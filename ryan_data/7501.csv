"I AM IN THE ZONE, people. The swoony-book-and-panty-melting zone, that is. Because, whoa, this one is a sweet scorcher, and I loved it. All of it. (TMI—so did my husband!)For years, Sadie has been turning down Joel and Oakley when they’ve each asked her for a date. The best friends are both interested—and interesting—but Sadie doesn’t do long term. And she’s not about to get between two friends…Or is she? One night of drunken wedding shenanigans changes the landscape of her relationship with both men, and now neither Joel nor Oak are expecting her to choose. They want her, together.It’s supposed to be a no-strings attached, temporary relationship, until feelings start to become too intense. Now they have to decide if they’re running for the end-zone or leaving the field all together.*Ahem* Read this book. READ IT. If only for a kinky, sexy good time, hit that one-click button and make it yours. But if you do, be warned—you’re not just getting an OMFG-I-need-a-cold-shower-and-some-batteries book when you read Red Zone, you’re also getting a sweet but intense story about love and acceptance.This (I wanna say couple out of habit…throuple, maybe?) grouping is amazing together. Their chemistry is, clearly, off the charts, but I loved the way they tried to make sense of what was happening between them, and then accept it. Especially Oakley and Joel. As they tried to sort out their feelings, their boundaries, their future, I was here, on the edge of my seat, waiting to talk some sense into them—all of them. Sadie, get it together. Joel, wise up. Oak, ahhhh, never mind Oak. Keep being my favorite (just don’t tell the others, okay?)This is the first book I’ve read by Mari Carr, and is unequivocally NOT my last. I loved the way she helped to shape this small town—gah, I NEED the other books in this series which features standalone installments by two other authors—and made even the potentially unlikeable characters redeemable. I loved the way she wrote dirty, kinky, erotic scenes but didn’t skimp on the overall story. I loved the way she made Sadie a strong but flawed woman, and Joel and Oak tough alpha men with soft, golden hearts. Basically, I loved it all. And so did my husband… *wink* ~ Beth, 5 stars~~~Whoa, I need to put my house on the market and move to Quinn, Texas, to find a couple of hot and sexy cowboys like Joel and Oakley.Joel and Oakley are best friends who work and live together on the ranch owned by Coach Carr, the town’s beloved high school football coach. Neither Joel nor Oakley have any desire to leave their small town for greener pastures. They're perfectly happy spending their downtime near their family and friends, vying for the attention of one gorgeous barkeep—Sadie.Sadie has been eschewing Joel and Oakley’s advances for years. She doesn't want to come between best friends by choosing one or the other. More than that, she doesn't want a relationship. But what if she doesn't have to choose? One wild champagne field night fuels the fire of their desires and starts a no-strings affair between the three of them. But what happens when the casual threatens to become serious—will they allow their feelings to become more or are they playing a losing game?Holy hotness factor! This book held me captive from start to finish. The friendship between Oakley and Joel—and their final acknowledgement that there's actually something more between them—was awesome to witness developing. Add in their desire for Sadie, and hers for them, and the sexy factor of this book turned from boiling hot to lava in a matter of pages.I love a good ménage story and this one was excellent! I'm now going back to read the other inter-related books in this series, as I can't get enough of these characters from Quinn, Texas…my soon to be hometown. ~ Missy, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ITHUF7V4NDNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010YH423Y#wasThisHelpful","R1ITHUF7V4NDNH","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! What a low-down, dirty, fun read this was! If you love books that include the Underworld, the Mafia, and men who love hard and with all of their being—both their women and their jobs—then For Fallon is for you!Fallon is a quiet bookworm who loves her job as a copywriter for Charity Events. When she meets Luca DaMiliano, her world is turned upside down. She falls hard and fast in love with Luca; he's kind, caring and attentive to her... until he's not. Then she discovers secrets and more, and her love for Luca begins to waver when the distrust and insecurities rise to the surface. Who is Luca? Does he really love her?Fallon is quiet and reserved but that doesn't make her meek and mild—she's strong and determined when she needs to be. Luca is dark, brooding and secretive. Just the kind of man I love to read about in books.There is something always hiding, and I'm hoping I don't figure it out early; there were a couple times, I yelled to myself, ""Ah hah, I got it..."", just to be surprised again! That is the best kind of book!I'm ecstatic to read Luca's story and see what happens next! ~ Heather, 4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31BA9JD3BO6CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4QD528#wasThisHelpful","R31BA9JD3BO6CH","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was totally captivated from the beginning... The story of Alexandria Charles Montague Collins is complex, full of depth, secrets and more… I am desperately trying to put the pieces together as I go!Alex has just graduated from Stamford and takes a quick vacation where she meets Nox. One week. No questions, no details, no last names. The week as Charli was EPIC! But what happens next, after a short visit to Savannah, will change her set of well-laid plans.I’m a huge Aleatha Romig fan, and in her amazing, fast-paced, can’t-wait-for-what’s-next style, this is perfect! So many times I wanted to read faster to see what happens, but yet slow down so it didn’t end! Nox is the epitome of HOT! If I had any options, I’d choose him! I’m sitting on pins and needles, on the edge of the cliff, waiting for what’s next… Hopefully, I don’t fall before the next book! ~ Heather, 5 stars~~~A series that starts with an emotional bang…This is the start of a five-book arc and I am already on watch for the next in the series!There’s a mystery that surrounds Alexandria Collins. Something happened in her past that has affected every goal and relationship she has made since childhood. She’s doing her best to keep those demons at bay but, as a result, that means she lives by a rigid set of rules. With her best friend’s encouragement she is going to transform herself for a week, leave her inhibitions aside and be…free. The best four years of her life are now ending and a new, unknown chapter is beginning. To celebrate, “Charli” was going to be everything Alex normally wasn’t…“This man dominated every situation. He was a man who knew what he wanted and took it.”…and Lennox ""Nox"" Demetri is going to be the person she does it with. Taking her over almost effortlessly, the week may not be enough…The tension is delicious as Charli and Nox spend their time together finding and pushing more than just sexual limits. It’s almost ironic the honesty that is possible when encouraged behind a web of protective secrecy. The two together just meld and melt together during this time of discovery and revelations. Tension turns to twists as Alex’s best laid plans are in jeopardy. And Alex is forced into making decisions that, ultimately, may be impossible to fulfill.I am so far in Alex’s corner, I want to move in! The unfairness of it all, after everything already endured, had me shaking my head and wanting to jump right in the pages and fight with her! The enemies seem to be obvious but I’m not entirely sure. I’m still waiting for another shoe to drop in this story that is only just beginning.By the end of this first chapter it feels like the story could only have this one, temporary conclusion, as it so perfectly sets up the next in this intricate tale of family secrets and hidden agendas. I can’t wait for what’s next for Alex and Nox, and whatever other twists and turns await! ~ Diane, 4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM75MGT47OA7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016J2HJMY#wasThisHelpful","RM75MGT47OA7B","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sweet baby Jesus! I knew that Spade’s story was going to be a good one, but I didn’t expect such an emotional journey for this playboy.Damien “Spade” Slater is the last remaining member of Ashes & Embers to be single. And he plans to stay that way for as long as he lives.Everyone wants more than that.“I don’t.”“No you’re afraid of more. You just don’t see the difference.”Claire Preston knows what she wants—to be a famous dancer. She is well on her way when she lands the lead in a NYC ballet. However, one night changes it all for both of them.This story was amazing! I have loved the Ashes & Embers crew and their girls from the very first book and this one was no exception. We got to see so much of the other members, especially Ky and Jax which made me so happy, even when I was crying!Watching the bad-boy rock star fall is one of my favorite scenarios, so watching Spade fall for Claire was so much fun.“I wanted her in a way that was different from how I’d wanted anyone else. I just didn’t know what that meant, or if it was just a result of the two of us being thrust together.”I loved that Spade didn’t change who he was and that Claire didn’t let him. We got to see that soft side that we all knew was hiding inside as well as keep his sarcastic, snarky, cocky side too.“Sometimes you don’t get a say in who you love. Sometimes God puts someone in your life, and no matter how hard you fight it, they become the reason you breathe.”This story had my emotions all over the place. It was sweet and sexy. Other times, especially the last 15-20%, I was bawling my eyes out. I laughed out loud and smiled until my face hurt. Stephanie has a way of writing that makes you feel like you are part of the story, joining in on all the fun. The pole dancing class with Grandma Helen—OMG! I loved everything about this story and look forward to more from Ms. McManus! ~ Tiffany, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6SQP205L8DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VFPLHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1D6SQP205L8DO","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Revered hero and fallen golden girl make an unlikely match…Ariana Rose is in a much different place than she was just a few years ago. Her father is on the most wanted list and, since he has disappeared, she is a convenient target for all the hatred he has inspired. Admittedly spoiled, she has changed along with the life she used to lead. A personal attack has her leaning on the few friends she has left which is how Lance Brown enters her life.Lance is recovering from injuries he received guarding the President and doesn’t quite realize how he ended up babysitting a spoiled princess. That’s not the only shock he’s going to get though.Is Ari as spoiled as you think she might be? At first I wondered but soon realized that she was spoiled but not in a catty, malicious way. She realizes how privileged her life had been and, now that it wasn’t, also understands and appreciates love and loyalty in a whole new way. When they first get together it’s easy to see the two almost circling each other as they try to figure the other one out. Was he safe to get close to? Was she? You could almost feel the wheels turning as they realize, and act, on their attraction even though everything else seems to be mired in doubt.“Let seduction begin tonight. Mr. Do-Right Agent wouldn’t know what him.”It’s kind of ironic that the storyline is all about secrets yet not ones that Ari is keeping. There is suspense, some intrigue and definitely sexy romance. The story is funny and heart-warming in turn which adds that much more to the smoldering scenes between Ari and Lance. Sex that makes you hot and smile at the same time is always a fun ride!Fast-paced, their relationship moves quickly with plenty of bumps along the way to keep things interesting. And maybe one or two little hissy fits thrown in for good measure. An abrupt ending left me feeling a bit cheated after the slow, gentle build-up of the story but definitely has me interested in catching up on the rest of the series. ~ Diane, 3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6USVRTTEFGS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TS81T5U#wasThisHelpful","R6USVRTTEFGS4","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's simple. I just cannot get enough of this world that Elle Christensen has created. The Fae and their affinity for light, their inability to lie without falling, and their close-knit community is an easy world to lose yourself in. I love how a destiny can be glimpsed, yet still be so murky and malleable that nothing can be certain. Chasing Hayleigh also really explores how there can be dishonesty and secrets even when there are no lies, and how much it can not only hurt those around you but yourself as well.Hayleigh is struggling to overcome a difficult past, and still insists on hiding from it instead of trusting her friends. Brannon is dealing with the aftermath of the Fallen in a continued plotline from the earlier books. His struggle, and the painful tasks he is forced to undertake, are dangerous and mentally exhausting. Reading about their struggle to trust each other made my heart ache for them.As I have come to expect from Elle's writing, their chemistry is NOT the problem. Together they are so sensually charged, and in the bedroom they are HOT. The sparks fairly leap of the page, and even in the story, it is obvious that nobody in their circle is surprised by their relationship. It is the emotional side that they struggle with, and as if that's not enough to deal with, they're both having to face down outside demons that threaten to bring them into darkness.The conclusion of their tale was everything I needed, and the glimpses into the lives of the couples of the previous installments was marvelous. What is going to kill me is waiting for the next installment after that preview of what's to come. I'll be on the edge of my seat, anxiously waiting to read more! ~ George, 5 stars~~~I have been impatiently waiting to get my greedy hands on Hayleigh and Brannon's story. I had a complete fan girl moment the second I realized Chasing Hayleigh was on my kindle and quickly got rid of all responsibilities. That baby was going to be read, and no one was going to stop me!After finishing the book I came to two conclusions. The first one being that all the hype I created was absolutely and utterly justified. The second, that I needed to find the caveman sign-up list and fill it completely with my name. Seriously, where can I find a caveman as sexy as Brannon? He has rocketed to the top of my fictional book boyfriend list. Hayleigh blossomed from her awesome bad-a-- self into a beautiful compassionate bad-a--. Together, they became a power team that was unstoppable.Chasing Hayleigh was full of love, humor, angst and so, so, so much caveman sexiness. Get your batteries ready ladies, this book will make you need them! ~ Kelly, 4 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OFDMS02TIS0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016LQ3X9Q#wasThisHelpful","R3OFDMS02TIS0M","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Listen. You need this book in your life. I tried to come up with a cute and clever way to say that, but it kept coming out as gibberish and emojis, and I realized there's no other way to say it. You NEED this book. But, just so we’re clear, you can't have Cooper because I licked him all over and he's mine forever. You know how sometimes a new book boyfriend comes along and puts all your other book boyfriends to shame? Right. I present to you...Cooper Moore.We first met Cooper and Maggie Williams in With a Twist. Cooper is West's best friend and Maggie is West's little sister. That, right there, is the juicy, delicious, utterly irresistible hook. But Maggie is broken—in the way that a woman would be broken after catching her fiancé balls deep in her childhood best friend on the day of their wedding. She's not in the right headspace for a relationship. She’s barely in the right headspace to function as a normal human being.She allowed Cooper in as a temporary distraction, a ‘hook-up’—holding him to several “rules"" to keep her battered heart safe from further damage. It's a pretty sweet set-up for Cooper—all the sexy times, none of the commitment. Until he realizes that it's not enough, that he hates “the rules” and that he’ll do whatever he can to show Maggie that there’s more to this thing they have together than simple booty calls and casual sex.Cooper and Maggie are just…perfect together. I loved their scorching physical chemistry and their playful, flirty banter. I loved how they handled each other tenderly and carefully—even when they went off the rails. Especially when they went off the rails. Cooper, with his deep dark secrets—and OH MY GAWD! For real, Cooper's deep, dark secrets might just make him one of my favorite book boyfriends of all time, you guys—playboy reputation and devil may care attitude is the last guy anyone expected to grow up and take responsibility for his life and take care of his woman. Watching him do so is…it’s dreamy. It’s swoony. It’s wonderful. I mean, is there anything sweeter than seeing a man like this brought to his knees by an everyday, chucks and jeans, all American girl? (Hint: No, there isn’t.)Maggie finds herself on quite a journey here, healing and growing and learning to trust herself again. She’s sometimes frustrating, but knowing that her head and her heart are basically starting from scratch after her devastating wedding day—she’s never annoying or immature. She’s just…lost. And it takes a village to help her find her way again. Cooper, West, Lily, Rose, family and friends from home all play a pivotal role in her story arc and it’s heartwarming and emotional, and lovely to read.Everything just works here. Maggie and Cooper are brilliant together despite all the things keeping them apart (her shattered heart and overprotective/overbearing older brother to name a couple). The genuine affection and camaraderie of this group of friends (some of the sweetest scenes involved the interactions amongst friends—so authentic and touching). I can't say enough good things about this series, and this book in particular has just completely won over my heart.If you’re looking for something swoony, sexy, and sweet (with just a smidge of fairy tale thrown in for good measure) then youneed this book! ~ Shelly, 5 stars~~~Ummm, you all have NO IDEA how bad I wanted this book. Like, super bad. SUPER BAD, Y’ALL. And then, it was there on my Kindle and I was over here like *flails* OMG! FINALLY! YAY! OMG! COOPER! MUST. READ. NOW! And so on…It only took one glimpse of Maggie Williams, cracked and burned, broken and so beautiful, for Cooper Moore to know he wanted her—and wanted to protect her. Even if that’s so not his style.For Maggie, fleeing Jackson for New York City, and the love and protection of her brother and his friends, seemed like the only choice after the ultimate betrayal—her fiancé, her best friend, her wedding day…Mags isn’t looking to enter another relationship, and besides, Coop is living The Life, and the word ‘girlfriend’ simply isn’t in his vocabulary. A casual hook-up seems like the answer to the burning attraction between them, except there’s one problem…Her heart.His desire.Her brother.Err…make that three problems.*Sigh* So, I’d be sitting here, reading Chaser thinking...this, right here, when this group of friends is all together, bantering and being effortlessly cool, is the best part of this book. What gives it its heart and soul, and a playful vibe that can so easily turn into something that makes your heart pound. That can stun you like a swift punch to the face...*ahem* Nope, not saying anything else about that.But then Maggie and Cooper would be together, alone, all swoony-perfect and panty-melting sexy, and I’d start to second guess myself. Because Cooper Moore—be still my beating heart. I honestly didn’t think Staci Hart would be able to top *MY* West after the excellent, still-gives-me-the-flails With A Twist, but Coop … Sweet baby Jesus in a basket, Coop comes SO damn close. I love this guy, with his hidden layers (Batman, anyone?) and his insatiable need for one Maggie Williams. I kinda ached inside for him—a man that seemingly has it all, but is really just a little bit lost in the big, bad world that makes up The Life. And seeing him with Maggie, as he’s trying to figure s--- out, had the potential to completely overshadow the moments with all the Habits crew…even if only briefly. Only, they didn’t. They worked together to make this book a fun, charming, well-rounded, complete read.I loved reading Chaser, although admittedly not with the same intense passion with which I loved With A Twist. Oh, don’t get me wrong, I adored this best friend’s little sister romance—one of my FAVORITE types of romance in the history of ever—but it was more of a slow burn for me, even if it wasn’t for these characters. Chaser’s charm just took a little longer grab hold of me, and the laughs were a different kind of funny. This couple was different, but damn, isn’t that what we all want when reading? The best parts of a book you love—banter, familiar, loved characters, humor, oh-my-god sexiness and an ending that makes your heart flutter—but with a new twist to make it something unique. And that’s about the gist of my experience with Chaser.I absolutely opened this book with sky high expectations, and more than my fair share of crazy-eyed excitement, and I wasn’t let down. All my flailing and fan-girl jonesing was worth it—and will now be directed at Tricky’s book, which honestly, can’t land on my Kindle soon enough… ~ Beth, 4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JLIILXD56CKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016C4ZWQE#wasThisHelpful","R1JLIILXD56CKP","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An emotional, heartbreaking love story of two individuals who were wronged in the worst kind of way, only to find out years later how they were robbed of their happiness!Nikole and Adam came from two different worlds, Adam having everything he's ever wanted and Nikole always working to have what she needed. When Adam runs into Nikole she sparks an interest in him that he's never felt before with anyone else, so he goes after her.Nikole knows Adam’s type—charming girls out of their panties and then dropping them like yesterday's news so, needless to say, she refuses to be another notch on his bedpost. That is, until he shows her he truly wants to get to know her. I loved seeing the sweeter side of Adam, but I will say when the sexy part came out, Hot Damn! Panties beware!!They try to find a way to be together when it seems the world is against them, and at times, I so wanted to choke the mess out of someone. I could not contain my sadness and tears when all hell broke loose, and I wished I could have smacked Adam into seeing the ‘real truth’!I won't give more than that, just know that the second part of the book flowed beautifully, that it had me rooting for them. The emotions, passion and love Adam and Nikole had for each other never fizzled—if anything their time apart showed them what they truly meant to each other, and how the love they shared has always been at the forefront.A beautiful book of true love and second chances. ~ Kara, 5 Amazing stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7E0J8D1EDJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GEGKQI#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7E0J8D1EDJS","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's not only the crime that's the problem, it's the cover-up. Ask any failed politician or former CEO.""Spotlight"" is the name of the investigative team at the Boston Globe newspaper. It is staffed with experienced, tenacious reporters who use every tool available to get to the bottom of a story. This story about child molestation by priests and a coordinated cover-up by the Catholic Church earned a Pulitzer Prize for the paper in 2003.Now screenwriter Josh Singer in collaboration with writer/director Tom McCarthy has offers us a riveting look at how it evolved (from one rumor), what issues were discovered (institutional cover-up) and the difficulties they encountered (embarrassed and frightened witnesses, plus 9/11).The brilliant cast includes:  * Mark Ruffalo (""Begin Again"") Mike Rezendes is a (lapsed Catholic) workaholic. He wants the scoop and he wants justice for the children.  * Michael Keaton (""Birdman"") ""Robby"" Robinson wants to expose the institutional cover-up, not just 13 priests.  * John Slattery (""Mad Men"") Ben Bradlee Jr. is thunderstruck when the number of local priests uncovered reaches 87! He reminds them that 53% of the Globe's subscribers are Catholic.  * Liev Schreiber (""Pawn Sacrifice"") This single Jewish man has just moved to Boston to take a new position at the Globe. Marty Baron realizes the scope of the story and tries to talk with the local Cardinal. He is given a Catechism book as a gift instead.  * Rachel McAdams (""Southpaw"") Sasha Pfeiffer can dig out more information from old ledgers than anyone else. Her discoveries help make their case. (She sometimes takes her grandmother to Mass.)  * Stanley Tucci (""The Hunger Games"") is Mitchell Garabedian a Lebanese attorney awash in Irish Catholic Boston. He is known as ""a character"" but has been on the right track far too long. He doesn't trust the newspaper.  * Billy Crudup (""Stage Beauty"") Attorney Eric Macleish has a good scam going. Wait until you hear how it works!  * Neal Huff (""Moonrise Kingdom"") Phil Saviano created a support group for victims of priests. He's one of the lucky ones: he didn't kill himself!Anyone who follows the news knows how this will end; but it doesn't detract a bit from the story. At one point Bradlee says, ""If there were 90 of these rats, people would know!"" and Robinson replies, ""Maybe they do.""Expect mild profanity, no sex, no gunshots, no vehicular mayhem and no blowie uppie stuff, just an engrossing story about a dedicated group of people taking on a powerful world-encompassing institution because it's the right thing to do.R-rated because of subject matter (child abuse) but an award winner as far as I'm concerned.

We can see that the hearings are held in such a way that testimony from the accused is never heard. Trumbo is resourceful though and figures out how to survive.* Diane Lane (""Man of Steel"") is his steadfast wife Cleo. She watches their lives disintegrate but stays the course.* Louis C.K. (""Louie"") is Arlen Hird, another blacklisted screenwriter, chain smoking despite his lung cancer.* Alan Tudyk (""Firefly"") Ian McLellan Hunter won an Oscar for the ""Roman Holiday"" screenplay, even though he didn't write it.* Michael Stuhlbarg (""Steve Jobs"") is Edward G. Robinson, who can't work anonymously because his face is his profession. His response is shocking.* James DuMont (""Jurassic World"") is J. Parnell Thomas, who conducts the initial hearings and then later crosses paths with Trumbo again, much to his surprise.* David James Elliott (""Mad Men"") is John Wayne, whose persona as a lover of America doesn't seem to jibe with his service during WWII. Elliott doesn't LOOK like, Wayne, but he sure SOUNDS like him.* Helen Mirren (""Woman in Gold"") is Hedda Hopper, the powerful gossip columnist who is determined to destroy the careers of the accused men. She is smart enough to smell a rat when ""The Brave One"" by an unknown screenwriter wins an Oscar.* Dean O'Gorman (""The Hobbit"") Kirk Douglas is furious at Hopper. As a result he did something which I still respect today.* Adewale Akinnuooye-Agbaje (""Pompeii"") is excellent as Virgil Brooks, the felon who becomes Trumbo's boss in prison.* Kudos to Casting Agent David Rubin for his excellent work. He brings us actors portraying Frank King, Otto Preminger, Louis B. Mayer, and dozens of others. This is a star-studded cast.The generous use of old newsreels and film clips with our cast integrated into some of them (notice the gladiatorial scene from ""Spartacus!"") makes everything seem authentic, as does the incessant smoking (even in movie theaters!) and the steady intake of controlled substances.Once again, Cranston turns in an award-worthy performance, as does Louis C.K. I had never pictured him as a dramatic actor but I have changed my mind. This excellent film works as a nicely biased history lesson about Hollywood and politics, AND it entertains as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0S251359TD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167IE0KY#wasThisHelpful","R3N0S251359TD5","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It saddens me that I must give this brilliant film a heartfelt two thumbs up. Why, you might ask? Because the premise is such a downer very few people will want to see it: If a child is confined with his mother to a small room for the first five years of his life, what can he expect when the door is opened? Well, I have a personal foible: I want someone to root for and this one actually gives me at least five. This inspiring movie really delivers and there is already early Oscar buzz about it (10-30-15).This R-rated drama from director Lenny Abrahamson (""Frank"") in collaboration with first-time screenwriter/novelist Emma Donoghue, is inspiring because it celebrates the resiliency of the human spirit and the power of a mother's love.The cast:  * Jacob Tremblay (""The Smurfs 2"") is little Jack, whose eyes have never focused on anything beyond the four walls of their small ""Room."" He's reasonably happy, but can't imagine ""in"" or ""out"" and when he sees a leaf blown onto the skylight, he's fascinated.  * Brie Larson (""Short Term 12"") is brilliant as Ma. She tries to keep Jack physically fit and is teaching him to read, but knows she must get him out of isolation before the damage is irreversible.  * Sean Bridgers (Lots of TV) is Old Nick, the fellow who kidnapped a teenage girl and has kept her locked in his shed for seven years.  * Joan Allen (""Bourne"") is Nancy, Jack's grandmother, whose life changed irrevocably when her daughter disappeared seven years ago.  * Amanda Brugel (""Orphan Black"") is Officer Parker, whose gentle insight helps a little lost boy put his world back together.  * Wendy Crewson (""The Vow"") is a talk-show host you will love to hate!Both of our escapees suffer from sensory overload, so with the press hounding them and a criminal case pending, it is no surprise that they both need counseling and time to adjust. In addition, the boy has never seen a stair, has an underdeveloped immune system and can't tolerate full sunlight.The boy's grandparents are no less challenged. They can't imagine what the two prisoners have endured but try to treat them with sensitivity. Their attempts made me smile...","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1351GDOTTVCKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016PIL6AS#wasThisHelpful","R1351GDOTTVCKB","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title is a parting statement two friends have used for years. Here is a G-rated dramedy (yeah, you read that right) that highlights the importance of friendship. We have two lifelong buddies whose lives are in flux. One wants a baby and the other becomes ill. Yup, it's a chick flick.Director Catherine Hardwick (""Red Riding Hood"" 2011) working from an original screenplay by Morwenna Banks (British television) gives us an upbeat tearjerker. Yup, you read THAT right, too! Actually, the women's touch is evident throughout: The sets look authentic, the clothes seem ""real,"" and relationships with parents, spouses and children all ring true. (And the casting of these two as little girls is perfect.) The husbands are rock solid, so no bad guys there!We see:  * Drew Barrymore (""Blended"") is Jess, the practical one. She is always swept into her chum's absurd schemes. She is almost frumpy next to her fashionista friend and she really wants a baby.  * Toni Collette (""Hector and the Search for Happiness"") Milly is the wild child: She has an actress mother, a penchant for chichi shoes, LOVES ""Wuthering Heights"" and wants to see the moors.  * Dominic Cooper (""Agent Carter"") Kit was a roadie with a rock show but settled down the moment he met Milly. He has to make the most challenging adjustment after her surgery.  * Paddy Considine (""The World's End"") Darling Jago toughs it out through all of those attempts to get Milly pregnant. Eventually he takes a job on an oil rig to earn enough for in-vitro fertilization. He hopes they're gonna need a bigger boat! (They live on a boat.)  * Jacqueline Bisset (""Rizzoli & Isles"") Miranda has enjoyed great success as an actress, and now all those years playing a doctor on that soap really pay off.  * Tyson Ritter (""Parenthood"") Ace is an appealing bartender at a local pub, but he's moving to Yorkshire...This is G-rated so expect no profanity or violence (well, a pretty funny childbirth), gunfire or mayhem. HOWEVER, be ready for (up-close and personal) scenes with injections, chemo sessions, vomiting and hair loss, plus a lengthy bit after a double-mastectomy. Terminal illness isn't pretty and this clearly doesn't pander to the faint of heart.Affinity groups often attend advance screenings; the one which came tonight is affiliated with breast cancer research, so the issues and scenes were not a surprise. They loved it, though I found this attention to detail to be disconcerting. I guess I'm faint of heart.

"James Bond gets a mysterious message so he begins delving into the past; which is what we do as well. Hmmm, a James Bond movie: Luxury car chases? Check. Interesting locales? Check. Lovely women? Check. Torture? Check. Gunfights? Check. Blowie uppie stuff? Check. Yup, we're in familiar territory. Meanwhile back at headquarters, M is struggling to keep his agency alive, so committee meetings and politics are his focus.This profitable franchise boasts Sam Mendez (""Skyfall"") back at the helm with a lackluster story and script written by a committee, which takes us down a time-tested trail. The movie runs for 147 l-o-n-g minutes; we could have edited the elaborate title sequence for starters! Our press screening began with a poorly lip-synced promo of pop singer Sam Smith singing ""Writing's on the Wall,"" which refers to a wall where dead agents' names are engraved. James Bond's name has been handwritten in red.Here is part of the enormous cast:  * Daniel Craig (three recent Bond films, plus ""The Girl in the Dragon Tattoo"" - 2011) may be doing his last stint as James Bond, although I see an announcement called ""Bond 25"" which may make a liar out of me. Craig is athletic and inscrutable, so we know we're in capable hands.  * Christoph Waltz (""Big Eyes"") is Oberhauser, this chapter's villain, who reveals a surprising link to our hero's past. Remember, this actor has already won two Oscars and he clearly is having a great time with another villainous role.  * Léa Seydoux (""Inglorious Basterds"") is our new Bond Girl. Her name is Madeleine Swann and she hates guns.  * Ralph Fiennes (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") is M, faced with endless bureaucratic rigmarole, so we are happy when he straps on a gun and sets out to help his rogue agent.  * Ben Whishaw (""The Danish Girl"") is Q; he's full of ideas and gadgets, plus his hesitant loyalty to Bond is sweet. I love this guy and was delighted that this time he gets out of his workshop!  * Naomie Harris (""Southpaw"") is our new Moneypenny, more outgoing than her predecessor and far more engaged in the agency's field work. She and Q make a good team.These PG-13 films have very little profanity, a bit of implied sex, and formulaic plots.

"""If voting changed anything, they would make it illegal."" So says a top-ranking political consultant who is sent to a war-torn country in South America to fine tune a faltering election. Director David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"") is working from an R-rated script (smoking and language) by Peter Straughan (""The Debt"") which in turn is based on Rachel Boynton's documentary by the same name.Problem is, our heroine's long-term nemesis shows up with a conflicting goal. Trouble ensues.... As a political junkie, I got a huge kick out of all their dirty tricks. They are unexpected and original. Everything from making a catapult from the elastic on a fitted bed sheet, to a misleading quote supposedly from Goethe (you have to see it).We watch:  * Sandra Bullock (""The Heat"") is Jane; coaxed out of a self-imposed ""retirement."" After an insulting incident launches her into action, she develops a clever strategy and a clear objective, but she also has a bit of common sense that penetrates her clinical depression.  * Ann Dowd (""Masters of Sex"") Nell is the recruiter who convinces Jane to once again, enter the fray. Nell has connections....  * Billy Bob Thornton (""The Judge"") Pat Candy has a history with Jane and doesn't hesitate to use it. This actor plays loathsome perfectly.  * Anthony Mackie (""Avengers"") Ben is Jane's right-hand man, but sometimes the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing... Jane's strategies are out of left field and break all the rules.  * Zoe Kazan (""Olive Kitteridge"") LeBlanc is the ultimate researcher. She's also multi lingual...what a treasure!  * Reynaldo Pacheco (""Right Mind"") Eddie is an early volunteer because his deceased father had been a supporter of Castillo in earlier campaigns.  * Joaquim de Almeida (""A Date With Miss Fortune"") Castillo is the client, trying to make a comeback but waaaay behind in the polls. He totally lacks charisma but is a politician through and through.It was interesting to see the favelas (slum-like homes, not just in Brazil) clinging to the hillside and to watch the merchants setting up shop. I loved the road race between the two campaign buses and appreciated Jane's way of ""changing the narrative instead of the candidate.""We learned a lot, some of which we would rather not know...One little quibble: I can appreciate that Bullock is fifty years old, but it strained credibility to see her in full makeup from morning to night. Even when rising early in the morning, it's intact.

"I always think long and hard before I send a dish back to the kitchen in a restaurant, because I know it's the poor server who must bear the brunt of the chef's reaction...and it might be nuclear. In this story, we can see what a daunting challenge it is to become a top chef, but if you've already achieved it and then watched your career implode due to drugs, alcohol and ego, you can see why our hero has a self-imposed penance. He has promised himself he will shuck 1,000,000 (a million!) oysters before he will allow himself to try again.We join him as he logs that final oyster after three long years. He walks away from his employment and gets ready to try again. This R-rated dramedy is directed by John Wells (""August: Osage County"") working with a screenplay by Steven Knight (""Seventh Son"") from Michael Kalesniko's story. It takes us to chaotic closeups of kitchens in several high-end London restaurants.The cast:  * Bradley Cooper (""Silver Linings Playbook"") Adam Jones is in recovery for drugs and alcohol, with a long list of bad debts and abused friendships that he must own and try to rectify. His ego is another matter. Chefs are the superstars of the restaurant world...and they are all seeking a one-, two- or three-star Michelin rating.  * Sienna Miller (""American Sniper"") is Helene, who has to take a position with Adam after he got her fired from her current job. Her young daughter is quite the taste tester... By the way, Adam forces Helene to apologize to the turbot for making it die in vain.  * Daniel Brühl (""Rush"") is Tony, who reluctantly hires Adam again, fully aware of his potential for trouble. Their story unfolds slowly over the course of the film.  * Omar Sy (""The Intouchables"") Michel should still be angry at the dirty trick Adam pulled on him in Paris ""back in the day,"" but all is forgiven and he joins him in London with his new endeavor.  * Emma Thompson (""A Walk in the Woods"") Dr. Rosshide will never quit trying to persuade Adam that group therapy might help. She monitors his sobriety and tries to talk some sense into him.  * Alicia Vikander (""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."") Anne Marie is a daughter of the deceased Parisian chef who gave Adam his first toque. She and Adam have a history and she too, is in recovery. Her father willed his knives to Adam.  * Uma Thurman (""The Slap"") Simone Forth is an arrogant reviewer who specializes in restaurants.This film is absolute Nirvana for foodies. In extreme closeups, we see preparation of numerous gourmet dishes, plus fast food which Adam studies for new ideas. The photography is yummy and Cooper is very, very good. As you might expect with this top-notch cast, all of the acting is wonderful and the (sorta) predictable story is satisfying.Expect yummy photography, lots of kitchen action, scores of F-bombs, an unexpected (but well-deserved) kiss, a few plot twists, and many people to root for.

"Sigh.... This is the way a romance should end...with a door quietly closing. It was waaaay more sensuous than sweaty bodies, full frontal nudity or other more overt signs of lust. In fact, I'm not sure we even saw a kiss....Actually, this Argentine film ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (English captions) is a police procedural, well done and beautifully cast. We start with a scene we soon understand is from a book, after which we watch the author wad it up and throw it into a wastebasket. He is a grizzled fellow, probably in his fifties, a retired police detective convincingly played by Ricardo Darín (""The Dancer and the Thief""), still trim and fit, but unable to forget a murder which took place 20 years earlier.In a flashback (by the way, the makeup is incredible), we see him called to the crime scene and start the process of finding the killer. Like him and the devastated widower, we become very much invested in finding justice for the victim.The photography is excellent, with seemingly long single takes and note- worthy continuity. The characters seem authentic, as does the infighting at the police department and the relationships in the workplace, namely the loyal, hard-drinking co-worker, played by Guillermo Francella (""Incorregibles"") and the new Assistant DA, played by Soledad Villamil (""It's Not You, it's Me"").I can't tell you too much because I want to avoid spoilers, but I highly recommend this film.

"A few months ago I helped a couple from Hong Kong find the Chihuly Glass Museum at Seattle Center. They had come to Seattle because the wife was bitten by the Seattle Bug. She was one of millions of Chinese who made the award-winning ""Bei Jing yu shang Xi Ya Tu"" (English captions) one of the highest-grossing romances in Chinese history. Naturally I was curious, so I got my own copy as soon as I could spot it in the catalogs. The one I have is in Region 3 format, but the Blu-Ray comes in Region 1.I soon became intrigued by Jiajia, a city girl from Beijing, come to Seattle to bear an American-born son for her wealthy, MARRIED, boyfriend back in China. She picked Seattle because ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is her favorite film of all time; she has an unlimited credit card and an imperious attitude. She has made plans to stay in a private home with two other Asian women awaiting the birth of their babies. With establishing shots of Seattle (the rest filmed in Vancouver, BC), I enjoyed seeing our waterfront and of course, our iconic Space Needle.First we meet Frank, the fellow who had been assigned the task of bringing her in from the airport (he's a bit late); he is polite, hard working and self-effacing. Next we meet her Seattle landlady, the two other women, Frank's tween-age daughter, his wife and the doctor Jiajia has selected simply because she speaks Chinese. Jiajia is rude, demanding and selfish.As her fortunes wax and wane, so do her relationships, in this sweet romantic comedy. I became invested in the outcome and was glad I own this DVD. The first part is difficult to watch simply because she is such a pill, but when she hits a speed bump, the story gains traction.There is no rating, but in my opinion this would be a solid PG-13.

Now it's called a ""re-imagining,"" so we leave everything we knew and approach this with an open mind although we recognize some familiar landmarks. We learn what event caused our team to be invested with their unusual skills.Life on Earth as we know it, is at risk and who better to save us? We see a high-echelon group of powers-that-be sit down to assess cost versus benefit, when a professor offers a group of his high-achieving students as our next best hope to develop inter-dimensional travel and find new energy sources as a result (don't ask!).The cast:  * Reg E. Cathey (""House of Cards"") is Dr. Franklin Storm, who is convinced his brilliant students can solve this sticky problem.  * Toby Kebbell (""Down of the Planet of the Apes"") Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom is his disenchanted former student whom we first meet in self-imposed exile. He had been thisclose to solving the problem. He does NOT want to wear a lab coat!  * Michael B. Jordan (""Fruitvale Station"") Johnny Storm/The Human Torch is his son who is lured onto the team with an offer of a new car (he wrecked his father's). He is defiant but has his own skill set.  * Kate Mara (""House of Cards"") Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman is a charter member of this invincible quartet. She is Dr. Storm's adopted daughter from Ukraine.  * Miles Teller (""Divergent"") Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic brings a prodigy's unusual abilities to the table. He wants their team to beat NASA to the punch and travel in their invention before Government take over.  * Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliot"" 2000 and ""Defiance"" 2008) Our friend Ben Grimm/The Thing has kept his old job at the wrecking yard, but answers our hero's call for adventure.  * Tim Blake Nelson (""Child of God"") as soon as we see Dr. Allen's smarmy smile, we peg him for a double-crossing villain, although HE certainly doesn't see things that way. He just sees a group of scared kids who can be very valuable to the government.Any shortcomings in this production I lay at the feet of writer/director Josh Trank. This is his first big-budget attempt and he will no doubt improve. I have seen these cast members in more demanding roles and they are highly capable. This is PG-13, so expect lots of blowie uppie stuff, unusual fisticuffs and Computer Generated Imaging, some mild profanity and no sweaty bodies.

"Have you read any of the humorous travel books by Bill Bryson (""Notes From a Small Island"" and ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself"")? In this one, when he ""hikes the Appalachian Trail,"" he really DOES hike the Appa- lachian Trail (apologies to former South Carolina Governor Sanford). Yup. It's a ""Road Trip"" comedy where we watch an ill-matched duo try to cope with the hazards and inconveniences of being on the road together.Director Ken Kwapis (""The Office"" and ""He's Just Not That Into You""), working with a screenplay based on Bryson's book, centers his movie on the ex-pat writer who has moved back home with his English family. This setup delivers a witty, satisfying, R-rated (language) dramedy for people of a certain age. For me, it generates a whole new respect for authentic actors who resist the siren song of plastic surgery; it's nice to see real people on screen.We appreciate:  * Robert Redford (""All is Lost"") Bill Bryson has returned to the U.S. after almost two decades in Europe. Watch his tongue-tied reaction to that rude talk-show host! Confronted by signs of aging (ailing friends, funerals, doctor visits), he longs for a new adventure, so he decides to hike the celebrated Appalachian Trail, which passes near his home town. He can't find any friends who share his enthusiasm.  * Emma Thompson (""Saving Mr. Banks"") Catherine is adamantly opposed to her husband's idea. Her reasons include his age, some well-publicized bear attacks, potential injuries...the list goes on and on. Ultimately he goes, so she says, ""Try not to die!""  * Nick Nolte (""Warrior"") Hard-drinking alcoholic Stephan Katz calls because he heard of Bill's plan through a mutual friend (Katz had NOT been invited). They had been close friends years ago, but had a serious falling out.  * Kristen Schaal (Lots of TV and voice work) Non-stop gasbag Mary Ellen is an unwelcome intruder. She provides our hapless duo with their first common goal: Ditch her!  * Mary Steenburgen (""Last Vegas"") Jeannie is the proprietor of a family-owned motel. Her lovely mother is a piece of work! I hope Bryson mailed Jeannie a check.  * Susan McPhail (""Mississippi Grind"") Beulah teaches Katz to keep his hands off a stranger's panties! Actually, her husband does...The dialogue seems authentic: two guys reminiscing about adolescence, pranks, girls, college and other shared youthful experiences. By the time they became adults,  Bryson had a career, a wife, a family and is happily domesticated. Katz is still an unrepentant hedonist, a drunk who has seen more breasts than Bryson ever dreamed of! Bill says, ""Books are television for smart people."" Katz is convinced the trail is ""uphill all the way to Maine.""Once we see samples of the gorgeous terrain, we understand why so many people want to hike this trail, yet only 10% actually complete it. Expect a few F-bombs and some adult humor (Katz is amused that Bill buries his own waste just off the trail, ""In the WOODS?!?"").Here in Seattle, residents of a nearby retirement community were treated to this advance screening. It was perfect for them and they had a great time!

"We have an older lesbian whose partner of 38 years died over a year ago, leaving medical bills and an empty house. Our gal found a new partner to quiet the echoing house, but the movie starts with her throwing the new partner out. Her teenage granddaughter shows up in desperate need of $600 for an abortion but our heroine has just paid off those medical bills and is strapped for cash. This movie is about their quest for money in a vintage Dodge sedan.Writer/director Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"" and ""In Good Company"") has crafted the ideal vehicle to remind us what a perfectly splendid actor we have in Lily Tomlin (Oscar nomination for ""Nashville"").His cast:  * Lily Tomlin (""9 to 5"" and ""A Prairie Home Companion"") Elle has a checkered past. She is a poet and an educator, but the more we learn about her, the more surprises we find.  * Julia Garner (""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") is perfectly cast as Sage, that wayward granddaughter. Her boyfriend failed to bring her the money and now accuses her of lying about his involvement. Problem is, she has an appointment for the procedure and the clock is ticking.  * Marcia Gay Harden (""Elsa & Fred"") Judy is mother of Sage and daughter of Elle. This is not an easy spot to be in!  * Judy Greer (""The Descendants"") Olivia is unceremoniously tossed out of Elle's house and must go on with her life. Elle will NOT accept money from her!  * Elizabeth Peña (""Lone Star"") Carla has the small store where Elle hopes to sell her first edition feminist books.  * Sam Elliott (""I'll See You in My Dreams"") Karl is a last resort. Elle is pretty sure he will help but we are not prepared for some of their surprises. The scenes with Elliott and Tomlin are particularly good!This has some predictable discussions about abortions, of course with Tomlin involved, they will be pro-choice (but watch that little girl outside the clinic). This satisfying movie is just over an hour long but isn't rushed; it earns its R rating because of dialogue and profanity.I smiled over Sage's confusion between ""The Feminine Mystique,"" Betty Friedan's book and Mystique, the character in the X-Men movies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7TO0CZ5HVME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNQPQGU#wasThisHelpful","R2F7TO0CZ5HVME","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I left this screening in a white heat of rage against ALL Americans whose insatiable appetite for drugs provides the funding for this horrific blood bath! How can we not see that the problem is NOT the cartels, it's the buyers who FUND the cartels! If there is no market, there is no cartel. To me it looks like a simple case of cause and effect.Director Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners""), working with a screenplay by actor Taylor Sheridan (""Sons of Anarchy"") ramps up the horror of what an idealistic FBI agent encounters when she volunteers to work with a CIA team along the Mexican border.

When she sees this chance to make a difference against the drug cartels, she volunteers.  * Daniel Kaluuya (""Babylon"") is her FBI sidekick Reggie. He is not quite so idealistic but he still ""mothers"" Kate.  * Victor Garber (Lots of TV) FBI chief Jennings asks Kate if she can see any changes in her world after their latest successful foray.  * Josh Brolin (""Labor Day"") CIA agent Matt is always upbeat, smiling and focused. He has a realistic view of his mission and knows exactly why Kate has been added to his team.  * Benicio Del Toro (""Inherent Vice"") Alejandro will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. He has a spooky way of appearing and disappearing with unsettling regularity. His sicario makes a formidable enemy!This R-rated crime drama has more grisly scenes than you may expect. It's one thing to READ about decapitations, torture, and betrayals, but it is another thing entirely to see them in living color! This film will stay with you for a long time.

"Once again our favorite Everyman Tom Hanks is working with his long- time friend and collaborator Steven Spielberg (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers""). These guys seem convinced that Americans need to know more WWII history. Lucky for us the Coen brothers are on the writing team, they bring some very dry humor to the Cold War as we watch two superpowers (plus East Germany) negotiate an exchange of spies.This time Hanks is an insurance lawyer ordered to defend a Russian spy. His reluctance to side with the enemy is justified when his family is targeted by outraged citizens who now see him as anti-American. We also watch as some Air Force pilots are assigned to the CIA; they will fly camera-equipped U2 spy planes 70,000 feet above the USSR. They are called ""drivers"" and are instructed to commit suicide if they are caught. They are stunned!We see:  * Tom Hanks (""The Terminal"") is perfect as James Donovan, a highly rated attorney who hasn't practiced criminal law in decades. He's smart, funny, and very, very resourceful. He quickly realizes his ""client"" will be denied Constitutional protection by the American courts. As a lawyer responsible for an accused prisoner, all he can do now is try to prevent the death penalty.  * Amy Ryan (""Birdman:..."") is Mary, his wife. When he goes to East Berlin to negotiate a trade - his Russian spy for the American pilot of a downed spy plane - she thinks he's going to Scotland to fish.  * Alan Alda (""The Longest Ride"") is Thomas Watters, Donovan's boss. It's at his insistence that Donovan must take up this case.  * Austin Stowell (""Behind the Candelabra"") is Francis Gary Powers, a U2 pilot (not the band!) who was shot down from Russian skies.  * Mark Rylance (""Wolf Hall"") is amazing as Rudolf Abel, the notorious agent who meticulously eludes discovery for so long. When asked if he is frightened, he replies, ""Would it help?""  * Sebastian Koch (""The Lives of Others"") Wolfgang Vogel is the East German official who resents being overlooked by the two superpowers who ignore him...in his own city!  * Will Rogers (""The Bay"") is Frederic Pryor, a student caught behind the Berlin wall as he tries to rescue his girlfriend. Donovan wants him to be part of the deal, too.The Cold War, Donovan, Abel, Powers... Many of these names will draw a blank from the younger generation because History as a school subject is no longer considered politically correct. Do they know about the Berlin Wall? We see it being built in this wonderful film; AND for period touches, we see an astonishing array of vintage cars, plus discarded flash bulbs on the floor. In addition, Donovan makes a terrific speech to the Supreme Court about what makes America unique.I can't help but recall George Santanaya's immortal quote: ""Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" More's the pity... Every young American should see this PG-13 movie. (By the way, be sure to stay for the terrific postscripts!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OE150D3481BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HM32X2#wasThisHelpful","R3OE150D3481BL","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Malala"" is the name of a legendary Afghani girl who had the courage to speak out and was eventually killed. This timely documentary directed by David Guggenheim (the award-winning ""Waiting for Superman"") gives us a first-hand account of her namesake, a courageous Pakistani girl who has the temerity defend her right to attend school, much to the outrage of the religious zealots who tried to kill her. Even more interesting to me, was the gradual shift of the Taliban from a charismatic new political influence to a tyrannical, blood-thirsty theocracy.Even before she was been awarded the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, Malala had become a highly visible advocate for education throughout the world, believing that this is the most direct way to cleanse countries of radical zealotry. ""One child. One teacher. One book."" To balance her celebrity we appreciate the humorous ways her family keeps her grounded, part of which includes doing her homework and getting along with her three younger brothers.We see:  * Malala Yousafzai, starting with the news clips which describe the Taliban's attempt to assassinate her and her brush with death at age 13. We see her in the company of queens, presidents, movie stars and school children. She is comfortable with them all.  * Ziauddin Yousafzai, her father, who overcame a childhood stammer to become a powerful speaker. He too, is a firebrand who refuses to tolerate the actions of the Taliban and the claim that they are based on the Quran.  * Toor Pekai Yousafzai and Atal Yousafzai are two of her articulate (and entertaining) younger brothers.  * Khushal Yousafzai is a child bride who grows up to become Malala's mother. She is homesick for the Swat Valley in Afghanistan but is working hard at assimilation in England.As we come to grips with the realities of life in Pakistan through news clips and interviews, we also learn about Malala's family history through animated figures and family photos. By the way, her father discovered that his family tree goes back over 300 years and Malala is the first female name that has ever been entered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R42TWVIW2PSXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0115SJ3PS#wasThisHelpful","R42TWVIW2PSXC","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yup, it's about Peter himself. Actually, this is a genesis story: where Peter came from and how he became the legendary Peter Pan. Screenwriter Jason Fuchs (""Ice Age: Continental Drift"") working from J.M. Barrie's classic, gives director Joe Wright (""Anna Karenina"") a contrived story that is just close enough to the original that we recognize the characters, but far enough to confuse children who expect the Disneyfied version.A preliminary scene shows us a bereft mother dropping off her baby at an orphanage. Then our story begins in London during the Blitz where these Dickensian digs shelter 12-year-old boys. Of course the head nun is an ugly tyrant who exploits and mistreats them, so we enjoy it when she gets her comeuppance. Thus begins our Hero's Journey.Here are some of the actors:  * Levi Miller (in his first big-screen lead) is wonderful as Peter, a boy who is convinced his mother will come back for him. He is curious, skeptical, bright and a natural leader, but has sense enough to be afraid when things look bad.  * Garrett Hedlund (""Country Strong"") is Mr. Hook, an Indiana Jones look-alike, complete with fedora and attitude (I kept looking for the bull-whip). ""I don't have your back, Kid!"" I enjoyed every scene in which he was featured.  * Hugh Jackman (""Les Miserables"") This charismatic actor is buried in Blackbeard's evil persona, determined to find the Fairy Kingdom which will provide him with enough fairy dust for eternal youth.  * Rooney Mara (""Side Effects"") is Tiger Lily. This character is far, far from Barrie's original. This one is a swashbuckling swordsman (woman?) who battles Blackbeard and flirts with Mr. Hook.  * Adeel Akhtar (Lots of TV) is Sam Smiegel (""Smee""), a hapless coward who only hinders everyone around him.Like so many big-screen, big-budget movies these days, our tale is overwhelmed by Computer Generated Imaging which does nothing to advance the story: e.g., the airborne sailing ships come complete with cannons AND flamethrowers. The battle scenes are endless and ultimately, boring. This PG-rated fantasy ran for 111 minutes, but somehow it seemed longer.To me, it just didn't pan out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5TRYNWQJZIH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016D5YJNO#wasThisHelpful","R5TRYNWQJZIH9","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A fellow I respect once said, ""Just because a guy is a genius doesn't mean he isn't a jerk!"" (He didn't use the word ""jerk."") In this case, the genius is already legendary, so we let director Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") use three major product launches to illustrate the life and times of the iconic founder of Apple Computers. Working with a demanding script from the always excellent Aaron Sorkin (""Moneyball"") based on the book by Walter Isaacson, he pulls back the curtain on a classic American success story.Sorkin wrote ""The Social Network,"" as he looked at Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, but this time, his trademark ""walk and talk"" scenes are overdone and unrealistic. All of them take place during product launch countdowns (""30 minutes, Mr. Jobs!"" ""Five minutes, Steve!"" ""It's time! You don't want to be late!"") so I constantly felt anxious and impatient with the intransigent Mr. J. In addition, each launch features the same six people backstage. Really??? Plus everyone interrupts, swears, and no one ever changes his or her mind.The cast:  * Michael Fassbender (""12 Years a Slave"") is Steve Jobs, an abrasive guy who marches to his own drummer. He isn't a programmer, can't write code and is not technical. He sees himself as an orchestra conductor, he doesn't play any instrument, but is in charge of all.  * Seth Rogen (""The Interview"") is Steve Wozniak, the brilliant geek who worked shoulder to shoulder with the ""other"" Steve to launch Apple. He's tired of being Ringo to Jobs'  John.  * Kate Winslet (""Insurgent"") is Joanna Hoffman, a woman who can go toe to toe with Jobs. She is the overworked dogsbody who, for decades, keeps him on schedule, placates his coworkers and looks out for his daughter Lisa.  * Jeff Daniels (""The Martian"") is John Sculley, the CEO of Apple whose board of directors ousted Jobs when he wouldn't budge on his new operating system.  * Katherine Waterston (""Inherent Vise"") has the thankless task of playing Chrisann Brennon, mother of Lisa, a daughter Jobs refuses to recognize even after DNA proves he is the father. (I said he was intransigent.) She has had a sinus infection for over 15 years.  * Perla Haney-Jardine (""Future Weather"") is the third version of Lisa. We watch Lisa grow up on screen. Her relationship with her father is contentious to say the least. By the way, in this one, there is no mention of his wife or his other children....  * Michael Stuhlbarg (""Hugo"") Andy Hertzfeld is constantly abused, insulted and demeaned by Jobs. In return, he suggests Lisa find a therapist and provides a strong masculine figure for her childhood. (Jobs never forgives him.)This offers nothing new in the way of information or insight. In my opinion, it wasted some top-flight talent. Fassbender is a pleasure to watch and Sorkin writes good R-rated dialogue (language), but 110 minutes is longer than I want to spend on this rehash.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCNKZBNHZ414Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168UF320#wasThisHelpful","RCNKZBNHZ414Z","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hey, Johnny Depp fans, are you still out there? I have to confess that his choices of quirky and/or repugnant movie characters have never appealed to me. This time he adroitly portrays the legendary Whitey Bulger, the most infamous criminal ever raised in South Boston. Director Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"") working from a script written by a committee, shows us how this two-hour R-rated true-life story all came down.This dark drama, which spans the 70s, 80s, and some of the 90s, features a foreboding score that telegraphs each shocking and bloody murder. The production design expertly captures those eras with authentic street scenes, automobiles and clothing. Warning: We're talking about Boston's Irish and Italian mobs, so the F-bombs spray like machine-gun bullets!We see:  * Johnny Depp (""The Lone Ranger"") is Whitey Bulger, the brutally efficient mastermind who plays both ends against the middle as he bullies and charms his way to the top of his local Irish mob in South Boston, then beguiles an old childhood friend into using an FBI team to settle accounts with the Cosa Nostra in North Boston.  * Benedict Cumberbatch (""The Imitation Game"") is his brother Billy, a State Senator who shares that deep sense of loyalty, but who can see his brother for what he is.  * Joel Edgerton (""The Great Gatsby"") brings us John Connolly, the profoundly loyal friend who believes in his chum and does everything in his power to protect him.  * Julianne Nicholson (""August, Osage County"") His wife Marianne can see John slowly change and does NOT like it!  * Kevin Bacon (""The Following"") Charles McGuire won't rest until Whitey is brought to justice. His impatience is almost palpable.  * David Harbour (Lots of TV) FBI man John Morris has his doubts, but Whitey keeps laying them to rest.  * Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation"") FBI agent Robert Fitzpatrick is the fellow who breaks rank first.  * Peter Sarsgaard (""Blue Jasmine"") is Brian Halloran, a junky who does his share of enforcing but doesn't want to be on the receiving end.  * Corey Stoll (""Ant-Man"") Fred Wykshak is the new broom brought in by the FBI to sweep up this mess. His character was the only one I could root for!This is organized as a series of vignettes which illustrate bits of testimony as former colleagues turn State's Evidence. In my opinion, Nicholson and Sarsgaard turn in the standout performances by far.The subdued screening audience was mostly silent as we exited the theater. We had learned one thing (SPOILER ALERT!): Crime does not pay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQAA158TQIFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JR13IG#wasThisHelpful","R1NQAA158TQIFD","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A little boy from the tiny farming community of Tulelake, California wishes that he could be Batman. He has just completed a round of chemo in his three-year battle with leukemia; his wish reaches the ears of a local Make-a-Wish organizer.This PG-rated documentary illustrates the jaw-dropping power of social media as it follows this 5-year-old cancer patient as he gets his wish courtesy of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in San Francisco. The idea caught fire on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. (the statistics are astounding), and resulted in a phenomenal day in his life, the lives of Make-a-Wish personnel and the happy citizens of San Francisco. In addition, this excellent documentary became a film festival favorite.We see:  * Miles Scott is our central character who has been battling leukemia. This was very much on my mind when our little guy had to climb that daunting flight of stairs near the end of his long, long day....  * Patricia Wilson is the Make-a-Wish spark-plug behind the event. She was hoping for ""maybe 20 people to pretend to be a crowd.""  * Ama Daetz is the television newscaster who broadcast an appeal for help and asked Batkid to watch for a message from the Chief of Police.  * Eric Johnston is the creative genius who designed the tools and choreographed the ""rescues."" He taught Batkid the secret handshake and also filled in as Batman.  * Sue Graham Johnston is the Damsel in Distress strapped to a bomb on the trolley tracks who must be saved by Batkid. Watch what happens to her leather jacket and purse.  * Mike Jutan works for Industrial Light and Magic. He is The Penguin. Hear what happens when he goes to China.The awesome effect of one small boy's wish reverberates through the Police Department, the Mayor's Office, the costume department of the San Francisco Opera, San Francisco Cable Cars, AT&T (baseball) Park and countless other local participants. It also generated national and international interest, with cards, letters, emails, etc., from well-wishers around the world, plus all of the actors who had portrayed Batman and greetings from both President and Mrs. Obama.I'm just naming some of the participants, you have to watch the movie to see what they do! Just the astonishing size of the crowd alone and its amazing behavior is worth the price of admission. There are times it's an honor to be a human being.

"So what was that about? It wasn't a comedy because it wasn't funny. It wasn't a drama because the script was too lame. It wasn't a tragedy because the ending was a copout. I know! It was about 81 minutes...and that is 81 minutes of my life I'll never get back!This ""quirky"" comedy was submitted to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival by Canada. I would fear for any poor teenager who is subjected to this jerk's ""guidance."" But then again, I'm just an old poop! I am not amused by an adult in a position of authority who offers drugs and alcohol to teenagers.Written and directed by Pat Mills (""Secondary High"") we see what happens when a prospective employer doesn't check a résumé. A former child star, lost to bad decisions and overuse of controlled substances, is probably not a very good prospect.The cast:  * Pat Mills (""You Can't Do That on Television"") is David Gold, the impossibly loose cannon who lies, cheats and steals. He copies a résumé off the Internet and gets a job as a high school guidance counselor.  * Zahra Bentham (""Degrassi: The Next Generation"") Lisa is one of the students who receives ""guidance"" from our hero. She clearly is more savvy than he, and hers is the only story worth following.  * Kevin Hanchard (""Orphan Black"") Principal Newman has no one to blame but himself.David's litany of affirmations turned out to be amusing because we hear them against a backdrop of completely contradictory behavior on his part. In addition, I smiled at the crime spree: robbing tanning parlors in a bright yellow Prius, with a runaway teenage girl.

"Maybe the title gives some of the plot away, ya think?If we have an irresistible force (a serial cheater) meet an immovable object (a womanizer), something's gotta give (Sorry, Johnny Mercer). Then after they develop a platonic friendship that lasts over the years through many failed relationships, do we even have to wonder what might happen? Nah...This lightweight romance from the USA was featured at the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival. Written and directed by Leslye Headland (""Bachelorette"") this predictable bit of froth is engaging enough to enlist a top-tier cast willing to say all those anatomical terms that pass for dialogue in a romantic comedy these days. I know, I know, I sound like a stuffy old poop, but I really didn't need masturbation lessons demonstrated on an empty plastic beverage container. Based on scenes like this, I'm guessing this will be R-rated.Featured are:  * Alison Brie (""The Five-Year Engagement"") as Lainey. She's just a gal who can't SAY ""No."" Her worst weakness is that married doctor with whom she has had a relationship since college.  * Jason Sudeikis (""Horrible Bosses 2"") Jake can't HEAR ""No."" As a result, he has earned quite the reputation as a successful lady's man.  * Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation"") is Jake's nemesis: a loathsome classmate in college and the married agent of Lainey's misery.  * Natasha Lyonne (""Orange is the New Black"") Kara is Lainey's wing man, full of advice and concern for Lainey.  * Amanda Peet (""Identity Thief"") is Jake's confidant boss, casting admiring glances his way, until something slips.I think you can see where this is going after we see our two lead characters meet in college and have a one-night stand, only to encounter one another again 15 years later. When they reconnect in a 12-step program for sexual issues, the story starts to gain a bit of traction.I did NOT like the way the men consistently talked over the women, disregarding their opinions and their points of view; that felt too familiar. I DID like the performances, particularly Brie and Sudeikis; they made an appealing couple and we ended up rooting for them.Only movie lovers with a high tolerance for sexual situations and anatomical language need apply.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37YZ747GF60WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158RTVHC#wasThisHelpful","R37YZ747GF60WZ","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How's THAT for a provocative title? And NO, this does not resemble 2014's romantic tragedy ""The Fault in Our Stars."" It does however have something in common with another Shailene Woodley film, ""The Spectacular Now"": it has the longest single-take scene I have witnessed in contemporary filmmaking. I note that our lead actress is stage trained, but her costar seems to be a beginner. What a remarkable beginning!This USA submission to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival says ""A Little Friendship Never Killed Anyone."" Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, he has guided a pair of young actors to excel in their craft as they portray a couple of teenagers forced to visit with one another by their mothers.The cast:* Thomas Mann (""It's Kind of a Funny Story"") is Greg, a young would-be filmmaker. He makes low budget parodies of classic films; derivative, juvenile, and silly.* Connie Britton (""Nashville"") is Greg's mother; she insists that Greg visit a classmate ""because she has leukemia."" He can't think of a worse reason to visit someone!* RJ Cyler (""Second Chances"") is Earl, Greg's partner in crime. Neither of them fit in at school so they have created quite a library of movies.* Olivia Cooke (""The Signal"") is Rachel, our eponymous dying girl. She is as wary as Greg about a visit. He finally tells her he agrees with her but his mother has threatened him, so she gives in.The final segment displays a unique art form that I have only seen a couple of times. It is breathtaking and adds to the eloquence of the ending.

"Have you read any of the humorous travel books by Bill Bryson (""Notes From a Small Island"" and ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself"")? In this one, when he ""hikes the Appalachian Trail,"" he really DOES hike the Appalachian Trail (apologies to former South Carolina Governor Sanford). Yup. It's a ""Road Trip"" comedy as an ill-matched duo tries to cope with the hazards and inconveniences of being on the road together.Director Ken Kwapis (""The Office"" and ""He's Just Not That Into You""), working with a screenplay based on Bryson's book, centers his movie on the ex-pat writer who has moved back home with his English family. This setup delivers a witty, satisfying, R-rated (language) dramedy for people of a certain age. For me, it generates a whole new respect for authentic actors who decline the siren song of plastic surgery; it's nice to see real people on screen.We appreciate:  * Robert Redford (""All is Lost"") Bill Bryson has returned to the U.S. after almost two decades in Europe. Watch his tongue-tied reaction to that rude talk-show host! Confronted by signs of aging (ailing friends, funerals, doctor visits), he longs for a new adventure, so he decides to hike the celebrated Appalachian Trail, which passes near his home town. He can't find any friends who share his enthusiasm.  * Emma Thompson (""Saving Mr. Banks"") Catherine is adamantly opposed to her husband's idea. Her reasons include his age, some well-publicized bear attacks, potential injuries...the list goes on and on. Ultimately he goes, so she says, ""Try not to die!""  * Nick Nolte (""Warrior"") Hard-drinking alcoholic Stephan Katz calls because he heard of Bill's plan through a mutual friend (Katz had NOT been invited). They had been close friends years ago, but had a serious falling out.  * Kristen Schaal (Lots of TV and voice work) Non-stop talker Mary Ellen is an unwelcome intruder. She provides our hapless duo with their first common goal: Ditch her!  * Mary Steenburgen (""Last Vegas"") Jeannie is the proprietor of a family-owned motel. Her lovely mother is a piece of work!

Actually, her husband does...The dialogue seems authentic: two guys reminiscing about adolescence, pranks, girls, college and other shared youthful experiences. By the time they became adults, Bryson had a career, a wife, a family and is happily domesticated. Katz is still an unrepentant hedonist, a drunk who has seen more breasts than Bryson ever imagined! Bill says, ""Books are television for smart people."" Katz is convinced the trail is ""uphill all the way to Maine.""Once we see samples of the gorgeous terrain, we understand why so many people want to hike this trail, yet only 10% actually complete it. Expect a few F-bombs and some adult humor (Katz is amused that Bill buries his own waste just off the trail). Here in Seattle, residents of a nearby retirement community were treated to this advance screening. It was perfect for them and they had a great time!

"This stellar cast really caught my eye! Here is a trio which easily delivers a tongue-in-cheek script for a PG-13 audience, most of whom have never seen the original TV show. All three actors are beautiful to look at; the script delivers nicely nuanced sexual tension; we enjoy witty repartee with nary an F-bomb; we gawk at wonderful locations; the Cold War is evoked with music, clothing, cars and spies. There is plenty of action which features gunfire, speed boats, motorcycles, a dune buggy, various trucks...and just a bit of highly satisfying blowie uppie stuff. Oh! And watch the stunt driving!Directed and co-written (with six other collaborators) by Guy Ritchie (""Sherlock Holmes"") this reboot of the classic television series has us laughing from the first high-energy scene that opens the movie, to the final one which I won't describe.Here is that eye-catching cast:  * Henry Cavill (""Man of Steel"" and ""Immortals"") CIA agent Napoleon Solo is working for the CIA to avoid a prison sentence. He has to work with a Russian operative to find and confiscate an illegal nuclear bomb. This actor is British playing American.  * Armie Hammer (""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Social Network"" where he plays twins!) KGB operative Illya Kuryakin has anger issues and trouble with impulse control. His job is to secure the bomb before that despised American. This actor is American playing Russian.  * Alicia Vikander (""A Royal Affair"" and ""Anna Karenina"") Gaby Teller is supposed to intercept her German father who defected to the Americans after WWII, but may have helped a rogue organi- zation build that bomb. She is Swedish playing German in English.  * Hugh Grant (""About a Boy"" and ""Bridget Jones"") Waverly seems to call the shots. Really?  * Elizabeth Debicki (""The Great Gatsby"") Victoria Vinciguerra brings glamor to the Cold War. This Paris-born actress was raised in Australia and is playing ...maybe Italian?  * Andrew Jack (""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"") is the brilliant dialect coach who worked with our stars and made them sound authentic.As our screening audience exited the theater we agreed that this delightful outing should become a series. The four principals are perfectly cast, they play comedy with beautifully understated delivery, and it is a pleasure to spend time with them. Let's watch for them again; cross your fingers!

"It's been ten years, so Marvel Comics has decided that it's time for another reboot of this perpetual series. Now it's called a ""re-imagining,"" so we leave everything we knew and approach this with an open mind although we recognize some familiar landmarks. We learn what event caused our team to be invested with their unusual skills.Life on Earth as we know it, is at risk and who better to save us? We see a high-echelon group of powers-that-be sit down to assess cost versus benefit, when a professor offers a group of his high-achieving students as our next best hope to develop inter-dimensional travel and find new energy sources as a result (don't ask!).The cast:  * Reg E. Cathey (""House of Cards"") is Dr. Franklin Storm, who is convinced his brilliant students can solve this sticky problem.  * Toby Kebbell (""Down of the Planet of the Apes"") Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom is his disenchanted former student whom we first meet in self-imposed exile. He had been thisclose to solving the problem. He does NOT want to wear a lab coat!  * Michael B. Jordan (""Fruitvale Station"") Johnny Storm/The Human Torch is his son who is lured onto the team with an offer of a new car (he wrecked his father's). He is defiant but has his own skill set.  * Kate Mara (""House of Cards"") Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman is a charter member of this invincible quartet. She is Dr. Storm's adopted daughter from Ukraine.  * Miles Teller (""Divergent"") Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic brings a prodigy's unusual abilities to the table. He wants their team to beat NASA to the punch and travel in their invention before Government take over.  * Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliot"" 2000 and ""Defiance"" 2008) Our friend Ben Grimm/The Thing has kept his old job at the wrecking yard, but answers our hero's call for adventure.  * Tim Blake Nelson (""Child of God"") as soon as we see Dr. Allen's smarmy smile, we peg him for a double-crossing villain, although HE certainly doesn't see things that way. He just sees a group of scared kids who can be very valuable to the government.Any shortcomings in this production I lay at the feet of writer/director Josh Trank. This is his first attempt and will no doubt improve. I have seen these cast members in more demanding roles and they are highly capable. This is PG-13, so expect lots of blowie uppie stuff, unusual fisticuffs and Computer Generated Imaging, some mild profanity and no sweaty bodies. Have I left anything out?In our screening audience, fans of Sci-Fi and CGI left the theater happy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3004CC046LXVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JPCA1Y#wasThisHelpful","R3004CC046LXVE","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She sang her way through college, so this casting is no accident, although she DID have to learn to play guitar.Written by Diablo Cody (""Juno"") and directed by Jonathan Demme (""Neil Young: Heart of Gold""), this capable duo brings our screening audience a PG-13 movie about a family that is conflicted, to say the least. My major problem is, I only LIKE half of them, the others are self-centered, spoiled, inconsiderate and rude.They include:  * Meryl Streep (""Into the Woods"") is Ricki, a wannabe rock star who was never very maternal. She walked out on her husband and three children 15 years ago to pursue her dream of stardom; her family's resentment still simmers. She toils away as a supermarket checker during the day and plays in a small bar's house band at night. She is oblivious to the pain she causes. She thinks ""ALS"" is short for Alzheimer's.  * Kevin Kline (""De-Lovely"") Her former husband Pete has always kept things on an even keel, raising their children with the capable help of a lovely second wife.  * Audra McDonald (Lots of TV) Maureen has willingly embraced motherhood and cared for those three children. She is smart enough to know the issues involved, but is kind enough to try to minimize them.  * Mamie Gummer (""The Good Wife"") is their daughter Julie (Gummer is Streep's second child). Julie wants her husband back...period. She is inconsolable and furious...but you can see her echoing her mother's behavior and mannerisms.  * Sebastian Stan (""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"") is their son Joshua.

I LOVED the choreography in his wedding dance.  * Rick Springfield (Lots of TV) Greg is Ricki's faithful band mate.

Greg says it's not your kids' job to love you, but it's your job to love your kids.

"Another impossible mission (is there any other kind?) for Ethan Hunt and his crew.  There are always many good reasons why this international franchise continues to print money: They are exciting and FUN, we enjoy the exotic locations, and there is action aplenty. Check out that opening sequence!Writer/director Christopher McQuarie (""Edge of Tomorrow"") never misses a beat; he's been thrilling us since ""The Usual Suspects,"" so we know we are in very capable hands and we're ready for slam-bang action from the first frame! McQuarie includes several critical scenes which include a suspenseful time element: an airplane taking off, a ticking bomb, or a drowning. We respond to the tension even though we know these MI movies have happy endings!We already know the plot (an unexpected threat to the future wellbeing of the world), the characters (our usual team and some outstanding new folks) and the exciting effects (chases by car, foot and motorcycle, with very little CGI or blowie uppie stuff). These always have minor tweaks, so this time I'm going to talk a bit more about the actors, particularly the ones we've already seen in these roles:  * Tom Cruise (""M.I."") Ethan and his team have been disavowed. There have been too many international incidents which took place while they were in the vicinity. Cruise allows his character to be beaten up, need to be rescued, want reassurance, and there are times he is not all-seeing and all-knowing. I was pleasantly surprised.  * Simon Pegg (""M.I."") Benji is loyal to a fault. He refuses to go back to London where he is safe, but instead insists on staying in Vienna and then Morocco with his fugitive friend. Pegg is the go-to guy for big action-filled franchises that need a friendly (and funny) face. See ""Star Trek,"" as well!  * Jeremy Renner (""M.I."") Brandt reports directly to the CIA now that the Impossible Mission Force has been disbanded; he finds it very challenging. Renner always brings a solid sense of security when he arrives on the scene.  * Ving Rhames (""M.I."") Luther is NOT loyal to the IMF team. He is loyal to Ethan ONLY; everyone else is dispensable. We are glad to know that! Rhames seems to play characters we always want in our corner.  * Rebecca Ferguson (""The White Queen"") Ilsa is Ethan's worthy opponent. She's smart, strong, creative and resourceful. Even when she does what she does, we still want to LIKE her! Ferguson was a big surprise to me, I wasn't aware of her before and she is terrific, maybe she has just had ordinary roles in the past. Ilsa is NOT an ordinary role!  * Alec Baldwin (""Blue Jasmine"") Hunley is the CIA director who explains that there is no such thing as ""The Syndicate,"" as he fires Ethan and his team. Baldwin specializes in morally compromised characters, so we are skeptical about his motivations.  * Tom Hollander (""About Time"") The British Prime Minister surprised me because he knew more than I expected. Hollander's familiar face is in everything from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" to ""About Time"" and ""The Lost Prince."" He works ALL the time!  * Sean Harris (""Prometheus"") Harris plays one of the spookiest villains I have seen recently because the man rarely smiles, he is a cold-blooded killer and he is ruthlessly determined to make the world a better place, i.e., the way HE wants it.The most unique element I could see in this entertaining behemoth was the motorcycle chase, although Ethan's underwater struggle and the backstage shenanigans at Puccini's opera ""Turandot"" are also worthy of note. Another plus is Cruise's abiding dislike for green-screen work, so his movies have very little Computer Generated Imaging. In addition, I was impressed that they could convey that much excitement without a single solitary F-bomb! Remarkable!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKRSHBFVALHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012XYQ1S0#wasThisHelpful","R1MKRSHBFVALHR","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Claymation studio Aardman (""Wallace & Gromit"") has created an award-winning PG-rated tale of a busybody sheep who must fix a problem he has created. These characters are based on a long-running TV series in the UK. We are charmed by mornings at the farm: a montage of activities that starts with a rooster crowing and ends with the farmer finally emerging from his house. There are many funny steps in between.Shaun is inspired by an ad on a bus; he decides to think outside the box and break up the morning routine. As a result he gets The Farmer in big, big trouble. Now he and his stalwart sidekick, the sheepdog Bitzer, have to get their amnesiac shepherd and his flock out of that dangerous city and safely back home. By the way, the entire movie is done with NO dialogue but not one child in the screening audience missed it.Writer/director Mark Burton (""Madagascar"") and writer/director Richard Starzak have used the voices of:  * John Sparkes (""Peppa Pig"") The Farmer loves his animals but through some mischief by Shaun, lands in the big city with amnesia. At least he remembers how to use a clippers: he has sheared many a sheep.  * Jason Fletcher (""Gigglebiz"") When our hero Shaun lands in the big city animal shelter, we watch all the creatures try to appeal to visitors in hopes they will be adopted. This scene contains many adult movie references to jails that made the parents laugh but went over the heads of the little 'uns.  * John Sparkes (""Calendar Girls"") Bitzer is the epitome of the hard-working sheep dog. I loved his morning routine where he is seen walking out of the yard clutching a roll of toilet paper with a newspaper under his arm. Like Shaun, he is determined to get The Farmer back home where he belongs.  * Omid Djalili (""Moonfleet"") is Trumper, the Animal Containment Officer who we come to realize will stop at nothing to recapture the fugitive Shaun.As you can see by the credits, this cast and crew are from children's television in the UK. They even offer an odd musical interlude. My major concern was that too much of the movie was over the heads of the children; in fact about two-thirds of the way through, a little voice piped up, ""Is it going to get better again?"" About then, the final (lengthy) chase scene began and after that, no child had a dull moment.

"A happy audience member said while exiting this screening, ""I LOVE stupid movies!"" Okaaaayy... This is not only stupid, it is stomach-churningly icky; even the title sequence is gross. (Watch the preview below.) Listening to the audience in the lobby later, I realized that MANY people enjoy stupid movies, so this one should make money.Was the National Lampoon's Vacation this profane? (I didn't see it.) Well, I guess once was not enough. Walley World: Brace yourself! Twenty-two years later, the Griswolds are coming back! This R rating is richly deserved with disgustingly anatomical humor and F-bombs by the score.The cast:  * Ed Helms (""We're the Millers"") is Rusty Griswold; he was a kid the first time he visited this theme park and the happy memory still lingers. He is certain that this cross-country road trip (in a Tartan Prancer from Albania) will bond his family again. This well-meaning character is the most socially tone-deaf doofus I have ever had the misfortune to watch.  * Christina Applegate (""Anchorman"") is his wife Debbie. She is patient when Rusty changes the voice in the GPS to Korean and she remains the voice of reason until they stop by her old sorority on their road trip. Yikes!  * Skyler Gisondo (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") James is the only ""normal"" member of this goofy family. He is bullied by his younger brother and totally misunderstood by his father, so my heart went out to him!  * Steele Stebbins (""A Haunted House 2"") Aren't there laws that prevent youngsters from talking like Kevin? This kid is cruel and borderline homicidal. And his parents are oblivious. As a target of childhood bullies, I fail to see the humor. Aarghhh!  * Leslie Mann (""The Other Woman"") Audrey Griswold can't forget what a good time she had when she and Rusty were children. Of course now she has the marriage right out of Central Casting, so she must be blissfully happy...Right?  * Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") plays Stone Crandall. the insanely conceited TV weatherman Audrey married. Hemsworth has an absolute blast sending up this character!  * Catherine Missal (""Law & Order"") Adena never suspects that the pedophile who talked with them by the pool is actually Rusty, James' inept father trying to be his wingman.  * Chevy Chase (""Community"") Did you think Clark Griswold was forgotten? Of course not!  * Beverly D'Angelo (""Mom"") Wherever Clark can be found, his devoted Ellen is close at hand.""Horrible Bosses"" collaborators Jonathan M. Goldstein and John Francis Daley wrote and directed this latest Ed Helms' outing (they must like him) so there is no one else to blame.

"Melissa McCarthy's comedy has an unfortunate tendency to go over the top; I'm happy to report that this is NOT the case here (and you WILL become inured to the f-word after the first 20 times you hear it). Written and directed by Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids,"" and ""The Heat""), we are transported to an R-rated James Bond'ish film, complete with iconic title credits and a song that evokes the genre.This movie opens in the middle of an important mission to find and confiscate a nuclear device before it can be used against the United States. We see a supremely effective American CIA agent in constant communication with his high-tech handler in Langley, although they aren't even on the same continent. She provides tactical information from heat-detecting devices to warn him of approaching enemies. They make a top-notch team...until he is killed. Now the CIA needs a new face that isn't known to the enemy.The cast:  * Jude Law (""Hugo"") is perfect as the super agent. He has the looks, the manner and the wardrobe.  * Melissa McCarthy (""Identity Thief"") is his heartbroken handler. She had been carrying a secret torch for her partner and now wants revenge, so she volunteers. Each new identity is more challenging (and funnier) than the last.  * Allison Janney (""Mom"") is their boss. She doesn't like our heroine, but knows it is vital to prevent that nuclear device from being smuggled into the United States...and our gal's face isn't known...  * Rose Byrne (""Neighbors"") This glamorous super-spy (with lots of hair!) is negotiating a deal. Nuclear devices are extremely profitable!  * Jason Statham (""Parker"") You have NEVER heard such an egotistical, overly confident bunch of twaddle in your life. Statham is clearly having a ball doing a hilarious sendup of his usual super-macho personae.  * Miranda Hart (""Call the Midwife"") Meanwhile, back at Langley, our heroine's gawky BFF has become, by default, her handler. She's confused and frightened but she's not stupid!  * Bobby Cannavalle (""Danny Collins"") This wealthy industrialist is in the market for a nuclear device.Of course we travel to lovely locations: Italy (one Italian agent learned his British accent from watching ""Downton Abbey""); MANY scenic spots in Hungary; plus some great locales in France. We see vehicular mayhem (with our heroine on a scooter), physical combat (she's surprisingly good), numerous gunfights (she's a crack shot) and some aerial stunts (she learned on the trainer at Langley). We do NOT see sweaty bodies or blowie uppie stuff...(well, just a little bit).We enjoy laugh-out-loud comedy with very few ""fat"" jokes. Even though we see agents, double agents and even a triple agent or two, we have several people to root for and we can trust that this will have a happy ending.

"As you can tell by the spelling, this award-winning documentary from the US to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival, is about Evel Knievel a dare-devil who made a career out of being a dare-devil. Nominated at both the SXSW Film Festival (Audience Award) and Sundance (Grand Jury Prize), this film won Grand Prize at the Boulder International Film Festival.Through Director Daniel Junge, we meet a motorcycle hotdogger named Robert ""Evel"" Knievel, a goofy guy from Butte, Montana. He is described by Johnny Carson as ""the only man in history who has become very wealthy by trying to kill himself.""We enjoy humorous interviews with articulate friends, colleagues and family members who have witnessed the astonishing arc of his life. For example, in 37 years of broadcasting, the Wide, Wide World of Sports says out of their ten all-time top shows, seven of them feature Evel Knievel. That's quite a statistic, and it's only the beginning.Junge takes us to Evel's iconic jumps: Caesar's Palace, Wimbledon, Snake River and many others you will recognize; but he also takes us through our hero's meltdown and decline.

Little known fact: The factory where this toy was first built, burned down not once, not twice, but THREE times! Each time it was rebuilt to larger specs and went right on making Legos. Today they make 100,000 pieces per MINUTE and there now exist over 100,000 pieces for every man, woman and child on earth.Applications abound:  * A therapist named ""Dr Legoff"" (no kidding!) successfully treats children with Autism. They learn how to work as a three-person team and it is remarkable!  * People from rock stars to basketball heroes play with Legos® to relax.  * We see an artist (a former lawyer) create an amazing show that draws not only adult aficionados and children, but legitimate art critics!  * We see interviews at MIT, in Japan, Denmark, the Prague, plus countless other cities, where children and adults express their admiration and love for their favorite pastime.  * Legos® are used by movie makers, Master Builders, NASA, architects, city planners, and hobbyists, to name just a few.  * A mathematician at a chalkboard is still working on the ""infinite possibilities"" offered in the Legos® world.One of the officials at Lego® recalled when the company almost had to close its doors in the late 1990s because their market tanked. To quote this unusual official, ""It was great because we had no one to blame but ourselves!""Enter the creative people who had been merrily building things all along, their only limitation was their own imagination. When the company realized what a gold mine they represented, they promptly joined forces and nothing has ever been the same. At Mattell, Barbie® rules, at Hasbro, it's GI Joe®, in the Lego® world, the customers shape their future.I found this lively piece to be interesting from beginning to end. Others in our 2014 Seattle International Film Festival weren't quite so enthralled. I was impressed by how international the staff is and how ubiquitous the toy is. I haven't begun to cover all the fun facts and faces; you'll have to see it yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18ABTK100L1H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134DI2ZY#wasThisHelpful","R18ABTK100L1H1","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A little boy from the tiny farming community of Tulelake, California wishes that he could be Batman. He has just completed a round of chemo in his three-year battle with leukemia; his wish reaches the ears of a local Make-a-Wish organizer.This PG-rated documentary illustrates the jaw-dropping power of social media as it follows this 5-year-old cancer patient as he gets his wish courtesy of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in San Francisco. The idea caught fire on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. (the statistics are astounding), and resulted in a phenomenal day in his life, the lives of Make-a-Wish personnel and the happy citizens of San Francisco. In addition, this excellent documentary became a film festival favorite.We see:  * Miles Scott is our central character who has been battling leukemia. This was very much on my mind when our little guy had to climb that daunting flight of stairs near the end of his long, long day....  * Patricia Wilson is the Make-a-Wish spark-plug behind the event. She was hoping for ""maybe 20 people to pretend to be a crowd.""  * Ama Daetz is the television newscaster who broadcast an appeal for help and asked Batkid to watch for a message from the Chief of Police.  * Eric Johnston is the creative genius who designed the tools and choreographed the ""rescues."" He taught Batkid the secret handshake and also filled in as Batman.  * Sue Graham Johnston is the Damsel in Distress strapped to a bomb on the trolley tracks who must be saved by Batkid. Watch what happens to her leather jacket and purse.  * Mike Jutan works for Industrial Light and Magic. He is The Penguin. Hear what happens when he goes to China.The awesome effect of one small boy's wish reverberates through the Police Department, the Mayor's Office, the costume department of the San Francisco Opera, San Francisco Cable Cars, AT&T (baseball) Park and countless other local participants. It also generated national and international interest, with cards, letters, emails, etc., from well-wishers around the world, plus all of the actors who had portrayed Batman and greetings from both President and Mrs. Obama.I'm just naming some of the participants, you have to watch the movie to see what they do! Just the astonishing size of the crowd alone and its amazing behavior is worth the price of admission. There are times it's an honor to be a human being. This is one of them....","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UVKHQ41WIKK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPT5G78#wasThisHelpful","R3UVKHQ41WIKK5","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It didn't take many focus groups to figure out that the Minions were the most appealing thing in the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, so now they star in their own movie!We begin in a primordial setting with the evolution of the species and quickly learn that the creatures who become minions need, above all, a BOSS! The next bit shows their unending quest to find one. In 1968 (enjoy the fashions and cultural bits), three of them courageously set out to explore the world and find true meaning in their lives (plus, of course, a boss).Voiced by:  * Pierre Coffin (""Despicable Me"") gives us Kevin, Stuart and Bob, our three intrepid heroes.  * Sandra Bullock (""Gravity"") Scarlet Overkill is sorta the Cruella de Ville of this one. She recruits our three adoring heroes for her own nefarious purpose: She wants the crown that belongs to the Queen of England. Boo.... Hiss.....  * Jon Hamm (""Million-Dollar Arm"") is her doting husband...who also mans her torture chamber.  * Michael Keaton (""Birdman"") Enthusiastic Walter Nelson is taking his family to the Villain Con, Orlando's answer to San Diego's Comic Con.  * Allison Janney (""Spy"") Madge, Walter's wife, is his supportive helpmate who also assists in the family business (wait'll you see...)  * Jennifer Saunders (""Absolutely Fabulous"") is The Queen (who might be mistaken for another queen we all know and love).This PG-rated animated comedy, co-directed by Kyle Balda (""Monsters, Inc."") and Pierre Coffin (""Despicable Me""), is based on a screenplay by Brian Lynch (""Puss in Boots""). It offers kid-friendly activities, like sliding down banisters and jumping on the bed, but also has some fairly intense chase scenes complete with gunfire and lots of blowie uppie stuff.Be ready for a few fart jokes (this is as racy as a PG-rated movie can get), some characters in jeopardy, and lots of silly fun. This is another animated feature that includes generous helpings of scenery and situations adults will recognize (e.g., the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House, still under construction in 1968, and Ayers Rock) with a script which often works on two levels. Our screening audience clearly enjoyed it.

"Yes! It's them! Don't tell me you haven't been watching for the opening date. Like every sequel, this one is bigger (solo numbers), harder (core), and waaay over the top. It has something for everyone and a body for everybody; you have to see it to believe it. The R rating is richly deserved although I hasten to add there are NO sweaty bodies, no gunshots, no vehicular mayhem, and no blowie uppie stuff, but there are F bombs by the score and some VERY suggestive (but terrific!) choreography.It's three years after the first ""Magic Mike,"" and some of our heroes' lives have changed drastically. Dallas has gone to seek his fortune on foreign shores and Mike is in the furniture business, while the rest of the Kings of Tampa toil on with diminishing returns. They decide to have one last blowout at a Male Entertainer's (Male Strippers) Convention in Myrtle Beach, Florida so they recruit Mike to leave his two-man business for awhile. Director Gregory Jacobs borrowed the final scene from his own ""Oceans..."" sequel. You might recognize it.Each returning cast member is spotlighted separately:  * Channing Tatum (""MM"") Mike Lane just has to dance and his routines are eye-poppers.  * Matt Bomer (""MM"") does his own singing in Ken's outrageous spotlight bit.  * Joe Manganiello (""MM"") You'll love Big Dick Richie's routine with the deadpan clerk.  * Adam Rodriguez (""MM"") The mirror dance is amazing!  * Gabriel Iglesias (""MM"") breaks out the sequins and a Carmen Miranda hat.  * Kevin Nash (""MM"") Tarzan uses glue and glitter for his surprise.  * Donald Glover (""Community"") Andre provides the vocals for an impressive routine.  * Jada Pinkett Smith (""Madagascar"") Rome has her own business now but Mike asks her to serve as their MC.  * Michael Strahan (""Are We There Yet?"") Augustus does an amazing routine at Rome's social club. He's an Adonis!  * Andie MacDowell (""Cedar Cove"") Nancy invites Big Dick to a ""Hello drink"" and finds out that he is both blessed and cursed.In the interest of authenticity we saw more drag outfits this time and we actually have a smattering of a plot...again...so just get over it!The (mostly female) screening audience was audibly impressed.

"How do you feel about animals? Do you like dogs? I certainly do! And here we have a dog who has not only earned our affection, but our RESPECT! We become acquainted with the Malinois, which is a Belgian version of a German Shepherd, a bit smaller but every bit as smart.Dogs have had an important role on battlefields since World War I and have been honored for bravery time and time again. There have been over 3,000 war dogs used in Iraq and Afghanistan; at the time of the filming (2014) 26 dogs and 25 handlers have died in Afghanistan.This wonderful PG-rated movie, written and directed by Boaz Yakin (""Safe"") is about a war dog. We first meet him in Afghanistan with his handler, who has trained him from a puppy. The two are inseparable until a betrayal leads them into a fatal encounter, which leaves the handler dead and the dog with a serious case of PTSD. (We know this from the trailers.) His behavior at his handler's coffin in a small Texas town is goosebumps all the way!Our cast:  * Carlos, in his debut performance, is Max, traumatized by events in Afghanistan and sent back to his handler's family in the United States to recuperate. He is grieving and vicious. By the way, can you imagine the impact of the Fourth of July fireworks on a repatriated war dog?  * Robbie Amell (""The Flash"") is Kyle, Max's beloved Marine handler, too soon dead, so we see him only in flashbacks. His father taught his sons that a hero always tells the truth, even when it hurts.  * Thomas Hayden Church (""Lucky Them"") is Ray Wincott, father of the dead Marine, led to believe that Max was the cause of his son's death. This former Marine sees no alternative but to put the dog down.  * Lauren Graham (""Parenthood"") is his wife, Pamela. She has lost her elder son and now is afraid of losing her increasingly defiant younger son. But just wait until this sweet Texas housewife gets angry!  * Josh Wiggins (""Hellion"") is their younger son Justin. While endlessly playing his video war games, it never occurs to him that his brother might die, and he certainly has no interest in babysitting a DOG. But what a joy it is to see three teenagers jump on their bikes to take on hardened criminals just because it's the right thing to do!This involving movie has clear-cut characters and situations, so we quickly come to love our hero, his family and his dog; fear and loathe the villains; feel the frustration of being a powerless teenager; and ache to see the truth revealed. This film slipped in under my radar so it was a pleasant surprise, and the screening audience actually applauded. Don't miss this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQM4929GUTGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FEYZNS#wasThisHelpful","R3EQM4929GUTGJ","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, it's finally here. This highly praised and heavily advertised movie is open for business. Pixar has a special place in my heart, ever since that charming young table lamp burst its rubber ball years ago, so I wasn't surprised, only warmed, by director Pete Doctor's appearance before the opening credits. Do you know why he appears? To thank us for coming to see the show! How can we NOT love these guys?The main thrust of this fairly complicated (rated PG) story is to illustrate the mind-boggling complexity of the human brain, how memory works (each memory is like a huge color-coded gum ball) and the effects of emotion on our daily behavior. Does that sound pretty heavy duty? Yes, it is and it's very clear that much of this film is for adults. However, I talked with a six-year-old boy as we exited the theater and he was very happy with it, so I guess, like other Pixar/Disney collaborations, this works on many levels: He particularly liked the cats at the end!The characters are voiced by celebrities but just as easily could have been done by professional voice artists, so I won't focus on them, but rather on the emotions themselves and how they effect the characters. To our delight, we see that every living creature, man, woman, child, cat and dog has a personal staff that includes these five emotions:  * Joy - Our 11-year-old girl Riley finds joy in her ice hockey, her imaginary friend, her school chums and her wonderful parents. Her mother and father find joy in their family, their jobs and their daughter. You should see what brings joy to a dog!  * Sadness - We see how sadness plays an essential role in the human experience. Dogs experience it too, but cats are oblivious. Riley is sad because she misses her old home in Minnesota; her new home in San Francisco doesn't even have a yard!  * Fear - Too much fear and we are paralyzed, too little and we are heedless of any danger. Fear is pretty paranoid!  * Disgust - This emotion goes into overdrive when Riley sees her dingy new bedroom in the attic...and a dead mouse!  * Anger - The movers are coming with their furniture...WHEN?!? Anger gets a nice workout from the very beginning and is always sputtering in the background. When Mom's Anger kicks in, she remembers that handsome young soccer player that she let get away....This is Pixar/Disney, so no profanity, no sweaty bodies, and no blowie uppie stuff but one fairly scary clown. The enormity of memory, both short term and long term, is wonderfully visible. By the way, I saw this in 3D, but there was no need; the story is the thing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73COS774DBTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCY46VO#wasThisHelpful","R73COS774DBTZ","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Are you a thrill seeker? I think our hero was born one!This white-knuckle documentary was submitted from the United States to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival. Directed by Marah Strauch, we follow the exciting life of the man who invented Base Jumping, a dare- devil sport that entails jumping from impossibly high places (buildings, aerials, spans and earth) with a parachute or a para-sail.Through countless interviews and his own exceptional cinematography, we come to know:  * Carl Boenish (""Bee' nish""), the good-natured fellow who INVENTED Base Jumping.We learn about the polio that struck him as a child and his determination to regain his strength. This hyper-intelligent and active boy became a piano player, an engineer, a skilled trampoline jumper, a filmmaker, an inventor, and then took up sky diving; but that still wasn't enough...  * Jean Boenish, is the woman he married. Wait'll you hear what SHE has to say! Carl's friends said he was never interested in the women who flocked around him but when he met Jean, he never hesitated. This unlikely woman happily joined forces with him, became a skilled Base jumper and his soul mate.She agreed with something he learned in college. ""To wonder HOW is good. To wonder WHY will make you the boss."" She is the perfect mate for this handsome, exuberant and charismatic man.The filmmaking in the documentary is exceptional: we can't tell when a scene is staged and when it is from Carl's amazing library. In addition, the editing is so impressive I'm still thinking about it. As Base jumpers, Carl and his team visit Houston, Yosemite, Canyon de Chelly and other jaw-dropping jump sites. I've never seen mountain crags as jagged as the ones we see in Norway. Wow!We enjoy interviews with Jean, fellow Base jumpers, tour guides, TV producers, family members and above all, Carl. Everything about this presentation is worth while.

"The 2015 Seattle International Film Festival welcomed this award-winning (Cesar Awards, 2015 for Actor, and Costume Design; San Sebastian Award, San Sebastian Film Festival) entry from France (English captions). Many of our members are familiar with writer/director Franois Ozon's work (""8 Women"" and ""Swimming Pool"").The film begins with a brief, wonderfully cast montage which provides the back story about a pair of inseparable friends who grew up together and were in each others lives up to and including marriage, childbirth and one's  unexpected death. The other, a grief-stricken young woman, learns something unexpected about her best friend's widower. ""Une nouvelle amie"" (English captions) takes us into a gender-blending drama which combines sexual tension with the devastating effects of losing a long-time friend.The cast:  * Romain Duris (""Mood Indigo"") is David, a grieving young father. He has a secret (he says he was born in a cauliflower) and Claire can help him with it.  * Anaïs Demoustier (""Caprice"") is Claire. She can't help but intrude into his life because she had promised her dying friend she would be there for him and his baby girl.  * Raphaël Personnaz (""Anna Karenina"") Gilles has his own agenda: he wants a promotion at work and is ready to be a father at home.I've liked Romain Duris ever since ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped,"" so it's no surprise that he pulls off this challenging role with such aplomb.

"Has blockbuster season started? Relax. Director Joss Whedon (""Avengers"") knows how to make a 141-minute, PG-13 film very, very exciting. Although I must confess, I found all the excitement merely filler between the excellent human interactions that generated the biggest audience response. (Note: Superheroes do NOT play well with others, so personality clashes are a way of life.)Ultron (voiced by James Spader) is the amazing result of brilliant engineering, programmed to preserve life on Earth. Problem is, humankind is now viewed as the most destructive element on Earth, so obviously, IT must be eradicated. Enter our heroes....This is only a small part of the massive cast:  * Robert Downey Jr. (""Avengers"") Tony Stark/Iron Man is faced with a moral quandary: Can Artificial Intelligence be reprogrammed to help mankind even after this unintended result?  * Chris Evans (""Avengers"") Steve Rogers/Captain America is the moral center to these movies, he chides his teammates if a profane word slips out. His idea of a pep talk: ""If you get hurt, hurt 'em back; if you get killed, walk it off.""  * Chris Hemsworth ""Avengers"" Thor must maintain his connection to his home planet of Asgard because it's future has a direct link to that of Midgard (Earth).  * Scarlett Johansson (""Avengers"") Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow holds her own amid all this testosterone. This time we are treated to an elaborate back story which sheds additional light on her character.  * Samuel L. Jackson (""Avengers"") Nick Fury along with Captain America, is still trying to knit his obstreperous bunch of superheroes into a cohesive fighting force....and come to their rescue when needed.  * Mark Ruffalo (""Avengers"") Bruce Banner/Hulk has the biggest problem with his other identity. He knows Hulk is a deadly warrior and as a result has major issues with the ethics of the situation.  * Idris Elba (""Thor"") Heimdall gives Thor a preview of what to expect on Asgard.  * Hayley Atwell (""Avengers"") We only see Agent Carter through a couple of brief flashbacks. These are heartbreaking for Steve Rogers.  * Jeremy Renner (""Avengers"") Hawkeye has the most to lose. He has a growing family he loves.  * Paul Bettany (""Avengers"") Jarvis/Vision has been a disembodied voice serving Tony Stark from the beginning. Now things look different....As I said, the cast is enormous. It also includes Don Cheadle,  Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Stellan Skarsgård, Andy Serkis, Julie Delpy, Claudia Kim, Stan Lee and a host of others.The humor is character driven (once again, Stan's is the funniest line). Much of it would go over an audience's head if they didn't know these heroes so well, e.g., Captain America describes himself as ""The world's leading authority on waiting too long."" The audience immediately remembered his tragic delay with Agent Carter and appreciated his wry humor.Expect chaotic over-the-top mayhem, endless battles, no sweaty bodies and a bit of blowie uppie stuff. I cringed when that building imploded and saw a strong resemblance to the NYC street scenes after 9/11.

"Not even Sherlock Holmes can withstand the ravages of time. Here we join him on a farm with his housekeeper and her bright little boy. One thing keeps nagging at our aging hero: an unresolved crime from 30 years ago.The United Kingdom submitted this drama to the 2015 Seattle Inter- national Film Festival and hedged its bets by starring one of its most beloved British actors and an American actress closely associated with Masterpiece Theatre. This satisfyingly complex plot is directed by Bill Condon (""Dreamgirls""), with a screenplay by Mitch Cullin based on the story ""A Slight Trick of the Mind"" by Arthur Conan Doyle.The cast:  * Ian McKellen (""Lord of the Rings"") is our eponymous legend, brilliance fading but still curious and observant. He knows his intellect has lost much of its edge, but he still has his moments and he hopes infusions of Prickly Ash will help. McKellen skillfully shows us the difference between elderly and doddering.  * Laura Linney (""Hyde Park on Hudson"") is Mrs. Munro, his fairly new housekeeper. She is unsure of Mr. Holmes and his effect on her son, so she's anxious to move on to another job.  * Milo Parker (""Ghosthunters"") is Roger, Mrs. Munro's fatherless son. He naturally gravitates to Mr. Holmes and is remarkably quick to learn about bee keeping and solving mysteries.  * Roger Allam (""The Angels' Share"") is Dr. Barrie, whose news is NOT welcome to our hero, nor is his solution.  * Hiroyuki Sanada (""The Twilight Samurai"") Tamiki Umezaki is Mr. Holmes' source for Prickly Ash; plus he and his mother have a long-standing link to our hero.It isn't often we see a movie with ""name brands"" at a film festival and we certainly can appreciate WHY they have become name brands.

This is also a satisfying look at the kind of support women offer one another. By the way, the late lamented dog's name was Hazel, but we saw his profile.

"Disneynature presents a true-life G-rated documentary that follows a female monkey (actually a toque macaque) and her newborn baby as they struggle to survive in ancient ruins found deep in the jungles of Sri Lanka. This is the perfect opportunity for a child to see how the ""pecking order"" works in the animal world. From that, eventually they will see how it applies to humans, not only on the playground, but in the grown-up world as well.We start with an inspiring report on the many contributions the eight Disneynature features have made throughout the world; a percentage of the money from ticket sales is earmarked for ecological and environ- mental concerns. They have, so far, contributed millions of dollars to various causes. After that report, we switch to ""The Monkees,"" a late '60s pop group which accompanies the title sequence. Other artists will follow....Warmly narrated by Tina Fey, we watch:  * Maya, along with her newborn son Kip, as she maneuvers her way from a low ranking semi-outcast, to become the mate of an alpha male which allows her to eat fruit from the top branches of the tree.  * Raja, the alpha male of the tribe, is catered to and groomed by an adoring entourage. (A macaque's hair is right out of The Three Stooges!)  * The Sisterhood is comprised of three sisters who, along with their offspring, enjoy the benefits of Raja's status.  *  Kumar is the macho newcomer who wants to challenge Raja.  * Lex is the horribly disfigured villain of the piece. He's the leader of the tribe of challengers who attack and drive our friends from their home.We giggle at the scenes in the springtime when all the creatures become ""twitterpated"" (it IS Disney) and the shots of Maya swimming underwater with Kip clinging to her are astounding. The mama sloth bear toting her cubs on her back (riding ""bear-back?) is fun and the leopard leaping up into the tree after the monkeys is chilling. We enjoy watching the youngsters tease the mongoose and the squirrels, the landscapes are breathtaking and the cinematography is the best.Stay for the closing credits because then you will meet the production crew, hear of their challenges and discover how long it took them to make this marvelous production. You'll be astonished!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROT6NCBDPKPZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WF83AI4#wasThisHelpful","ROT6NCBDPKPZF","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We all know anxious parents who hover over their darlings, afraid to expose them to possible rejection, pain or other learning experiences. Director Salomé Breziner takes this basic device and stretches it to absurd lengths as she brings this USA-sponsored entry to the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. There are valid reasons it took this long to be released!The cast:  * Nia Vardalos (""I Hate Valentine's Day"") is Maggie. No one can ever say this single mother doesn't LOVE her son. She is terrified that he might miss out on college because of cost, so among other strategies, she has submitted his name for a gay college scholarship.  * Jason Dolley (Lots of TV) is Lloyd. You might say this beleaguered fellow is a bit non-plussed by that scholarship application, since everything about it is a surprise!  * Mark Boone Junior (""Sons of Anarchy"") is Max, the fellow we realize is Lloyd's dead-beat father.I found this contrived screenplay insulting to gays, parents, teachers, and the audience. The humor is anatomical and absurd, Maggie is annoying and repugnant, while Max is a parody: a former flower-child stoner, but even HE has more common sense than that idiotic mom. To watch someone who is utterly tone deaf to her effect on others is NOT funny! We could only pity the poor son and writhe in embarrassment for him as we waited for this thing to be over.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJUAR9C0KCNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSD1T02#wasThisHelpful","R3EJUAR9C0KCNS","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Murder mysteries are not my genre, HOWEVER a mystery that is couched in Phoenix/Northern Arizona history is quite another story! This is the first David Mapstone book I have read, so the elements others may have come to expect were a pleasant surprise to me. As a former Arizonian and an amateur history buff, this was right down my alley.I admired:  * Mapstone's jaunts on familiar Phoenix streets and Arizona highways (...smile...);  * Jon's descriptions of some of the old Phoenix landmarks;  * Mapstone's reaction to his wife's critical situation.  * Jon's cutting commentary on contemporary architecture, particularly the new federal courthouse. I'll be sure to look the next time I'm in the city;  * How Jon jogged my fond memory of the smell of orange blossoms;  * Some of his phrases: ""I went from zero to jerk in 3.5 seconds"" (he didn't say ""jerk"" but I can't quote him here);  * Mapstone's loyalty to his friends;  * Jon's reminder of President Eisenhower's brilliant Interstate Highway System (and its awful impact on small-town America);  * A trip down memory lane to Flagstaff, Ash Fork, Payson and bits of old Route 66;  * Jon's appreciation of how dark the countryside is with no street lights;  * Mapstone's confrontations with bureaucratic bungling and his short-tempered reactions.The upshot is that I very much enjoyed my first ramble over familiar territory with David Mapstone. Even thought this is NOT his first installment, as a new reader, I can assure you it stands alone very well.This is a well-crafted mystery with a nicely snarled plot and a satisfactory exposition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K3ZWN7FYZTP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204004#wasThisHelpful","R1K3ZWN7FYZTP1","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Has blockbuster season started? Relax. Director Joss Whedon (""Avengers"") knows how to make a 141-minute, PG-13 film very, very exciting. Although I must confess, I found all the excitement merely filler between the excellent human interactions that generated the biggest audience response. (Note: Superheroes do NOT play well with others, so personality clashes are a way of life.)Ultron (voiced by James Spader) is the amazing result of brilliant engineering, programmed to preserve life on Earth. Problem is, humankind is now viewed as the most destructive element on Earth, so obviously, IT must be eradicated. Enter our heroes....This is only a small part of the massive cast:  * Robert Downey Jr. (""Avengers"") Tony Stark/Iron Man is faced with a moral quandary: Can Artificial Intelligence be reprogrammed to help mankind even after this unintended result?  * Chris Evans (""Avengers"") Steve Rogers/Captain America is the moral center to these movies, he chides his teammates if a profane word slips out. His idea of a pep talk: ""If you get hurt, hurt 'em back; if you get killed, walk it off.""  * Chris Hemsworth ""Avengers"" Thor must maintain his connection to his home planet of Asgard because it's future has a direct link to that of Midgard (Earth).  * Scarlett Johansson (""Avengers"") Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow holds her own amid all this testosterone. This time we are treated to an elaborate back story which sheds additional light on her character.  * Samuel L. Jackson (""Avengers"") Nick Fury along with Captain America, is still trying to knit his obstreperous bunch of superheroes into a cohesive fighting force....and come to their rescue when needed.  * Mark Ruffalo (""Avengers"") Bruce Banner/Hulk has the biggest problem with his other identity. He knows Hulk is a deadly warrior and as a result has major issues with the ethics of the situation.  * Idris Elba (""Thor"") Heimdall gives Thor a preview of what to expect on Asgard.  * Hayley Atwell (""Avengers"") We only see Agent Carter through a couple of brief flashbacks. These are heartbreaking for Steve Rogers.  * Jeremy Renner (""Avengers"") Hawkeye has the most to lose. He has a growing family he loves.  * Paul Bettany (""Avengers"") Jarvis/Vision has been a disembodied voice serving Tony Stark from the beginning. Now things look different....As I said, the cast is enormous. It also includes Don Cheadle,  Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Stellan Skarsgrd, Andy Serkis, Julie Delpy, Claudia Kim, Stan Lee and a host of others.The humor is character driven (once again, Stan Lee's is the funniest line). Much of it would go over an audience's head if they didn't know these heroes so well, e.g., Captain America describes himself as ""The world's leading authority on waiting too long."" The audience immediately remembered his tragic delay with Agent Carter and appreciated his wry humor.Expect chaotic over-the-top mayhem, endless battles, no sweaty bodies and a bit of blowie uppie stuff. I cringed when that building imploded and saw a strong resemblance to the NYC street scenes after 9/11. That was painful and unnecessary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39N5L0X4E8W3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJ8QXC#wasThisHelpful","R39N5L0X4E8W3H","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Relatos Salvajes"" is an audacious collection of short stories from Argentina (English captions) which garnered a ten-minute standing ovation at Cannes and was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. Written and directed by Damián Szifron (lots of Argentinian television), this starts with some memorable wildlife photography, shot with elegance and described by a playful voiceover. This sets the tone.Rather than concentrate on the wonderful actors, I will instead give you hints about the unpredictable (and humorous) short stories; some are shorter (and darker) than others, but none leave you wondering about what happened. This is a refreshing change from many of the short stories we have seen or read. What a treat!  * Let's start with “Pasternak,” or what I call ""Free Ticket."" We meet an assortment of passengers on a commercial airline who are strangers to one another. A sense of discovery is personal to start with and as our suspicions grow, we laugh at the contrived stories. That's all I'll say...  * In ""The Rats"" (""Las Ratas"") we are in a late-night diner where a waitress greets a rude, demanding guest. As WE discover why she becomes so upset, so does the cook...  * “Road to Hell,” or ""El más fuerte"" is one I call ""Road Rage."" A businessman in an upscale car tries to pass a derelict clunker. The driver keeps swerving into his path and frustrating him, so when he finally passes him, he calls him an uncomplimentary name. Everything is fine until he gets a flat tire.  * “Bombita” is one I call ""Tow-Away Zone."" We meet a successful demolitions engineer who is reminded by his wife to pick up a birthday cake on his way home. While in the bakery, his car is towed and our story begins. For anyone who has dealt with an implacable bureaucracy, this one is for you!  * “La Propuesta” or “The Deal,"" I call ""Hit and Run."" An irresponsible teenage driver hits and kills a pedestrian. Here we watch his wealthy family as it maneuvers to keep him out of jail, even as his conscience begins to bother him.  * The final segment (I couldn't find a name for it), I call ""The Wedding Party."" This goofy, hilarious story takes place at a wedding reception. It's obvious that the bride and groom are delirious with joy and the elaborate party is very, very upscale. Just wait until she dials a workman whom her fiancé had called a week or so earlier.You won't recognize most of the faces...maybe Ricardo Darín (""The Secret in Their Eyes"")... as a result it's easier to suspend disbelief, even though this is a brilliant and convincing collection of actors. This film examines the human animal and how it reacts to stressful situations.SEE THIS MOVIE!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IGCR3Y6IPJXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHAJ1AI#wasThisHelpful","R3IGCR3Y6IPJXT","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Submitted by the US to the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival, this documentary celebrates the life and contributions of Caroll Spinney, who has performed ""Big Bird"" and ""Oscar the Grouch"" on Sesame Street for over 40 years.We see his origins (his family believed in home movies!) and hear his tales of early television. For example, when they tried a wireless microphone, long before they were in common use, they didn't realize they had to reserve a band width. Imagine their surprise when, during the show, a CB radio cut in: ""Hey good buddy. That purty little wife of yers is waitin' on you at Exit 18!""We hear of his first marriage, which gave him three much-loved children (who are interviewed for this documentary), then after his divorce, his three futile attempts to meet the girl of his dreams. The story is very funny and is related by HER! On the other hand, we are stunned to see that he was scheduled to fly in the ill-fated space shuttle Challenger in 1986.We see the incredible complexity of working in that costume. Just being a Muppet is highly demanding, but to be Big Bird is even more so. I won't try to describe it; you just have to see it.Working with the brilliant Jim Henson was memorable, but the part that put a lump in my throat was when Big Bird sang ""It's Not Easy Being Green"" in that giant cathedral for Henson's funeral....","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7QE2AI7UT1H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5FX38I#wasThisHelpful","R7QE2AI7UT1H8","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This will be a tough review to write because no matter how I present it, 50% of you will disagree with me. Is Edward Snowden an irresponsible hacker like Julian Assange with WikiLeaks, or is he a patriotic man who is alarmed to see loss of liberties in democratic nations?This R-rated documentary is narrated by a woman who had begun receiving encrypted emails offering evidence of illegal covert surveillance programs run by government agencies. They were signed ""Citizenfour."" Five months later she secretly met with him in Hong Kong, along with reporters Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill of the Guardian. She brought her camera....Here is what jumped out at me:  * Snowden's sole thrust is exposure of governmental overkill; it is not to divulge secret operations, endanger intelligence agents or become personally famous.  * During the early part of the filming (in Hong Kong), he was still anonymous. By the time he gave an example of how monitoring can be done on our phone even when it is in the cradle, we could see that he is careful, not paranoid. He unplugged his phone....  * Back in the United States, his auto pay for his rent stopped working and his girlfriend had five days to move out; utility vans lined the street where she lived.  * Under the Patriot Act, our government and others like ours, can harvest all communications: this includes phone calls (both land- line and cell), E-mails, texts, Tweets, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc., etc... Take a look at the enormous new data storage facility under construction in Utah. (BTW: The UK is even more aggressive than the US.)  * He is angry that Obama made a point of criticizing our government after 9/11, saying that we should never infringe on private citizen's lives unless they were proven security threats, but now, under Obama, surveillance has increased exponentially.  * As soon as his name was divulged, the government wanted an investigation: NOT to discover why it is monitoring its citizens, but to ascertain WHO LEAKED SNOWDEN'S STORY. He insists that HE is not the story, abuse of power is.  * The government has a list of over ONE MILLION American citizens who are currently on the Enemy's List. Snowden was shocked.  * Journalist Glenn Greenwald is at least bilingual. He seems to be sensitive to the security aspects of the project but is also very much an activist when it comes to exposing government surveillance.This isn't the most thrilling documentary I have ever seen, but it is endlessly fascinating. Director Laura Poitras brings us a personable and intelligent young man who impressed me as a patriot. Plus he looks like one of my relatives who is a former Marine and, I would like to think, brave enough to do something similar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N4ANX8X8IZ3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGF9GGO#wasThisHelpful","R3N4ANX8X8IZ3B","A10H47FMW8NHII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10H47FMW8NHII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Across the preindustrial countryside, fortified cities and towns announced the advance of darkness by ringing bells, beating drums, or blowing horns from atop watchtowers, ramparts, and church steeples.” – from AT DAY’S CLOSE'… women in general were not to stray at night. Besides compromising their own virtue, they might sully, through low intrigues, the reputations of honorable men.” – from AT DAY’S CLOSE'Often, in preindustrial homes, iron grates and bars protected windows on the ground floor, prompting frequent comparisons with convents and gaols - 'more like prisons,’ observed a visitor to Madrid, 'than habitations of people at their liberty.’” – from AT DAY’S CLOSE“Amid the darkness, superior storytellers spirited suggestible minds to realms of wonder, far removed from daily hardships … As fires burned low, lucky listeners might be transported by a storyteller’s wizardry to some distant time and place. For a few precious hours, in a dim and drafty cottage, peasants too might become rich, or even lords and ladies.” – from AT DAY’S CLOSE“An absentee planter, (George) Washington expressed alarm over the extent of theft by his slaves, for which he blamed the nighttime 'frolicking‘ of negligent overseers.” – from AT DAY’S CLOSE“To keep gnats at bay, families in the fen country of East Anglia hung lumps of cow dung at the foot of their beds …” – from AT DAY’S CLOSE“Leering husbands, spouses suspected, committed adultery (in their dreams) without once leaving their sides … So suspicious of his visions was (Samuel) Pepys’s wife that she took to feeling his penis while he slept for signs of an erection.” – from AT DAY’S CLOSEAT DAY’S CLOSE is author Roger Ekirch’s examination of that time in pre-industrial Europe between sunset and sunrise when there were no light switches to flick – when the only source of illumination was a flame, i.e. a candle, flaming torch, or fire in the hearth.Divided into four parts, Ekirch’s prodigiously researched book – sixty-eight pages of Notes – profiles nighttime as a period notable for danger and violence, as an environment that called for personal and official adaptation, as a singular interval for work and play, and as an opportunity for private reflection, prayer, love, and, ultimately, slumber either blessed or otherwise.What some might see as an esoteric topic is developed by the author into a full-fledged, scholarly, and satisfyingly lucid presentation. His only fault in the process is perhaps to belabor the point of the moment he's making with an overuse of references and quotes from his primary sources – those sixty-eight pages of Notes. At times, my reaction to such an approach was to think: “OK, I get it. Let’s move on!”  Some judicious editing would’ve improved the whole, I think.Whatever the reader might think of AT DAY’S CLOSE, it does indeed effectively drive home the realization that nighttime back in the day was a milieu rarely experienced by today’s developed societies unless a power plant worker drops a wrench and crashes a grid, or one lives in, say, North Korea; and the reader may recall, as I do, the sung lines:'I thank the Lord for the night timeTo forget the dayA day of up, uptight timeBaby, chase it away” – lyrics to THANK THE LORD FOR THE NIGHT TIME by Neil Diamond","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MGUZ1LYY7CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393329011#wasThisHelpful","R39MGUZ1LYY7CI","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‟In Northern Ireland, the term ""supergrass"" especially refers to arrested paramilitaries who divulged the identities of their compatriots to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, possibly in exchange for immunity from prosecution.” – from Wikipedia“Someone who betrays a confidence. To squeal, to tell tales, to inform the police of illegal activities.” – the definition of “tout” from The Urban DictionaryI thought I was more or less caught up on Gerald Seymour’s thrillers, but somehow to date I had missed FIELD OF BLOOD first published in 1985. Or perhaps I have read it in the distant past and forgotten; getting old with the attendant risk of senile dementia isn’t for the faint of heart.When published, the author’s books are always contemporary with the world’s tension spots. So, for example, the recent The Corporal's Wife is set against the backdrop of Iran’s nuclear program. FIELD OF BLOOD is framed around The Troubles in Northern Ireland during the first half of the 80s. How many less than forty years old even know what that was all about?Characteristic of Seymour’s novels is the fact that the characters, both major and minor, aren’t stunningly good or evil, just average folks in the wrong place at the wrong time while adhering to a particular cause or philosophy and facing off over it. There are no clear victories, and any apparent victory is pyrrhic in nature. Of course, the reader will take a side and assign “antagonist” and “protagonist” appropriately.Here in FIELD OF BLOOD, the most sympathetic protagonist is 1st Lieutenant David Ferris of the Royal Fusiliers, currently rotating through Belfast on the Army’s continuing counterterrorist mission.  The chief antagonist, perhaps also someone for whom the reader can feel sympathy, is Sean McAnally, a Provo fighter reluctantly returning from a self-imposed “retirement” in the Irish Republic on the demand of the Chief of the Provo’s Belfast Brigade to do what no one else on call can do, i.e. take out a hated judge with a rocket propelled grenade.Sean succeeds in his attack, but is then arrested by the Royal Ulster Constabulary on a stroke of pure luck. Pressured by Detective Chief Inspector Howard of the RUC, and facing a long stretch in prison, McAnally goes supergrass. His statements allow the RUC and the Army to roll-up almost the entirety of the Belfast Brigade’s command hierarchy.From two chance encounters in the field, Ferris has, oddly enough, earned McAnally’s trust, and the former is used by Rennie to keep the latter from backing out of the deal given him by Her Majesty’s government in return for the testimony he’ll be expected to give in court.The Catholic population of West Belfast reviles Sean as a tout. The remnants of the local Provo organization will do just about anything to stop him from taking the witness stand.Sean’s decision to go supergrass sends ripples throughout the personal and professional lives of characters on both sides. And that’s what FIELD OF BLOOD is all about. It’s a gritty look at a bad time in a tortured place worth reading many years after The Troubles.I never cease to be amazed at the author’s ability to create so many distinct personalities on both sides of the conflict at hand. It’s as if he’s encountered them all in real life and taken good notes.Here, as usual, victory – if the reader accepts such occurring at all – is pyrrhic. Life is like that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BMOZQLWZADD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444760157#wasThisHelpful","R2BMOZQLWZADD8","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""… I may be old, but I'm still who I always was. I'm the sniper."" - Bob Lee Swagger""Everyone loves to hate the Nazis, bad boys of a hundred thousand silly plots."" - from SNIPER'S HONOR (with an emphasis on ""silly"")So, here in SNIPER'S HONOR by Stephen Hunter, we have his ex-Marine sniper uber hero, Bob Lee Swagger (""Bob the Nailer""), enduring old age and declining health on the front porch of his homestead in rural Idaho. Bob is bored to tears. Then he receives an attention-getting email from a Washington Post correspondent pal currently posted to Moscow which ultimately sends Swagger off on a knight-errant quest to salvage the memory of an extraordinarily gifted, female, Red Army sniper, Ludmilla Petrova, who disappeared without a trace in the closing stages of World War II on the Eastern Front. It doesn't hurt that an existing photo of the woman reveals her to have been blonde and gorgeous rather than one who could pull a Five Year Plan tractor from the mud without horses. Sniper's honor be damned; perhaps old Bob the Nailer is just smitten. You think?The bulk of the story takes place in flashback as the reader follows Mili's heroic wartime career shooting Nazis, which is unbelievable and, as the basis for a Bob Lee Swagger adventure, patently ridiculous. Of course, the author also has to endanger his hero in the here and now, and therefore introduces an even sillier subplot involving mysterious platinum purchases that get Mossad's shorts all in a twist. Oh, puhleeze!I haven't read more than two previous Swagger thrillers, so my acquaintance with the man in his prime is much less than other reviewers who see SNIPER'S HONOR as too undignified an end for one who has served honorably and shame on the author.  But even from that relatively detached perspective, this book strikes me as something Hunter had to slop out to meet contractual obligations to the publisher rather than a work of love.If Bob Lee has to go down, then it should be in a blaze of gunfire and with a two-hankie ceremony at Arlington. Honor and a dignified exit are due even fictional superheroes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVFA2SSWB6UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NICV0OC#wasThisHelpful","R2JVFA2SSWB6UB","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But make no mistake, it's the backstory occupying the first couple hundred pages that makes the whole a superlative work of military history. Now I feel I have as complete an understanding of the battle and what led up to it as a casual student of World War II could hope to have.The book (necessarily) begins with the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by the Kido Butai, the Japanese Navy's mobile carrier force commanded by Admiral Yamamoto, i.e. the effect this attack had on the fighting assets subsequently available to the U.S. Navy. Moving on in examining the next six months leading to the Midway confrontation, Symonds considers the nature and strategic bent of the two opposing navies, their commanders, their ships and planes, the men that flew the latter, and the preliminary skirmishes (if they can be called such): the American carrier raids on the Marshalls and Gilberts islands in February 1942 and the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942.Once the main act gets underway and evolves to a conclusion that was remarkably different than what the Japanese planners had envisioned, the reader can perhaps not but be struck by the apparent triviality of circumstances which were key to the outcome of the battle, e.g. the delayed take-off of a Japanese scout plane and the wake generated by a Japanese destroyer as it proceeded at flank speed to catch up with its task force; that old saw about the loss of a horseshoe nail to the survival of a kingdom comes to mind.The maneuvers of opposing armies across a landscape relative to rivers, towns, hills, or enemy entrenchments are simple to describe and map compared to ship and plane movements across a featureless ocean. One of the strengths of the BATTLE OF MIDWAY narrative is the author's skill at doing just that. At no time was I confused. The thirteen included maps are clearly rendered and invaluable.There were two other aspects of the chronicle that stood out for me, though I doubt that effect was intended by Symonds. One was the complete ineptitude of the commander of the U.S.S. Hornet's air group; one wonders how he continued up the promotion ladder to vice-admiral as his career progressed. Really? The second was the casual and appalling brutality inflicted on a few downed American pilots fished out of the sea by the Japanese, e.g. in one instance, two airmen, after being interrogated by their captors, had weights tied to their legs and they were tossed back into the ocean.Was the outcome of the Battle of Midway based on better luck or abilities? For me, it came down to the former. But good luck is a part of life (or not), and if it gets me home safe at the end of the day, I'll take it.THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY is a must-read for anyone interested in the Pacific War of World War II.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L0UVJFYR5GRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199315981#wasThisHelpful","R2L0UVJFYR5GRL","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Shirley MacLaine's The Camino: A Journey of the Spirit, loosely billed as an account of her walk from St. Jean to Santiago ... is a book so mad it howls at the moon, a book that with any name on its cover but that of a Hollywood legend would have had orderlies with soft, placatory smiles knocking on the author's door ...

It was, indeed, his pilgrimage too."" - from TRAVELS WITH MY DONKEY, as the author and Shinto stand atop the famous pilgrimage milestoneIn 2004, for no particular reason related to piety, author Tim Moore decided to make the venerable east to west pilgrimage across the width of northern Spain starting at Valcarlos and ending at Santiago de Campostela at the enshrined (supposed) remains of the apostle Saint James. Not wishing to carry his stuff all 466 miles, Moore decides to pack it in with a donkey. Thus Shinto, an ultimately endearing 200 kilogram package of obstinacy, phobias, and more or less stoic forbearance.The books biggest flaw is the lack of any photos - especially photos of ""Shints"" - even though the author makes multiple references to pictures taken. I had to go to the Web to retrieve a color snap of Tim and his faithful companion which I printed, trimmed, and pasted into the book for the benefit of its next owner. Shinto bears little resemblance to the donkey portrayed on the volume's front cover.As a lapsed Catholic and in the face of life's day-to-day responsibilities, Moore's 41-day trudge seemed an enormous waste of time. However, that doesn't prevent a feeling of reluctant admiration for one who'd actually do it, especially while pushing, pulling, and cajoling livestock all the way. After all, Tim produced an engaging and humorous narrative about the experience which provided several days of chuckles. And I did appreciate the author's comments about Shirley MacLaine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PDE165D4XTEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312320833#wasThisHelpful","R3PDE165D4XTEK","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“'I thought that if (Farideh) was brought out of Iran she would be far from everything she knew and would come back to me, that I would be her rock. It was to win her that I asked you to bring her. The hope that she would learn here to love me.’ He held back the tears.” – the corporal, in THE CORPORAL’S WIFE""Play up! Play up! And play the game!"" - Victorian era writer Sir Henry NewboltMehrak is a corporal in the shadowy al-Qods brigade of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and the permanent driver assigned to the powerful Brigadier Reza Joyberi, who has oversight responsibilities over his country’s nuclear program. Mehrak has seen and heard a lot. So, when he’s caught in an MI6 honey trap in Dubai after completing a personal errand for the Brigadier, the British Secret Service realizes they’ve ensnared an information source valuable enough to buy them a seat at the head table with the American and Israeli intelligence agencies.The corporal is spirited off to a safe house in Austria where he’s tended to by an interrogator and three minders. Shortly thereafter, Mehrak broods about the state of his marriage with Farideh, who detests him. Perhaps, he thinks, he can patch things up if she joins him. Thus, the ultimatum to his MI6 handlers: “If I cannot have my wife, I will go back.”As an information source, Mehrak is top drawer, so the mandarin on the Iran Desk at Vauxhall Cross, correctly fearing that Farideh might soon be arrested, mounts a shoot-from-the-hip extraction of her from Tehran.Farideh means “precious.”In common with all other Gerald Seymour thrillers, the plot of THE CORPORAL’S WIFE is both topically relevant with contemporary global conflicts or areas of tension and populated with a large cast of deftly portrayed characters, none of whom would fall into the popular super-hero status but are, for the most part, simple soldiers or mercenaries, mid-level government or law enforcement functionaries, or just ordinary working folks, all caught up in a bad spot. Indeed, in the main cast list of about a dozen in THE CORPORAL’S WIFE, the chief male protagonist is Zach Becket, an English Midlands construction laborer who also happens to be of Persian descent and phenomenally talented with Farsi and who attracts the attention of the MI6 Iran Desk when suddenly needing somebody to have a go at scoring one for Queen, country and St. George.This novel also perpetuates the author’s apparent worldview that a decisive win in any international intrigue is a nebulous concept and the outcome is more apt to be a Pyrrhic victory or a near draw for both sides. THE CORPORAL’S WIFE exhibits this characteristic of Seymour’s plotting more than in most of his past releases, I think. One certain outcome here, however, is that General George Patton’s words “all glory is fleeting” are realized. In real life, one needs to look no further than the abrupt downfall of U.S. General David Petraeus as an abject example.My only complaint with THE CORPORAL’S WIFE is perhaps that the author tried to wring-out of a couple of characters more than was needed to provide the reader with a satisfying whole. Sometimes, less is more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JK6X3F1AQL6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444758551#wasThisHelpful","R2JK6X3F1AQL6E","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Sir, madam, you need the red door, I believe."" – from PERSONAL, the uniformed steward as Reacher and Miss Nice disembark from a Royal Air Force Gulfstream“It’s not the same with a sniper out here.” – from PERSONALIn the long progression of full-length Jack Reacher thrillers by Lee Child, PERSONAL is, in my estimation, one of the best.Here, a very long-distance sniper's shot almost takes down the President of France; only bullet-proof glass saves his life. One among the small number of suspects thought capable of such marksmanship skill is an ex-U.S. Special Forces soldier, John Kott, sent to a 15-year stint in the brig by ex-Army M.P. Reacher back in the day. It's now sixteen years later and Kott is out and thought to be preparing to shoot again at an upcoming G8 summit in London. Jack is persuaded to foil the plot and take Kott down - for good. But John's malicious intent is more than it seems on the surface; it's personal.Unusual for a Reacher adventure, our hero is assigned a constant side-kick, Casey Nice, which is a … um, nice touch. Casey is a CIA operative on temp loan to the State Department. Or is it the other way around? It's complicated.Once Jack and Casey hit the ground in London, there's the shadowy Welshman, Bennett, with an unpronounceable first name. Bennett is perhaps MI6. Or maybe SAS. It's complicated.Then there's Little Joey, most assuredly the physically biggest Bad Guy Reacher has ever gone up against. If the two face-off in hand-to-hand combat, it could be a close-run thing for our Jack.But the best feature of the PERSONAL story line is watching Reacher perceive and deduce the identity of the master puppeteer behind the intrigue to arrive at a conclusion that the reader wouldn't expect though all the clues are there to see beginning with the ostensible mission of the 50-caliber bullet let fly at the French President and the time it took to reach its target. The reader will just be having too much fun going with the flow of the story to give them much thought. That, to me, is indicative of a good read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBV4N4UHXQI9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178747#wasThisHelpful","RBV4N4UHXQI9M","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""FOOFARAW: a disturbance or to-do over a trifle"" - from the Merriam-Webster on-line dictionary""Science is not a democracy"" - from THE PLUTO FILESThe recent fly-by of Pluto by the New Horizons spacecraft rekindled whatever residual interest remained in me from growing up in the 50s and 60s when the place was presented to impressionable minds as a cold, dark planet at the edge of the solar system about which little could be said. Ok, whatever. After all, it was the ""John Carter of Mars"" book series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, not ""John Carter of Pluto."" So, for me, an avid reader even back then, it was hard to care.In May 1996, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, author of THE PLUTO FILES, was formally appointed Director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. One of his first responsibilities was to serve as the project scientist for the design and construction of the Rose Center for Earth and Space, the home of a refurbished and re-conceived planetarium.When it opened in February 2000, the Rose Center presented the objects in our Solar System as families of objects with similar properties. The traditional ""planets"" weren't counted-up as such, and Pluto was relegated to the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune as a ""trans-Neptunian"" ice ball with a de-emphasized planetary status. The fact of this downgrade was reported by the New York Times in January 2001 and all astrophysical hell broke loose.Although the Center's final design was a committee decision, Tyson found himself at the sharp point of the excoriation for Pluto's relegation to the celestial doghouse. THE PLUTO FILES is Neil's narrative of the uncomfortable experience and appraisal of the controversy told against the backstory of Pluto's discovery in 1930 by an American amateur astronomer and the subsequent hold that world (as the ""ninth planet"") achieved on the United States' communal psyche.From a previous reading of the Tyson's Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries, I knew the author to be erudite, lucid, literate, and congenial. THE PLUTO FILES exhibits these traits as well as a wry humor. All in conjunction make for an enormously appealing read.Perhaps the author's biggest service in writing this book is to provide a telling example of the reality that scientists in any field, ostensibly dealing with the observable traits and facts of our physical universe, will fight like cats in a sack over ego-connected ""truths"" about which they differ. That can be, in itself, an entertaining blood sport for the non-aligned observer. For that reason, THE PLUTO FILES is praiseworthy entertainment.Pluto is what it is and where it is regardless of all the fuss. Since these two facts do nothing to help me perform my job, pay my bills, or deal with encroaching, age-related health maladies, I personally don't have a dog in the fight for calling it a planet, an ice-ball, or (in deference to our three cats) a cosmic fur ball. And I suspect that a survey of all U.S. citizens on the question would demonstrate a plurality of ""Don't Care."" But it's still fascinating to see the photos sent back by New Horizons that stimulate the imagination. Now that's an American space accomplishment the survey responders should be proud of!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V0J64Y7WQZZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393350363#wasThisHelpful","R1V0J64Y7WQZZA","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""But always will I remember Old Edinburgh in the evening ... I like to linger on the hill in the dark, where winds whistle like swords and darkness creeps with an air of conspiracy."" - from IN SEARCH OF SCOTLAND""Many a wild Highlander at that time in Edinburgh with his chieftain must have heard stories about (Mary, Queen of Scots), how she bathed her body in wine, how you could see her riding her horse full tilt for the gates with her court far behind scattered like a hunting field over the 'Royal Mile'; how sometimes on dark nights you might meet her stealing through the streets hiding her beauty beneath a manly cloak ... Perhaps a curtain would be pulled aside and this Highlander would see her for a second against the candlelight, with pearls shining in her hair. And he would ride his shaggy pony north through wild gorges, thinking of this queen, taking with him something of her beauty, her strangeness, her remoteness from anything Scotland had ever known, home to a lonely stone hut in the heart of the hills. So she became a legend at the age of eighteen ..."" - from IN SEARCH OF SCOTLAND""... in the mountains of Scotland the moonlight has a sharper edge to it. It suggests not the amusing playful fairies of the Saxon but the witch and the warlock of the Celt. If you did see a fairy by Scotch moonlight it would be on its way to steal a baby."" - from IN SEARCH OF SCOTLAND""The piper in a city street is a misfortune, but pipers marching with the wind over a hill send blood to the head and make fingers itch for a sword. The bagpipe is the voice of the claymore. It sings the song of the sword: the sword drooping from dying fingers, the sword flashing in battle, the sword whistling in triumph, the sword sheathed in failure."" - from IN SEARCH OF SCOTLANDFirst published in 1929, IN SEARCH OF SCOTLAND is Henry Vollam Morton's travel essay on Scotland based on his driving tour of it.Morton's output as a travel writer was positively prodigious. Yet, after having read only two of his other books, In Search Of England (1927) and In Search of London (1951), plus this one, I am struck by his extravagant use of superlatives and the word ""most."" One might be tempted to whisper the aside that he might've achieved a more balanced perspective by getting out more. But the thing is, you see, he did; his wide-ranging travel narratives span five decades.One result of the enthusiasm with which Morton writes might be the frisson of delight one experiences when reading his exquisitely descriptive prose that occasionally attains the sublime.In SEARCH OF SCOTLAND, the author is particularly fascinated by Mary, Queen of Scots and Bonnie Prince Charlie, and the last chapter is almost entirely dedicated to Robert Burns.The paramount highlights of Morton's own journey were apparently climbing Ben Nevis and the time spent on the Isle of Skye. Having visited Skye myself on one of several auto tours, I must agree with the words of the captain of the ferry that transported him there: ""Weel - ye'll come back."" Skye is indeed a magical place (though perhaps a bit less so now that the Skye Bridge carries the A87 across from the mainland to the Isle causing the closure of the venerable Kyleakin Ferry).And, finally, as evidence of what a Renaissance Man the author was - he died in 1997 - IN SEARCH OF SCOTLAND includes his own recipe for Scotch Broth (""that divine brew""), the ability to make he would confer on all brides to insure domestic bliss. (I guess back in the day Campbell's Chunky soups just wouldn't do.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0SCD350SWVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=041354480X#wasThisHelpful","R1Z0SCD350SWVZ","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""... but who wants tidy?"" - Jonah, in THE AGENT RUNNER""After four years of secret meetings, they behaved towards each other with the sly hostility of a long-married couple."" - from THE AGENT RUNNERThe Great Game historically refers to the century-long conflict beginning in 1813 between the British Empire and Russia over control of Central Asia, and particularly Afghanistan, which Britain sought to establish as a buffer between Russia and India, which Russia coveted. Embedded in The Great Game were the First, Second, and Third Anglo-Afghan Wars which caused no end of aggravation for the Empire.The United Kingdom is still involved in the region, principally as an ally of the United States in their joint war against al-Qaeda entrenched in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and, most annoyingly, in that part of the latter known as the ""tribal areas"". You would think Pakistan would be an ally to the Anglo-Americans. You would think. In THE AGENT RUNNER by Simon Conway, the notion is put forward that since Pakistan doesn't want Afghanistan aligned with India, the preference of some powerful Pakistanis may be to keep the Afghans in turmoil by keeping al-Qaeda and the Taliban in play. At least, in this novel, that's the approach of a principle character, Major General Avid Khan of Pakistan's ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence).In previous spy thrillers by Conway, A Loyal Spy and Rage, the reader was introduced to the MI6 operative Jonah Said, of Black and Palestinian heritage (and born in California, no less). Here, in THE AGENT RUNNER, the author's edgy protagonist and next-in-line MI6 hero is Edward Malik of Asian and Muslim background. The United Kingdom has gone multicultural and its spies perhaps don't even drink martini cocktails anymore, shaken or stirred. What would ""M"" think?Ed is an agent runner whose asset of the moment is Tariq Mahoon informing from within the ISI. But Tariq is sacrificed to the Pakistani intelligence agency by the Americans in their single-minded zeal to capture Osama bin Laden, and now Malik wants revenge against the ISI officer that summarily executed him. That's after physically assaulting the CIA's Head-of-Station in Kabul. A dodgy career move, that.Jonah appears occasionally in THE AGENT RUNNER as an aide to Samantha Burns (""Queen Bee""), the MI6 mandarin moving the pawns about the board in this deliciously complex and Machiavellian story of personal manipulation, betrayal and, ostensibly, tidying-up. But the story is Ed's show and an engrossing debut for the character.Conway's novels to date, including this one, remind me of those by Gerald Seymour in that a win arrived at by the last page isn't assured or clear cut. Rather, the winner is the one who comes out the least damaged. That, to me, is more like real life and will likely make me a reader of anything the author pens in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OPFN6BAULKYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVD7AQA#wasThisHelpful","R1OPFN6BAULKYT","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Why, you don't even have to be a Jane Austen fan to appreciate it!The book's chapters progress through life as one might experience it: Wedding Bells, Breeding, Toddler to Teenager, Home and Hearth, Fashions and Filth, Sermons and Superstitions, Wealth and Work, Leisure and Pleasure, On the Move, Dark Deeds, Medicine Men, and Last Words.JANE AUSTEN'S ENGLAND is liberally sprinkled with quotes from primary sources including many from Jane Austen's own letters as well as two other contemporary contributors, diarist and vicar William Holland (1746-1819), and diarist and clergyman James Woodforde (1740-1803).Although I didn't find either to be particularly necessary to supplement the text, the authors include a listing of weights and measures then vs. now and a ""Chronological Overview"" (from 1860 to 1817). There are also several maps of England (including ""Jane Austen Territory"", ""William Holland Territory"", and ""James Woodforde Territory"") and a 1797 London city map.JANE AUSTEN'S ENGLAND provides an engaging look at the period lived by the author of Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and Northanger Abbey.

"The wife is dedicated to keeping the central heating thermostat set at 68 degrees, but she wanders the house in sweats during the winter. On the other hand, my year-round, off-the-time clock wardrobe is walking shorts and a T-shirt, which is sometimes insufficient for warmth when in front of the computer. My previous space heater, habitually placed in the desk's foot well, died with a pop and the smell of charred insulation after many years of service. RIP.The VORNADO VH101 is, um ... cute. Its controls are the ultimate in simplicity. One red button for On/Off, and one black button with three settings: Low Heat (‒), Fan only, High Heat (=).Underneath my desk, the heater is totally inadequate, perhaps because the space is too large. It only works reasonably well if it sits on my desk blowing High Heat air directly onto my upper torso from about 18 inches away. The Low Heat setting is too anemic even at that distance.There are four ""Advanced Safety Features"":Tight Grill Spirals. True enough ‒ I doubt even an infant could poke an exploratory finger through the grill, though that same precocious child playing with a knitting needle could probably cause trouble.Cool Touch Case. True again, especially the top, back and sides. The case edges around the grill itself warm up slightly more, but hardly enough to cause comment or deduct points.Automatic Safety Shut Off System (""If airflow becomes blocked, power to the heating element is shut off to prevent overheating."") Was that the WRONG ANSWER! buzzer I just heard? I draped a handy cat bed over the entire device and it just kept on blowing heated air. Perhaps draping an actual cat ‒ we have three to choose from ‒ might've successfully activated this feature.Automatic Tip-Over Protection (""If tipped more than 10 degrees in any direction, heat and fan functions immediately shut down."") It actually seems more like about 1 degree, especially if tipped forward. In practice, this demands the heater be on an absolutely flat and level surface. I guess this means I can't shove the thing under my T to get the full warming experience.So, in conclusion, the VORNADO VH101 works just OK under narrow operating conditions.

"Like its predecessor (Short Fuses (Four free short stories)) of a couple years back, MORE SHORT FUSES is essentially a convenient and relatively easy vehicle for author Stephen Leather to promote his massive body of fiction produced over the past couple of decades. The man is a writing machine.The first half of this e-book is comprised of four short stories that will give the reader an excellent introduction to Stephen's writing style and the flavor of his fiction. The second half is simply the first chapter of five previously-published novels to get you hooked into acquiring and reading the whole of each. OK, so this is blatantly self-serving but, I ask you, what's a poor, starving thriller writer supposed to do short of going door-to-door like a high school kid hawking magazine subscriptions?The first short, ""Rules of Engagement"", features the author's ongoing, serialized super-hero, Dan ""Spider Shepherd, the ex-SAS trooper now working for MI-5. The last two, ""Ghost Kids"" and ""Massage Therapy"", reflect the author's immersion into the country of his expat residency ‒ Thailand. The second, ""The Constituency Meeting"", is reminiscent of his early novels of the 90s (before creating the Shepherd character), each of which was a one-off tale and some might say is perhaps the best stuff Leather ever wrote simply because the plots were so imaginative and so varied. (The first I ever read, The Chinaman, was the one that got me hooked.)If, like me, you've read almost all of Stephen's full-length novels, then MORE SHORT FUSES can simply be deleted from your e-reader after finishing the four shorts, all of which are diverting entertainment.

Grant intentionally made his headquarters in the field with the Army of the Potomac commanded by Major General George Meade. Grant's intent was to oversee the pursuit and defeat of General Lee and his army by Meade's force. This represented a sea change in the use of the latter by the Federal government; up to that point, the Army of the Potomac's chief mission had been to shield Washington, D.C.THE LAST FULL MEASURE tells the story of the last twenty-one months of the war from the perspectives of Grant, Lee, and Colonel (then Brig. General) Joshua Chamberlain, whose 20th Maine regiment staunchly held the left of the Union line on Little Round Top on the second day of Gettysburg. There are, additionally, single cameo appearances by Union Major General Winfield Scott Hancock and Confederate generals Longstreet, Stuart, and Gordon. As portrayed by Shaara, all - particularly Grant, Lee and Chamberlain - are soldiers to whom the utmost honor is due for their services to their respective causes.Broadly viewed, the narrative encompasses Grant's Overland Campaign, the Union siege of Petersburg, and Lee's final retreat to the west. More specifically, it includes long or short summaries of the Battle of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, Lee's defense at the North Anna River, Cold Harbor, the Battle of the Crater, the Confederate attack on Fort Stedman, Gravelly Run, Five Forks, and Appomattox.This is the third of Jeff Shaara's historical novels about the Civil War I've read, and I have two more on the shelf that I contemplate reading and savoring ' A Chain of Thunder: A Novel of the Siege of Vicksburg (the Civil War in the West) and The Smoke at Dawn: A Novel of the Civil War (the Civil War in the West), both dealing with the Civil War's western theater.Except for Shelby Foote's The Civil War A Narrative Complete 3 Volume Set (Fort Sumter to Perryville, Fredericksburg to Meridian, Red River to Appomattox), I can think of no other volumes on the topic that I've enjoyed as much as (Jeff) Shaara's. Perceiving the conflict as the author does through the eyes of his main characters, the reader is afforded an understanding of the Civil War not usually realized in purely historical accounts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOFMN0DOYS14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VR5FYY#wasThisHelpful","RUOFMN0DOYS14","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Tis the season to be jolly"" ‒ lyrics from the 1862 carol ""Deck the Halls""Because of three housecats and the potential for self-expression of their dark sides, we've gone years without putting up a Christmas tree with all the begging-for-trouble ornaments and twinkles. (One year years ago, we put up tinsel and pine cones on the fireplace mantle and this festive display turned ugly early one morning. I remember the sleep-wrecking crash as if it was only yesterday.)I could easily have remained in a ""Bah-Humbug!"" funk over the holidays, but the wife wanted something to show the neighbors that we're not completely Scrooge-like. So, this year we acquired and mounted outside the front bay windows (and beyond the reach of Amanda, Sissy and Rags) the 36"" LED FOLDING TWINKLE SNOWFLAKE CHRISTMAS DECORATION.The decoration, designed on a substantial plastic frame as a radially symmetric, six-armed snowflake, comes so cleverly folded in its shipping box that I first thought I'd received only part of it. Unfolded, the frame measures 35.5 inches across at the ends of opposing arms. The frame is stabilized in the open position by plastic clamps, which don't seem to snap into place all that securely and make me doubt that the fully opened frame would be all that robust in the face of anything other than gentle handling.104 or 105 LED lights are distributed over the decoration (depending on who's doing the counting, me or my wife), 15 of which blink at half-second intervals. The fifteen blinkers are distributed around the six arms in a 3-2-3-2-3-2 pattern and are a very pale blue in color. The non-blinkers are a cold white.Seen from the street, the twinkling snowflake presents an attractive display that might lead the passer-by to assume that I'm truly into the season's theme. However, it's the wife that already has plans to expand the spectacle to an ostentatious trio of flakes next year.The cats, wretched creatures that they are, don't even give the snowflake a second glance.

Ho!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6IQXS90TXYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0069SI6HG#wasThisHelpful","R1U6IQXS90TXYI","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INTO THE WOODS, the film, is Disney's production of the live musical of the same title (which, by the way, I have not seen and am uninfluenced by its success). It is, essentially, a synthesis of four Grimm Brothers' fairy tales ‒ Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Jack and the Beanstalk ‒ into a larger fantasy stage managed, so to speak, by the ""witch next door"" to the village Baker and the Baker's Wife.The film's first half, corresponding to Act 1 of the play, is clever enough to be almost-brilliant. The best performances in this half are by Meryl Streep as The Witch, Lilla Crawford as an edgy Little Red Riding Hood, and Johnny Depp's all too brief appearance as The Wolf. And the marital interaction between The Baker (James Corden) and The Baker's Wife (Emily Blunt) is nicely nuanced and should be familiar to anybody in the audience who's married.Had Disney ended the film at the halfway point, which it easily could've, I would've awarded 4 or 5 stars. But, nooooo!The second half, corresponding to the play's Act 2, is a complete muddle ‒ an attempt at an extended morality play that was painfully awkward to watch. Sometimes you have to know when to cut your losses and quit. Nearing the end of INTO THE WOODS, I for one was tempted to just walk out. Disney's writers, when adapting the original script to the Big Screen, certainly should've at the lunch break had they had any sense of company tradition.I can't imagine what the tradition-rich Disney Studio perceived as its target audience for this film; it's too dark for the kids, and adults may find it, at the end, to have been simply contrived to the point of stupidity (Well, the obvious target audience is that which liked the stage play. But that doesn't explain why Disney Studios should necessarily take it on. Walt Disney has to be rolling in his grave.)Perhaps my generation that grew up with Disney productions since the 1950s might and should expect better. Personally taking that viewpoint is my only dog in the fight.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K64WGFXFQ2QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RFHUSN0#wasThisHelpful","R3K64WGFXFQ2QB","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Her black and silver dress is turning into moonlit ripples on the water, and her hands are covered in scales. She turns and gives me a triumphant smile, or maybe she is just baring her teeth."" ‒ from THE FRANGIPANI HOTEL, short story ""Reception""THE FRANGIPANI HOTEL by the young Vietnamese-American author Violet Kupersmith is a collection of short stories set either in post-war Vietnam or the United States. The main characters are either Vietnam-born or the children of Vietnamese who expatriated to the States. All the stories have an otherworldly edge.Other reviewers have complained that the tales contained herein aren't scary enough. Piffle! Granted, none of the shorts in THE FRANGIPANI HOTEL are truly scary; most are creepy, a couple are disturbing, and one is mostly just sad. However, sometimes less is more. For example, the film The Exorcist was scary with a capital ""S"", but The Others [HD] was just creepy. But, I liked the latter more for its subtlety. So too, here.In the book's ""About the Author"" paragraph, one learns that Kupersmith is working on her first novel. I gather that the short stories in THE FRANGIPANI HOTEL were writing exercises to refine her writing skills. Not all are polished; a couple seemed somewhat awkward in concept. However, the breadth of Violet's imagination and raw talent is apparent, and I'm open to buying and reading her first novel when it's published.I particularly liked the short story ""Descending Dragon"" for its sad depiction of one growing old and lonely far from home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2192HCF1RGZJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993314#wasThisHelpful","R2192HCF1RGZJR","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In actuality, it wasn't much, though his references to some of the battlefield's main monuments are enlightening and not something to be found in the Guelzo volume. That said, HALLOWED GROUND is a concise summary of the Gettysburg battle which would serve well as an introduction to a more comprehensive understanding or simply as a short-version narrative of the affair for someone wishing only to skim the topic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PF4B5FPYL01L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0609610236#wasThisHelpful","R2PF4B5FPYL01L","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In this case with DO NOT PASS GO, I did so without any knowledge of the title's significance. You see, I've never played Monopoly in my life. Not even once. I'd never even seen the playing board before calling up on the Web a photo of the game's standard UK edition for the purpose of this review. Such statements by author Tim Moore such as the one immediately below left me pathetically uncomprehending:""Criminal psychologists and addiction counsellors could save a lot of time by scrapping all that blather about personality profiles and upbringing in place of a single yes or no question: have you ever landed on a Park Lane hotel and then rolled a double one?""Moore's love - well ok, obsession - with the game inspired this travel narrative, a walking tour of London determined by the squares on the periphery of the (UK) playing board. For those unacquainted with this version of the game, the squares are:King's Cross - a mainline rail terminusThe Purples - Pall Mall, Whitehall, Northumberland Ave.Free Parking - virtually impossible to find in LondonThe Yellows - Leicester Square, Coventry Street, PiccadillyGo To Jail - for Tim, Her Majesty's Prison PentonvilleThe Oranges - Bow Street, Marlborough Street, Vine StreetWater Works - for Tim, the Crossness Southern Outfall WorksThe (Other) Stations - Liverpool Street, Fenchurch Street, MaryleboneThe Reds - Strand, Fleet Street, Trafalgar SquareThe Light Blues - The Angel (Islington), Euston Road, Pentonville RoadElectric Company - for Tim, the Lots Road Power Station (shut down in October 2002)The Greens - Regent Street, Oxford Street, Bond StreetThe Dark Blues - Park Lane, MayfairThe Browns - Old Kent Road, Whitechapel RoadLucky for me, the author spends only minimal text referring to actual Monopoly play. Rather, with the same dry wit and self-deprecating humor displayed in You are Awful (But I Like You: Travels Around Unloved Britain and I Believe In Yesterday: My Living Hell in Living History, Tim's book comprises an entertaining and informative tour of the locations he visits and walks through.I would never have to come up with an excuse to visit London; I'd just go, even if the price was to eat a helping of jellied eels when I arrived. That said, DO NOT PASS GO compels me (next time) to walk Oxford Street and penetrate into the heart of Mayfair, neither of which I've bothered to do on a multitude of previous visits for no reason that I can think of at the moment. And Moore's excellent account just as certainly makes me determined to avoid the Old Kent Road as a rewarding destination.Any travel essay that leaves me with unambiguous feelings about the topic has done its job and DO NOT PASS GO meets and exceeds this standard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TTMWO2N1K3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099433869#wasThisHelpful","R2TTMWO2N1K3V","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Jupiter Best and Greatest, protect this legion, soldiers all."" ‒ according to CAESAR'S LEGION, the Legionary's Prayer""The eagle of the (Tenth) legion, silver at this time, gold by imperial times, was venerated by its legionaries. Kept at an altar in camp with lamps burning throughout the night, it and the ground it stood on were considered sacred. Conveyance and protection of the eagle were the tasks of the men of the 1st Cohort, but it was the obligation of every soldier in the legion to defend it with his life."" ‒ from CAESAR'S LEGION.CAESAR'S LEGION by Stephen Dando-Collins, with the subtitle of ""The Epic Saga of Julius Caesar's Elite Tenth Legion and the Armies of Rome"", could just as well, I think, be subtitled ""Highlights of the Tenth Legion's Service during Transition from Roman Republic to Early Imperium (61 B.C. - 73 A.D.)."" On a wider scale, the book is a sometimes detailed but mostly cursory history of the Tenth Legion from its founding by Julius Caesar in the Spanish Roman province of Baetica in 61 B.C. to its disappearance from history no later than 636 A.D. when the Muslims invaded Byzantine Syria.In CAESAR'S LEGION, the history of the Tenth is more a history of its association with the various Roman strongmen that controlled its movements from 61 B.C. to 73 A.D.: Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, and the generals Corbulo, Vespasian, Titus, and Silva. When a battle is being fought and the Tenth is there, then that legion is given first mention of those legions present. If an interlude of peace is at hand, then the Tenth is left for years in its permanent camp along the Rhine, or in Spain, or in Judea, with barely any attention paid to it at all.For any student of Rome's military establishment, Stephen's book serves as an admirable introduction to how the Tenth (and any other legion) was formed, numbered, structured, officered, equipped, paid, encamped, and reenlisted and fought and laid siege. Moreover, what elevate CAESAR'S LEGION to five-star status are the six appendices: ""The Legions of Rome, 30 B.C. ‒ A.D.233"", ""The Reenlistment Factor"", ""The Uniqueness of the Legion Commands in Egypt and Judea"", ""The Naming and the Numbering System of the Roman Legions"", ""The Title 'Fretensis'"", and ""Imperial Roman Military Ranks and Their Modern-Day Equivalents.""CAESAR'S LEGION contains several small scale maps of the Roman world that at least allow the reader to locate battle sites in a general way.For any student of Rome's military establishment who REALLY wants to get into it, see Legions of Rome: The Definitive History of Every Imperial Roman Legion by the same author.CAESAR'S LEGION has the Tenth fighting in Gaul, Britain, Spain, North Africa, Greece, and Judea either against non-Roman ""barbarians"" and insurgents or other Roman legions under the control of rival commanders. However, it never became a couldn't-put-it-down narrative for me until the last chapters when the Tenth was involved with the 70 A.D. siege of Jerusalem and the 73 A.D. siege of Masada. At that point, the book became better than average because those battles, more than any that came before, seem relevant to anything contemporary today. Or perhaps it's because one can visit, as I have, both Jerusalem and Masada. And what can be seen at the Tenth's battlefields of Munda, Thapsus, Durres, Philippi (Filippoi), and Pharsalus if anything? (Today, Caesar's 54 B.C. supposed landing point on the coast of Kent is a golf course. I wonder if the painted locals allowed Julius to play through?)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TYWPWMPC0Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0471686131#wasThisHelpful","R16TYWPWMPC0Q3","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Robert Duvall's ""Gus"" McRae character from Lonesome Dove had grown older and lived long enough to drive from Texas south in his classic Caddy for A NIGHT IN OLD MEXICO, then this would've been his story.Duvall's character here is Red Bovie, a Texas rancher who's lost his spread to the bank and is now faced with living out his remaining life in a trailer park. Gus wouldn't have tolerated that, and Red doesn't either. Rather, he takes his stick-in-the-mud grandson Gally (Jeremy Irvine) in tow for a bit of fun below the border. Instead, they blunder into a drug deal gone bad and pick up a foul-mouthed stripper/singer named Patty Wafers (Angie Cepeda), who develops affection for the curmudgeonly but still game and feisty Bovie.As Red and Gally head towards the border across Texas back roads, let's ignore the Joshua trees seen out the driver's side window ‒ trees limited in range to the Mojave Desert in California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Let's ignore the palm trees lining the streets of the remarkably un-dusty and well-developed town just across the Rio Grande in (again presumably) north-central Mexico. My wife and I are virtually certain that Latin ambience was provided by Olivera Street in downtown Los Angeles. So much for authenticity of location.Duvall's Augustus McRae was perhaps his greatest and most loved acting achievement. It set him up for several later roles, including Broken Trail, Open Range, and this one. Perhaps fans of Duvall as Gus will find enough in A NIGHT IN OLD MEXICO to satisfy especially if, like me, they're older and mindful of old age's encroaching limitations and societal expectations. Otherwise the film is clumsy, unbelievable, and sometimes painful to watch. Besides Duvall, only Cepeda as Patty is worth the effort.There's even an allusion to the maturation process of boy to man characterized by the type of hat he wears, seen awkwardly here with Gally and more skillfully with Newt Dobbs in LONESOME DOVE.I think it's due time that Gus ‒ er, Duvall ‒ saddle up and hit the sunset trail on Old Hoss or, as the case may be, driving a Lincoln Navigator.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBV57RICEZOKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IO03I6Q#wasThisHelpful","RBV57RICEZOKU","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Hurt locker"" ‒ Military slang for a bad and painful place""You know, it seems to me that we would have been better off sending in the SAS.

Shepherd recognized him immediately ... `Bloody hell, you're a sight for sore eyes,' said Shepherd."" ‒ from WHITE LIES, as Spider kisses and makes up with the SEALsA couple of books back in FALSE FRIENDS, Spider acted as the MI5 handler for a couple of British-born Muslims as they infiltrated al-Qaeda to thwart a domestic terrorist attack. One of the two, Manraj Chaudhry, ostensibly returned to his medical studies after the mission. But, here in WHITE LIES, we (and Shepherd) learn that he's since been recruited by MI6 without MI5's knowledge and sent to Pakistan's al-Qaeda-infested Tribal Areas on an intelligence-gathering assignment. After Chaudhry's cover is blown, MI6 approaches Spider and his boss, Charlie Button, to send Shepherd in with the Pakistani Special Services Group to rescue the poor devil. Unfortunately, the attempt becomes a bleedin' disaster and now Button, back in London, must play hardball with MI6 and pull her two chestnuts out of the fire.Author Stephen Leather uses an old but effective technique to ratchet up the tension, i.e. to alternate the narrative back and forth between the dual perspectives of the rescuers and those in need of rescue.What perhaps makes WHITE LIES the best of the Dan Shepherd adventures is the degree of hurt in which Spider finds himself and the significant role that Charlie Button has to play in the story. If you're a Button fan like me, you've been waiting for this for a long time. She deserves her own series.I'd like to think that Dan and Charlie will someday get married in St. Paul's Cathedral to a thunderous symphonic performance of Elgar's ""Nimrod"" and then settle down in Luton to raise little spies for Queen, the (remnants of) Empire, and St. George.

"Jake and Will are a couple of American buds off on a backpacking tour of Southeast Asia. Southwest China first, then Laos and Thailand, then home.While in China's Yunnan province, soon to cross into Laos, and with Burma ""just over there"", our two heroes meet up with Howard, a laid-back hippie dude who lives in the area. Howard promises a day's excursion to a waterfall off the beaten track near the border that tourists haven't yet discovered. Who knows, there might even be naked, native girls bathing in the pool under the falls. Local color, right? Yo, dog, we're in!The sally-forth pretty much meets expectations until Jake accidently nails a rural customs cop with a crossbow. Then the day becomes a major bummer. Totally.The focus of this unusual thriller by Simon Lewis is Will, a meek and timid type not comfortable with changes in plan or confrontations of any sort. Here in the jungle he finds he must take responsibility and man-up. Indeed, this is perhaps the overriding theme of BORDER RUN and is thus reminiscent of the 1971 film Straw Dogs (The Criterion Collection) though the two plots are vastly different and I'm not sure why I'm compelled to make the comparison. Perhaps senility and the fact that I loved the film for the lesson it taught about getting cornered and the loss of ""civilized"" escape routes.In any case, BORDER RUN is an imaginative story of a series of events that spiral out of control through faulty perceptions, circumstance, and just plain bad luck. Will, who could likely represent a lot of us, is the lab rat that must react.

"""'It's Dopey,' Vaksberg said. 'You killed Dopey.'"" ‒ from THREE STATIONS, said to Arkady Renko, Dopey being one of Snow White's Seven Dwarfs (in Disney's 1937 version)This book's title, THREE STATIONS, refers to that public open space, Moscow's Komsomolskaya Square, on the edges of which are situated three mainline railroad termini, Leningradsky and Yaroslavsky on the north and Kazansky on the south. And, to make things even more bustling with potential mischief, the Komsomolskaya Metro station serving a pair of underground lines lies between the former two.The Three Stations square serves pretty much as the focal point for both the main plot and the subplot of this police Investigator Arkady Renko thriller by Martin Cruz Smith. Within the former, Renko persists, against the direct order of his boss, Prosecutor Zurin, to pursue a serial killer. Within the latter, to which Arkady has little if any connection, a prostitute, Maya, escapes with her infant girl-child, Katya, the rural brothel in which she was virtually imprisoned and takes a train to Moscow. While aboard the train, Katya is stolen, and Maya spends the rest of the book searching the Three Stations for some clue as to her whereabouts.I've read some, but not all, of the Renko police procedurals. He contributes above-average entertainment to this story, but his character is still derivative from previous installments ‒ a weakness that perhaps strikes all fictional series that feature a continuing hero regardless of the impact made on readers at his/her first appearance on the literary scene, which, in Arkady's case, was Gorky Park. So here, it's actually Maya's search and Katya's haphazard odyssey that's the more interesting story line.THREE STATIONS is a perfect escapist read for a day at the beach or a plane ride to Shangri-La, but it's not memorable or unique enough to rate five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V1KOBFOSA3RD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OHUYTG#wasThisHelpful","R1V1KOBFOSA3RD","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Smiley was no material for promotion and it dawned on him gradually that he had entered middle age without ever being young, and that he was ‒ in the nicest possible way ‒ on the shelf."" ‒ from CALL FOR THE DEADI've been a tremendous fan of John le Carré's George Smiley for years. How could one not be, especially after having seen the BBC's exemplary television adaptations of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People, both starring Alec Guinness?CALL FOR THE DEAD was first published in 1962 when I was but thirteen. (It's hard to believe I was ever that juvenile. I may have read the book in the intervening years, though I suspect not. But, alas, memory fails.)At this late date after Smiley has disappeared from le Carré's repertoire and Sir Alec is deceased, the chief delight for me in CALL FOR THE DEAD was learning about George's induction into the Secret Service, his early assignments recruiting and running German agents against the Nazi regime, and his marriage to Ann. Even Smiley was young once, though he apparently missed the high points.Smiley's introduction to the readers of spy fiction takes place in his world of 1961 when George, while investigating the apparent suicide of a Foreign Office official shortly after being interviewed (by George) regarding his wartime membership in the Communist Party, encounters a blast from his own wartime past.To those who've followed George's adventures over the years, it's evident in CALL FOR THE DEAD ‒ which was also the author's very first novel ‒ that the Smiley's character is in for considerable development over future years. Indeed, George must rely on the efforts of others, particularly an Inspector Mendel, to bring this case to a successful conclusion. Without Mendel, I doubt that Smiley would've pulled it off. In le Carré's later stories featuring George , especially when he's up against the Soviet master-spy controller Karla, our hero takes center stage, however low key and inscrutable in manner, and relinquishes it to no one.For readers of today's younger generations who may only be familiar with the author's most recent works and know nothing of Smiley, CALL FOR THE DEAD is the place to start. The Cold War is over, but George is timeless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4P3EWMX8HA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081KYXQ8#wasThisHelpful","R3R4P3EWMX8HA7","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The riders rise at three each morning, clear their heads with coffee hotter than a scorned girl's slap, fill their bellies with as much bacon as they dare before a ten-hour stretch in the saddle. By five they ride like Cossacks ..."" ‒ from PAINTED HORSES""You can't have horses in with newborn lambs. They'll stomp the lambs right to bits."" ‒ from PAINTED HORSESPAINTED HORSES by Malcomb Brooks is one of those too-infrequent novels that the reader is likely to be loath to put down to pay attention to the demands of spouse or bill-paying job, and, when the last sentence is read, is bereft at the prospect of a return to mundane living.The book features two protagonists brought together in unlikely circumstances. Catherine Lemay, born in the East into affluence and sent off to England's Cambridge on a music Fulbright, but soon seduced and detoured into archeology while helping to excavate under the ruins of bombed-out, mid-50s London. And John H, from Baltimore, who runs away from a foster home to grow up in the 30s on a Basque sheep ranch in Montana, then fight with the U.S. Army in Italy, and who now lives as a semi-recluse in a deep canyon back in Montana. Horses, especially wild mustangs, are John's obsession.The two come together in John's Montana canyon, soon to be flooded by a federal dam project unless something of extraordinary historical archeology is perhaps found in its depths.Though Brooks has apparently written in other print media, this is, as near as I can tell, his first novel. If so, it's a brilliant debut. If not, it's still brilliant. The author clearly knows Montana and its inhabitants and terrain. And wild horses. Moreover, unlike some other major authors who've been cranking out works of fiction for years, the characters in PAINTED HORSES aren't in the least derivative, i.e. they're clearly demarcated from each other in language, demeanor, background, and self-awareness.Some readers may find the conclusion not as tidy as they might like. There are loose ends, rewards and punishments not justly distributed, and avenues not explored ‒ much as in life itself. I liked it all the more for that; it seemed real.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P04ZZBOKNCXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802121640#wasThisHelpful","R2P04ZZBOKNCXF","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Review of a complimentary paperback copy kindly supplied by the author)""In the moonlight coming through my single window, I saw the loose ends of the laces on my sneaker rise tentatively in the air ... The first lace rose gently into the air, the aglet pointing like the head of a cobra, questing, searching. The second lace joined it a moment later."" - from TECHNICALLY, MALES ARE DUMMIES AND OTHER STORIESIn this book, the title of which I'll shorten to MALES ARE DUMMIES for the sake of convenience and because doing so should appeal to the other gender, author Robert J. Sullivan presents eleven of his short stories, some previously published elsewhere.Sullivan has also published the novels In the Blood (A Sam Dane Thriller Book 1) and This Honest Man (Sam Dane Thriller Book 2), both featuring his hero Sam Dane, an interplanetary cop.The strength of the MALES ARE DUMMIES collection lies in the versatility of the author's imagination, which skips about among different centuries, worlds, and universes. Some of them have a The Twilight Zone: The Complete Series (Episodes Only Collection) quality, that television series being one of my faves back in the past century when first aired and even now when I stumble upon repeats.I found ""First Shots"" and ""Gruff Samples Spanish Wines"" particularly good because they respectively feature heroes Jericho Pierce, a Prohibition era Tough Guy out to right wrongs, and Alistair Gruff, a cheeky English soldier of fortune of the Elizabethan period. Should Sullivan ever give up on Sam Dane as a viable going concern for reasons I offered in my review of THIS HONEST MAN, then I'd be delighted if the author transitioned to a series built around the latter.I won't say that all of this volume's shorts were significantly entertaining, but most were. And, in the aggregate, the whole is a fine introduction to Robert's writing talent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LWCUXALAZY8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZQQZIQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LWCUXALAZY8I","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And most urgently of all my reasons, the rapidly accelerating changes taking place all over the world meant that much of what I sought to experience would soon be gone, or, at best, become a vastly watered-down version of the real thing. I had to press on."" ‒ Gary Mancuso, after more than 4 years of travel. (""Bully for you.""‒ Teddy Roosevelt)So, the back story behind THE LAST PLACES ON EARTH is apparently this. Gary Mancuso is a key software developer for a Los Angeles investment bank. He earns enough at this gig to buy a ""beautifully decorated home near the ocean"" in West L.A. and accumulate investments, a wife, and cars. However, having fretted about globalization and the disappearance of ecosystems, he sells the house and cars and sets out to realize a personal dream, (which he names) the Disappearing World Travel Project, a journey of several years (!) of uninterrupted travel supported by the money from said assets to experience first-hand the world's vanishing cultures, animals, and ecosystems.  Gary's book is his report back to us.Fair enough, though I haven't ascribed such significance to my own international excursions that I've named them.  I mean, it's not as if I was looking for Elvis while in the backwaters of Ceausescu's Romania back in '79, though I did hear rumors while there that ... well, never mind. (However, the wife and I will be hiking Kaua'i in September; maybe I'll call it ""The Muddy, Muggy Slog in Search of Detective Danno."" Whaddya think?)As a travel essay, THE LAST PLACES ON EARTH should meet and perhaps exceed the expectations of the armchair traveler. Mancuso opens a window on a far-flung array of places off tourism's beaten path: Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Venezuela, Brazil's Amazonia, rural China, Myanmar, Uganda, Zambia, Madagascar, Mongolia, Caucasian Georgia, Togo, Borneo, North Korea, Tanzania, the Central African Republic, and Antarctica. Gary's book, for the most part, does what a good travel narrative should do; it lucidly and colorfully details reasons why a particular place should inspire in readers compelling reasons to either visit or avoid it. (If the reader is left feeling wishy-washy about a destination, the volume has, in my mind, failed the whole point of the exercise.) Mancuso evidently took good notes during his years abroad, and he's a literate writer. For that, honor is due.On the other hand, the author also visits a multitude of other locales but gifts them only a word or two in the narrative, an incomplete tally of which includes (North) Vietnam, Istanbul, Morocco, Cairo, India, Taiwan, South Korea, Dubai, Gabon, Laos, Bhutan, Tasmania, and the Galapagos Islands, all of which contained something that was ""disappearing"" and thus made his endangered list. So, what were those all about? I want to know. Moreover, though he was constantly taking photographs, not so much as one grainy snap appears in THE LAST PLACES ON EARTH, and that grievous omission is what causes me to deduct a rating star more than any other reason I've mentioned, or will mention, here. He didn't even put the best of his pics on a website and provide the link. I mean, how tough can that be for a man with his IT skills?My favorite travel writers are such as Bill Bryson, H.V. Morton, and Joe Bennett. Without taking themselves or their journeys oh so seriously, they impart knowledge with a good humor that is sometimes self-deprecating, while causing me to recall the good fun I've had while traveling abroad and reminding me that there are places I should make efforts to see while I still can. On the other hand, Mancuso's Disappearing World Travel Project soon became for him a grinding obsession to which he sacrificed his physical and emotional health and his marriage on its stone-cold altar, perhaps best shared in the chapter entitled ""Rootless."" Does Gary expect us to feel sorry for him for his self-inflicted wounds? Oh, surely not, you think? In any case, I didn't and don't. The only useful lesson which endured for me from that gratuitously self-centered portion of the text is that solitary travel can be crushingly lonely. But, if one believes Country Western laments, that fact becomes obvious simply by being a long-distance trucker along Interstate 10 between Phoenix and El Paso, and I learned it decades ago driving solo between solitary hotel rooms in Vienna and Munich, or some such similar stretch.Mancuso, of course, learned much more from his 6-year long trudge of discovery; that's evident from the last chapter ""Our Disappearing World."" Gary is a True Believer. And he found his ""music moment"":""It was during (the) ride through the western edge of the Usambara Mountains that I had my 'music moment.' In movies involving long dramas or epic journey, there is often a time when the main character realizes some large goal, the completion of a quest, or some other major personal milestone. Dramatic music plays in the background, and grand scenery, memory flashbacks, or some idyllic scene is portrayed to illustrate the special realization.""Since Gary invested so much effort into his grand quest, I suspect his mental symphony went something like ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" (of 2001: A Space Odyssey fame) composed by Richard Strauss. Myself, I prefer a snippet of Rod McKuen's free-style poetry done to Anita Kerr's musical accompaniment on the late 60's album The Sea:""... I'm just a man, who needs and wants mostly things he'll never have, looking for that thing hardest to find - himself. I've been going a long time now, and along the way I've learned a few things. You have to make the good times yourself. Take the little times and make them big times, and save the times that are alright for those that aren't so good ...

"""The last time you heard of me and Tom was in that book Sam Clemens wrote ... Now Tom and I are a mite older and a lot of water has gone under the bridge since then ... We've been reading a lot of books and our English has improved a little."" ‒ Huck Finn, from the opening lines of REDEMPTIONBy the end of the first couple of paragraphs of REDEMPTION by Andrew Joyce, the author manages to separate Tom and Huck from anything that came before in their previous lives created by Mark Twain. Why, even Becky was rumored to have run off with a corset salesman back in '54.  Indeed, the improved language skills from all that fancy book learnin' that our heroes hoisted aboard make them virtually unrecognizable. Whatever adventures they have here or in the future as adults, they're on their own.REDEMPTION takes up at the beginning of the Civil War when Huck and Tom join the Confederate Army. After a minor tussle, during which they pick up a sidekick for the plot's duration, a young Union soldier named Jed, the story jumps forward twelve years to Colorado Territory, where it pretty much remains except for an aside in Hawaii and a brief closing in New York City (!) in 1895. Huck is the first-person narrator for the bulk of the tale. It doesn't seem like there'll be any sequels or prequels.REDEMPTION is a classic Western morality play of good vs. evil far removed from those lazy days on the Missouri side of the Mississippi where our two heroes of yore grew up. The players in the White Hats are, of course, Huck, Tom and Jed. And all three are square-jawed, determined, honest, upright, brave, principled and straight-shootin' WASP American fellers that any frontier mother would be proud to have as sons-in-law, by God. There are no grey areas of personal character here (such as in Eastwood's award winning film Unforgiven.)Speaking of Westerns in the film genre, I gather Joyce has seen his share. While reading REDEMPTION, I detected strains of at least Shane, Dances with Wolves, and Wyatt Earp. As a matter of fact, Andrew's sagebrush saga would probably make a pretty decent movie with the right director and cast.As a book worth reading or not, REDEMPTION is certainly the former, though the plot elements are formulaic and the Huck, Tom and Jed personae aren't particularly stressed by any challenges to their stalwart codes of conduct. As pure escapism for filling a couple of hours on a plane or while on lunch breaks during the work week, it's more than adequate 4-star entertainment if you're not expecting nuanced conflicts. So, saddle-up, pardners.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HIL0IRYBX9B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENOPHVQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HIL0IRYBX9B7","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As has been admirably noted by at least one other reviewer, DYNAMITE FISHERMEN follows shoes-on-the-pavement CIA agent Conrad Prosser as he performs the nuts-and-bolts duties of his assignment to the American Embassy in turmoil-torn Beirut of the early 1980s, i.e. to gather intelligence and recruit agents. There's no James Bond derring-do here, only the routine, day-to-day efforts to get the job done in hopes of a promotion.I'm old enough to remember the news reports of the violence in Beirut back during those years. The stew of competing factions ‒ Syrians, Palestinians, Lebanese Christians, Lebanese Army, Iraqi and Israeli surrogates ‒ was confusing both then and now, and author Preston Fleming does little to enlighten the casual reader who has no deeper knowledge of the time and place. For him and Conrad, the mess just is.It seems to me a novel ‒ especially a spy novel ‒ should incorporate a plot with some degree of overt conflict between major characters and an escalating tension leading to a resolution. The superb character-driven Smiley novels by John le Carré (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People) had that. There's nothing like that here in DYNAMITE FISHERMEN.Fans of this book will say I just don't get it. You're right; maybe I don't. But if I want to read about somebody doing routine tasks, perhaps there's a thriller out there featuring a lead who lays linoleum. Prosser himself was so average and unremarkable a protagonist that I never came to care much about the character or his mission. That, for me, is a serious flaw in any novel.I recognize why some might give DYNAMITE FISHERMEN four or five stars either because it gives an unembellished, unsensationalized portrayal of a craft usually fictionally fraught with guns, babes, chases and close calls for the hero or because it's a sober and realistic picture of a confused time in a venerable Middle-Eastern crossroads. So, I'll just leave it at three non-committal stars and move on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JML9JH5NE32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EV84PS#wasThisHelpful","R27JML9JH5NE32","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""You can't get spoiled if you do your own ironing."" ‒ Meryl StreepThis is that time of the year when my male pals invite me over to watch football on the widescreen, guzzle brewskis, gorge on pizza and wings, belch, and ogle the cheerleaders. It's then that I'm thankful for having a wife that insists that I decline the invitation and do what she says I'd rather do ‒ the ironing, while watching Home and Garden Television, sipping strawberry smoothies, and snacking on soy protein chips. I'm the luckiest man in the world to be so not spoiled; Meryl has it right.I recently noticed that my ironing board cover of several years was developing a nasty rip. Plus, there were all those unsightly water stains. Eeuw! It's blatantly un-Martha Stewart. You can understand, then, how tickled I was to receive my new WOOLITE SCORCH RESISTANT SILICONE COATED IRONING BOARD PAD & COVER. ""Tickled pink,"" actually, as that's the color of the cover I was sent, which suits me just fine as it matches the hue of a couple of shirts I wear to work. (After all, I'm a 21st century, sensitive male in touch with my right brain.)The Woolite cover slipped easily over my boringly standard-sized board without my damaging a nail. Admittedly, there was a smidgeon of anxiety when I went to secure the cover at the board's underside with the two pairs of Velcro-tipped straps provided; they're almost too short. But, the  to 1 inch of overlap manages to hold - just.The amount of padding is - adequate. Not so extravagantly cushy that I'd be tempted to lay my head down on it to give my eyes a rest (though I admit that the thought has entered my mind), but adequate. It provides a sufficiently yielding surface on which to use my SUNBEAM 4211 STEAM-MASTER iron to smoothly slide-out the wrinkles in my ""wrinkle-free, easy care"" shirts stitched together in a Third World sweat shop by child slave labor earning pennies a day and a bowl of gruel every other.The scorch resistance of the Woolite cover has yet to be tested, which will perhaps happen next time I'm interrupted mid-ironing stroke to quickly clean-up a hairball that one of the cats has yorked-up onto the couch. I'll keep you updated about both the scorching (or not) and the hairball; I like to give my reviews added value.So far, the cover has functioned just fine, but expectations are necessarily low for something so inert and without an ON/OFF switch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MXW8JVESCJ2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K6L8HO#wasThisHelpful","R3MXW8JVESCJ2K","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since that approach held out promise of a humorous read, I bought the book.It's all in the packaging; I was seduced.THE POTTY MOUTH AT THE TABLE is a series of thirty-three short essays in which Notaro expresses annoyance/displeasure/anger/hysteria with circumstances encountered in her life.Mind you, the author occasionally scores, as with her chapters entitled ""Thanksgiving"" and ""I Only Want to Know if You Have Herpes"" in which she respectively disparages Vegan extremism and Facebook postings.For the most part, however, the author's attempts at humorous rants seem contrived and come across only as petulant and whiney if not downright over the top. Indeed, her reaction to the unexpected appearance of two deer in ""Tiny Dancer"" had me wishing Notaro had a handler to slap her and shout ""Snap out of it!""The open letter to her husband in ""A Handy Manual for A Widower, My Husband"" should've caused her husband's lips to curl. It did mine.It's not that THE POTTY MOUTH AT THE TABLE is a bad book; it just doesn't leave me with the least desire to return to the author's other books for more.

"""People are very strange.

The quality of the music could best be described as shameful, the food obtained from any number of stalls around the park as indigestible, and the ideas represented by the single-issue campaigners who thrust recycled pamphlets at the hirsute punters as half-baked, but no one seemed to mind too much. It was, after all, free."" - from IN SOUTHERN WATERSPublished in 1999, IN SOUTHERN WATERS is one of writer/broadcaster Ian Marchant's rare novels. This was his first.Here, college student Caroline Woolfit moves into the top floor flat at 23 Bloomsbury Place in Brighton, Sussex. Her room is being sublet by another of the current residents, Bob Blossom, who covets the use of Caroline's hi-fi.If you're looking for a piece of fiction even remotely resembling a thriller, this book isn't it. Rather it's a genial and charming examination of the relationships - relationships colored by experiences past and present - between several roommates and neighbors clustered together by circumstance. And, indeed, unless you exist alone in a cave, isn't that what Life is all about for better or worse?The chief character is Blossom, more or less. If you've previously read any of Marchant's other nonfiction works (such as Parallel Lines: Or, Journeys on the Railway of Dreams or Something of the Night [Hardcover]), you may come to the opinion (as I did) that there's a lot of the author in Blossom. Or perhaps Marchant is Blossom. After all, Ian is from Newhaven, which is but a few miles east of Brighton. Both seem inordinately fond of spliff, a joint rolled with both tobacco and pot. And how convenient that Blossom is working on a book entitled ""In Southern Waters.""There is indeed a Bloomsbury Place just off Marine Parade in Brighton. Via the magic of Google Maps taken down to street level, you can see that #23 is a five-story house entered through a blue front door. And the free festival at Moulescoomb's Wild Park - basically, courtesy of Google Maps again, just a very spacious open field - is apparently the Family Fun Day held annually every year since 1978 on or close to May 17.If IN SOUTHERN WATERS was a television sitcom, each chapter would be a self-contained episode that contains varying amounts of humor and poignancy. Perhaps my favorite was ""Beating the Retreat,"" landlord Geoffrey's account of the gritty World War Two retreat of His Majesty's forces before the advancing Japanese Army across the length of Burma.Though this book isn't for every reader of fiction, I enjoyed it enormously both for the engaging stories contained within and (largely) because I treasure the several months I've spent in England (and all over Great Britain) in a multitude of places - including Brighton.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q4NQ7W2M3CH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0575402636#wasThisHelpful","R2Q4NQ7W2M3CH6","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Dead Blow Hammer (A Handy Mann Novel), author Steve George debuts his hero, Jim ""Handy"" Mann, a grain commodities trader (with, apparently, lots of free time) and self-assigned neighborhood Mr. Fixit. In MIMSY, George continues the theme of having his Hero-for-the-Common Man run afoul of devious women with ulterior agendas. The thing is, as another character in MIMSY observes, Jim uses his role as handyman as an excuse to meddle to no good end. Or, as might be stated another way, no good deed goes unpunished - a maxim that I truly believe in.Here, the object of Handy's chivalrous intentions is Mimsy Waters, the wife of ex-baseball player William Waters. Mimsy takes refuge in the shelter for abused woman across the street from Mann's house as he's fixing the front door of the former. From that point, Jim's troubles escalate.As a self-professed handyman himself, George claims to write about what he knows best. One wonders if that includes difficult women.I gave DEAD BLOW HAMMER five stars in recognition of Steve's creation of a literary hero that doesn't fit the usual mold of such in a realm inhabited by the likes of Jack Reacher, Dave Robicheaux, Jason Bourne, Clarice Starling, or even Thursday Next. It's as if a protagonist was fashioned from a bartender, bus driver, bank teller, or dental hygienist. In George's world, there's hope for all of us workin' schmucks to get a series of our own. That said, I can only award four at most now and in the future if Handy's weakness is for ladies in distress that are best left alone. He needs to get out more. Perhaps if Stevens would send him off on a much needed vacation to Las Vegas or the Big Apple, he might get into a different sort of trouble that would expand his worldview and opportunities for meddling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCM5OM5OQH4NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFFDXVW#wasThisHelpful","RCM5OM5OQH4NN","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Jostling along the street in a coach in December 1662 made Samuel Pepys's testicles hurt."" - from HUBBUB""(Clavering) listed various examples of damage and injury caused by falling (chimney) pots. In one case the sweep became stuck in a chimney pot and both fell into a pile of rubbish in the yard below. The sweep was hospitalized, the pot broke, and a maid who had been washing in the yard fell into an apoplectic fit."" - from HUBBUBHUBBUB by Emily Cockayne is a scholarly account of the assaults on the senses and one's person encountered in England in the period 1600 to 1770 - assaults brought on by humans living in too close proximity to one another, particularly in the cities of London, Manchester, Bath, and Oxford.In chapters entitled Ugly, Itchy, Mouldy, Noisy, Grotty, Busy, Dirty and Gloomy, the author examines everything - from physical deformities to poor personal hygiene to spoiled food to poorly-paved streets to air and noise pollution to traffic congestion to raw sewage, and more - which might be encountered by the average citizen on a daily basis and cause for simple discomfiture to absolute outrage.Cockayne's approach to the narrative is to rely heavily on references to or quotes from public records and the personal accounts of contemporary chroniclers to make her points. Thus, HUBBUB comes across as interesting though somewhat dry reading, and it teeters precariously on the shelf of Popular History about to tumble to that of Scholarly Dissertation. It suggests a high school research paper for academic grown-ups, perhaps a doctoral thesis. Each chapter ends with a lengthy summary paragraph which encapsulates that which came before. Taken together, these paragraphs would have sufficed to provide the reader with the big picture, but what would've resulted wouldn't have been a 250-page book but a short pamphlet.The volume is liberally sprinkled with reproduced engravings of the period illustrating the various annoyances. The author seems to have found those by Hogarth and Marcellus Laroon particularly useful.One might be left pondering the question: So, what's changed with species communal living? I suspect undeveloped countries still endure most if not all the sensory assaults experienced in 17th and 18th century England. Even in developed Western democracies, it's a matter of degree, isn't it? Here in Southern California, I experience gridlocked freeways and pot-holed surface streets. I have neighbors on each side of me, each of which has a large tree that dumps huge amounts of leaves onto my property that must be swept up. Teenagers park in front of my house in the wee hours and discard fast-food wrappings into my planting beds. The neighbor up the hill and behind occasionally has noisy parties. Annual area wildfires started by arsonists or idiot campers contaminate the air with smoke. A busy-body local municipal government tells me I can't erect a white picket fence across the front of my property (if I wanted to) or landscape with fake grass to cut down on an enormous water bill (which I've considered doing).As one who loves London above all other cities visited, I'm left with this quote by James Boswell noted in HUBBUB about a journey within that metropolis:""... the noise, the crowd, the glare of the shops and signs agreeably confused me ... my companion (in the coach) could not understand my feelings.""But, perhaps more to the point of HUBBUB, this quote from Jean-Paul Sartre's play ""No Exit"":""Hell is other people.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AJ3KJ8HRCYLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300137567#wasThisHelpful","R1AJ3KJ8HRCYLX","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In DISTANT ANNIHILATION, Tarquin Collingwood, formerly an officer in the 9th Berkshire Hussars posted with his unit to the U.N. peacekeeping force in the Balkans, now finds himself on a Mission Improbable to the Central Asian republic of Azakistan to foil an evil plot by the Iranians and some disreputable Russians to bring the world to the nuclear brink.Author Azam Hossain persistently refers to the Iranians as ""Persians.""

"(Note: This review is of an uncorrected advance proof of the book.)Pat Scannon, Ph.D, M.D. founded the biotech company Xoma Corporation, though he later gave up the management of it so he could disappear into his office and work on ... well, technical stuff. But, he got bored. So, in 1993 he tagged along on an underwater treasure hunting expedition to the Western Pacific Ocean island of Palau, a trip that got sidetracked with the search for a Japanese trawler sunk by (future President) George H. W. Bush in World War II, his first ""kill."" Among the underwater wrecks also dived was that of an American B-24 bomber shot down in 1944 while attacking the Japanese-occupied island. After returning home, Scannon did research that revealed to him that the plane was one of three B-24s downed there in August and September of '44. The locations of two of the aircraft were known; the resting place of the third, presumably underwater, was not.VANISHED is New York Times Magazine contributor Wil Hylton's narrative of Pat's decade-long obsession with finding the third plane and its lost crew and the several expeditions he led to Palau to do just that.  His wife was apparently glad to get him out of the house.Hylton ranges far and wide to create the back-story, including describing the early lives and training of some of the lost aircrew - particularly Jimmie Doyle and Johnny Moore - and the enduring grief of surviving family members, the environment of the B-24 bases on Los Negros and Wakde islands, the overall U.S. strategy for the conquest of the Pacific on the final thrust at Japan, the battle worthiness and effectiveness of the B-24 Liberator, and the ongoing efforts of the American military's Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) to bring home the remains of U.S. servicemen and women missing in action and presumed dead.I think, however, that the author got a little too carried away with background. Did I really need to know about Scannon's parents' experiences in Europe during the war, or the health problems of several Japanese secret police officers stationed on Palau in `44, or the eminently tolerable conditions of Japanese P.O.W. camps for captured Germans in World War I? (World War ONE! Really?)Above all, VANISHED is a fine tribute to the admirable mission of JPAC in general and to the personal efforts, albeit derived from an obsession, of Scannon in particular to help the families of the crewmembers of that ""lost"" B-24 to achieve some closure on the disappearance of their loved ones so many years past. However, that said, I also got the impression that the tensions sure to have occurred between the family members, Scannon's search group BentProp, and the U.S. military authorities -  tensions almost certain to have erupted into shouting matches - were glossed over by the author to make the overall effort appear more heroically harmonious in print than in actuality. By the end of the book, I was beginning to fidget.I'm awarding VANISHED four stars on the conditions that the final, published version undergoes significant editing for content and typos and includes additional relevant photographs. At minimum, it's an effort worth honor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT9GYMGIDAJ4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594487278#wasThisHelpful","RT9GYMGIDAJ4Y","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DEATH IN THE FAST LANE by Chris Jay Becker is a quickly-read e-novel which would be an e-short story with more spirited editing. The plot has LAPD Robbery-Homicide detectives T.S. ""King"" Leary and Thurston Howell ""Millionaire"" Adler investigating two deaths and one near-miss apparently caused by maliciously modified automobile brakes.The crime mystery is neither suspenseful nor particularly interesting. The author seems more focused on creating glib and clever dialogue between characters reciting their lines against a backdrop of the city's then-and-now rock and roll scene, a milieu that held no interest for me whatsoever.From the very beginning, the reader knows that the evildoer pulling the strings is the Angel of Righteousness, a religious nut case. (Gee, you think? Well, this is California.) When his identity is finally revealed by the evolution of the storyline, the revelation is pretty much ho-hum.This is not to say that DEATH IN THE FAST LANE is completely without merit. As a novice thriller writer, Becker does very well at defining the different personalities of his characters; they don't end up being essentially identical cookie-cut pieces differentiated by name only. With the main protagonist in future episodes, Leary, the author now needs to concentrate at making him more sympathetic to the reader by developing his vulnerabilities and internal conflicts; flawed heroes are more appealing than unblemished ones. Similarly, Becker needs to develop any future story's main villain and bring him into more intimate and energized conflict with Leary. In DEATH IN THE FAST LANE, the final (and only) confrontation between the detective and the Angel was so fleeting and tension-free as to be laughable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ51ACJ816M8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EDD89I#wasThisHelpful","RJ51ACJ816M8V","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""During and since the War the steps of the Fountain have been occupied by an untidy fringe of foreigners, provincials, soldiers, sailors, and their lady friends ... The centre of Piccadilly Circus, which used to look so lovely with its baskets of primroses and violets in spring, its roses in summer and its dahlias in autumn, is now, in my opinion, one of the most depressing and regrettable spectacles in the capital. I have an idea that sitting around Eros began during the War with the Americans, who chewed their gum there and mournfully smoked their cheroots, wondering why the heck they were in London."" ‒ H.V. Morton in IN SEARCH OF LONDONWell, you know what they said about Yanks in England during the war: ""Overpaid, oversexed, overfed, and over here.""Having been to London almost more times than I can count, I could have been on any visit part of that ""untidy fringe"" except that sitting in the middle of what amounts to a busy road junction on the steps of an unimposing statue has never held much attraction. Other than that, London is my personal-favorite city in the whole world and reading H.V. Morton's IN SEARCH OF LONDON reminds me why I love it so much.Morton's book is product of his fourth visit to the city which occurred in or somewhat before 1951. England and its capital were still recovering from the destructive effects of World War II, and George VI was still King. As the author is careful to point out in order to give some idea of the changes he'd seen over time, his first visit was as a child in the closing years of Victoria's reign.While IN SEARCH OF LONDON could perhaps have been used as a walking-tour guidebook for a contemporary tourist when it was first published, now it couldn't serve as such at all. Too many things have changed (even during the period between my first and most recent visits, 1975 and 2010). There aren't as many second-hand book stores along Charing Cross Road as there used to be. The Royal United Service Museum, once housed in the Banqueting Hall of the old Palace of Whitehall, is apparently no longer there, though I can't seem to discover with a Web crawl where it went ‒ if anywhere. With the increased security around public buildings after 9/11, I suspect tourists can no longer scurry past the gate guards into St. James's Palace for a cursory look-see. Though one can still go by motor launch from Westminster Pier to Greenwich, the latter is now a stop (Cutty Sark Station) for Docklands Light Rail. And the Royal Naval College in Greenwich closed its doors in 1998.IN SEARCH OF LONDON serves best as a reminder ‒ if such is needed ‒ that the metropolis is chock-a-block filled with sights and history just waiting to be discovered by the city explorer of any era. And Morton takes the armchair tourist even further into what perhaps could only be experienced after special arrangements and efforts (which are probably beyond the casual visitor), e.g., a climb up Big Ben to inspect the bells and the clock and its workings, attend an auction at Sotheby's, descend into the Royal Vaults beneath Westminster Abbey's Chapel of Henry VII, or observe the grueling examination on London's streets administered to cabbie wannabes.H.V. Morton is a travel essayist of the utmost eloquence and possessing boundless enthusiasm. (If I may be so plebeian, his passion for his subjects reminds me of Huell Howser, host of the American public television program CALIFORNIA'S GOLD.) In any case, I've read and enjoyed him in the past (In Search Of England), and I'll most certainly do so again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDOJKPWC9WF8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306811324#wasThisHelpful","RDOJKPWC9WF8G","A2DSXA1E02C86D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSXA1E02C86D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's always worthwhile to watch Vincent Price (THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES, DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN) in a humorous role. After playing such eeevil characters as the insane, murdering Richard III in TOWER OF LONDON, or the odious WITCHFINDER GENERAL, it's a blast to watch a film like THE COMEDY OF TERRORS!

"KING KONG is more than a monster movie. Even though I love the stop-motion work by Willis O'Brien, all the adventure on Skull Island, and Kong's eventual New York rampage, there's more going on than simple action. KING KONG tells several tales, including the primal ""man vs. beast"", the environmental ""nature vs. man's exploitation / destruction of it"", and the obvious, forbidden love story between Kong and Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). The ferocity of Kong is matched by his protective, gentle stance toward her. The fact that O'Brien was able to animate a tiny model, and make it not only look huge, but also make it a living, sympathetic character in the film, is nearly miraculous! People cry when Kong meets his end, and they also know that he was ultimately exploited and abused, and suffered unto death, due to the greed of man. KING KONG is a morality tale that causes self-examination. Within that glued-on rabbit fur beats a real, living heart. So many decades after its original release, I still cry every damned time he climbs the Empire State Building...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NME6AYT1LZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001R6AW18#wasThisHelpful","R6NME6AYT1LZV","AIMR915K4YCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIMR915K4YCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"EL MONSTRO DEL MAR! (aka: MONSTRO!) is about three wild, insane, homicidal women, named Beretta (Nelli Scarlet), Blondie (Karli Madden), and Snowball (Kate Watts), out for a good time. Fans of Russ Meyer, especially his sublime FASTER PUSSYCAT KILL! KILL! will adore these women, even though they're a bit more on the sadistic / psychopathic side than Meyer might have dared to put on film. Not surprisingly, their idea of fun involves cold, bloody murder. After taking care of a pair of overly helpful gents, and taking their car, the terrible trio head out to the beach for a swim. What they don't know is that they've happened upon more than just another good time. Ignoring the cryptic warnings of a local old man, the girls settle in for a night of partying in a beach house, unaware of the lurking terror outside. With a new-found friend named Hannah (Kyrie Capri) in tow, the women rave on, while a group of fishermen is devoured nearby. It appears that a sea monster is hungry for human flesh! Will the three ""man-killers"" recognize the danger they're in, before it's too late? Have they finally met their match? EL MONSTRO DEL MAR! is a well-made, low-budget Australian film from writer / director Stuart Simpson. Very gory, it still manages to have a decent story-line. The monster itself is actually quite menacing! The gooshy finale -almost- enters into blessed DEAD ALIVE territory!

Very different in mood and overall atmosphere from the two preceding CREATURE films, TCWAU is far more somber and introspective.

"THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is, obviously, the sequel to 1931's FRANKENSTEIN. Director, James Whale returns, as do Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein, and the inimitable Boris Karloff as the monster. The film opens w/ a gathering of Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, and his wife, Mary (Elsa Lanchester), discussing her legendary book. As the evening progresses, we learn that Mary has another story to tell. It's a continuation of her first tale. The scene switches to the familiar, burnt ruins of a certain windmill, where we discover that the monster is quite a bit healthier than we were led to believe! Enter Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger), who's tracked down Henry, in order to join forces on a little project. Pretorius has talents and ideas of his own, leading to a venture never dreamed of by Henry. Pretorius thinks it's time for a female version of Henry's creation. Meanwhile, the monster goes through its / his own dark night of the soul, encountering the wrath of the villagers he once terrorized. Escaping their clutches, the monster heads out toward freedom, and his date w/ destiny. The eventual meeting of monster and mate (Lanchester again) is nothing short of glorious! THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a fascinating movie, building on the melodramatic horror elements of the first. This time, much light and dark humor is added to the mix, giving BRIDE a strange, satiric flavor. Karloff gives more life and personality to his role, re-inventing it as he goes along. This all works together to make one of the greatest sequels ever released! While many see BRIDE as superior to FRANKENSTEIN, I see them as equals, each having different aspects that elevate them beyond mere horror, and into the realm of high art.

"FRANKENSTEIN, like DRACULA, is a film that transcends its genre, having become a masterpiece in its own right. Boris Karloff, an unquestionable legend of horror, literally becomes the monster, imbuing it / him with a humanity that belies the gruesome, murderous shell containing it. Karloff, like Lon Chaney Sr. before him, has a rare ability to not only portray a role, but to enter into it, becoming someone / thing other than himself. Beneath the incredible, iconic make-up, Karloff moves this shambling creation along, giving it life, just as it is shown on screen. When Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) shouts those immortal lines, ""It's alive! Alive!"", we absolutely believe him, because Karloff raises this creature from the dead! I don't believe that anyone else, save for the aforementioned Chaney, could possibly have made this work.

THE SNOW CREATURE is a sub-zero-budget ""monster"" movie, w/ a tall guy in fuzzy clothes standing in for the monster. He's supposed to be a yeti / bigfoot / abominable snowman, but is more like a wookie / teddy-man in need of a long bath. He kills someone, leading a group into the mountains to track him down. We get to see the creature dance back and forth, in and out of the shadows, over and over, until our skulls crack open. No kidding! Wilder -the guilty director- uses the same shot of the SC coming at us, then running it backward, some 13-14 times! Anyway, the beast somehow winds up back in Los Angeles (it had been in the Himalayas), escapes, and roams around aimlessly.

"MONSTER MADNESS: MUTANTS, SPACE INVADERS, AND DRIVE-INS picks up where the first MM left off, taking us into the fantastic world of the 1950's! As the title implies, big changes were under way in Hollywood, and horror was mostly replaced by science fiction. DESTINATION MOON, THE MAN FROM PLANET X, and ROCKETSHIP XM were some early releases that ushered in the sci-fi explosion. The unknown aspect of outer space created a vast array of incredible story-lines- male astronauts captured by beautiful female aliens were popular scenarios, as in CAT WOMEN ON THE MOON. The UFO craze led to cinematic creations like EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, INVASION OF THE SAUCERMEN, and the classic THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. The cold war and fear of nuclear annihilation were great influences on the movies of the 50's. Roger Corman's DAY THE WORLD ENDED is discussed as a good example of the atomic mutant film. THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD shows the lethal alien invader at its most terrifying. Giant people, reptiles, insects, invertebrates, etc., roamed the Earth. THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN, TARANTULA, THEM!, etc. are examined. Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion work is also given its due. The influence of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is undeniable. Big pictures like THIS ISLAND EARTH and FORBIDDEN PLANET are contrasted, w/ FORBIDDEN PLANET seen as the more serious, influential film. The McCarthy era's anti-communist paranoia is shown w/ INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. Fans of FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, HIDEOUS SUN DEMON, PLAN 9, LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine will love their segments! Drive-in theaters are covered for their horror / teenager exploitation potential. I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF, I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN, and TEENAGE CAVEMAN were naturals for the then-emerging teen market! Interviews w/ Rex Reason, Anne Francis, Yvette Vickers, Kevin McCarthy, Robert Clarke, Dolores Fuller, Roger Corman, and many more, round out this wonderful tribute / documentary.

"The teaming of Director, Tod Browning (FREAKS) and Bela Lugosi is one of those legendary cinematic ""miracles"". The look and feel of DRACULA is remarkably bleak, especially the castle sequences toward the beginning. Lugosi IS the role he plays, embodying the Count w/ an eerie, carnal ferocity, like a barely-controlled animal that could leap and tear its prey to pieces at any second! There are shots of him simply standing still, giving off some sort of aura I've never seen in any other film, horror or otherwise! His face takes on a mystical, otherworldly quality that transcends mere acting.Though NOSFERATU was itself a masterpiece, DRACULA takes that film's more feral, rat-spider-like creature of the night, and exposes a wicked sensuality within the beast. Damn, I love this movie! Co-stars Dwight Frye as the haywire, crackpot Renfield, and Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing. Helen Chandler is also good as Nina...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OMX5SHQ652UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MG2RG0#wasThisHelpful","R2OMX5SHQ652UW","AIMR915K4YCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIMR915K4YCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE WOLF MAN is, of course, the film that propelled Lon Chaney Jr. into the upper echelon of horror icons. Unlike Karloff or Lugosi, Chaney brings a more down-to-earth, natural approach to his role as Lawrence Talbot.

Loaded w/ dark, heavy atmosphere, THE WOLF MAN is one of the rare 1940's Universal films that stands alongside the stellar releases of the 30's.

After teaming up w/ an equally comical magician and his daughter (Cecil Kelloway and Peggy Moran), they set out on their expedition. Obviously, problems must arise, in the form of the nefarious Professor Andoheb (George Zucco), who also happens to be an eeevil high priest and servant of the mummy Kharis (Tom Tyler)!

Well, for these viewers, I would recommend the sequels, which are chock-full of spooky, lumbering, killer mummy action! THE MUMMY is a showcase for Boris Karloff, whether in the moldy bandages or out, he's superb throughout! His Imhoptep is mysterious, sinister, and sympathetic. The infamous ""stare"" scene alone, is enough to establish his horror icon status forever! Karloff was / is the only such actor on the same level as Lon Chaney sr., and that's no small achievement! His eternal love for his lost soul-mate, for whom he paid the ultimate price, is riveting. Zita Johann is Helen Grosvenor, the seeming reincarnation of Imhoptep's only desire.

Myra carries out her seances there, making a meager living. However, she dreams of bigger things, and has a foolproof plan to improve life for herself, and yes, for Billy as well. After much preparation, the time has come to enact her scheme. Billy does the dirty work, snatching the little girl, Amanda, from right in front of her school building! After some unexpected resistance, he whisks her back to the house. Myra will have her way. She will use the girl to get the income she deserves, as a simple means to an end.

Ms. Stanley's Myra is as pitiable as she is coldly terrifying, while Attenborough plays Billy w/ just the right amount of downtrodden loss of spirit.

"In the twisted tradition of TOXIC AVENGER, TROMA studios unleashes KILLER NERD! Harold Kunkle (the inimitable Toby Radloff) is the pitiful, picked-on creature of the title, pushed to an eventual spree of bloody violence. Kunkle is an obvious basket case, suffering from many deficits. Radloff plays Kunkle so convincingly, that it's hard to believe he could possibly memorize his lines! His performance goes far beyond wooden, into petrified forest territory! With no production values whatsoever, KILLER NERD's ""genius"" lies in its over-use of its anti-charismatic star.

"Director, Ishiro Honda (GODZILLA, RODAN) made this alien invasion epic from 1957. THE MYSTERIANS gets going right away, when a chain of catastrophic events occur, causing mayhem and many deaths. During their investigation, a team of scientists and soldiers encounter a titanic robot on a rampage. Said robot resembles a gargantuan aardvark in a metallic baseball catcher's uniform. Look out! It shoots laser beams from its googly eyeballs! Luckily, the military blows it up. Uh-oh! Suddenly, activity is discovered on the dark side of the Moon! The rise of THE MYSTERIANS has begun! Lovers of Japanese monster movies in general, and Honda films in particular, will find much enjoyment here!  The earthlings are told by the invaders that they require human women to marry! They must re-invigorate the old MYSTERIAN gene pool! Obviously, the women must be young and extremely beautiful. Several prime females have already been kidnapped. Is the Earth doomed to a fate resulting in a pretty woman shortage? No way! Let the war commence! Who cares if THE MYSTERIANS have superior technology and firepower? Our babe supply is at stake! Now, all mankind must unite, in a final battle for the planet! From THE MYSTERIANS' zit-like terror dome, to the groovy ""Earth-Force"" battle-cruiser, this movie is a flat-out blast!

"DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS is a 5-segment anthology film from Amicus studios. Five men on a train encounter the mysterious Dr. Schreck (Peter Cushing- THE FLESH AND THE FIENDS, HORROR EXPRESS) of the title. He tells each man's future w/ a deck of Tarot cards. Story #1 concerns an ancient manor, a werewolf, and a family curse. Story #2 is about a jazz musician who pisses off a voodoo god, inciting its wrath. The third tale is best described as a killer plant / vine movie (sort of a cousin of DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS). The fourth installment stars Christopher Lee (THE SKULL, THE OBLONG BOX) as a pompous art critic, plagued by an artist's (Michael Gough- HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM, KONGA, HORROR HOSPITAL) disembodied extremity.

Meanwhile, Carol Dahlmann (Kathleen Crowley- TARGET EARTH) hires Dave Hollister (Arthur Franz- INVADERS FROM MARS, MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS, THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE) and his brother to help her find her lost husband. She fears for him, since he's gone in search of the missing satellite. The trio set out on their trek, encountering many perils along the way, including wildlife, such as Mexican monkeys (?!) and hyenas (??!!). Of course, there's the ""big snake on a tree limb"" scene as well. They also encounter a tribe of Hollywood Indians in matching wigs. Onward they go, deeper into the unforgiving foliage. More be-wigged, Hollywood Indians appear, just in time to be enlisted as baggage-carriers! Amazingly, Mrs. Dahlmann's hair remains full and manageable, in spite of the jungle heat! Hey, wasn't there a satellite out here somewhere? And what about the Hollywood Indians that keep melting to death? Romance blooms, so I guess Mrs. D's forgotten all about her husband! Oh look! A chimpanzee! THE FLAME BARRIER is a typical jungle adventure, disguised as a sci-fi epic.

"In FUTUREWORLD, the sequel to WESTWORLD, Peter Fonda (RACE WITH THE DEVIL) plays investigative newspaper reporter, Chuck Browning. When a source, w/ information about the WESTWORLD disaster, is murdered, Browning is compelled to look into the Delos resort. Delos is trying to improve its image after the catastrophe of the first film. Browning finds himself competing w/ television reporter, Tracy Ballard (Blythe Danner). Of course, the two decide to join forces in order to get the Delos story. As in WESTWORLD, there are three separate sections in the resort complex. This time, it's MEDIEVALWORLD, SPAWORLD, and the title resort. Browning and Ballard are soon ""blasting off""  for their ""safe"", simulated adventure! The reporters discover quickly that something is obviously being covered up. Their quest leads them into the computerized bowels of the complex, where they uncover a vast conspiracy! The first two thirds of this movie are actually pretty dull, picking up a bit for the finale, where a familiar face returns (yep, Yul Brynner makes an obligatory appearance in an utterly absurd ""dream"" sequence). While the cheeeze-factor is sky-high, especially in regard to anything attempting to appear ""futuristic"", FUTUREWORLD does try to make the best of its lesser, ""follow-up"" status. Unfortunately, it simply isn't all that intriguing or exciting. Neither Fonda nor Danner seem all that enthused about their roles, though Delos technician, Dr. Schneider (John P. Ryan- IT'S ALIVE 1 and 2) is suitably creepy, and Arthur Hill (THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN) is serviceable as the overly-kind, Dale Coba-like Delos executive, Duffy.

"SNOW BEAST (2011) is the -sort of- remake of the original frozen cheeeze-log, of the same name, from 1977. John Schneider (THE CURSE, CONJURER) stars as wildlife researcher, Jim Harwood, who takes his teen daughter, Emmy (Danielle Chuchran), along to Canada on a research project. He and his team set out to do their work, unaware that a a huge yeti-monster is on a rampage, slaughtering innocent humans. Of course, the divorced Harwood is accompanied by a beautiful colleague, named Marci (Kari Hawker). Could romance be far off? Not if the SNOW BEAST can tear them apart first! Meanwhile, Emmy gets herself into various scrapes, committing acts of hijinks and frivolity. Oh yeah, and the SNOW BEAST continues to lower the skier / snow-boarder population in the area, in bloody ways. This is no plodding, ""slow"" beast either! This thing can move! While not the scariest or most realistic-looking creature, the SB does have a certain charm. It looks a lot like a very angry version of the Bumble Snow Monster from RUDOLF THE RED-NOSED  REINDEER! Yukon Cornelius would certainly have his hands full w/ this fuzzy fiend! This is an odd film, in that it has its sudden death scenes, interspersed w/ touching father / daughter moments.

"After opening w/ a blank screen, accompanied by a narrator reciting a ""protective spell"", BURN WITCH, BURN! (aka: NIGHT OF THE EAGLE) begins. College professor, Norman Taylor (Peter Wyngarde) is a logical, non-superstitious man. He scoffs at all things outside of the normal, natural world. This proves challenging, since much of Norman's work and social circle consists of practitioners of the occult! Of course, Norman's cynical attitude terrifies his wife, Tansy (Janet Blair), as she's also a firm believer in witchcraft. To Norman it's all preposterous rubbish. As his wife reveals her true convictions and fears concerning the other faculty members, he sets out to prove her wrong. It's Norman's rationality vs. what he sees as absurd hocus pocus. After gathering and destroying all of Tansy's protection charms and magical objects, Norman's luck suddenly changes, and his life takes an inexplicable turn for the worse. Norman soon finds himself up against forces he can neither explain nor defeat. BURN WITCH, BURN! is one of the best movies of its type, making the most of an overarching sense of dread and inevitable doom! The black and white filming only adds to the bleak atmosphere.

"WATCH THE SKIES! is a hit and miss collection of three minor sci-fi entries. Movie #1> THE COSMIC MAN- A UFO crash-lands on Earth, causing great concern for the military. A scientist is called in to examine the craft. He discovers a free-floating orb, hovering about six feet off the ground. Of course, the Colonel in charge sees it as a weapon, or a way to dominate space travel. Unbeknownst to anyone, a visitor from another world (John Carradine- INVISIBLE INVADERS, THE ASTRO ZOMBIES, THE HOWLING) has come via the orb. Why is he here? What does he want? At first, he spends his time as a shadow-figure (a cropped-in negative), silently creeping about, causing panic. Eventually, he takes on a more ""human"" appearance. Trouble starts when the military attempts to take control of the spaceship. Soon, THE COSMIC MAN reveals his agenda. This is another movie that owes a great deal to THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Movie #2> THE FLYING SAUCER- An international playboy (Mikel Conrad) and his nurse (Pat Garrison) are sent to a cabin in Alaska to learn the secrets behind THE FLYING SAUCER. Things bog down to a crawl, as the movie turns into a nature film. Absolutely nothing of interest occurs until 40+ minutes into the ""action"". In the meantime, we are treated to endless footage of the Alaskan hinterlands! While not a bad story, there's just too much padding, turning this into one looonng, dull experience! Movie #3> STRANGER FROM VENUS- Pretty much the British version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, it contains many similar elements, including an alien visitor (Helmut Dantine) w/ an agenda / ultimatum for the wayward Earthlings. It even co-stars Patricia Neal (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL) as the alien's only human friend! Certainly, STRANGER FROM VENUS is a smaller, lower-budgeted film, but it still manages to get its point across. So, this three movie set has two good movies and one that could have been much better.

"Watching this now, it's difficult to believe that it was so controversial when it debuted in theaters, back in 1984. M.A.S.S.

In reality, SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT is just another slasher film w/ a holiday theme. The killer Claus, far from being blasphemous, is absurd, but perfectly suited for the subject matter.

"QUEEN OF BLOOD (aka: FLIGHT TO A FAR PLANET) is directed by horror-meister, Curtis Harrington (NIGHT TIDE, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN?, WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO?, THE KILLING KIND, THE DEAD DON'T DIE). After receiving a message from an alien race, the Earth awaits the arrival of its first extra-terrestrial visitors. Instead, a probe arrives and reveals that the aliens have crash-landed on Mars. Earth scrambles to put together a Mars mission, to investigate the fate of the distant travelers. Some snappy special FX, and some ""borrowed"" sound effects (From WAR OF THE WORLDS and FORBIDDEN PLANET), indicate that the mission is underway. Blasting off from a moon base, the astronauts, including Dennis Hopper (NIGHT TIDE), locate the alien spaceship, and enter it, finding only one occupant, and he's dead! A second mission, this time w/ John Saxon (CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE, BLACK CHRISTMAS, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) aboard, is dispatched in a hurry. Saxon and company find a comatose female alien (Florence Marly) and rescue her. Saxon joins the first mission, and the QUEEN OF BLOOD regains consciousness. Green, beautiful, and mysterious, the title character is both eerie and alluring. Ms. Marly pulls off a predatory air w/ ease. Without a word, she devours those around her w/ her eyes. Not surprisingly, she has a bewitching affect on the males of the crew. Horror occurs when the QOB begins to slake her thirst. This is an excellent example of horror / sci-fi from 1966. A fantastic twist on the vampire legend, w/ a nifty, doomsday finale! Saxon is believable in his heroic role. Co-stars Basil Rathbone, pretty much reprising the same role he played in VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET, stuck in the lunar command center. Also, watch for Forrest J.

This is simply a thin neoprene band that Velcros around your child's head.The size medium fits the head of my 9 year old, so not adult size, by any means.Easy to get on and off since it has a Velcro closure.My children found that is also doubles as a blind fold.

"I love tea, so I couldn't pass up a sampler of teas.  These teas come in a little cardboard tray that slides out of a cover, and there is also a little white cardboard tray over the tray.There are ten tea varieties in the box and each comes sealed in a foil envelope.  You tear off the top but the envelopes are resealable.I like the varieties, which include black, green, oolong, white, and chai.  I am interested in trying most although there are one or two I might pass off to a friend.The teas are all loose, so I use them in my tea infuser.The teas I have tried taste good, but not phenomenal.  For example, the Jasmine tea.  Jasmine is usually a favorite of mine because it is so fragrant and floral, but this seemed on the weaker side and the bag was labeled that it was picked in 2014.  Although I don't really mind, I'm not sure I would want to be giving or getting it as a gift if labeled that the tea is over a year old.  I think the teas are kept decently fresh in the packaging, so who knows if it is the age or if the tea is just weaker than I expected.Overall, a nice set of teas especially if you want to sample different kinds.  Also good to have on hand for if you have guests - I can never seem to keep track of what kinds of tea people are going to want!I received a discount on this product for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3265TB403G1DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IL75S4#wasThisHelpful","R3265TB403G1DA","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of children's products that are made from wood and not plastic.  This is an adorable kitchen that has lots of great features and is a great alternative to a plastic kitchen.The kitchen assembles easily, as everything is carefully labeled and the instruction manual is clearly printed on large paper.  They really did a great job of taking out any guesswork in assembly.  The pieces fit together well and there were no issues - all you need is a screwdriver.I will warn that the box does have a picture of the kitchen on it - so be careful if you are ordering this as a gift.There are so many features to this kitchen, from an oven to a microwave, sink, and shelf space.  I like having the extra space for accessories or whatnot, as we have had another kitchen that does not have any spot to stash things.There are a few accessories, like a spatula and some food jars.  A bit random to have a spatula as your only cooking accessory, but no problem as it keeps the kids busy!This kitchen is a nice, solid toy and offers so much imaginary play time.  I love the classic look of this, without plastic and lights and sound effects.

"My girls don't have an 18"" doll, but they love their stuffed animals and this bed is perfect.  They have been asking for a doll bed for a while and they thoroughly enjoy this mini bed!The bed came carefully packaged.  There is a picture of the doll bed on the box, so be careful if you are ordering this as a gift and you don't want the surprise to be ruined.Assembly is very easy.  The bed comes with a large, nicely printed manual on 8.5""x11"" paper, and you just need a screwdriver.  The bed goes together quickly and it only took me a short time to put it together without issue.The bed comes with a white ""mattress"", and a nice satin bed set including a pillow and comforter.  I love the colors, pattern, and the overall look of the set with the bed.The bed is a nice quality, but I would just be careful that your child is careful with it and doesn't sit in the bed!  We have another solid wood doll bed for our older daughter, and the kids have sat and stood in it (despite me telling them not to).

"My daughter likes to read in bed, and she had a cheap reading light that broke, so we got this as a replacement.This is more or less your typical clip-on reading light, but it also has a charger you can connect to USB, which sets it aside from other lights we have had.The unit takes 3 AAA batteries, which are easy to install.The light has two settings, with nice bright LED lights.  You turn it on with a button on the top of the light.The clip is easy to use.  My daughter's bed has a really thick top rail, so the clip has to be able to fit on to the vertical bars in the headboard, and it is no problem to fit this on, plus it has some foam padding so that the clip stays secure and doesn't damage furniture.Overall a perfect light for reading at night.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10P1M49N5YYIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PO68CDW#wasThisHelpful","R10P1M49N5YYIC","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We do a lot of camping and spending time outdoors, and I love the idea of a portable hammock.This hammock is easy to set up, and you need to find two trees at an ideal distance apart.The hammock is made from a nylon material, and I like the 'natural', earthy colors.The recommendation is to sit sideways in it, not lengthwise, but I think it is based on comfort.This product all fits nicely into a nylon bag, which is nice, as I have had other hammocks that do not fit everything into the bag.  When you are camping or traveling, it would be too easy to lose track of stuff that doesn't fit into the bag.The kids loved this hammock so much that there wasn't much opportunity for mom or dad!

"My kids love playing with their dolls and stuffed animals and were super excited about this play kitchen that is sized for an 18"" doll.The kitchen is easy enough to put together.  The instruction booklet is printed on 8.5""x11"" paper, with plenty of directions.  The pieces are all carefully labeled with stickers and baggies.  I recommend a large and small screwdriver.My box had an invoice on the top, covering the picture on the box, but just be careful if you are ordering as a gift, as I worry about ordering presents and having the boxes arrive marked.There was scuffing along one of the pieces that makes the top of the kitchen right above the clock, so it is kind of noticeable.  The pieces seemed to be packaged carefully enough, but apparently pieces rubbed together.  Also when I put the ""faucet"" on the countertop, the bottom of the faucet split a little bit.  It still seems to be tightly held to the counter but it's too bad.The set is super cute and the kids love it.  This gets plenty of play and is adorable.  The knobs don't move, but the oven door does open.My only other complaint is that it seems a little odd that the hinge is on the left and the handle is on the top, and I was worried the result could be some rough handling, but fortunately my kids are a little older and more careful.  I just wish the design had the handle on the right side of the cabinet.Otherwise the construction and features are well crafted and very appealing.Overall, this is a cute mini kitchen whether your kids use it for a doll or stuffed animals.

"Coconut oil is great for so many uses - from eating to skincare.  This product is a perfect choice because it is 100% organic.This product comes in a nice glass jar (as a set of 2).  I like having the set of 2 since I can keep one in my kitchen and one in the bathroom or on my nightstand.It is usually solid at room temperature, unless it gets warm, at which point it becomes a liquid.I use this for cooking, for example in baking.  Coconut oil makes for really good cookies!I love using coconut oil on my skin.  I stopped using skincare products a long time ago.  Now, I stick with coconut oil.  I love using Cocozia on my skin because it is 100% organic and has nothing added.  It is perfect after showering and before bed.  I use it on everything from my face to my legs, and I usually put some on my hands and feet right before I go to bed.  You can also make your own body products like body butter.  I made one with coconut oil whipped with shea butter, jojoba oil, and essential oils.  Smells amazing, feels amazing, and I know just what is in it!  So many body products at the store are full of chemicals and synthetic fragrances, and this is a fantastic way to avoid those.You can even use this on hair.  I have friends who use it on their hair to smooth and prevent frizz.  My hair is on the fine side but it would be an easy way to use an all natural product to make hair healthier.I have a lot of issues with my teeth, and I use Cocozia coconut oil as a rinse.  I use it a little bit like oil pulling and swish it around my mouth for a while before rinsing.  It is amazing how it can brighten and whiten teeth in 10-15 minutes!Overall, a great product for going natural whether you are looking for a way to eat healthier or use natural skincare.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FYVTVVNC197H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1AE5EW#wasThisHelpful","R2FYVTVVNC197H","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taking probiotics is very important to us, especially for the kids.  We don't always have tiem to eat a well balanced diet and since probiotics can help with things like my daughter's eczema or stomach issues, this is a useful supplement.These probiotics are little ""pearls"".  At first I thought they were chewable, as they have a sort of ""chalky"" look to them, but it is recommended that you swallow these whole.  It is Orangesicle flavor, but the package says ""for best results, don't chew"".My kids are 6 and 8, and they both have tried these.  They aren't a big fan of the flavor when chewing these, but they are picky as far as vitamins and flavors.  I will have to see if I can get my 8 year old to swallow these whole, as they are just the right size and shape to practice.  I was thinking of crushing this in food, but not if it reduces the efficacy of the product.I appreciate the ingredients of these probiotics - no artificial colors or additives.  The label also reads ""Free of gluten, lactose, wheat, soy, eggs, shellfish, tree nuts, chemicals, and artificial ingredients.  Contains trace amount of milk protein.""  My daughter has a peanut allergy so the label threw me a little bit, but the ingredients look to be peanut safe and she had no problem when taking this supplement.There are 3 billion CFUs in this product, which is good, because I always pick billions (not millions).  This product seems to do well keeping the kids digestive systems on track, and they haven't been sick this school year.  Apparently most of our immune system is in our gut, so I am all for supporting a healthy gut.

"My kids love toothbrushes and toothpaste.. go figure!  So they were really excited when these toothbrushes arrived - they couldn't wait to rip open the packages.These toothbrushes come in two different varieties, and each comes with a toothbrush holder that suctions to the mirror.The holder is easy to use - suction it to the mirror, and lift up the animal head to insert the toothbrush head, then close.  The holders are nice at home, but also for traveling, because it acts as a toothbrush holder and also for hanging up when away from home.The toothbrush is cute, with a cow print on it.  The brush head is small and soft, so better suited to younger kids.  The bristles are a dark gray color, which is unique.  There is also a texture on the back of the toothbrush head, I assume for brushing your tongue.Overall, lots of great features for a kid's toothbrush, and I love that it is appealing for little ones!I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR7LH8678AGPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160PDH44#wasThisHelpful","RR7LH8678AGPU","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My kids do a lot of coloring, and they have some of these detailed coloring books.  I got this coloring book when we had relatives in town with their dog - so it was the perfect coloring activity to do with kids and adults.There are 32 images in the book, with a list in the back of all the dog breeds.  I like that there are all different dogs and breeds to give the book variety.Each page is different, with a different breed as well as a different sort of theme, as each dog is doing something different and often staged with various items (e.g. surfboard).The paper is nice bright white, and thick enough so that it holds up decently.  For fine coloring like this, we use things like gel pens or color pencils.The only improvements I would make:~ I would like the pages to be perforated so that they can be torn out~ the pages aren't numbered, so the numbered list of dogs can be confusing, especially if you cut out pages - so numbering or labeling pages might be useful.I received this coloring book in exchange for my honest review.

I have cut through some decent size branches without a problem.The blades have a mechanism where you can lock them by sliding a little piece over.The only issues I have had are that the handles can be a bit wide and don't always push back open smoothly, as maybe the tension could be a little stronger.I received this product at a discount for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L19O5O9D3AAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPXQNZG#wasThisHelpful","R1L19O5O9D3AAK","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do all the yardwork (other than mowing) at my house, and I also work doing gardening as a side job, and I work in a greenhouse.

The reality is that I go through garden gloves, or I misplace them, or leave a pair outside - so it is nice to have an extra pair.These gloves are a thin, stretchy material with a rubbery palm.  I like the thin material, which is comfortable and gives me the dexterity I need.  The rubberized portion is very grippy, really sticking to things like weeds as I am pulling them out.  It is nice to be able to get a good grip on things between having dexterity and the rubbery grip.The thin material is great in the summer when you  hand can breathe.  Granted your palms will be more sweaty underneath the rubberized palm, but these are so thin and lightweight.The only issue I have is that these are the slightest bit small for me, but I am tall and have long fingers.

"This has been a great desk lamp.  It has an interesting design where it folds into a compact bar.  This would be great if you need a lamp to travel with, like if you have a booth or display at a show and need a portable light.The lamp is easy to set up.  The light portion simply lifts up, and is completely positionable.  The bottom twists to become the base.  There is a marking right on the bottom of the lamp so you know right where to twist the base, so there is no confusion.I like the color of the light - it doesn't seem as stark as some lights, and has a warmer feel to it.  There are three settings of brightness, and the light panel has a cover on it, so you can't see the individual LEDs.  Since the lamp can be positioned easily, you can make sure the light isn't shining in your eyes.  I like the power button, which is a spot at the base of the lamp that you tap.The base is small, but the lamp has some decent weight to it.  So although it is a little top heavy, tipping has never been an issue where it sits on my desk.  If you place it on an uneven surface or somewhere it could get bumped, there is the possibility of tipping.  I wouldn't give this to the kids (like my first grader) for her desk, just because the kids are probably careless enough where it could tip.The lamp is easy to charge, with either a USB cord or an AC adapter.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TI3P8ELBMW5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AEDPC4#wasThisHelpful","R1TI3P8ELBMW5U","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We use a lot of devices, so keeping them charged can be a handle.  Plus, I need to make sure my phone is always charged as I am the main contact person for the kids.  Portable backup battery chargers are a must.This portable battery charger has the features I look for:~ slim design - this slides right into a purse or a pocket.  It has nice rounded edges that help not catch on things.~ charging indicator - there are lights to indicate when this is charging~ decent charging power at 6400mAhThe charger is easy to use, and because it shows you how much power is remaining, there is no guesswork.There is also a built-in LED flashlight, which is a bonus feature.

"We do a lot of cooking and a good oven mitt is a must.  These mitts have a silicone construction which extends up by the wrist, so it protects against heat and things like steam burns. I love silicone oven mitts because you don't have to worry if you get them wet. I also use them for things like holding hot foods (such as peeling blanched foods or potatoes).These mitts are nice and flexible. We have had a variety of mitts that are really stiff, which make me concerned about having the dexterity to be able to hold on to hot pans properly.

"I do a lot of crafts with my kids, so that being said, I am not much of a crocheter, but my kids make a lot of rubberband crafts. When I saw this set, I knew this would be a vast improvement over the cheap plastic or metal crochet hooks I have been using.This set comes packaged in a plastic box, which you can use for storage. Each hook has the size marked on the handle, with a range of sizes. I generally use the smallest one, but when we have projects where I need to grab large bunches of rubberbands, I switch up to a different size.The handles are so comfortable and I wish I had these years ago. I went from trying to grip a thin metal rod that dug into my fingers and was slippery. If you've ever done rubberband looms and tried to be precise and pull a big group of rubberbands over a peg, it is a lot of work. The handles on these add a little size to the handles, as well as rubberized comfort and non-slip grip. Plus, since these have a nice sturdy metal construction, no issues with these bending (compared to plastic hooks).Overall, I love this set!

"We go through a lot of trash bags, from household garbage cans to cat litter.  This is a nice big roll of trash bags, with 120 total.These trash bags have to be ripped off the roll, and they seem to rip off nicely.  Not like the rolls where you try to tear off a bag and it ends up tearing the bag.These bags are a translucent blue color.  You can see the trash through them, but that's not an issue for us.The bags hold up well - the plastic is thicker than some bags we have used, but not stretchy.  I was surprised when I was putting a large, thick envelope into the trash bag and was sure the corner had torn a long hole down the side of the bag - but it didn't show any sign that I could have easily torn the bag open.Overall, a handy roll of trash bags to have.

"We do a lot of outdoor adventures, including boat trips and kayaking, plus days at the beach.  This is a very useful dry bag to have on hand.This seems about on par with other dry bags we have used.  The instructions are printed right on the top of the bag, which is nice (to roll and clip).The bag is made of all one material, and comes with a shoulder strap you can attach to the bag.Although we don't plan on submerging the bag, it is useful for storage in situations where things could get wet - for example, gear you don't want to get splashed as people get in and out of the boat, or strapping this to the kayak.  I think this would be useful too at the beach when you don't want wet or sandy things mixing with stuff you want to keep dry.I haven't tested this as far as submerging it, but we did run it under water to check the seams etc.  The top rolls just fine to create a seal as well.Overall, a good dry bag, and I actually like the small size.  Whereas the bigger ones might be more useful on a bigger scale, I picture using this for myself on a trip to the beach!

"My kids LOVE Beanie Boos, and they both have a collection, so they were super excited when this game arrived.This is a cute, simple game.  It is recommended for kids ages 3-6, and is for 2-6 players.  It is easy to figure out the rules of play and set up the game.  Out of the box, we had to stick numbers on the die and pop a cardboard ""Peanut"" Beanie Boo in a little holder.There is a main playing board, and each player chooses a board with a Beanie Boo character.  Everyone takes turn rolling the die (we always start with the youngest player).  Depending on the shape you land on, you pick that shape piece and see if it matches the color and shape you need on your board.  First person to fill their three shapes wins the game.My kids were super excited to get this game.  It sets up so quickly and is very easy to understand, so there is no confusion when it comes to playing.  That also makes it great for playing with friends, especially because the kids can explain it.  With almost no setup time, the kids can be playing in no time.For younger kids, this is a great way to reinforce skills like matching colors and shapes.  It can also be a bit of a memory game if you see a piece someone has picked up that you either need or are trying to avoid picking up.The game can surprisingly take a while to complete.  When we first got it, I had thought the game play might be over in just a matter of minutes, but the game can stretch on for a while.  There were times the kids were impatient for the game to end, but only because they were being impatient, as I felt the game play time was good.If your kids are younger and more easily frustrated, there were occasions we sorted out game pieces as they were revealed to both reduce frustration and also to speed up the game.  In other words, the pieces the kids didn't want to pick up again went face down on a certain part of the board so that they didn't pick up the same ones over and over.  Alternatively, you could make it more challenging, and put the pieces back and mix them up so that it is less about memory and more about chance.Overall, this is a cute game especially if your kids are into Beanie Boos!I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7JEJQ5WSADR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0P6R2A#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7JEJQ5WSADR","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter is obsessed with My Little Pony, so I gave these to her as a reward. We had heard of surprise eggs before, so she was really excited when she saw these!These are ""Sweets & Surprises"" eggs, so each egg has candy and a non-candy treat. The candies we received in our eggs are small pink hearts. We had different non-candy treats - a necklace, ring, and a pencil topper - as well as a sticker in each egg. The My Little Pony toys are very cute, all with MLP images on them.The eggs are shrink wrapped with plastic, and the candy is also sealed inside.There is information on the wrapper as well as on an insert, but I had trouble finding the ingredients because the information is listed in so many languages. However, I was never able to find any allergy information (as my daughter has a peanut allergy), so she was very unhappy to be told she could not have the candies. (She can't have products processed/manufactured in a facility that processes nuts, which is often the case with candies, so I'm not sure if I can give these to her).These eggs are cute and definitely a hit with the kids, but the price is a little steep especially if you wanted a large quantity for things like favors or Easter eggs (which we are used to doing but at a cheaper price point). Overall, a super cute idea especially if your kids are really into My Little Pony!I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3TO35Y5MZLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017591TMG#wasThisHelpful","RJ3TO35Y5MZLA","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kids were so excited when this remote control car arrived.I was concerned when I took the toy out of the package, as the exterior of the car is a very thin plastic.  However, it has not been an issue even with the kids crashing the car into things.  There is a bumper on the front and back, but I am still cautious when the kids are rough with it.Setup is fairly easy: the remote requires four AA batteries.  Also you need to remove the compartment *using a mini screwdriver) on the bottom of the car to find the antenna for the remote control, as well as the charger and rechargeable battery.  The battery charges by plugging into a USB adapter, which I plug right into my computer.  I like that it has an indicator light to show when it is done charging.The ""Predator"" is easy to use.  You use a pointer finger to move the toy forward or to go in reverse.  There is a wheel on the side of the remote that you use to steer.  The controls are easy enough to use, but the car goes very fast, so it can be hard for younger kids to control it.As far as performance, this toy does well.  It has nice big tires with grip on them, and so the car powers over carpet and other things, from feet to stuff the kids leave on the floor.  The first day we had this, my daughter drove it right over the cat's wet food bowl, so I had to wash the tires!There are two small things I would improve about this product:~ I wish the screw to the compartment cover on the bottom of the car would stay attached to the compartment when you unscrew it (some toys have this feature).~ There is no speed control on this.  It is either on or off - fast or not moving at all.Overall, this has been a really fun toy, and it cruises around the house easily over all the stuff the kids leave laying around!I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KGZICVZ1XNC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YNZSRM#wasThisHelpful","R2KGZICVZ1XNC7","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We use microfiber towels a lot, as we have two kids and are an active family.  This is a nice size towel for a variety of things, from swimming to kayaking and hiking.This towel is nice for one, because it is very absorbent.  Trips to the beach/pool/etc. often become big hassles as far as having to lug so many towels, especially when the kids are in and out of the water.  The Wanderluxe Towel is a small size but absorbs very well.The towel has a very soft, smooth feel.  The tightly woven construction gives the fabric a smooth texture, and not one to pick up particles (sand, dirt etc), which is a must.I also like that there is a loop for hanging it up, which really comes in handy for showering at the campground and so on.

"I have been using natural products for a while now, but toothpaste was one of those things that took me a while to find an alternative.  I have tried a few tooth powders before, and this is probably the third one I have tried out.This is a powder in a small plastic tub (my others come in a tub and a squeeze container).  I wet my toothbrush and dip it in.The powder is very light grey and is darker when wet.  It has an interesting taste, but is overall quite mild. Reading through the ingredients, I thought some of the flavors might be too strong, but this is a mild combination of flavors, and I like that there are no overpowering flavors like mint or cinnamon.  This does have a natural taste to it, sort of earthy but fresh.I do feel like this does a good job cleaning my teeth, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth looking whiter.  Interesting how it turns a dark grey in my mouth but washes clean.  There are a few gritty bits in the powder, but not a big deal at all.I am also hoping this helps with my teeth, as I have issues with my teeth and feel like I could use some extra nutrients in my mouth when I brush.I would say this is about the same as my other tooth powders, but with a much milder, more pleasant flavor, plus the benefits of activated charcoal.I received a discount on this product for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR29FVYDSBJ1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Y8NPSQ#wasThisHelpful","RR29FVYDSBJ1L","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember how tough it was to keep my kids busy when they were young, so I got this toy for my best friend's little one.  Staying at home can be a challenge, especially with winter on the way!  As soon as the Learn with Me Color Fun Fish Bowl arrived, we took it out and got down to some playing!The fishbowl comes with batteries, which is convenient especially if you are giving this as a gift.  No worrying about having to look for batteries.To use the toy, you insert fish in the top.  This can be a little frustrating for younger kids as you need to insert the fish a certain direction for the toy to work properly.  There are 10 fish and the toy talks as the fish are inserted, which helps kids learn their colors.  There are two modes, where the fishbowl either identifies the color fish, or it requests a color fish.This toy is good for traveling, since all the pieces store in the fishbowl.  We have also used it in the car, and except for my little one dropping a few fish here and there, is makes for good entertainment in the car.Once the fish are in the fish bowl, I wish it were a little easier to remove the fish.Overall, a fun toy for little ones, and helps with a variety of things from fine motor skills to learning colors.I received this toy in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZD5YA6KFYDCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2VZMM0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZD5YA6KFYDCW","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No problems - cut right through the bread.Next, we took the inner ring and pressed it down on the outer edges of the bread.  However, it didn't quite grip the edges of the bread enough to press them down and seal the bread into a pocket.

The instructions are right on the tube, as it is marked ""LOCK"" and has arrows to show how to open, etc.There is a carry strap, which also helps keep the lid from getting lost.The diameter of the tube is large enough so that either your papers don't have to be too tightly rolled, and/or you can put multiple items in the tube.This is the first storage tube we have tried, and it does the trick.

The chimes are connected with a string, and one of the metal loops was not entirely closed, so I had to carefully loop the string back to the top to re-hang it.These chimes do sound a little bit ""tinny"", again compared to more expensive chimes.

There are three color columns, so I wasn't sure about dividing the chores up between two kids, or how to divide by day.  The best strategy for us is filling the first column with chores, and the other columns become the days of the week (Mon-Fri).This is so easy to use and very visually appealing and rewarding, since you can see the chores and the stars.  Since there are images associated with each chore, it is helpful for kids who aren't readers or strong readers quite yet.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QR6RNTUOCFZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0115ESRYA#wasThisHelpful","R3QR6RNTUOCFZK","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seaweed Snack:Our family eats a lot of seaweed, and we are lucky that our 5-year-old loves roasted seaweed, because she is otherwise extremely picky about what she eats.  I would like her to eat a lot more fruits and vegetables, but seaweed is very healthy, so she enjoys a variety of seaweed, from roasted seaweed snacks to sushi.These seaweed snacks are a little different than our typical seaweed snacks, and consist of crispy, puffed rice, sandwiched between two strips of seaweed.  These have a nice seasoning to them, including soy sauce, sugar, and red pepper.  I was concerned these would be spicy, but they are just right.My 5-year-old ate the whole bag in one sitting - more like a matter of minutes.  She shared a few pieces with her sister and myself, and we all agreed that these snacks are really good.These are really tasty and healthy, and a very convenient snack.  They are made with simple, healthy ingredients, and I appreciate that these are all natural.Chocolate Snack:I wasn't sure what to expect from this little cacao snack, but I was intrigued when I poured little chocolate cubes out of the bag.  These are crispy little chocolate-y cubes, and taste amazing!Both my kids (age 5 and 8) weren't sure what I was ""making"" them eat when I offered these, but soon they were fighting to eat them all.These chocolate snacks have a wonderful light, crispy texture to them, while having a great chocolate flavor.  But they also aren't too heavy or sweet.  They make a nice, light snack and are absolutely delicious!I appreciate that these don't have artificial colors or other additives.  And a bonus - they are peanut safe, so my daughter can have them (always check labels).I received product samples in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV89OYQONYAEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0120AHBYK#wasThisHelpful","RV89OYQONYAEN","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always use packing cubes when we travel or go camping, as they really are a lifesaver for me with two kids.These have everything I look for in packing cubes:~ There is a mesh panel on the front, which allows you to see what is inside.  Plus it allows for ventilation and makes it easier to compress these in your luggage (instead of having air trapped in the cubes).~ Two zippers on each cube.  I don't like having to chase one zipper around a bag, so this is perfect for when I am busy and on the road.~ There is a handle on the top of each cube.  When we get to our destination, I sort cubes, so if the kids are in different rooms/tents/etc, I can easily carry these around and put the cubes by each person's bed (or sleeping bag!).These are made with a nice sturdy nylon material, and are a mid to large size bag.  I use these for shirts or the kids clothing, or you could put all your socks and undergarments in one of these.

"My daughter is obsessed with My Little Pony, so she was very excited when this arrived in the mail.This product consists of a coloring book and stylus that looks like a crayon.There is a unique code inside the front cover of the coloring book, so you can download the Painting Lulu app for free and access the same My Little Pony coloring pages in the app.  Downloading the app and using the code was very easy.The coloring book is nice, with a thick cover and decent size pages (a little larger than your typical coloring book).  I like that the app has the same pages so that you can basically use the coloring book infinitely!  My kids both had fun using the coloring book and the app, sometimes at the same tie.My only complaint is that the stylus was really hard to use.  I had to push the stylus on the iPad really hard to get it to work - where the stylus was basically being mashed into the iPad.  It sort of defeats the purpose of the stylus (being able to be precise), and my daughter was frustrated right away and gave up and just used her fingers.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R76FRY27GVL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9657641020#wasThisHelpful","R2R76FRY27GVL4","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember having a collapsible cup as a kid for travel and I absolutely loved it!  I got this set for the family so that the kids would have something to use when we travel or go camping.These cups come as a set of three, and I got the blue/orange/pink set.  I like having the three colors so that we know whose cup is whose (however, the lids are identical, all with pink straps, so keep that in mind).The cups collapse easily enough and have a squared bottom.  The easiest way to collapse them is probably just pushing down on the top while they are on a counter.  They also pull open easily, but you have to have the lid off, otherwise it creates too much suction.The cups are entirely silicone except for a metal rim, and the snap-on lid is a firm plastic material.These aren't the biggest cups, but perfect for things like camping when it is time to brush teeth and rinse out.  I also like that this is silicone and I don't worry about leaching from plastics.  I would consider putting hot cocoa in these although I think for the most part we are sticking with water.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.

"My daughter has really thick hair, and after a summer of sun and time at the pool, plus more swim lessons, her hair can use some serious conditioning.

"We use a lot of fresh garlic, and had a garlic press for years, but the hinge gave out on it.  The KOVOT press & slicer looked nice and sturdy, modern - plus I've only ever had a garlic press (not slicer)!This garlic press is very easy to use.  There are two compartments inside: one for slicing and one for pressing.  A big clove of garlic easily fits inside without a problem.  Then squeeze the handles together (making sure the press is fitted together properly), and voila, you have your choice of pressed or sliced garlic!Since the garlic slicer is a new feature for me in a garlic press, I am having fun with it.  I love garlic so having little slices in my food is wonderful!Washing out the press/slicer is easy.  The inside of the slicer is labeled carefully (to note the sharp blades), and the inside of the handle has a little plastic tool that helps you remove any bits of garlic that get stuck in the press (as they always seem to for me).

"We got this little LED touch-light for my daughter, for her locker, but this would be great in lots of dim areas, like under a cabinet, or in a closet.This light bar has four LED lights, and the light fixture rotates side to side so you can angle the light.It does not come with batteries, and it was easy to install the 3 AAA batteries.  You just slide off the back, and slide back into place when done (my 8 year old did this).The back has two large foam stickers for attaching to a surface, as well as some extras in the box.  You can also change the batteries without having to peel the stickers off the back - just slide the light part off the back panel.The light turns on and off with a set of two little metal spots on the light (capacitive touch sensors).  This makes it easy to turn it on and off, and my daughter really likes that feature.This is a hit in my daughter's locker, but I wouldn't mind having some of my own!The only thing I might change is having different light levels, but it doesn't really need it.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336VXK4ALBOKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GD8OKY0#wasThisHelpful","R336VXK4ALBOKP","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have wanted a fabric shaver for a long time - it may sound funny, but I have had a lot of my sweaters for a long time, and I also consign a lot of clothes.  I have literally spent too much time trying to cut pills off clothing with scissors.  And when my husband sold his old car, we cut all the pills off the fabric with scissors.  Needless to say, this product was long overdue.This is a small, lightweight product, and I wasn't sure how well it would work.You simply plug it in and slide the switch at the thumb location to turn on the shaver.  Inside the device, sharp blades rotate underneath the little metal grill.I tried this on one of my favorite old hoodies, which is covered with pills (see photo - I'm not sure why the first photo is so washed out, but you can see the pills!).  Simply run the shaver over the pills, and you can hear the pills getting shaved off.  There is a clear panel where you can see the pills collecting.  The shaver does a fantastic job!

"This lamp came just in time for lots of use - between homework, reading, and other projects that need light.I have to say, I LOVE this lamp!One of the pretty cool features is that it is actually recharges!  It comes with a charging cable for USB, as well as an AC adapter you can plug the USB cable in to.* The only downside to this product is the AC adapter - the prongs are not straight at all.  They aren't wiggly either, so it isn't something that was bent or can be bent back into place.  We are not going to use the AC adapter, and instead we use our own USB charging station. *This lamp has 3 brightness settings, which is great, like if you want to read at night in bed, versus needing brighter light for other projects.  There are lots of LEDs in this lamp, but it has a nice surface over the lights to help diffuse the light.I love how adjustable this lamp is. The neck bends quite a bit, so you can have the light up high or down low.

I can't tell you how often my kids leave a bag of food open or not closed carefully, and we end up with chewy crackers, etc.  I like to transfer foods from their store packages into these storage containers.The containers are marked with care instructions, as they are both microwave and dishwasher safe (just make sure lids are at least askew if heated in the microwave).These wash easily and I haven't had any issues putting them in the dishwasher.The small size is great for things like lunchboxes and snack bags, and the largest size holds a big portion of food.

You slide the pieces together and lock them in place, which is easy to do.There is a nice wrist strap on the pole, and the handle has a nice soft material that is also contoured to your hand, so it makes it easy to grip the handle even when you are sweaty.You can remove the tip, and it comes with two rubber tips (one on and one off).  It also has a little basket at the end.The only downside is that the product doesn't come with any information.  I was thinking of getting one of these for the grandparents, and it would be nice if it had a little insert about how to use the locking mechanism on the side.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGXX0UIC0C9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CKWNTI#wasThisHelpful","RTGXX0UIC0C9J","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teething can be such a frustrating time for both baby and parents alike.  That was when I stopped wearing jewelry and started pulling my hair back since my baby would grab at anything she could!  I gave this set to my best friend, whose baby is entering the teething phase.  She and her baby both enjoy this set!The necklace is a nice length - nice and long so that your little one can really grab it and play with it.  It gives them a little length to work with and not be right up on your neck.  The back of the necklace has a safety clasp so that it will release if too much pressure is put on the necklace.  Nice to have a safety feature.The bracelet is a sturdy bangle, and my friend often ends up just taking this off and letting her little one enjoy it on his own.  This one has been particularly good for chewing on!The set is pretty to wear, and as a new mom, it is a nice alternative to regular jewelry that might be uncomfortable or unsafe for your little one.  I don't even think that people would guess this is silicone!This is such a nice set for yourself, or to give.  It is a perfect gift for a new mom and even a mom having her second (or third, etc) baby, especially when it is tough to find something nice for both mom and baby for someone who has had a baby before.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIO5TYR2RY688/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010P3HRB6#wasThisHelpful","RIO5TYR2RY688","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two girls, so the kids have taken over one bathroom and we fortunately have our own bathroom.  I find I can always use some good bath mats and bath rugs, and we put this DocBear Bathroom Rug right to use.This is much like our other memory foam bathroom rugs, although it is a little lighter weight. Because it has a lighter, thinner feel to it, I am taking off a star.The outer material is very soft and comfortable, pretty much the same as our several other memory foam rugs.This has a nice non-slip bottom. It has a good grip to it and it certainly isn't going anywhere (which is especially good for the kids).Stepping on the rug feels very nice and comfortable.  The size is on the small side, but you know what you are getting when you order the product and the measurements are listed.  This serves as a nice little mat right outside the bathtub or in front of the sink.  Stepping on cold tile is no fun, and stepping on tile with wet feet can mean trouble (slipping), so it is nice to have this instead.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4JDI2Z566Q5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HZE5T6#wasThisHelpful","R4JDI2Z566Q5P","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We try to eat healthy, and my daughter has a nut allergy.  Prior to having kids, I loved spending my time perusing the store for new products to try. Now, with two kids, I don't have the luxury.  I try to stick with what is on my list and get out of the store, so that doesn't lend well to finding new products.I chose the box of nut-free snacks, as our house is completely nut-free.  My daughter not only has an allergy, but we try to eat healthy, and she's picky, so I tend to have a lot of factors that make it difficult to shop for her!  This package came just at the right time, at the beginning of the school year, when I am trying to keep a variety of foods for snacks and lunches.My kids were super excited to try the box.  I wanted to make sure that my daughter with the nut allergy tried products she had not tried before.  The only thing I think we had tried prior to receiving the box were the BBQ Pop Chips, so it was nice to have a variety of products that were all pretty much new to all of us.  I also like that this has a variety of sweet vs savory, as there is a selection of chips, granola bars, and dried fruits.Our favorite item in the box are the granola bars, as my daughter has not been able to have any granola bars before because they are never peanut safe.  I also like that the box offers some items in different flavors, because I will repurchase items that were favorites.I think this box is such a great idea, and I'd love to try the non-GMO/organic versions next.  A great way to sample products, and its like having a personal shopper!I received a box in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24TQFBXK1M97N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RC6A8JI#wasThisHelpful","R24TQFBXK1M97N","A3R4GS2F5N5SWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4GS2F5N5SWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love that this product comes in a nice, BPA-free, re-sealable, screw-top container for easy use and re-use.  (I have purchased shea butter before that came in a bag).This product has a nice, light scent. It is all natural and not fragranced, and I would describe it as natural and earthy.Melts in your hand for easy application OR can be scooped (and measured) with a spoon for use in recipes.  I love making my own body butters, which you mix this with some other natural ingredients.One note:  Shea butter is somewhat greasy feeling, but our skin NEEDS those moisturizers.  If you can rub it in and let it be for a few minutes, do so!  Otherwise, apply it after a shower and before bed to avoid getting fingerprint residue all over everything.  It is worth it!

"I love making healthy drinks and smoothies, so I got this product thinking that I would try it with my kids.Just a note - this is not nut-safe.  My 5 year old has a peanut allergy and she cannot have this.  The label actually says ""Allergen Friendly"" but then in tiny letters it says ""Manufactured in a facility that processes nuts, tree nutes, peanuts, seeds, soy, wheat, and dairy (milk).  I feel like the listing for this product is misleading because you can see where the image shows ""allergen friendly"" but not the allergy warning.  Had I known that, I likely would not have ordered this product (as our household is entirely nut-free).I do give them lots of credit though, as this product has no sugar, no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.I tried this with my 8 year old, and I have also tried it myself.  I use a heaping scoop in juice or water.  It does leave some particles behind that don't completely dissolve, but fortunately my daughter is open to trying things.  My younger daughter would take one look at the little bits and refuse to drink it, so everyone is different.  That being said, it doesn't seem grainy, even though it might look like it.It has a sweet taste, kind of fruity, but from years of taking things like spirulina, I can taste undertones of greens.  The sweetness is nice but you can tell it is an alternative sweetener (in this case, stevia).Waiting to see how well it works as far as curbing appetite.

"Teething can be such a terrible time for little ones - I remember my babies grabbing at my hair, clothes, toys, anything they could gnaw on.  I got this for my friend whose baby just started teething.  For one, the necklace is beautiful!  The colors are gorgeous, and the silicone beads are tied on a satin cord.  I would wear this even without a baby!The beads are nice squishy silicone that give baby something to bite on.  It is so nice to have something for your little one to grab and chew, not real jewelry that could get ruined or hurt your baby.

"I love using ginger for lots of things, and I love that it also has lots of great health benefits.  And as with products that have health benefits, I prefer that they are organic, so I fully appreciate that this is organic ginger.My ginger powder came sealed in a thick plastic pouch.  I have added this to my stash of products I add to my smoothies in the morning.  I make smoothies with coconut milk, greens, a banana, and frozen fruit - then adding in things with additional health benefits, and the Kazu organic ginger powder is an excellent addition.The powder is very finely ground - no clumps or graininess.  This doesn't seem to be as strong or spicy as some other ginger powders I have used, which is not an issue.  It tastes fantastic and I like the flavor that it adds to smoothies and so much more.

"My kids were excited as soon as this hair brush arrived - for one, it is super cute!  It is pink and purple, and the bristles are all different colors.

Also makes a cute stocking stuffer!The back of the brush has a cute mirror on it too, which is so convenient (why doesn't every brush have one?!).The brush works nicely to work out tangles.

"I needed some tables for my new home, so I purchased these.  Here is my review.1) Color:  The color of the stain is espresso, there is no red in the color, but you can still see the grain of the wood quite well.  5 of 5 stars2) Construction:  It appears that there is no particle board, it is solid wood.  Some assembly is required.  It uses wood dowels and screws to mount the leg sides to the top.  There is no included wood glue.  4 of 5 stars3) Finish:  One of the three tables does have some minor issues with the finish, it appears it wasn't applied correctly and has left some clumps of the dried finish on one of the legs. Although its not noticible unless you run your hand down the leg of the table, its still something that should have been noticed at QC. Every other part of these are top notch quality. 3 of 5 stars4) Strength:  I used wood glue for the dowels and the included screws.  Once everything is put together and the glue has dried, these tables are amazingly strong. 5 of 5 stars.Also, there are no glides on these tables.  I purchased Safeglides 1"" felt glides for that purpose.  Those are found on Amazon if you do a search for them.

"I've had this console for a few weeks now.  Here is my review.1) Construction:  The console main components are solid wood with the exception of parts of the drawers.  5 of 5 stars2) Ease of Assembly: Assembly was a little difficult for just one person. Further, I was disappointed in the fact that the dowels were sized differently than the dowel holes. The holes were larger.  Also, there was no wood glue for the dowels.  So, if you want to make the table as strong as possible, as a console for a flat TV, you need different dowels and wood glue. 2 of 5 stars.3) Look and feel:  The table looks really good.  The drawers are very functional and even have a drawer stop, which is unusual for Winsome and a welcome improvement over other items they ,manufacture. The color is true espresso, there is no red in the stain and it is dark. Yet not too dark where the grain of the wood is hidden.  In fact, the wood grain that shows through is really quite nice.  I would question the durability of the finish however.  I am already noticing some very minor scratches on the surface.  4 of 5 starsOver all, this is a good buy.

"I've owned this now for about 3 weeks and wanted to give myself sufficient time to write a good review from sleeping on the mattress.  Here is my review.1) Packaging.  I must  say I was impressed with the cleverness of the packaging.  I mean, who sends a mattress through the mail?  But, since it is foam, the mattress arrives compressed and rolled up.  I simply opened the box, unrolled it and removed the plastic and the foam took about 24 hours to expand into place.  5 of 5 stars.2) Comfort.  This is probably the real reason why anybody gets a new mattress.  Its good!  Its Comfortable very supportive.  Im over 50 years old, and I have problems with both shoulders.  When I lay on my side, the pain wakes me up and I miss a lot of sleep.  I must say I have no more pain in my shoulders because the mattress is supportive all over, not just pinning the support on my shoulder.  Thus, I get much more sleep.  Further, I can also sleep on my stomach, which is nice to have another position to sleep. If I could give it 10 stars for comfort I would!  5 of 5 stars.3) Look and feel.  The fabric covering is nice and quality.  5 of 5 stars.4) Formaldehyde.  When you open the plastic bag to let the mattress expand, there is a pretty strong scent of formaldehyde.  I kept the mattress in the living room and opened the windows at night.  After 2 days of venting, I put it in the bedroom.  While sleeping on it, once in a while I do smell the formaldehyde.  But to be honest, the mattress is so comfortable, that its a secondary concern.  4 of 5 stars.Thank you Signature Sleep for producing this mattress at an affordable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUQCVKWH7T7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005A4OO80#wasThisHelpful","R1PUQCVKWH7T7S","AR5XJEZR0LWWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR5XJEZR0LWWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It fits the standards chili, taco and gravy seasoning packets with room to spare.

"I did a lot of research on a coffee press and settled on this one by Bruntmor.  I should say that I use Coffee Presses for ground cocoa beans. Here is my review.1) Look and Feel.

It looks very high quality. 5 of 5 stars.2) Function.  What I really like about the stainless instead of glass is the uniformity of the interior.  With glass, sometimes its not even, allowing grounds to escape.  Not so with this unit.

"Unfortunately this toaster has received some poor reviews and I thought I would buy this from a local store and write a review here on how I thought this toaster performs.1)  Cord Issues.  There are several reviews that say the cord comes out the front.  Well, thats not entirely accurate because the toaster feartures a cord wrap around structure on the bottom.  So, you wrap it half way around and it comes out the back.  Easy.  5 of 5 stars2) Crumb Tray.  The tray is designed to open by sliding it forward, and then pushing it closed.  Once a person understands that, it works just fine with no issues and does not open on its own.  5 of 5 stars.3) Toasting.  There are no issues at all, works just like it should.  In fact, it toasts very evenly, much more even than my last $100 toaster. 5 of 5 stars.4) Not Heavy.  This toaster  feels very light.  I suppose that's how they lowered the cost of shipping them from China to the USA.  I don't have a problem with that. 5 of 5 stars.5) Looks.  Its awesome looking!  5 of 5 stars6) Controls.  The toaster has a cancel button which stops it from toasting and pops up the toast.  You can't use the handle for this.  I suppose the reason is because the toaster is so light, you would flip it around if you weren't careful.  I like the button.  5 of 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WBCJ0CZEYU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YS1ZAO#wasThisHelpful","R20WBCJ0CZEYU4","AR5XJEZR0LWWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR5XJEZR0LWWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read the reviews before I purchased this cooktop and was fairly prepared for what to expect.  Here is my review ....1.  Infrared Element.  I've had infrared elements in ranges before so I was expecting this unit to be fast at heating, but I was disappointed.  The unit is actually pretty slow at heating up.  Granted, I have never owned a single element cooktop that runs off of 110vac.  But, contrary to other posts, its not fast by any stretch of the imagination. 4 of 5 stars2. Electronic Smell and vapor.  This was a bit alarming, but not totally unexpected from reading the other reviews.  During the first few days of use, the cooktop produces a vapor emanating out of the bottom of the unit combined with an electronic smell.  So far no fires, in fact, the unit has stopped producing those effects after a few days.  3 of 5 stars.3. Style.  I like the handles on the side and the stainless steel look.  5 of 5 stars.4. Temp Control.  Like most infrared cook tops, it is thermostatically controlled.  To fry something, you'll have to crank it all the way up to high.  After a few minutes, the round control knobs does get quite hot, but no fires yet!  The control does give a nice range and the control light when lit, indicates when the unit is on.  4 of 5 starsI admit, I am a little uncomfortable with the heat coming off the control knob.  I keep it unplugged when not in use. This cook top is not UL rated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRYBUC9N5KYRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7F4Q5Q#wasThisHelpful","RRYBUC9N5KYRG","AR5XJEZR0LWWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR5XJEZR0LWWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Movie Review: All is Lost.  I admit, when I was watching this I could almost hear Tom Hanks (star of the movie Cast Away) telling us the movie was a lot like his.  Well, with the exception that All is Lost stars Robert Redford but apparently Wilson decided he'd had enough of survival movies, because Robert has no co-star.  In a way, I suppose its a lot like the movie Gravity too.  Its about survival until the very last option is used up.  Until then, we use our brain and imagination to figure things out.  The setting of this movie is on a modern private sailing boat with the character played by Robert Redford who is alone, making all the tough decisions with out a think tank handy. Of course there are storms, radios that don't work, and survival tools that we all hope will get him through.  If you are bored, and wonder how you could handle it, watch it.  Its not as good at Cast Away or Gravity.

Since its not advertised as having such, there is no rating that I will give on that.3) Quiet operation: Its fairly quiet, but it does make a slight vibration and noise when operating.  4 of 5 stars4) Assembly: It is very simple, not even a need for the instructions.5) Comfort during operation:  Everything is good except the seat - I purchased a replacement.  4 of 5 stars6) Adjustments:  All adjustments are good and make it comfortable to ride.Optional things to consider:* I highly recommend the seat be changed out for this one on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GHVJX4/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1* Cell phone holder: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FHCR20/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1* Cup holder :http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EOZK32W/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39H3K46J0ZT28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046E1MRQ#wasThisHelpful","R39H3K46J0ZT28","AR5XJEZR0LWWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR5XJEZR0LWWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my review of the Fire TV Box.  The main reason why I purchased the Fire TV is because the Amazon App on my Vizio TV has had many problems over the last year.  But, the TV, and all the other Apps are just fine.  So, rather than pay $200 for a Vizio repair man, I decided to purchase the Fire TV box instead.  Clearly, if you don't have a good standalone video streamer, this is a very good buy!1. WiFi Reception.  It really is quite good.  HD Movies come in very strong which is a huge improvement over the Vizio TV Amazon App. The WiFi reception is probably one of the biggest improvements for me. It simply streams without any WiFi issues and plays without buffering. Obviously a lot of that has to do with my connection speed, but I've had problems with buffering with even extremely high internet speeds in the past. The quality of the WiFi allows me to see the movies in HD, when I couldn't before. 10 of 5 stars.2. Size.  The tiny little box is very nice.  The size is very small and yet it works very well. The unit seems to always be on and I'm ok with that.  5 of 5 stars.3. Menus.  The menus are very smooth and responsive with no jitter or lag. I am really impressed with this! Simply move the through the movies with the left or right button on the remote and you can flick through what you like or have watched.  However, there is no way to search for just the free Amazon Prime Streaming movies from the rentals or search for a category like Sci Fi or drama.  Currently the search is for movie titles only. 3 of 5 stars4. Closed Captions. Fire TV has Closed Captions as a selectable option.  This is a big bonus because the Vizio TV app for Amazon does not feature closed captioning.5. Set Up.  Set up was very easy, almost too easy.  10 of 5 stars6. Shipping.  I got this unit it only one day!  Holy Cow, I didn't pay for that, but I am impressed! 5 of 5 stars.7. Kindle Fire HD.  It does not seem to work with my Kindle Fire HD, only the HDX. I spent a lot of money on my Kindle Fire HD, and I am a little disappointed that there is no way to have this feature on my HD. It would seem that Amazon could create an app to make the HD work like the HDX. 0 of 5 stars8. Voice Remote.  Works great the first time. But as already mentioned, the search (even in voice mode) is for titles of movies only. 5 of 5 stars.9. Amazon Account. My Amazon account was already programmed in! 5 of 5 stars10. Forward/pause/rewind. Once a movie is playing, you can forward, pause & rewind and even see a picture of the movie as you scan through it. While you are forwarding or reversing through the movie, where you were is still playing.  That's pretty cool as well! 5 of 5 stars.11. Netflix.  The Netflix app works fine, although the Amazon has more features that are easier to get to. 5 of 5 starsSo, I am very happy with the purchase.  From my own experience with the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 64 gig 8.9, there has never been an Amazon branded device that has worked so flawlessly right out of the box the very first time.  You did really good Jeff! And, because the first Kindle Fire units were not perfect from the beginning, you know I really hesitated on this Fire TV unit.  I am so glad that I went ahead and didn't wait.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8RJL81BPH06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","R3O8RJL81BPH06","AR5XJEZR0LWWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR5XJEZR0LWWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like most plumbing, it would seem that faucet I buy never exactly matches the plumbing so I had to by about $25 extra in hoses with the proper fitting to make this work.  I am not going to mark down my review of this model because of that.  Its simply what happens when we buy plumbing items!  Here is my review  ....1) Valve.  A very good valve with no leaks. Its easy to open and close the valve. 5 of 5 stars2) Professional feel.  Everything is very smooth operating. 5 of 5 stars3) The Finish and looks.  The stainless is very very attractive.  The finish is awesome. With other appliances that I have purchased, the brushed stainless steel isnt as fine as I would like.  This faucet has a very fine brushed look to it.  There is nothing cheap or plastic about this unit.  I suppose the sprayer hose could be nicer, but the black mesh is lighter than a steel connecting hose to the sprayer.  I have no problem with the connecting hose. 5 of 5 stars4) Sprayer and faucet aerator.  Both work exactly as they should.  Further the sprayer has flexible nipples for easy cleaning. The aerator puts air into the solid stream of water which makes it taste better and it works as it should. 5 of 5 stars5) Installation.  This is the only negative about this item.  The connection tubes are very close to the main unit.  So, its quite a reach to use tools to connect the hoses.  Sorry, but I had to give the awesome faucet a lower score on that.  3 of 5 stars.6) Sprayer hose length.  The hose works very well for my deep and very wide double sink.  5 of 5 starsAll in all it was a good purchase and I expect to get years of service from this faucet.***** Follow up 3/27/2014 *******Its been a few weeks using this new faucet and I have had no additional problems or issues other that what has been mentioned in the original review above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GS99YMJ2VTEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00402VN8W#wasThisHelpful","R2GS99YMJ2VTEC","AR5XJEZR0LWWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR5XJEZR0LWWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crazy!  The package that I got says that mounting screws are included, but they are not!  Ok, so, if you were shopping for the best value, then you were taken!  There are no mounting screws even though the package says they are included.  Egads!  Pass on this, by the time you get in your car, go down to Home Depot or Lowe's you just spent another $5 for this item!  SHARKS!  LOLSo, even though I rated the product 1 star for the missing mounting screws, I am going to go ahead and rate the rest of the item...1) Performance.  Like everyone else has said, it opens tops easily.  5 of 5 stars2) Design. The design is a little different than others.  But it works good no matter what the design is.  If you like a more rounded look, than this is better than some of the others. 5 of 5 stars3) Chrome.  The item is still a bit rough, but for those of us that are looking for something a bit ""40's"" decor, this is it. Chrome over rough metal is right up that alley. 5 of 5 starsSo, if you are missing screws like I was, #10 screws work well.  Further, an inexpensive way to keep the bottle cap from rolling on the floor is with a Neodymium magnet just behind the bottle opener.  Here is a link to some: http://www.amazon.com/CMS-Magnetics%C2%AE-Holding-Neodymium-Countersunk/dp/B008H40TK2/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393035148&sr=8-1-fkmr1&keywords=Neodymium+Round+Base+Magnet+with+screw+hole .  Then you dont need a bucket to catch the bottle cap.  I already had some laying around, so it was even cheaper for me.Thank you Amazon for the A to Z promise in making the missing screws a non-issue with a partial refund.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158BLS98SW5U0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SYOCUQ#wasThisHelpful","R158BLS98SW5U0","AR5XJEZR0LWWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR5XJEZR0LWWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At first, you will think you know the ending of this movie from the very start.  You've seen the previews, and yet I can tell you what you have seen is only a small part.  How can someone make a movie with such emotional courage, spiritual inspiration, and sheer determination out of what we have already seen?  But they do, oh they do!It was motivational for me.  What makes it so?  I suppose it's the human side of us. How we control, or not control, our anxiety to survive. When is it time to give up, and when it is not? And, while the special effects don't even seem like special effects, they are more like pure photography.  So too are the sound effects because they don't seem like effects, but the real thing.  They simply allow the movie to be real.If you've ever wanted to go to space, see this movie.  It gives you every angle, every bit of technology, and every fear coupled with the natural laws that matter must obey.  The only thing is, being human is more than a natural order of things.  Bad things do happen in space or right here on earth.  What are you made of? Could you handle it?  This is what this movie is all about.Dr. Ryan Stone played by Sandra Bullock.  She is one of two main characters in the movie. I never once got the impression that she was acting nor did I see any bad acting that spoiled the scene.  She is a doctor, not particularly a life long employee of NASA.  So, she relies on veteran Astronaut Matt Kowalsky played by George Clooney.  His acting well is very similar to his other acting in so many movies; cool, calm and collected and well played.  He gives advice to Dr. Ryan on many times. She is wired with emotions, he is not.  Both are fantastic actors. However, I would like to see a movie where, just once, George Clooney loses it!  That would be fun!Although the plot is fairly simple, taking us through it is not. What technology will fail? What can be improvised? This is probably not a movie that you would see twice.  Unless you really wanted to try and find the few tiny glitches in acting or perhaps some scenes where inertia and gravity theories don't seem quite right and you wanted a second look.  I suppose there might be a few of those.  But that would miss the true point of the movie.In the end, the real point is that you too will thank the Earth for everything she has given you!

"I have a Honda Civic and needed new wiper blades so I decided to search Amazon for something good.

"I've had my Vizio 3D 47"" LED TV for about three years now. My TV weighs 51.8 pounds.  This is my 3rd mount (haha).  The first mount I got was from Sam's Club and was supposed to be designed for flat screens that were up to 47"".  But it was terribly weak, and you could see the tube steel actually warp a bit when moving it.  Then I got another one here on Amazon (Mount-It! Vizio Compatible Swivel TV Mount) but after 6 months, it began to come apart.  Although it never dropped the TV, it was pretty close to doing so.  This one had great reviews, so I thought I would try it. My complete review is below ....1) Strong for the size.  Its about half the weight of other heavy duty adjustable mounts that I have purchased on Amazon before.  Yet its strong and doesn't warp or bend when articulating from side to side.  I am very impressed with it. 5 of 5 stars2) Tilt Adjustment.  The tilt adjustment, which angles the top down or up, is quite good. It uses a flip up lever and when you push down, it clamps it firm. Others use a screw knob which is much more difficult. 5 of 5 stars3) No Level.  This unit does not come with a built in level, but I just used my own. 4 of 5 stars4) Small Base.  As others have said, this unit has a small foot print and could make it difficult to mount in the correct room position.  Fortunately for me, the mounting stud is at the center of where I mount the TV. 3 of 5 stars5) Right and left articulating swing angle.  This type of mount is good because it provides and right and left articulating swing angle.  My eating table is a raised bar height table to the left of the TV.  The swing angle allows me to swing the TV over to the table when I am enjoying a meal.  However, when I am cooking in the kitchen, I need to swing it to the opposite side. The angle is not quite as high as others because the articulating frame is not as long as other mounts do because of its size. But it still works for me and should for most people. 5 of 5 stars6) Overall Design.  I like the way the bolts, especially for the articulating swing mechanism, are easily accessible.  This allows for an easy visual inspection to see if the bolts are tight.  Other mounts have the bolts hidden and can't be adjusted or tightened which could cause the TV to fall if they become loose. 5 of 5 stars7) Level when articulating to the left or right.  As others have mentioned, nearly all these types of mounts to tend to warp a bit when articulating to the extreme left or right.  However, because this works well with my heavy 47"" TV weighing at 51.8 lbs, it does not warp and therefore the level does not need to be readjusted every time I swing to the right or left.  I would say if you have a heavier or larger TV, that might be a problem with this particular mount.  The last mount I purchased did have a better mechanism for leveling after articulating - You just leveled the TV with your hands. So, therefore I would be cautious when using anything above a 50"" TV if you didn't want to mess with the level every time you articulated to the left or right.  Again, I am pleasantly surprised how well it does with my 51.8 lb Vizio 47"" TV.8) Ease of mounting.  I was able to do mount the frame to the wall, and mount the TV to the frame by myself.  Two people would be better, especially if you have a heavier TV. 5 of 5 stars9) Smooth Operation.  The articulating frame is extremely smooth and it doesn't take very much effort to return the TV to the center position.  Its much smoother than the other mounts I have owned. 5 of 5 starsAs others have said, this is a very good mount and strangely strong for how light it is.  I have no problem recommending it for flat screens that are heavy up to 47"" in size.  My previous mount that this one replaced was listed as ""Mount-It! Vizio Compatible Swivel TV Mount for 32-60"" Plasma & LCD"".

"This is Moffo's show all the way, she was perfect for Gilda in every way, voice, looks, and the naive ingenue quality that many other divas failed to project, despite their perhaps greater technical skills (although for sure, Moffo was hardly just some pretty face -- in fact she was amazing -- while her rather too short years at the peak lasted.) I completely agree that the stereo imaging and balance buried too many of the voices in extreme left right balances -- remember, stereo was a new medium when this was made. However, Moffo's assumption of this role soon makes one forget all that -- she is great.

"Exactly what I expected: (1) many obvious outtakes that are marginally interesting (2) a smaller number that, while clearly inferior to the released version, differ enough in detail, wording, instrumental accompaniment, or tempo, to be well worth owning for the Dylan aficionado, and (3) a few extraordinary gems,( eg. an early take Positively 4th St., sung with a deep pathos and hurt of betrayal which, we now realize, underlies snarling anger of the released version); these gems remind you once again that Dylan has left more great music on the cutting room floor than most artists create in a lifetime.

"You've got a basic choice here. For almost the same price you can get the CJ MF 2550, which has twice the power, but does not have Teflon caps. I own the the MF 2550. What I've found so marvelous about the 2550 is the sheer effortlessness of it presentation. I have to wonder if the lower powered 2275 SE, even with the Teflon caps,  could convey that same sense of utter ease, which to me is the heart of the (listening) matter, in a high end system. Admittedly, the 135 wpc of this amp is not trivial, but having owned a number of very good 100-150 WPC amps in my time, I can tell you that something magical happens when you get above 250 watts -- it's like going from a nice V-6 to a great V-8 or V-12 -- everything suddenly becomes so athletic and and fluid. Note also, the 2550 weighs almost twice as much as the 2575 -- all that copper and pig iron in the chassis is not there for decoration, but to provide sheer the sheer grunt needed to handle the most demanding musical peaks. When you are spending this much, it seems to me that  the effortless power trumps the Teflon caps.That said, CJ's remarkable Teflon capacitors have the remarkable ""Windex-clean"" sound that only Teflon caps seem to be able to convey convincingly (after a very painful break-in period). What I did was go for the CJ Classic SE preamp, where the Teflon caps added only $500 to the cost. Matched to the power of the 2550, it's a great combination with high end grunt, and Teflon clarity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R233PJUUSVNEAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVQLTL4#wasThisHelpful","R233PJUUSVNEAX","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This film is a reminder of a third, and less appreciated  aspect of his genius -- what a great actor he was.

Unlike the rest of this set, and most of the Klemperer boxes in the new EMI/Warner series, the sound is rather dull and lacking definition. Too bad, because Klemperer's conducting/arranging  is uncharacteristically stripped down and vivid here, but the lack of grip and bite in the individual instruments, so central to the Brandenburg Concertos, gets rather lost in the mix here.

"Free markets have generated unprecedented prosperity for individuals and societies alike. But, because  free markets also persuade us to buy things that are good neither for us nor for society, they undercut Adam Smith's notion that the individuals' pursuit of self-interest in free, competitive markets advances the interest of society as a whole. It is this conundrum of free markets that forms the core of George Akerlof and Robert Shiller's engaging new book, Phishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception. A ""phool"" is anyone who does not fully comprehend the ubiquity of ""phishing,"" the aggressive marketing and often, outright fraud (or example, Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme) that has become the reality of today's digital-age financial markets.  As too many optimists have learned to their detriment, investing in asset markets is highly complex and fragile, and a whole ocean of phishes has set out to exploit this reality: Borrowers are lured into unsuitable mortgages; financial advisers spin narratives of riches from nowhere; and the media promote extravagant claims.Ackerlof and Shiller's view (supported by plenty of data) is that rapidly rising prices usually reflect irrational exuberance, aided and abetted by phishing. Their main advice is that the financial authorities need to be prepared to intervene when financial turmoil turns into financial crisis. However, simply by the title, I think they are trying to tell us that we are all ""phools"" at one time or another, and that we need to be aware of this in making our investment decisions in our 401Ks and in other investing. This strikes me as a timely recapitulation of the wisest financial advice that has ever been given: ""a phool and his/her money are soon parted.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0B4K17RF436/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691168318#wasThisHelpful","R3M0B4K17RF436","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For sheer elegance and refinement, I doubt that Karajan ever surpassed these early performances, rendered in vintage mono. Another huge plus is that Dennis Brain plays first horn -- his too short career with Karajan was almost entirely in mono. Although the Kingsway Hall recording is a bit distant, it still has plenty of bloom and vividness. The Philharmonia was a brilliant instrument at the time, and Karajan's briskly patrician conducting brought a lean strength to the orchestral playing that's extremely appealing. While Karajan is both precise and elegant, there's also warmth and humor -- I especially enjoyed his startlingly fast tempo for the waltz from Sleeping Beauty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D69GZ91F9XAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DO5H#wasThisHelpful","R1D69GZ91F9XAE","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own the MF2550, which is identical to the MF2550SE except for the use of Teflon capicitors and upgraded Vishay resistors in the latter -- for an extra $2000, which is 50% more. Is it worth it? Yes, but it depends. Everything I say below, from my review of the 2550, is true of the 2550SE, with an addition: Teflon caps add quickness, clarity, and a degree of extension to the higher frequencies. However, my Conrad Johnson preamp Classic SE has Teflon caps, and I thought I had enough in my system already, and adding more could be too much of a good thing. If you are not in that situation, I would go for the SE model, despite the significant price differential. The Teflon caps have an amazing sound. Do be aware, however, that you will need several hundred hours of break-in for the Teflon caps before the amp sounds really good. Here is my review of the MF-2550:  ****I'll get to the point quickly -- this is the best power amp I've heard under $8K-10K. As a 30 year Conrad-Johnson owner, I can attest that it has the warm, balmy, plush CJ sound in every fiber and circuit. It also comes closer to the McIntosh sound than any CJ amp has ever come, which I happen to think is a plus, as I really like the powerful grip and authority that Macs bring to the table. As far as recent CJ power amps, it's more articulate than than the very fine $8,000 CJ ET250s, which I auditioned for several weeks a while back, and found too reticent and slow -- well, maybe I just don't like tubes in my power amp, even if only on the input stage. There's been speculation that this design of this amp is based on the old MacCormack DNA 250, which I think is probably true, but that's like saying the Porsche 356 was based on the VW Beetle, which was also true, but which totally misses the real point. I had the DNA 250, and while it was a good, powerful, quick amp, it really was a great home theater amp IMHO, not satisfactory for true audiophile setups. The MF2550 has the instantaneous rise and thrust of the MacCormack's distributed node power supply, which was the brilliance of the design, without the rustic edges of the MacCormack's often sub-par parts bin. Is it really better than the legendary CJ 350, as CJ's PR dept implies? It's a close call, because overall, the two amps sound very much alike. But, I would say yes, because the MF2550 has 99% of the 350's feeling of effortless power, ease, and extension, but addresses what for me was the sole issue with the 350, the slight tendency to sound ever so slightly aggressive in the midrange at times. The MF2550 is super-sweet in the midrange. I would still not say it is a ""tube"" midrange -- it does not have the lateral expansiveness on voices that many find so engaging, but that others find too blowsy in tube power amps -- but it definitely has the CJ midrange, so intimate and palpable. In short,this is a ravishingly beautiful power amp at a price that will put lots of people into the true high-end sound for the first time. I hope many others will give it an audition -- and a note to McIntosh fans (of which I am one also.) This is the first the CJ amp that to me sounds thoroughly Mac-like in the way the power just grips every note and sound and keeps it under its potent control -- it reminded me a lot of the gorgeous MC452 -- so give it a whirl if you are willing to forgo the blue glow of meters for the burnished gold face of CJ. You will find what you like here too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DG2SW8LZ6BEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZ157UE#wasThisHelpful","R3DG2SW8LZ6BEP","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even though mono sounds a little ""narrower"" than stereo, the Decca engineers worked around that brilliantly.

"If conductor Ferenc Fricsay never again reached quite the level of  his legendary 1950 recording of Der Zauberflote, he can be forgiven. Nobody else did either.  Fricsay was a formidable Mozartian, and his honesty, conviction and above all profound devotion to Mozart has rarely been equaled on disk. His historic 1950 (mono) recording of The Magic Flute, the recipient of a well-deserved Penguin Guide rosette, remains one of the treasures of the back catalog. Clearly the crown jewels of this set are his performances of other major Mozart operas. Long out of print in their original issues, they are almost impossible to find on disk today, and acquiring them used would almost certainly cost more than this entire box set.His 1960 recording of Le Nozze Di Figaro (in stereo) is a distinctive and highly rewarding portrayal of what many consider to be Mozart's finest opera. If Fricsay's tempi are a bit eccentric (and fast) at times, they are nevertheless done with impulse, dynamism and sympathy with the music and the singers. This mastering is an improvement on that found on the Australian Eloquence label, which had been quite good itself.His Don Giovanni was clearly less successful than La Nozze or Flute, but is still of historic interest (one of Fricsay's last recordings). Die Entfuhrung Aus Dem Serail is a bravura performance of this marvelous Mozart opera. Fricsay's direction is just about perfect, and if the tempi seem a little fast at times, it never gets in the way of the singers. Rita Streich and Josef Greindll are truly superb. The clarity and warmth of the sound is outstanding for a mono recording from 1954. The mastering used in this set sounds to me like the later 24-bit (DG Original Image Processing). Frankly, I think I prefer the warmer sound of the first CD issue, but it's a close call. This later remastering provides greater clarity to the orchestral sound, slightly at the expense of making the voices sound just a bit less natural to my ears. However, once you start listening you'll be in such rapture of Rita Streich that you won't care what CD you have -- this is magical. Streich also shines on other recordings here, including her spin as Amour in Orfeo and Euridice (sung in German).Overall, the sound quality is excellent, and thoroughly vintage DG -- clear, clean, precise; bright compared to say Decca, Phillips and EMI, but almost never harsh and dry (that came later, well after Fricsay had passed away). As far as whether there has been any remastering, unfortunately the booklet gives no clue. It's a safe assumption, however, that Polygram followed the same practice here as it did on the mega-sets from Decca and Phillips: using the most recent CD mastering available, but not remastering simply to have a later date. This is fine with me, as ""newer"" is not always better (I am no fan of DG's rather hot 24 bit remasters). Finally, the vintage mono recordings, which make up much of this recording, are superb. In this regard, DG was as good as anyone, including Walter Legge's best work at EMI, which means they are pure magic.If you are a Fricsay fan, as I am, this collection, like Volume I featuring his orchestral works,  is self-recommending. He was a genius of eloquence, lyricism, and understatement, with a fine sense of dance and dynamism that he could summon at will when the music required it, but never as a means of superimposing himself on the music just to plump his own ego, Sadly, Fricsay did not live long enough to take the victory laps he so richly deserved in his lifetime. This and Vol I will, I hope, serve as that tribute.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CU8PB91P0292/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6ET93W#wasThisHelpful","R3CU8PB91P0292","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a slightly different view than some of the commenters on the desirability of newer remastering on these recordings.  The ""digital edge"" that a few people have noted is in many cases, unfortunately, not a digital artifact, but the way DG recorded many of these originally in analog. They liked a bright, analytic sound then, and frankly, they sounded pretty spectacular in the LP era. Unfortunately, the CD versions tend to accentuate this characteristic. The best DG transfers to CD were made before 1995 IMO. The later 24 bit and still later subsequent remasterings, if anything, tend to accentuate the analytic DG engineering of the late 60s and 70s even more. (Most DG recordings in the 80s were digital -- not much you can do to help those.) All that aside, these are superb performances, and pretty soon you'll care not at all about the mastering details and get to the real point -- this is great Opera conducted by ""the maestro."" If there is a glaring omission on this set it is the marvelous opera recordings he did for EMI, particularly the mono recordings of Nozze de Figaro and the Magic Flute. This was the young Karajan before he became ""Karajan,"" and the frisky deftness of his conducting was something he was never again able to muster in his later, more ""serious"" performances. No set of his opera recordings is truly complete without them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DI7U6Q5S12EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ULE2W42#wasThisHelpful","R1DI7U6Q5S12EW","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hesitated at first, wondering how the mono would sound. Having listened to many of the recordings, I am now very happy I that I went ahead and bought the set. You soon forget that it is not stereo, and just listen to the performances, which are memorable. Even though mono sounds a little ""narrower"" than stereo, the Decca engineers worked around that brilliantly. What is lost in side to side expansion is made up for in the front to back depth of the sound -- it almost sounds 3-dimensional at times. Think about how great the Beatles mono set sounded -- different from stereo, but still riveting in its way, sometimes more so. I felt the same way listening to this. So glad I have it, and I thank Decca/Polygram for reissuing these great recordings and performances for all time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F9497X5Q4RBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QHL0V3C#wasThisHelpful","R1F9497X5Q4RBF","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though definitely a cheaply produced, 1960s period piece, Putney Swope still manages to serve up an interesting cocktail of early-Woody Allen type comedy shaken, not stirred, with biting social satire. It builds upon a clever role reversal premise, in which '60s ""movement"" black radicals take over a stodgy Madison Ave ad agency. If its message that no good deed goes unpunished, and that people of all colors are infinitely corruptible, now seems dated, it's only because culturally subversive underground movies like Putney Swope helped make these ideas mainstream in the '60s.

"This amp wasn't out when I bought my MF 2550 last year, and in a way I'm glad, because I might have bought it to save money. Nothing wrong with that,  but I suspect it would have been the wrong choice for me, and maybe for you too, if you are looking for that last bit of high end sound. What I've found so marvelous about the 2550 is the sheer effortlessness of it presentation. I have to wonder if the lower powered 2275 could convey that same sense of utter ease, which to me is the heart of the (listening) matter, in a high end system. Admittedly, 135 wpc is not trivial, but having owned a number of very good 100-150 WPC amps in my time, I can tell you that something magical happens when you get above 250 watts -- it's like going from a nice V-6 to a great V-8 or V-12 -- everything suddenly becomes so athletic and and fluid.  Note also, the 2550 weighs almost twice as much as the 2575 -- all that copper and pig iron in the chassis is not there for decoration, but to provide sheer the sheer grunt needed to handle the most demanding musical peaks.  When you are spending this much,  an extra $1000 strikes me as not that big a deal to get to the true high end sound --  all the more so if you are buying online, and can't A-B directly. That said, I have not heard the 2275, and am looking forward to reviews from others in this space. Moreover, CJ also makes an SE edition of the 2275,  which has CJ's remarkable Teflon capacitors, which have the remarkable ""Windex-clean"" sound that only Teflon caps seem to be able to convey convincingly (after a very painful break-in period). Since the 2275 SE sells for only slightly more than the non-SE 2550 that I have, that strikes me as closer call, if you really don't need the power of the 2550 models (and like the somewhat less ""romantic"" Teflon sound).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KUHTLYE1XQMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRBCDE6#wasThisHelpful","R1KUHTLYE1XQMB","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In this latest, Third edition, Professor Shiller updates the text to reflect developments since the 2005 second edition.  This first edition of this book, in 2000, was a broad study, drawing on a wide range of published research and historical evidence, of the enormous stock market boom that started around 1982 and picked up incredible speed after 1995. The book argued that the boom represented a speculative bubble, not grounded in sensible economic fundamentals. The second edition, in 2005, added an analysis of the real estate bubble as similar to the stock market bubble that preceded it, and warned that ""Significant further rises in these markets could lead, eventually, to even more significant declines."" Alas, both predictions turned out to be true, as we now all know. In this latest edition, Professor Shiller updates his argument, and augments his arguments, and adds an important new chapter on the bond market, which many feel is also in bubble territory.

"An opera critic once wrote of a Maria Callas performance that she ""plunged into the score...absorbing every note and expression mark,"" with the result that ""the wealth of detail her voice unearths is breathtaking. It is as if an old painting, familiar but dim, has been cleaned to its original tints.""

Long familiar performances from the age of the LP and from two earlier CD transfers now leap our to the listener with new and vivid clarity of sound. Warner Classics, which acquired EMI, the company that produced most of the Callas recordings, went back to the original master tapes and production notes from the recording sessions to create what must surely be the definitive digital version of our age. (The book included in the complete set gives a detailed account of the process.) Listening primarily on CD (not vinyl), I was immediately able to hear the difference that the new remastering has made.  It is a revelation. By bringing us as close as we can come to what she must have sounded like, at least in the studio, Callas Remastered is a priceless opportunity to rediscover what made her such a sensation. She simply sounded like no one else. As one Italian critic described her, she was ""a star wandering into a planetary system not its own."" Hearing these beautiful recordings brought to life again, brings her miraculous wanderings to life once gain. Much the same can be said for the vinyl version, except that based on my limited listening, there were a few more clicks and pops than I would have expected -- however, it's minor -- and as expected, the vinyl has a bit more warmth than the CD versions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQRTC4J1S9B3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH9NFSQ#wasThisHelpful","RFQRTC4J1S9B3","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of particular interest, he adds an important new chapter on the bond market, which many feel is also in bubble territory. The good news is that, while Professor Shiller says that returns in all asset classes are likely to be subpar for some years given today's elevated asset prices, the mood is less somber than in previous editions, and there are no warnings of imminent doom, as in previous editions.  In particular, he does not see a classic ""bubble"" in bonds, due to the lack of ""exuberance"" -- prices for bonds are being bid up reluctantly by investors, he says, which is not the formula for a bubble. However, he certainly balances that somewhat comforting news with a realistic view of the risks that the current situation presents to investors and savers of all types, stocks, bonds, housing, and savings accounts. His main piece of advice to all Americans concerned about their financial future may be the most sensible piece of financial advice ever written: spend less, save more! Yes, we all know that, but when the winner of the 2013 Nobel prize says that, it really means something.I find Professor Shiller's writing style highly enjoyable, not at all like most economics books. The plain-spoken style is smart, wry, and often witty, and there are almost no mathematical formulas, except in the occasional technical notes in back. The book also talks about a lot of factors that are intrinsically interesting to non-economists.  For example, it has chapters devoted cultural factors in investing; the effects of the news media;  ""new era"" economic thinking; psychological factors; psychological anchors for the market and herd behavior.Professor Shiller ends by offering a lot of good, commonsense advice to both policymakers and investors, large and small. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand what's behind the current anxiety, turmoil, and hopes, for a brighter financial future for all Americans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WXF5WGIG7PN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691166269#wasThisHelpful","R5WXF5WGIG7PN","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Murray Kempton was a mid 20th century New York newspaper columnist - make that uber-Manhattan-liberal columnist --  whose graceful prose, originality of insight, and sheer intelligence won him a large audience not only among traditional liberals, but in the conservative sector, most famously, his dear friend William F. Buckley, Jr. His profiles tended to focus on the lives of the obscure and down-trodden, yet, with exceptional grace, he was able to tie the insights into the lives of the many, from the rich to the working middle class.  His method of argument was almost classical, in the style of Cicero and the great Latin writers, yet grounded in 20th century humanism. While the subject matter of many of these essays - news items that only made the back pages of newspaper even in their time (mid-to late 20th century New York), the elegantly precise style and keen insights into human nature are timeless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9YXAOUW7JFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812922948#wasThisHelpful","R1W9YXAOUW7JFW","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was said that while Bach could write boring music, he could never write bad music. I would say much the same about Martin Scorsese.  The technical virtuosity and visual brilliance on display here prevent me from calling this a ""bad"" movie. But, about midway through this 3-hour marathon, I found myself wishing that it would be over sooner rather than later. The script is largely episodic, with not enough of a story narrative or arc to sustain interest. Some individual scenes are truly brilllinat, but because the overall plot structure is so weak, they come off more as brilliant acting school vignettes, rather than a part that enhances the whole. Scorsese fans will love it, because it is so self-referencing, even to the point of DiCaprio doing a perfect Ray Liota impression from Goodfellas. But is that enough of a reason to sit through 3 hours of this? For me, no.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SM11SDB89M6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIUATDM#wasThisHelpful","R2SM11SDB89M6N","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's put aside for a moment the quality of the performances, which are clearly self-recommending as soon as you see the roster of great Decca artists of the era, the likes of Ansermet, Serafin-Tebaldi-Bergonzi, Solti, Monteux, and even the occasional Karajan (better known for his work with DG and EMI). What has to be recognized here is the inspired work of the Decca engineers in the 1950s and early 1960s, the very dawn of the age of the LP. They must surely have realized that, given the limitations of home audio systems of the era, very little of their extraordinary work was likely to be heard by their listeners -- yet they went ahead and did their work magnificently anyway, not cutting a single corner or compromising their standards in the least. Now, thanks to the wonders of today's audio systems and the compact disc, we get to unlock and enjoy all of the inspired work they now present to us -- not because they had to, but, surely, as an act of faith in the enduring legacy of great music in the future. With this set, I can only say thank you guys (and gals), your faith has been rewarded.

"Callas' Medea, recorded by EMI for Dischi Ricordi (the owner of the rights to the performance) in September 1957, has been remastered by EMI with brilliance and immediacy. Although the rich envelope of sound in Callas's 1957 voice, present on the  earlier CD version, is a bit diminished here,  there can be no doubt that this new remastering is a thrilling, if somewhat bright rendering of this classic performance. Callas's studio Medea (ie., this one) has often been described been as ""tired-sounding,"" perhaps because of the lackluster sonics in most LP versions. While the earlier EMI CD edition was quite strong, the bright, dry sound of this new remastering presents Callas with an incisiveness not dissimilar from her live recordings in the role.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEFTHFF40PFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000630T#wasThisHelpful","RPEFTHFF40PFI","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As much as I welcome this latest (and probably last) installment of Richard Ford's momentous Frank Bascombe cycle, this series of four short stories/novellas strikes me not as something new, but more like a series out-takes from Lay of the Land. Though a few years older, Frank is exactly the same guy he was in LOTL, and nothing he does is in anyway different from what I think he would have done as the grizzled, world weary survivor (of life, first, prostate cancer only secondarily) of the earlier novel. In short, there has been no discernible character development since LOTL, which from an artistic and compositional standpoint, renders this modest collection largely superfluous. With that in mind, one must also note that Richard Ford's writing is as good as ever here, pretty much the best around since Updike's premature and much-lamented departure, and the collection is not without Ford's trademark flourishes of humane and poignant pathos. I will also say that I enjoyed reading it despite the obvious limitations, and do recommend it to those who are still curious to see how old Frank is handling the latest insults to our universally shared, and often frustrating existence in the early 21st century.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHKFYGQIQQ79Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061692069#wasThisHelpful","RHKFYGQIQQ79Q","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I went into this knowing that the series ended rather deus et machina due to the premature death of the screenwriter after just 6 episodes, I was able to enjoy it on its own terms, as one might enjoy Schubert's Unfinished symphony. What there is of it is quite rewarding, a challenging ""what if"" exploration of what life in occupied Great Britain might have been like, using the historical background of an actual occupation of a channel island as a proxy for the larger country. What we find is people on both sides, German and English, revealing themselves to be first and foremost human beings, interested in their own survival and that of their love ones, under the most difficult of situations. The terrain is fraught with moral ambiguities, as real life in war must always be, but that movies studiously avoid, in favor of black and white portrayals of ""evil"" enemies vs. ""good"" patriots. The subject matter is uncomfortable at times -- there is not the least suggestion in the film that Nazi Germany was anything other than the purest form of evil ever invented. Yet, people had to find a way to live together, even if one group were jailers and the others their hostages, as people do. What makes this work in the end is the acting, good on both sides, which is able to convey this human and moral ambiguity honestly and convincingly, a achievement for which this series earns my 5-star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T31GC67QR2BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006Q93F6#wasThisHelpful","R3T31GC67QR2BB","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although one might quibble with the DG sound engineering in the era of these recordings -- on the dry, analytic side, and rather closely miked -- there can be no question with regard to the performances, which are impeccable. Here you get the full range of DG's top artists and conductors of the 60, 70s, 80s and 90s -- Kleiber, Fricsay, Karajan, and Bohm -- as well as some of its most legendary recordings, many of which were bestsellers, both instrumental and operatic, in their day.

"While these are priceless, historic recordings beautifully sung by the auteur herself, I'm afraid the mastering has been badly muffed. Instead of allowing  the authentic sound of the demo tapes to shine through, with the intimate sonic limitations of all demo master tapes, which were never intended for public release, the engineers apparently decided that they could ""improve"" and ""modernize"" the sound via hi-tech digital processing. So instead of having a beautiful period restoration of the tapes as they actually sound, what we have here is a horribly compressed, loud, and hot mastering. It is totally unnatural, and almost unlistenably shrill sonically And let me emphasize again, I am not talking about the limitations of the original demo tapes, which I would have been happy to accept in anything close to their original form. So yes, if you love Carole King and great music, you will still enjoy this, but in a much diminished  form that does not do justice to the genius of Carole King, nor to what I consider the natural beauty of her singing her own compositions, as she originally conceived them. I hope if when they dig deeper into the CK vault in the future, they will treat subsequent releases with greater respect for their sonic and artistic integrity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P5OO3GDTQ3P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EM6FTW#wasThisHelpful","R1P5OO3GDTQ3P7","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need not comment on the performances, as PaLi/Pl/Le are now enshrined in the annals of great rock, and always will be (PaLi is often ranked as a top 100 of the century.) This is strictly on the sound, which is extremely good. There are many transfers of both these songs and these two albums floating about. Aside from one very expensive Mobil Fidelity transfer which is now out of print, these are the best sounding CDs I have encountered, and are really quite natural sounding. The main competition is the 2001 remasters, which many complain are too bright, and the original Chrysalis CDs, which many feel are too soft and muddy. Exactly where these transfers came from I do not know, but this is a European pressing, which may have used masters sent over to the EU in the earlier days of LP. In any event, they are nicely done, totally non-compressed, and not digitally processed sounding at all. Quite similar to the original LPs, which were quite good.

On my set, only the Flute is in mono, as it was recorded in mono. The other three were recorded in stereo, and are presented this way on my set.Of the these four operas, three have become not only my favorite performances of the opera, but my favorite recordings. Yes, the Magic Flute is in mono, and a bit boxy, but there is a warmth and integrity to the sound that even many stereo recordings never capture. Of course, Fricsay's conducting is superb, and Rita Streich's Queen of the Night, which she was never able to perform on stage, is the best on record IMHO. The 1955 Decca stereo on Figaro and Don Giovanni is a bit tubby in the bass, but the ambiance is wonderful, with great clarity to the voices. The stars of both performances is Hilde Gueden, although Kleiber's conducting on Figaro also earns a place in the Hall of Legends.

"Ok, I admit that most of these songs sound like out-takes from Nine Objects of Desire (1996) and Songs In Red And Gray (2001). They are very much in that syncopated, confessional  ballad style that SV so brilliantly invented and explored on those two albums (and then largely abandoned on Beauty & Crime). While it is true that none of the new songs, with the exception of ""Horizon (There Is a Road),"" is at the same high level as the earlier efforts, if you liked NOoD and SIR&G, you will definitely like hearing that distinctive style lovingly revisited again here. I will also say that even a ""high B"" effort from SV is more intelligent, lyrical, and musical than 99% of what else is around, which is why I give this album 5 stars without the least reservation. Suzanne Vega is a musical and artistic tour de force of one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R174GB9XCPSO8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H312W4G#wasThisHelpful","R174GB9XCPSO8V","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If your a Fricsay fan, as I am, this collection is self-recommending, so you don't need my additional comments on his immense gifts as a conductor nor the quality of the performances, which are manifestly exceptional. He was a genius of eloquence, lyricism, and understatement, with a fine sense of dance and dynamism that he could summon at will when the music required it, but never as a means of superimposing himself on the music just to plump his own ego, the failing of a another great German conductor who shall remain nameless. (Although early in the ""other"" conductor's career, he could be as delicious and deft as Fricsay, who sadly, never lived long enough to take the victory laps he so richly deserved.) My main contribution here is on the sound quality -- it is excellent, and thoroughly vintage DG -- clear, clean, precise; bright compared to say Decca, Phillips and EMI, but almost never harsh and dry (that came later, well after Fricsay had passed away). As far as whether there has been any remastering, unfortunately the booklet gives no clue. It's a safe assumption, however, that Polygram followed the same practice here as it did on the mega-sets from Decca and Phillips: using the most recent CD mastering available, but not remastering simply to have a later date. This is fine with me, as ""newer"" is not always better (I am no fan of DG's rather hot 24 bit remasters). Finally, the vintage mono recordings, which make up much of this recording, are superb. In this regard, DG was as good as anyone, including Walter Legge's best work at EMI, which means they are pure magic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12KBW6AARSJFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K12RE92#wasThisHelpful","R12KBW6AARSJFP","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll get to the point quickly -- this is the best power amp I've heard under $8K-10K. As a 30 year Conrad-Johnson owner, I can attest that it has the warm, balmy, plush CJ sound in every fiber and circuit. It also comes closer to the McIntosh sound than any CJ amp has ever come, which I happen to think is a plus, as I really like the powerful grip and authority that Macs bring to the table. As far as recent CJ power amps, it's more articulate than than the very fine $8,000 CJ ET250s, which I auditioned for several weeks a while back, and found too reticent and slow -- well, maybe I just don't like tubes in my power amp, even if only on the input stage. There's been speculation that this design of this amp is based on the old MacCormack DNA 250, which I think is probably true, but that's like saying the Porsche 356 was based on the VW Beetle, which was also true, but which totally misses the real point. I had the DNA 250, and while it was a good, powerful, quick amp, it really was a great home theater amp IMHO, not satisfactory for true audiophile setups. The MF2550 has the instantaneous rise and thrust of the MacCormack's distributed node power supply, which was the brilliance of the design, without the rustic edges of the MacCormack's often sub-par parts bin. Is it really better than the legendary CJ 350, as CJ's PR dept implies? It's a close call, because overall, the two amps sound very much alike. But, I would say yes, because the MF2550 has 99% of the 350's feeling of effortless power, ease, and extension, but addresses what for me was the sole issue with the 350, the slight tendency to sound ever so slightly aggressive in the midrange at times. The MF2550 is super-sweet in the midrange. I would still not say it is a ""tube"" midrange -- it does not have the lateral expansiveness on voices that many find so engaging, but that others find too blowsy in tube power amps -- but it definitely has the CJ midrange, so intimate and palpable. In short,this is a ravishingly beautiful power amp at a price that will put lots of people into the true high-end sound for the first time. I hope many others will give it an audition -- and a note to McIntosh fans (of which I am one also.) This is the first the CJ amp that to me sounds thoroughly Mac-like in the way the power just grips every note and sound and keeps it under its potent control -- it reminded me a lot of the gorgeous MC452 -- so give it a whirl if you are willing to forgo the blue glow of meters for the burnished gold face of CJ. You will find what you like here too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1ULI05MI3BG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZ1HA0Y#wasThisHelpful","R2V1ULI05MI3BG","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the conducting, Fricsay was a formidable Mozartian. However, Seefried was really off her game here, and a Nozze di Figaro with a sub-par Susanna simply can't succeed, no matter how good the conducting or the singing by others in the cast. A shame, because we have so little of Fricsay's best work available in good sound, due to his premature death.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GJGKO0LWA4PU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E56D#wasThisHelpful","R2GJGKO0LWA4PU","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because La Divina was so masterful with her roles of tragic women, e.g., Norma, Lucia ,Violetta and Tosca, her versatility and genius for playing comedic roles tended to be overlooked. This recording, vividly transferred to CD by EMI, reveals just how good she was in the comedic genre, playing the role of Fiorilla with wit and charm. Strong performances are also put in by Selim, a young sounding Nicolai Gedda, and Stabile in his role as Prosdocimo. Overall this is a fine Il Turco in Italia, with Callas at her comedic best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJGKQH8CZ0EML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TEPEV2#wasThisHelpful","RJGKQH8CZ0EML","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The performance here is 6-star, but the sound is 2-star at best, so I gave it 3-stars, which I hate to do on a great Tebaldi triumph like this. The source appears to have been vinyl, but that's not the problem. It's that the engineers, presumably seeking to ""modernize"" the sound, have added some annoying digital artifacts, especially to the voices -- excessive sharpening of the ""edges,"" which creates at times a distracting whistle/ringng to the consonants. It's still listenable -- this is Tebaldi and Gueden after all-- but it could and should have been a lot better IMHO. I'd be curious if anyone who has bought the 11 disc Tebaldi opera set from Decca, which has this on it, has noticed the same mastering issue for this opera on that set. This 2-disc set is apparently a CD-R on demand, which may be part of the problem.Update: August 5, 2014: I have now confirmed that this is not a CD-R on demand. The original Amazon listing of CD-R has been corrected. It still sounds rather too edgy to me for a mono recording from 1950, but despite that, I hope that my comments on the sound will not stop people from listening to this great early Tebaldi & Gueden collaboration -- and I have raised the rating to 4 stars to reflect that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHWDHMY5ZCSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000421S#wasThisHelpful","R1GHWDHMY5ZCSF","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Instead of using the EMI remasters from the 1985-1994 first generation CDs, this set, like the other Callas EMI studio recordings still in print, uses the 1997 Callas Edition remaster or the later 2000-2002 remaster, which are notoriously bad, and have been the subject of extensive negative commentary in scholarly and lay publications, as well as on this site. The ART/EMI remastering has been a fiasco, removing the tape hiss, and not incidentally, most of the life, immediacy, and exquisite articulation that made Callas the legend she was. Instead of going back to the master tapes, as it did with the first generation CDs, what the EMI engineers did in 1997 and later was was go back to the first generation CD masters, and fiddle with them to get a more ""modern,"" ""hotter"" sound, using digital processing that sounds, actually, quite digital.

They don't bother me, personally, as they are to me a bit like specks on an Old Masters painting, where more damage is done to remove them. The 1997 remasters did clean up many of the tape splice /tape drag type issues, but even then, they made some mistakes that would be comic if they weren't so damaging. For example, in the Mario, Mario, Mario entrance on Tosca, the 1997 remaster engineer managed to remove Walter Legge's careful production technique of having Callas walk up closer to microphone with each succeeding ""Mario"" to simulate her approaching from out of the room. Hearing the footsteps, and mistaking them for tape splice noise, the engineer simply took the third ""Mario"" and looped it three times, completely destroying Legge's carefully orchestrated effect. To their credit, the 2002 remaster of Tosca corrected this obvious flaw, but is otherwise horrible, as before.

"This is a legendary performance of Don Giovanni from the 1950 Salzburg, but unfortunately, the sound quality is poor, even by the standards of the 1950s. It sounds like it was taken from a vinyl or 78RPM source, which can be quite ok in some cases, and in fact, the Fritz Busch from 1936 on EMI sounds amazingly good. But this one certainly does not sound good -- thin, attenuated, and barely listenable. I hope there is a better source available somewhere as I would love to hear this in better sound.

"While no selection of highlights could ever do Mozart's comic masterpiece full justice, this one makes virtually no attempt to be as fair or as inclusive as possible. Measuring in almost 14 minutes short of full CD capacity, it manages to leave out two of the most beloved duets in Act I, as well as other famous set pieces later in the opera, while including others that, while certainly enjoyable, are far less beloved by opera buffs. Perhaps, the selection was originally made for cassette tapes, but that's hardly a good excuse. On the positive side, the sound quality of what is there is excellent, but given how cheap some of the complete recordings have become as age of the CD wanes, you would be well advised to put your money into the complete set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMZ9Q50XWOU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000042FL#wasThisHelpful","R2LMZ9Q50XWOU0","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I generally like the remasters from Eloquence Australian, they tend to be quite bright and well-lit. Usually, that's salubrious, but this one goes too far in that direction for my taste. (Although disc 1, the earlier symphonies, has less of a problem.) The orchestra loses bloom, and the violins become too prominent. While the performance is self-recommending, the sound may not please those who remember the way these sounded in the Golden Age of the LP.

"This appears to be a reissue of the original RCA Opera Series CD release, not a remaster, which is just as well, as the sound was excellent for the era and still is. Recorded in New York in 1959 during the Met season, it has much of the immediacy of a live performance, even though it was recorded in the studio. Leonard Warren and Leonie Rysanek have great and convincing chemistry in the lead roles. Warren sings with kingly grandeur, yet also with the tormented soul of a (somewhat?) unwilling murderer. Rysanek's beautiful voice soars not only in her two great arias and sleep-walking scene, but even in the crowd scenes, which is quite an accomplishment. Carlo Bergonzi and Jerome Hines also offer excellent singing, as does the Chorus of Witches. As in many recordings in the early days of stereo, there is too much left/right extreme in the voice placement at times, but at the same time, the engineering on 16 and 32 ips tape was full-throttle and rich in ways that are still pleasing to the ear. Despite the period limitations, the overall sound and the great performances still make it my top recording of Verdi's great Shakespearean thriller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356VF98UF5LRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QM8HTY#wasThisHelpful","R356VF98UF5LRN","A2REQUI85URT87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQUI85URT87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the original RCA Victor Opera Series release of Aida. Despite a somewhat muffled midrange, it is still prferable IMO to the recent 24 bit/remastered reissue from Sony/BMG. While the new mastering adds a considerable degree of brilliance and immediacy, the rich envelope of sound present in this earlier version has been lost, and the new transfer lacks the musical weight that is so crucial to Aida. However, if you don't feel like tracking down the original CD release, which is long out of print,  or in fact prefer the greater incisiveness of the remastered sound (despite the loss of vocal core and plushness), the new reissue is may be the one for you.

"The standout track for me personally is title track “Faithful,” featuring Russ Lee and co-written with All Sons and Daughters. The song is an upbeat worship declaration in the style of ""Psalm 40"" sung with a stirring passion and filled with prayerful lyrics. This is an incredible song for the Church. You'll worship our King Jesus right along with Russ, in particular the proclamation in the bridge. “Faithful” gives me a lot of joy, and my heartbeat is to please the Lord. I love songs that allow me to have fun and praise God at the same time, and this song certainly does that. I really enjoy how my love of fun, uplifting music and biblical truth is perfectly married in this song. The song also is a great reminder that our circumstances don’t define our joy. Our position in Christ and His unending faithfulness is worthy of all of our praise and adoration. The song reflects the conviction and strength we can all have as God's army of dry bones who are filled with God's breath, and then we can breathe out as prophesied in Ezekiel 37. We live in a fallen and sinful world. One day we will have a new heaven and a new earth and until then we need to all pray: “When the whole earth shakes, and the mountains quake, I won't be afraid because You are faithful, Falling on my knees, still You’re holding me, I won't be afraid because You are faithful.” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HW3KCDI6EFT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D9R866#wasThisHelpful","R2HW3KCDI6EFT8","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nobody does tours like NewSong. When the group introduced its annual ""Winter Jam Tour Spectacular"" in 1995, NewSong started to change the public face of Christian music. The mega-event on wheels has become one of the Gospel music world's biggest annual tours, with some history-making moments along the way. To this day, NewSong's multi-artist, ticketless concerts give thousands the opportunity not only to hear incredible music but, of course, to also hear the Gospel message.Known for their live shows, NewSong has delivered their first live worship album in ten years, Faithful (Live), an intimate recording focusing on their acoustic concerts captured in the round. This collection brought the band back to the heart of what they do, leading people in worship.“Angels” is inspired by 1 Peter 1:12 and was written by NewSong’s Eddie Carswell and Seth Mosley. “The whole idea that there are things angels long to see and know that God shows to us,” Carswell explains, “that He loves us to the point of coming to us because we couldn’t get to Him, it was just an exciting concept to try to write about.”The song features Russ Lee’s tender and powerful vocals and takes listeners on an emotional and spiritual journey with every lyric sung about faith in our God Almighty, our Lord and Savior, Jesus. The bridge of “Angels” is very stirring and convicting. I'm really engaged by the emotional vocals and the deep, prayerful lyrics throughout the album.The standout track for me personally is title track “Faithful,” featuring Russ Lee and co-written with All Sons and Daughters. The song is an upbeat worship declaration in the style of ""Psalm 40"" sung with a stirring passion and filled with prayerful lyrics. This is an incredible song for the Church. You'll worship our King Jesus right along with Russ, in particular the proclamation in the bridge: “When the whole earth shakes and the mountains quake, I won't be afraid because You are faithful, Falling on my knees, still You’re holding me.”Other ‘new song’ highlights include “Hallelujah (Bride in White),” co-written with Elias Dummer of The City Harmonic with an open invitation to sing hallelujah and “Keep Me Close,” a soaring prayer of surrender, co-written by Matthew West.Matt Butler sings a worshipful rendition of Hillsong’s “This I Believe (The Creed)” which features tender and powerful vocals and takes listeners on an emotional and spiritual journey with every lyric sung about faith in our God Almighty, our Lord and Savior, Jesus. The chorus is very stirring and convicting: ""I believe in God our Father, I believe in Christ the Son... I believe in the resurrection, that we will rise again, I believe in the name of Jesus."" The song is a great call to worship, and is a fresh offering of praise for the Church.NewSong’s cover of Desperation Band’s “Make a Way” is a gorgeous offering of praise to the only One who has power to save. It is a very sing-able song for the Church, and I love singing about how Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life, and no one comes to Father except through Him. That’s cause to stir your heart to sing at the top of your lungs, “Jesus, it’s always been You, Jesus, It always will be You.”The beauty and majesty of our King Jesus is reverently captured throughout the album with anthem after anthem, including “This Beating Heart,” “Yours,” “Always” and “Give Me Faith.""Closing Thoughts (Staff Review, NewReleaseToday.com):Like NewSong’s last live worship album, Rescue, which featured a mix of a couple of original tracks and mostly worship covers, including “Arise My Love,” “Blessed Be Your Name” and “Rescue,” this album is a wonderful return and offers a more balanced mix of originals and fresh new renditions of songs for the Church. These are very passionate worship songs sung with vocal sincerity and reverence with biblically based lyrics.There are several instantly sing-able and worshipful arrangements that you'll want to add to your Sunday morning set-list. I especially recommend “Hallelujah (Bride in White),” “This Beating Heart,” “Keep Me Close,” “Yours,” “Always,” “Rock of Ages” and one of my top worship songs of the year, ""Faithful.""

"""He’s Still  Here"" is just a foretaste of what I consider to be Chris August's best overall album, and is a thesis statement deeply rooted in the Word of God, which is how Chris was inspired to write these songs and come out of darkness and deep depression into ""His marvelous light."" God’s resurrection power from The Holy Spirit, that same power that defeated death and raised Jesus from the grave, is available to followers of Jesus. I love the translation of Romans 8:11 (Voice): ""If the Spirit of the One who resurrected Jesus from the dead lives inside of you, then you can be sure that He who raised Him will cast the light of life into your mortal bodies through the life-giving power of the Spirit residing in you."" Jesus is ever true to His Word. What He spoke on earth, He affirms in heaven. The Word is a message of grace. We can all take comfort in the Truth expressed in this song which comes directly from God's Word: ""Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.""  We can all make the choice to ask The Holy Spirit to indwell us with His supernatural ability to overcome what the Enemy wants us to think about ourselves. That’s what this song is all about. We are aware of many situations involving people dealing with depression. Chris’s hope is to pass on the life-giving message of Jesus Christ. As Chris so powerfully urges in this song, ""He's still here, still movin' after all these years, And He never disappeared, Our God yesterday is our God today, He's still here."" Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZ2MPAXOC51Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0V12FG#wasThisHelpful","RZZ2MPAXOC51Z","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great and challenging song for believers. Many times we keep our faith to ourselves or maybe we just talk about the love of Jesus with fellow Christians. If the spirit of love is a basic element in Christian faith, then the expression of love is an integral part of faith. This expression of love constitutes faith in action. This song reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. This song invites listeners to ask themselves the question how can you be reckless for love? Remember these words, “All you are and will be starts to intertwine, you’ve got a lot to give, be reckless for love.” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YRRZ4UH8JIHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDX13L0#wasThisHelpful","R1YRRZ4UH8JIHG","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""How I love You, How I love You, You have not forsaken me, How I love You, How I love You, Here is where I want to be"" sings the gorgeous bridge of ""Shepherd,"" led by Amanda Cook. It is one of the standout songs on this compelling collection of songs, Brave New World. The album focuses on the central themes of asking God to inhabit our inner being and truly allow the power of the Holy Spirit to sanctify us, along with relying solely on the love of Jesus to mold our hearts and make us more like Him. The theme of trusting God completely weaves through all of the songs, a message that all believers need to hear. This album is best described as a worship experience with an ethereal worshipful tone, similar to Kim Walker-Smith and Jesus Culture. Amanda has consistently impressed me with her mature faith and sincere desire to serve Jesus. Being a Christian father of three young daughters, these songs all reflect the yearning for Jesus to make us brave that I pray for my daughters' to feel in their hearts as well. Every song completely focuses me as a listener on joining in praise, worship and adoration of our beautiful King Jesus, with reminders that ""You taught my feet, To dance upon disappointment, And I, I will worship."" Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJ45TZ9DJV0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DINOAC#wasThisHelpful","R3PJ45TZ9DJV0K","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Believing the words of this song is a great way to work on the disciplines of self-examination and prayer. You can know Jesus personally. Reach out to Him and know with certainty: ""perfect love casts out fear."" Amanda has been writing and singing with her breath, given to her by God, into anointed new songs for the church. You'll be blessed by this powerful song which is a stand-out anthem with a convicting declaration:  “Awake my soul to sing, With Your breath in me, I will worship, You taught my feet, To dance upon disappointment, And I, I will worship.” This song reflects the conviction and strength we can all have as God's army of dry bones who are filled with God's breath, and then we can breathe out as prophesied in Ezekiel 37. For the saved in Christ, one day ""God will wipe away every tear, there will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying."" As believers, we all need to live for Heaven and not get depressed or angry about our fallen world. Pain and suffering and disappointments point us to God and how much we need Him. If you have put all of your hope and trust in Jesus Christ for your salvation, you can sing along with a loud voice: “Hallelujah, Hallelujah, You are making all things new.” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SOE426NGS87X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DINHUY#wasThisHelpful","R3SOE426NGS87X","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Don't Have Love"" is a modern retelling of 1 Corinthians 13. We are commanded to love others by Jesus. This song challenges me to think about how well I am loving others. The passage 1 John 4:19 says, ""We love because He first loved us."" So often, even as Christians, we think by avoiding conflict and passively avoiding people in general means that we're following God's commands. However, we are called to actively love one another. There is a lot of great biblical truth throughout this catchy song ""Don't Have Love."" We can move mountains, we can give away everything we have to the poor, the Bible tells us if we don't do those things in love, it is meaningless. As you listen to this great song think about how well you are loving others and know that Jesus loves you and wants us to glorify Him. As the song proclaims, ""Love's never selfish, love's never vain (you don't have love), Love doesn't criticize, love doesn't blame (you don't have love), From the beginning, through every age, Love is the one thing that's never gonna change."" Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMZBHMBW16S8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008594TKK#wasThisHelpful","RMZBHMBW16S8Z","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My family has been blessed by Holly's music ministry and her great example of how to be a modest and godly woman who expresses her love for Jesus and how He has rescued and redeemed her from the lies and destructive messages of the world. ""God Is"" picks up with Holly's desire to provide words for the Church to sing about our Lord, to edify and build up believers with her anointed voice and transparent faith. In that way, her newest song ""God Is"" reflects her heartbeat to sing about the attributes of God and make an offering of praise to Him. His Name is a strong tower. We can call out for Jesus and He will keep us safe. This is a truth for believers to cling to. We're not supposed to just hope it is true, or turn to the Lord as only our last resort, but daily be washed by the Truth of the Word of God. If we learn to build our lives on Scripture, we would all have a Rock as our foundation as we navigate our lives.

"Big Daddy Weave formed in 1998 in Mobile, Alabama, where the band members Mike Weaver (guitar, lead vocals), Jay Weaver (bass, vocals), Jeremy Redmon (guitar, vocals), Jeff Jones (drums), and Joe Shirk (saxophone, keyboards) were all attending school.

Every song on this stellar collection displays the band's heart behind what they do, leading people in worship.""Beautiful Offering"" features Mike Weaver's tender and powerful vocals and takes listeners on an emotional and spiritual journey with every lyric sung about faith in our God Almighty, our Lord and Savior, Jesus. The song is a great call to worship and a fresh offering of praise for the Church. The final refrain is very stirring and convicting: ""Take this broken life I bring, make it a beautiful offering, a beautiful offering. Your love changes everything, I am a beautiful offering to You.""I'm really engaged by the emotional vocals and the deep, prayerful lyrics throughout the album, especially the bridge in the opener, which says ""You have ransomed all I have, now all I have is Yours, You have ransomed all I am, now all I am is Yours."" Those prayerful words set the tone for these exceptional, beautiful offerings to God.This band can really write a hooky and truth-filled chorus, and lead single ""My Story"" is catchy, relevant and worshipful like their previous hit songs ""Overwhelmed,"" ""Redeemed,"" ""What Life Would Be Like"" and ""Every Time I Breathe."" ""My Story"" is a modern adaptation of the hymn ""Blessed Assurance."" The song is an upbeat worship declaration sung with a stirring passion and filled with prayerful lyrics. You'll worship our King Jesus right along with Mike, in particular the proclamation in the chorus: ""Of the grace that is greater than all my sin, of when justice was served and where mercy wins, of the kindness of Jesus that draws me in, to tell you my story is to tell of Him.""Other highlights include ""I Belong to God,"" ""Come Sit Down,"" ""The Lion and the Lamb"" and ""It's Already Done."" The upbeat ""I Belong to God"" is a surefire hit song with an exciting declaration: ""Here we are now, children of a mighty God, I belong to God, I belong to Jesus.

"No worship band in recent history has created the kind of reaction The City Harmonic did with their EP Introducing The City Harmonic, which features the standout anthem ""Manifesto."" They have followed that up with each album being their new best: I Have a Dream (It Feels Like Home), which features ""Mountaintop"" and ""Holy (Wedding Day),"" and Heart, which features ""A City on a Hill"" and ""Praise the Lord."" The band is made of frontman Elias Dummer, bassist Eric Fusilier, guitarist Aaron Powell and drummer Josh Vanderlaan, a group of musicians who doesn't have much interest in gathering fans, but rather aims to come alongside other members of the Body of Christ.The opening four tracks set the tone brilliantly for this exceptional alternative rock worship album, one of the best of the year. The opening track ""We Are One"" and closing track ""One"" bookend the theme of the album that weaves through every track: ""Make us one as You are One."" Once you let the song ""We Are One"" sink in to your soul, you won't be able to get the uplifting lyrics out of your head. I find myself frequently singing the unifying chorus: ""We are one, we are all for One, all for Jesus, Once for all, to the glory of the One true God.""In the style of ""Mountaintop"" and ""Manifesto,"" I can't get enough of ""Maranatha."" You'll get swept up in the emotion of the bridge, ""for the dark and the light at war in me, Maranatha... for the widowed wife, and the orphaned one, Maranatha."" You'll want to jump to your feet, raise your hands and sing at the top of your lungs, ""Christ has come and Christ is coming, rise and sing, Maranatha!""""Into Your Arms"" takes listeners on an emotional and spiritual journey with every lyric sung about faith in our God Almighty, our Lord and Savior Jesus. The chorus is very stirring and convicting. I'm really engaged by the emotional vocals and the deep, prayerful lyrics throughout the album. You'll want to lift your voice to Jesus in singing these words, ""Oh How You love me... Oh How I love You now, I found freedom in the fall into Your arms, into Your arms I'm falling.""During ""Solid Rock,"" front man Elias Dummer achingly sings ""Christ the Solid Rock, I'm standing on, through the pouring rain, I won't be afraid!"" Brit-rock guitars swell with the orchestra adding stringed instruments, and my spine tingles during this moving song.The Church can all sing to ""Let There Be Light"" with the words ""Oh Word of God, let there be light, cut through the dark, Oh let there be light...Oh Word of God, let there be light."" It is a great message and song for us to celebrate our freedom from sin based on our faith in Christ Jesus. Also, it is commanded by Jesus in Matthew 5:16 to ""let your light shine"" so that others may praise God based on seeing the power of His life in us. We need to celebrate that freedom with our hands reaching out to others in Christ, showing His light in us and letting Him shine in us.""All of This & More"" is a love song to our Savior, which you'll join in singing after one listen: ""You are more, You are Who all this is for, You are more, You are more, You are all of this and more."" I can't help but break down every time I listen to the song. This song encourages me and is one of the most inspirational songs I've ever heard. The City Harmonic really captures what it means to love Jesus and be loved unconditionally by Him.""Oh What Love"" reflects the yearning for Jesus that I pray for my daughters to feel in their hearts as well. The song is a beautiful reminder of our eternal promise and convicts us to remember our blessed hope of living forever with Him based on His love for us. Followers of Jesus can all sing ""Jesus, oh what Love, Jesus, oh what Love. Nothing can separate us from Your love, no mountain high, no valley low. How wide, how deep, how wide the love of God, more love than I have ever known."" The beauty and majesty of our King Jesus is reverently captured throughout the album with anthem after anthem, including the reflective closing tracks ""Confession (Agnus Dei),"" ""Still and Small"" and ""One.""Closing Thoughts (Staff Review, NewReleaseToday.com):We Are contains eleven brand new songs that continue the musical journey, with lyrics that point to the wonders of our God combined with sweeping melodies and infectious choruses that will be replayed in your mind over and over again. The album is a collection of modern hymns, psalms and spiritual songs for the Church, born out of churches working together and drawing inspiration from traditions and styles of worship throughout the ages. You'll experience the majestic nature of God in the music of The City Harmonic.Every song released by The City Harmonic completely focuses me as a listener on joining in praise, worship and adoration of Jesus. These songs were written from a place of reflecting on what it means to be one body of Christ as Christ is One with the Father and Holy Spirit. The project is intended to lead listeners to that place also. I'm both challenged and entertained, and I love hearing Scripture proclaimed in fresh and exciting ways. Every song is emotionally stirring and rooted in the Truth of God's Word.I eagerly await each new release, and the truly stellar We Are is now my top overall album by The City Harmonic. These are very passionate worship songs sung with vocal sincerity and reverence with biblically based lyrics. There are several instantly sing-able and worshipful arrangements that you'll want to add to your Sunday morning set. All of the songs are catchy, exciting and worshipful. After listening to the album, I am stirred with compassion to love people as Jesus loves us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R154ZLDT7CVML5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGJ85ZM#wasThisHelpful","R154ZLDT7CVML5","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right from my first listen I was hooked by the Psalm-like reflective lyrics, especially in “The Storm,” which draws from Psalm 69 with the sincere and prayerful lyrics: “In over my head, I was washed overboard, Adrift, on the high seas, Far from the nearest shore, I cried out to You my God.” The song beautifully captures the emotion of the biblical truth expressed in Psalm 42:7 (NKJV): ""Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls, all Your waves and billows have gone over me."" That prayerful language instills awe in us about how Sovereign our God is. When we feel like we are on shaky ground and we are dealing with the uncertainty of our situations, the economy and our world, this song allows us to dwell on the unshakable nature of God. When all else fades away, He will remain. This is one of my favorite songs of the year. We should all be living for Heaven, our true home. Everything in this broken world will ultimately disappoint you. I love how this song reminds me to have my priorities in the right place. When it seems like hope is lost, and all that’s left is despair, there’s still hope in God as he tells us He’ll guide us home. Until then we can lift up our voices to Him: “My hope in the dark, there You were shining, You have brought me home.” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T366TRPWQQH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HPM6L4#wasThisHelpful","R1T366TRPWQQH0","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the beginning notes of ""Nothing Ever (Could Separate Us)"" I was hooked by the lyrical and musical intensity of this great band Citizen Way. The song kicks starts a musical journey immediately relating to believers who have put all of their hope and trust in Jesus Christ, ""Not even death could pull me from Your arms, nothing ever could separate us now...when I can't see You, I know You are near...even in death we won't be torn apart."" The great Brit-rock style guitar riffs are found throughout the song.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K8QKA7VISZ5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLNK9W2#wasThisHelpful","R1K8QKA7VISZ5U","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Should've Been Me"" boldly declares a statement of faith: ""All of these years never heard it like this / It should've been me, it should've been us, should've been there hanging on a Cross, all of these shames, all of these scars, should've been stains that were never washed, why do I hide, why do you try, over and over and over again, I guess it just leaves me sayin' thank God, leaves me sayin' thank God for the should've been.""

"Our blessing as her listeners is to join in and share in Cindy's sincere prayer to God. This song represents the truth of the Christian walk. We know our lives here on earth are only temporary and our real home is heaven. So, it’s possible that the pain has a purpose. As Cindy tenderly sings in this “gourmet” offering of praise—“Cause there are questions without answers and flames that never die, And heartaches we go through are often blessings in disguise, So thank You, Lord, oh thank You, Lord, And yeah, how could I ask for more?” Sometimes, we need the suffering and heartaches so God can shape us into who we need to be. Someday we’ll see the purpose. Until then, remember God promises us His very best, and this song reminds you to count your blessings. Jesus doesn't ask us to cover our weaknesses. It's through our weakness that His power is made perfect and He makes us strong in Him. That's cause to count our blessings, “Thank You Lord. How could I ask for more?” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHYJ21IADFHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YY3EA6#wasThisHelpful","R2MHYJ21IADFHE","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like the upbeat musical vibe, matching upbeat message and call to action of “Glow in the Dark.” Matching lyrical content and musical mood has long been one of Jason’s specialties. The lyrics of this song encapsulate what I’ve long admired about Jason’s music ministry, an accessible and catchy melody and a personal connection to a deep and meaningful topic expressed in a memorable way. Regarding this great song, ""Glow in the Dark,"" my pastor recently shared that ""a lamp doesn't talk, but it shines."" That's our job as Christians. Sometimes it is better to keep our mouths closed and not get in the way of the Gospel. As followers of Jesus, we can live out the words: “Let the world see what you’re made of, that His love’s alive in your deepest parts, Like a flame, like a burning star you can shine right where you are, He made you to glow in the dark.""

"The prayerful message of abandon in this song is my heart's cry for my daughters to adopt as well. I want them to connect with Jesus in the same way this song longs for relationship with our Lord and Savior. When we feel like we are on shaky ground and we are dealing with the uncertainty of our situations, the economy and our world, this song allows us to dwell on the unshakable and eternal nature of God. When all else fades away, He will remain. This song leads me to the Throne Room in worship of Jesus, and in this vertical expression in particular I truly get lost in the Majesty and wonder and beauty of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. The musical arrangement is perfect for any style of worship service, and the message is biblical, timeless and contemporary. This song for the Church reminds us that the pain of this world is temporary and to live for Heaven. As Christians--the bride of Christ--we'll worship Him forever and in the Presence of Angels and with the Elders and the saints all sing to our Bridegroom: ""Like the voice of many waters, I can hear the angels sing, Holy, holy, holy, holy, Holy, Worthy, Glory.""

"The chorus: “You call me Worthy, shame flooded by Mercy’s sea, Forever forgiven, a new Life has risen in me, Righteous and Holy, sin always and fully erased, Beloved, Accepted, my fall was arrested by Grace,” does an excellent job of explaining what grace is all about. My pastor uses the acronym, Gods Riches at Christ's Expense to define grace. When you sing this song, the devotional thought we should all be thinking is whether we are submitting our lives to the Truth or just singing the words. God wants us to boldly approach the Throne of mercy and grace to receive and obtain what we need from Him. When we acknowledge our identity in Christ in this song, our burdens are removed. I can’t get enough of the beautiful poetic and powerful expressions of faith in this song, “Adopted by Perfection, You rejected my rejection, made whole by resurrection…I’m Yours, I’m Yours.” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXDAMU3MGFPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCJ8C4U#wasThisHelpful","R2FXDAMU3MGFPG","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clearly some truths that we can rally behind as believers in Christ together is that God is Our Father, He sent His Son Jesus to die for our sins, and He rose again and defeated death. We can all say Hallelujah and celebrate those truths together while singing along with this song. The enthusiasm and energy of this song and band is infectious. I love listening to this album when I want an exciting time of worship that glorifies God and gets me pumped about my faith. Carry the Fire is loaded with great up tempo songs, catchy melodies, and solid lyrics reflecting unashamed faith in Jesus. Rarely has an album affected me this deeply, as many of the songs cause me to physically feel the depth and sincerity of the goosebump-inducing, emotional vocals. How these songs convey our relationship with Jesus is truly inspiring and convicting. “Our Father Has Won” celebrates the freedom we are promised in God's Holy Word: “if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW3X4U8ALN4OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCJ8A4W#wasThisHelpful","RW3X4U8ALN4OI","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This song gives us a foretaste of eternity where one day believers will be singing to Jesus: “Holy is Your name, Worthy is Your name.” A thread found throughout this album is that we are compelled to love by the unstoppable love of Jesus Christ. The first song urges to “sing out,” and the closing song “10,000 Reasons” urges to “sing like never before.” We love because He first loved us. God is love. Songs are an inheritance to share in victory together. God’s Word doesn’t return void, and He wants us to have victory.

"""The Joy"" is an uplifting, catchy and encouraging song. A great reminder in this song is to remember: ""I was lost but now I'm found, but happiness ain't joy, just ask around, it's nothing circumstantial, it's something supernatural."" A great outcome of memorizing the words of this song is that you are ultimately singing God's Word. Regardless of our circumstances, we need to truly be free in Christ and be happy and filled with joy, like Paul and Silas in prison. One of the greatest witnesses that followers of Jesus can demonstrate to non-believers to show them the upside down Kingdom of God is to live out the words of this song and have that inner-joy, which is supernatural. That shows observers of Christians walking through valleys that they have the hope and joy of the love of God, living out His plans for them. This is one of my favorite songs of the year. I can't get enough of the Biblical truth of the song, and I love when artists take Gods' Word from the Bible and turn it into a great and catchy song filled with truth.

"For me, the most encouraging part of this song is the message that I don't have to be perfect, but that God knows me and loves me just as I am. That is cause for celebration as we all have freedom to be ourselves and know that He has great plans for us as His children. I can relate to the lyrics, and this song relates to every listener in some way. We all need encouragement and we all need to be built up. This song is filled with the biblical Truth of 1 Corinthians 10:31 – “Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” I love the sincerity and humility of this song. I sing it at the top of my lungs in praise and awe of my Savior and King, Jesus. Worship is really about submission and our roles as worshippers are really defined in this song, which is to just be amazed and in awe of God. All we can do is submit to Him and give everything we have to Him. If you are a painter, paint in God’s Name. If you’re a teacher, teach in God’s Name. Everything we do is a ministry. Lift up your voice and your life to God and submit to Him.  My hope for this song is for people to pray along and live out these words along with David: “Every day I'm gonna wake up, Gonna wake up, Wake up and say, You can have me, have everything.” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9KOYQQOZ3ZKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEH0Q08#wasThisHelpful","R9KOYQQOZ3ZKQ","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Owl City is back with a new full-length studio album, Mobile Orchestra, due out July 10th worldwide on Universal Republic. Owl City's Adam Young burst onto the music scene with one of the all-time best selling debut singles, the incredibly infectious ""Fireflies,"" where Adam mused ""I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly... everything is never as it seems... when I fall asleep.""Owl City's dreamy songs and hook-filled melodies have consistently been a draw for me. Unlike his previous offerings such as in ""The Real World"" where Young sings ""reality is a lovely place, but I wouldn't want to live there,"" this album is filled with Young's musings about love, faith and life, and his personality can be heard in every song.Young has a unique gift to make catchy and optimistic songs while still challenging me intellectually. My best way to summarize the theme of the album is found in the fun nod: ""and I could feel the love"" in referencing ""The Lion King's"" hit song, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" in the incredibly catchy and fun reminiscing song, ""Unbelievable"" featuring ""MMMBop"" artist Hanson. Young and Hanson trade-off sharing their favorite childhood memories, including the creative rhyming of ""when I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C3-PO,"" and ""when I was a kid I lived for climbing trees, and Dr. Pepper jelly beans.""That theme of ""and I could feel the love"" weaves its way throughout all ten amazing songs, each hitting an aspect of Owl City's music that all of his existing fans have come to love with rave-style dance tempo song ""Verge"" featuring guest vocals from Aloe Blacc (who vaulted Avicii's ""Wake Me Up"" into a mega-hit). I expect a similar outcome for this melody which I can't get out of my head. You'll be singing along ""from this day forward I will make a promise, to be true to myself and always be honest. For the rest of my life, I will do what's right when I step out on the verge of the rest of my life tonight."" Those lyrics set the tone for Young's commitment to be true to himself and always be honest, which can best be found in his personal expressions of love and faith, ""I Found Love,"" ""My Everything,"" ""Can't Live Without You,"" and ""You're Not Alone"" (which features Britt Nicole).Like everyone else, I was hooked by ""Fireflies,"" ""Umbrella Beach"" and ""Vanilla Twilight"" from Ocean Eyes. At the time, I didn't even know Adam was a Christian and then he recorded a brilliant cover of ""In Christ Alone,"" and I've been a huge fan ever since. Some of the vertical Christian focused lyrics are found in my favorite song, ""My Everything"" where Adam expresses his faith directly to God: ""Hallelujah, by the grace of God above, Hallelujah, I will shine a light 'cause I am loved, This is all I know how to say.""""You're Not Alone"" features Britt Nicole and the biblical confession: ""In the face of my depravity, For God so loved the world He died for me, My fire burns 'till He returns, And takes me home beyond the galaxy, You rescued me and I believe, That God is love and He is all I need, From this day forth for all eternity.""The nod to ""Galaxies"" where Adam credits God as ""the saving grace of the Galaxies"" found in the ""galaxy"" reference in the bridge of ""You're Not Alone"" is matched in the song ""Back Home"" featuring Jake Owen, with the musing of Young and Owen about ""fireflies"" also providing a throwback in the country-tinged back porch song. That is one of the many highlights of this brilliant offering by Owl City, his best album and easily one of the best alternative music albums of the decade.Closing Thoughts (Staff Review, NewReleaseToday.com):Something about Owl City's music that I've consistently enjoyed is the ability to escape daily stress and pressures while listening to the songs. Knowing Adam's faith as a Christian allows me as listener to share his optimism that we weren't made for this world. Mobile Orchestra is easily the best alternative music album of the year. I love that this album is chock-full of optimistic messages about love, faith and life wrapped around some incredibly hooky beats and dance floor tempos. If you liked Ocean Eyes and All Things Bright and Beautiful, you'll be thrilled by Mobile Orchestra. Do yourself a favor and get this album immediately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQ9C6B2ICYH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XO12RSK#wasThisHelpful","R1CQ9C6B2ICYH4","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This song has an epic feel because it is about a future biblical event of Jesus coming back to earth on His white horse, and the urgency of the song matches the excitement and anticipation of the lyrics. Some lyrics from the song that reflect Kevin’s faith journey are: ""Fall, fall to my knees again, You pick me up, And through this journey give me faith again, Soon this life will turn to ash like it once began, We will fade but no no no no this is not the end, yet."" He has a new lease on life with a rebirth and renewal of his Christian walk and his faith-based music ministry, including a vibrant home church community at Journey Church in Franklin, Tennessee, which is also home to “gourmet” worship artist All Sons & Daughters. Like how this song celebrates the Lord Jesus Christ’s return, it also celebrates Kevin’s return to the faith-based music industry, and is a creative way to put the words of Scripture into the hearts, minds, and mouths of listeners. That's one of my favorite aspects of Scriptural-based songs, including biblical overtones of some of co-writer Brent Kutzle’s band OneRepublic’s songs like ""I Lived,"" ""Counting Stars,"" “If I Lose Myself,"" ""Preacher"" and ""Life in Color."" In fact, if you like those songs, you’ll love this song and you’ll be singing along, ""I saw the heavens open over me, He showed His face so that I could see, Without a doubt you know I still believe, I see Him riding on a white horse, a white horse.""

"There are some lyrics in the song that I have dug into and found Scriptural and personal context for believers. ""I once was lost and now I'm not, You sanctify me, give my life direction alone"" is a great way to pray out loud in a Psalmist fashion what it means to recognize when we are in a valley and need God to light the way out of the darkness. Psalm 18:28 (NLT) says it this way: ""You light a lamp for me. The Lord my God lights up my darkness."" That's what God wants to hear from us, just as in Amazing Grace, where believers sing ""I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see."" God's Providence in Kevin's life pointing him to make Christian music is part of His Providence in my own life, where by using his gifts for God's glory, I heard biblical messages in his songs ""What if I Stumble"" and ""In the Light"" which helped lead me to accept Jesus Christ as my personal Savior, for which I'm eternally grateful. The takeaway message and personal testimony of Kevin is found in these lyrics: ""Through the chaos and the numbing chill, down in the valley, up the tallest hill, inside every broken temple, is a space for You to fill."" Every one of us is God's broken temple, and He desperately wants to fill us with His Light and His mercy and make us new. God's glory, His strength, is found in our weakness. This song celebrates that truth and allows listeners to sing the words and pray out loud for God to fill our broken temples with His Holy Spirit. Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZ9HFRTQE0YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBC3S74#wasThisHelpful","RQZ9HFRTQE0YC","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album is filled with overwhelming biblical truth. After repeated listens, the songs get deeper into the recesses of your heart with the comforting messages of the Bible that God is love, and we love because He first loved us. You can have joy and worship loudly about the love of God in your life. When you've encountered the love of God, you won't be the same. God wants us to know ""it is for freedom that Christ has set us free.""This song celebrates the truth from Ephesians and Romans about grasping ""how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ."" Allow the fullness of Christ's love to indwell in your heart and proclaim the truth of this song. One of the key takeaways of this song is ""We give You all the praise that we can bring, We have come to abide in Your grace once again."" When you abide in His grace, you won’t be the same. His grace takes away anxiety, and guilt and shame. Know that being His is enough. Sing along loudly, ""One thousand songs, and one thousand praises, could not lift high enough the name of Jesus, Oh we will cry out with all we have now, to glorify the One we love."" Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROK2RIKZHPPIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBCF1FG#wasThisHelpful","ROK2RIKZHPPIM","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moriah Peters has the gift of encouragement, and every single song lifts me up. At her young age of 21, she has delivered an album loaded with spiritual maturity. Every song connects emotionally to the Truth that God can make us brave in the face of adversity. As stated in the title track, ""Impossible is possible with You."" She opens with the ultra-catchy dance-tempo title track ""Brave,"" which perfectly sets the tone for this excellent album. The title track opens with the lyrics ""No one ever told me this would be easy but I never knew it could be this hard / Oh the worry the worry the worry is weighing on me / Could You help me break down all these question marks and make me brave?"" Another version of this inspiring song also ends the album, with a guest vocal by Andy Mineo. Moriah has really emerged as one of the top female vocalists in Christian music, and she is a great role model for girls. She has delivered the ideal album to minister to anyone struggling with fear and self-doubt. Every song is a great showcase of Moriah's excellent singing voice, and you can practically hear her smile as she delivers one infectious song after another. The layered and well produced musical arrangements on this album perfectly accentuate Moriah's powerful and passionate songs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R59DFI6K8SV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLPBI86#wasThisHelpful","R59DFI6K8SV4","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Settle in and really allow yourself to experience these songs, especially ""Lift Up Your Head."" The song connects to Psalm 121:1-2 (NKJV): ""I will lift up my eyes to the hills--From whence comes my help? My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth."" The song has a psalmist style message: ""Breathe, darling, breathe. It's not yet time for you to leave. Love will have its day. Lift up your head.Turn your face to the rising sun while you wait, while you wait for redemption to come."" The song is such a joyful and hopeful prayer. ""Lift Up Your Head"" is about submitting to the Lordship of Jesus over our lives and acknowledging that ""Love will have its day. Lift up your head. Turn your face to the rising sun while you wait, while you wait for redemption to come."" The Lord tells us all throughout Scripture to ""lift up our eyes"" to Him and this song celebrates that Truth. As Laura said, Jesus showed ""radical open-heartedness"" towards the ""least of these."" The song reminds us not to lose heart. It encourages us to make Him the Lord of our lives and believe in His promise of a new day, when there will be no more pain, sorrow or tears, and all things will be made new. What a wonderful, loving and gracious God that we serve. I am so thankful to Jesus for saving me and showing us how to live. Remember and celebrate that ""love will have its day."" Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PBRKVFF7BU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTNHZ7C#wasThisHelpful","R37PBRKVFF7BU0","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good News of the Gospel which this song perfectly portrays it is that God accepts us no matter what we've done. The simplicity of the chorus repeating ""so come"" allows you to soak in the truth of the verses and think about whether you are connecting your heart with God's heart, which is to show us His glory in His compassion and mercy. He is near to the brokenhearted. He delights in the humble and contrite in spirit. To quote Ghandi, ""In a gentle way, you can shake the world."" As Christ's image-bearers, demonstrating His heart for the broken is how we can shout His Name and show Jesus. Misty's gorgeous rendition of Kevin Prosch's beautiful song ""So Come"" causes my heart to sing along loudly about this glorious promise in Revelation 22:20: ""He who testifies to these things says, 'Surely I am coming quickly.' Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!"" God loves you so much. Lean on Him, and He'll give you strength. If you are a follower of Jesus, you can know for certain that God is singing these words over you: ""So come."" Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IIDMEE735DNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTNI2KQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IIDMEE735DNR","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""God of Ages Past"" is a beautiful vertical ballad in the style of “Yearn,” “Embracing Accusations,” “The One You Need” and “That’s How You Forgive.” It is a moving and sincere offering of praise: ""O God of ages past, convince my heart at last, come tell me of all I have in You."" People typically remember songs longer than they remember sermons. I love when an artist can bring the truth of the Bible into their song and we can have it be part of our lives. The bridge of this song really drives home the point that God’s plans for our future and God’s ways will ultimately unfold in our lives. We think that we can fix situations in our lives, and God reminds us that we can’t fix things on our own without God. This song beautifully expresses the desires of my own heart of stone for God to “start a fire in these broken bones.” I love to sing this song at the top of my lungs and cry out to God how proud I am to be a follower of Jesus. Ask the King and King and Lord of Lords: “Oh God of ages past, Convince my heart at last, Come tell me of all I have in You.” Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPBSG82O6PGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBB5WZK#wasThisHelpful","R2DPBSG82O6PGY","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Cast My Cares"" has an easily accessible message that will speak to everyone regardless of their circumstances with a wonderful melody to sing the words of Scripture. I love when artists draw from the Bible and write songs that stick with you and sing over you the Truth of God's Word. The key as a follower of Jesus is to walk by faith and to be guided in your daily walk by prayer and God's infallible Word, the Bible. My personal devotional prayer this year has been to have more faith. This song is my heart's cry and anthem to sing daily in praise to the Lord, regardless of my circumstances, doubts or worry, singing words to Him like ""I will cast my cares on You, I'll trade the troubles of this world, for Your peace inside my soul."" Amen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WW08J8TG45XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVEP2EQ#wasThisHelpful","R2WW08J8TG45XZ","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I Feel His Love"" features a worshipful refrain and Laura's strong vocal delivery. When Laura passionately sings the song, I hear in her voice a prayer of gratitude and commitment to lift God's Name high and give her gifts back to Him. Laura once again isn't performing the song; she is lifting the worshipful and heartfelt words back to our Savior. We were created and made in the image of God, and as so, I really connect with the lyrics, “His love goes deeper than the pain that I feel, His love is stronger than depression or fear.” A challenge I've personally taken away from this song is that God put it on Laura’s heart to speak with God and ask Him to release her from her depression and she was obedient. Even when you don’t feel it, you can express these words and this beautiful melody, and pray these words along with Laura: “I am confident that neither life or death, Can keep me from the love of Christ, Can keep me from the love of Christ, And though I cannot see still my heart believes, And I am filled with joy inexpressible.""

"Unbroken Praise is the latest live worship album by our generation's most influential worship leader, Matt Redman, available everywhere June 16. As the writer and singer of ""10,000 Reasons (Bless the Lord),"" ""Holy,"" ""Never Once,"" ""Blessed Be Your Name,"" ""Better is One Day"" and ""You Never Let Go,"" along with Passion's ""Our God,"" ""Here For You,"" ""Lay Me Down"" and ""Jesus, Only Jesus,"" worshippers worldwide have been consistently blessed by Matt's ""Heart of Worship."" This new album is not to be missed, with 11 new and fresh Spirit-filled songs for the Church. The album is centered on our unbroken praise of Jesus.The exciting opener ""Louder"" sets the tone with its upbeat electronic musical arrangement and the crowd clapping along. There's a Hillsong Young & Free vibe, with the opening lyrics ""There's a song that cannot be contained, / There's a shout that breaks through every chain, / God, we won't be silent!"" I really like the call to worship and find myself frequently singing the catchy chorus: ""We lift our voices, lift our voices, make your praise so glorious, so glorious, we'll never stop singing."" The song has a great melody, and I would love to sing it ""louder"" with fellow believers.Matt's update of the hymn ""It is Well With My Soul"" takes listeners on an emotional and spiritual journey. The Horatio Spafford-penned chorus is very stirring and convicting. Like Matt's classic song ""Blessed Be Your Name,"" the hymn ""It is Well with My Soul"" is a reminder that our worship of God should not be based on our circumstances, but based on who God is. Commit your life to Jesus and offer Him your heart and your life as you sing along with this great song.I'm really engaged by the emotional vocals and the deep, prayerful lyrics throughout the album. ""Unbroken Praise be Yours God forever, take this life, let it become Your home, unbroken praise be Yours"" are the biblical cries of worship in the heartfelt and soul-stirring title track ""Unbroken Praise.""""Abide with Me"" was co-written with Matt Maher and also appears on Saints and Sinners. The song is a powerful ballad, and I love the emotion and biblical truth that Matt brings to the song. The song features Redman's soothing vocals as he prayerfully sings ""Abide with me, abide with me, don't let me fall, and don't let go, walk with me, and never leave, ever close God abide with me.""I find myself singing along loudly with Matt in ""King of My Soul"" when he cries out ""Forever You are seated on the Throne, / Forever You are good above it all, / King of My Soul."" The song builds to an emotional crescendo in the bridge: ""this will be our joyful surrender, this will be our anthem forever!"" That's a wonderful truth that all followers of Jesus can adopt as their anthem of faith.Many of the songs are arranged in a very sing-able and catchy style, such as ""No One like Our God,"" which is filled with great statements of faith proclaiming Him as the Lord of our lives: ""There is no One like our God, never has there been, / never will there be a greater hope than this, there is no One like our God.""""The Awesome God You Are"" is yet another great song for the Church which I hope I'll be singing with fellow believers. The song has a great worshipful chorus with Redman singing ""God let hope arise, and faith become the fortress of my heart, / I will lift my eyes, and see You as the awesome God You are, / Believe You as the awesome God You are, / King Jesus as the awesome God You are.""Closing Thoughts (Staff Review, NewReleaseToday.com):The idea of an entire album filled with songs declaring our unbroken praise is a devotional challenge. What's especially cool about this new album is how every song is true to that biblical concept. These great new worship songs really set me in the proper mindset to praise God for loving me so much that He gave His life away for all that was lost. I really enjoy the exciting musical vibe of this album, and the melodies and lyrics on Unbroken Praise are all catchy and biblical, reflecting unashamed faith in Jesus. Don't miss out on this incredible worship album, one of the best of the year for sure.These are very passionate worship songs. There are several instantly sing-able and worshipful arrangements that you'll want to add to your Sunday morning set-list. I especially recommend ""Louder,"" ""It is Well with My Soul,"" ""Unbroken Praise,"" ""Abide with Me,"" ""King of My Soul,"" ""No One like Our God,"" ""No Longer I,"" ""Majesty of the Most High"" and one of my top worship songs of the year, ""The Awesome God You Are."" Unbroken Praise is a must-have for your praise and worship collection. This is a truly fresh and catchy set of excellent songs for the Church, a foretaste of our eternal unbroken praise for followers of Jesus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24UY266TH5QTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8NVF8E#wasThisHelpful","R24UY266TH5QTB","A3UCCGOG903V0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCCGOG903V0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update 11/4/2015Now these shoes are completely falling apart versus a month ago when they were just starting to fall apart. I attached some photos. Too bad because they are comfy.---------------------------------Update 9/29/15So, after TWO MONTHS they are falling apart1) the shoe is separating from the sole on both feet2) the suede looking strip around the shoe is rubbing offSo, in a nutshell these shoes are falling apart after two months. They were comfy. I had high hopes, but two months of NYC walking and they are almost done for. Contrast that to my sketchers Shape Up mary janes that looked like these shoes, but lasted for over 2 years of NYC walking. I am back to Skechers and Merrells. I cant deal with shoes that fall apart even if they are less expensive!!-------------------------------------------------------------------Original ReviewThese shoes are comfortable. No, you won't look like a fashion model in them. But, if comfort is your number one priority, these are a decently cute way to achieve that. I bought two pairs, the tan color and the grey.1) The look- they remind me of my old skechers shape up Mary Janes that I loved but that skechers discontinued. And if you know that shoe, these are very similar. They are a bit of a big, clunky looking shoe. There is no way around it. That said, I do still think they are cute. The Mary Jane style makes them fun looking and cute. They can go with jeans, khaki short and a blouse, etc. They are the type of shoe you could wear with a workout outfit or with a summer day outfit of khakis and a blouse, or jeans and a cute top.2) The fit- very true to size. They are not narrow, maybe run slightly wide. I am between a 9.5 and 10 and the 10 fit me perfectly. I ordered two pairs one in wide and one regular width. My foot leans toward the wider side but I usually just order medium width. Since these shoes are a bit wide I would have been fine with the medium width. Though the wide was not sloppy and I actually kept both pairs. The strap adjusts nicely for a secure fit. My foot was hugged nicely by the shoe and didn't slide around.3) The comfort - very comfortable. I could wear it for hours right out of the box on the first wear with no blisters at the end of the day. That is saying a lot for a new shoe. I had knee surgery so this comfortable shoe is already a go to shoe. I walk in NYC for hours most days and this shoe has been perfect. It is supportive and comfy.4) The colors- I bought grey and tan and like both. You can see the two colors in the attached photos.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17HRDJWNY5F8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAX5EGC#wasThisHelpful","R17HRDJWNY5F8Q","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This set is a really good quality. We like that it has pink doors and purple roof pieces which appeals to my daughter, but my son really likes playing with it too. My kids are of the preschool and kindergarten age and the set is perfect for them. My five year old can pretty quickly build great houses and structures after I showed him how to do it once. My three year old needs a bit of assistance from the five year old, but she loves putting the pieces together and especially loves constructing the roof.The little figure can be a man or a woman (the dress snaps off. The figure holds an umbrella and it is hard to keep the removable umbrella in the figure's hands when it is played with. My kids don't seem to car though. There is also a cute horse that comes with it. The figure can only go on the horse with the plastic skirt taken off.The logs are real wood and sturdy.

"So, I got this pillow to replace a few other toddler pillows I got for my kids. The other pillows were too tightly filled, with little give and had a slightly chemical smell to them. I had none of those problems with this pillow.1) Its organic- it is filled with a clustered fiber that non gmo, no insecticides used on the cotton etc. I figured that this is important since my kid's faces will be sleeping against this pillow every night.2) No chemical smell - the pillow smells fresh and not like it is treated with chemicals.3) It is very comfortable- this pillow gives enough to be comfortable for my kids yet still provides neck support. They have had no problems sleeping on it and easily transitioned to using it once we received the pillow.4) Well made- it has a 200 thread count and the stitching is sturdy and secure.5) It is made in the USA- it is nice to know that American quality control standards are in place during its manufacture.All in all, it is a great toddler pillow and I recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKBY0P9C9P4M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQ80EE4#wasThisHelpful","RKBY0P9C9P4M9","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The teeth are all painted in good detail and they are solid plastic. My five year old son loves carrying them around and discussing what their diets were (carnivore, omnivore or herbivore). He has so many dino figures that just having replicas of the teeth is an exciting addition to his dino collection.The top row of teeth is Albertosaurus, Triceratops, SpinosaurusThe bottom row of teeth is T-Rex, Tarbosaurus, CarcharodontosaurusKeep the box for easy reference of the teeth or there is a reference sheet inside of the box also.I included pics because it is hard to see the names of the dinosaurs that go with the teeth on the manufacturer's pictures.The pics I included:1) the black background pic is the inside of the box2) the orange background pic is the back of the box3) the green background pic is a photo of the actual teeth","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MOZFIZD4DRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXHIX4O#wasThisHelpful","R38MOZFIZD4DRW","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My three year old was THRILLED to get this Peppa. It is the perfect size for her and the face is really cute. It is made of hard plastic. There are plush versions of Peppa on amazon but my daughter likes plastic versions for pretend play, so this is perfect.I gave it four stars only because Peppa's outfit is a bit tricky to put on. Even my five year old asked for help to put it on. But after a few times he got it on by himself, though my 3 year old continues to need help with putting it on.1) the opening for the arms in the rain jacket is small so you sort of have to angle Peppa's fingers into the arm holes to get the jacket on.2) the hat sits on Peppa's ears but falls off when the kids play with it.3) the boots have to be pulled on at a certain angle that is too tricky for my three year old. My five year old can almost get the boots on but Peppa's legs swing back and forth when he tries to get the boots on making it difficult.All of that said, would I buy this Peppa doll again? YES! There is not much for Peppa on the market in terms of plastic figurines and this doll is nice because it isn't a miniature size. So my daughter enjoys carrying it around.

"Update 7/2015 regarding durability of design on frontI probably have 10 of these Funtainers in all different designs (frozen, hello kitty, spiderman, batman, etc etc). I send them with the kids to school often and have used them for 8 months. I haven not had one design scratch off or peel. I use hot soapy water to hand wash them. I do only use them as water bottles so I am not constantly washing them. But they have been washed repeatedly and the designs on mine still look great with no scratches or peeling. These are still the only water bottles we use for my 3 and 5 year old that don't leak and that the kids can easily close. All the kids in our neighborhood love these bottles and use them!-------------------------------------------------------------------------Original reviewThis cup is perfect! So, last summer I sent my three and four year old to camp and I needed to send them with a reusable water bottle. I tried regular water bottles with a screw on lid but my kids couldn't get it on right and threw the water bottle in their camp bag still open. Water soaked EVERYTHING! I couldn't send the kids with a sippy cup because they were beyond that. Every other thermos or portable cup I tried, my preschoolers either couldn't open it by themselves or they couldn't figure out how to close it so there was a water leaking mess.This cup solved all of those problems!! It is so easy. The kids push the button to open it. They drink from the flexible straw spout and then just press the lid closed. A two year old could do it. Finally, I had a portable thermos I could send them to camp or school with that did not leak from not being closed properly.We use this cup all of the time. And I have bought tons of these cups now with different characters on them. The quality is great. I hand wash and have had no problem with the outside graphics peeling off. I have these sticky name labels that are water proof from a company called Mabels Labels that I use to identify my children's funtainers because now all of the kids at their school have them.They are perfect for little kids past the sippy cup age that need an easy to open and close thermos for school. Though they are also great for older kids too. Highly recommend!I am attaching photos so you can see how the cup looks on the inside as the photos I see for the product only show the outside. There are easy to clean parts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOZ2OC4CCFR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRP3088#wasThisHelpful","R1EOZ2OC4CCFR7","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Scholl's did not let me down as these are very comfortable shoes. Usually, when I put on any new shoes for the first time something on the inside of the shoe will slightly bother me. But, not with this shoe. Everything felt great from the first time I put them on. I am a size 9.5 to 10 with average width feet. I got the 9.5 and they fit like a glove. So, they run exactly true to size.The inside has a super comfy, blanket like lining that feels like a dream. The only reason I am not giving them five stars is because my heel feels very slightly loose in them when I walk. Since these shoes don't have an adjustable strap I think it's just the elastic strap has a little bit of give when I walk. It is only a bit of give and I can walk comfortably in them. I am obsessed with comfortable Mary Jane style shoes and I can say I do prefer an adjustable strap to get the ultimate comfort and secure feeling. I walk all day in NYC carrying a baby so I need comfort and a securely fitting shoe. Anyhow, the heel is only a tiny bit loose so I am going to keep these shoes. They are perfect for slipping on quickly to run outside and the comfort can't be beat. I am attaching some pics of them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUN890J1S2GC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HABTY0Y#wasThisHelpful","RUN890J1S2GC3","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The book is great if your child loved the movie and wants to talk about the movie and the story.

"I have a lot of skechers shoes and these are so comfortable and did not disappoint! The cushy insoles make walking in them all day so comfy. I usually wear between and 9.5 and a 10 in shoes. I got these in a 9.5 and at first I thought they were way too small. I had to really pull them on me the first time, and initially I assumed I had to return them for a size 10. But once I put them on, they fit like a glove and the 9.5 was perfect.If you go between two half sizes just keep in mind that they may be slightly snug in the lower size. If you like to slip on a shoe very easily then go for the half size larger. Obviously, this is only if you fit between two half sizes (ie 9.5 and 10).  You do NOT need to size up a full size on this shoe. It does run true to size. I was just giving info for people who debate between two half sizes.There is not much more I can say about these shoes except to say that they keep my feet happy all day. They do look a bit clunky. Obviously, this is more of a no frills functional shoe. If you want a more feminine shoe, check out some of skechers other go walk shoes that have splashes of other color. But if you want comfort and simplicity, then I highly recommend this shoe!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GGO9NHYE450/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUFE0SY#wasThisHelpful","R13GGO9NHYE450","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are adorable slippers. Here you can see them on with Cinderella's wedding dress. The detailing on the butterfly that is on the front of the shoe is really pretty and it is affixed on there securely. My daughter's feet did bother her a bit the first time she wore them so I just put tights on her the next time and they didn't bother her at all. She does have narrow/petite feet and they were big on her but I ordered up a size.And we love that they light up.

"Final Update-I have had to update this review now for the third time! When I reviewed this product, the picture the seller included was stolen from Disney's official Cinderella dress. The seller here used that exact picture and the title said they were selling the Cinderella live action dress. I had the official, beautiful Cinderella dress made from Disney so I made a review of it and included a picture so people could see how beautiful the official disney Cinderella dress is. However, I later saw from other reviews that the dress sent to customers was not the official disney Cinderella dress but a cheap knockoff probably from China. However, the seller kept the photos of the official Disney Cinderella dress up with the product, confusing customers. I guess enough people complained about false advertising because  finally the seller has pictures of the knockoff dress they are selling. In my opinion the photos of this knockoff dress look nothing like the official Disney Cinderella wedding dress. Do yourself a favor and buy the real official Disney Cinderella wedding dress because it is so beautiful and well made. You can find it on the Disney store website.Update- review changed to one starThe first two pictures posted for this product are from the actual Disney Cinderella wedding dress, which is shown in the picture I included. When I reviewed the item this only picture for the product was of the Cinderella Disney store dress so I wanted to show how beautiful it is. We have that Disney store dress and love the quality as you can see in my photo. However, I just checked this review today and saw the seller put other pictures of a knock off dress up. This knockoff dress is not the same as the first two pictures the seller has up which are of the official Disney store dress (which you see in my photo). So, I am changing my review to one star. Go to the Disney store to get the real dress.----------------Original Review 5 stars (for the product I thought was the official Disney Cinderella dress)------------------------------------------------This dress is super pretty in person. I don't even think the photos do it justice!! It looks well made and expensive. The details on the bottom of the dress are really pretty and the shimmery arms and top of the bodice makes it look really elegant. Here it is on a four year old that wears 5T top and the 5/6 fit perfectly. She has received a lot of compliments on it! She is also wearing the cute Cinderella butterfly slippers that you can also find on amazon (note that the necklace doesn't come with the dress though). Overall, it is darling and great for little fans that are in love with the new Cinderella movie!","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ZVKB52GCIHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOC2BJW#wasThisHelpful","R9ZVKB52GCIHN","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice adjustable strap sandal that is comfortable and can be worn all day. I like it because my daughter can run and jump in these sandals and they have good support. The sole also has good traction and she doesn't slip around in water puddles in these shoes. Also, they are made of a comfortable material that doesn't give her blisters or discomfort.

"These shoes are comfy and easy to slip on. These shoes are perfect for when you are on the go and need to throw on a pair of shoes to let the dog out or take out the trash, etc, and you don't want to take the time to deal with adjusting velcro straps or tying laces. They are also good for putting on if you only have one hand free, which is helpful if you are holding a baby or something else. The straps are elastic so you can just slide your foot right in. Though elastic, the straps are not uncomfortable yet they securely hold my foot in the shoe.The shoe is also sturdy. It has a good traction to it so you don't slip around. The sole is as good with traction as any sneaker. The chocolate color is very attractive and doesn't show dirt, which is a bonus since I am always chasing the kids and dog around at parks etc. It is also quite cushy inside and I could walk around all day in these shoes.The fit is great - the shoe runs true to size and is roomy enough in the toe box and not too narrow.

"I have had three kids and I can say that this stuff works miracles to prevent and treat diaper rash. I have tried other stuff (butt paste, aquafor, triple paste etc) and nothing works like desitin in the purple box. I use it if I notice even slight redness when I change my baby's diaper and by the next diaper change the redness is usually gone (this is when redness is very light/just beginning).My kids have very rarely had a diaper rash but when they do I do lots of warm soaks in the bath, pat and air dry, and then slather this stuff on before I diaper them and it has almost always taken care of the rash (except for once when my daughter had a yeasty type rash that needed a prescription). But for use for three kids, this has worked all but once.

"We just saw the premier of the Cinderella movie the other day and my kids loved it, so of course, this doll of Cinderella in the wedding dress was a must have. The one thing that impressed me the most was that the doll's face really does look a lot like the actress in the Cinderella movie. So many of the Disney dolls have futuristic looking faces.Beyond the doll's beautiful face and expression, her dress stunning and is intricately designed in a beautiful ivory. The detailing on the bottom and top of dress is also gorgeous, as is her blonde hair in the updo and her delicate veil. I even like how the doll's hands and arms are positioned. The Cinderella doll is simply captivating and a must have for any young fan of the new Cinderella movie!My only complaint is the packaging of the doll. She is attached to a plastic backing with many plastic ties on the back of her head and it is really hard to cut them off because they are so tight to the plastic backing (little room between the ties and the plastic to fit scissors). Plus, while doing this you don't want to mess up her updo hairstyle. Also, attached under her dress is tissue paper that has plastic ties that you have to cut off from inside the dress. They use it to make the dress seem to puff out in the package. The ties leave tiny holes in the dress. They aren't that noticeable but still annoying to have her pretty dress punctured by little holes. I attached pictures so you could see.However, even though the packaging isn't ideal she is still a beautiful doll and her intricate details make her a joy to have!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CMMZBT2Q9MWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCHH1GA#wasThisHelpful","R1CMMZBT2Q9MWW","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ugh! This pistachio blend was horrible. I took a handful and ate it and could not believe how bland and stale it tasted. It just tasted really expired and old. I checked the sell by date and it is 8 months away (bought in Feb 2015 and expires Oct 2015). Then I checked to see if this was an extra dry roasted variety and it is not.It tastes like cocktails nuts left out in a dish on a bar for weeks on end, i.e., dry, and old. Even the pistachios are flavorless. I have been eating pistachios all of my life and I have never tasted one this bad that wasn't rotten. I am considering calling the company about it. If you look at the photo I provided you can see how old looking the pistachios look. They really are an off color (they are the three nuts in the middle of the cashew and peanut pile). And, again, the other nuts tasted and look just as old as the pistachios. In other words, avoid, avoid, avoid!","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5EZ9X72WR12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRAUG3M#wasThisHelpful","R3K5EZ9X72WR12","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great wipes for freshening up. You don't need the Cottonelle dispenser because if you have any spare baby wipes dispenser, it will work (these wipes will fit in there. They are a bit smaller than standard sized baby wipes but still work if you buy a cheap Huggies box of wipes with a plastic container and just use that dispenser for the Cottonelle wipes).My big word of warning is that if you use these a lot they can clog the toilet if you have a finicky septic system. I use them sparingly and have not had a problem. My sister in law has a more finicky septic system and she used these wipes nonstop for all of her ""wiping needs"" (for lack of a better term) and clogged up her system and had to call a plumber, who said she had a pile of wipes caught in there that weren't dissolved and caused the problem.Overall, they have worked fine for my needs. No itching or other problems from using them.

You can't see the whole cup from the vendor photo so I attached a photo of the other side of the cup. Basically it is like the dino is holding the cup. So, on one side you see the three dino fingers/claw and on the other side it looks like a dino thumb (for lack of a better word).

"First, make sure you look closely and realize that you are getting tiny tins of play doh with this set. I looked quickly when buying and thought it came with full sized play dohs. In the picture I provide you can see the size of the small container v. the big regular sized play dough containers. This set only has the small containers which are half (or less than half of the size of the normal sized play doh containers). I didn't even know play doh made such small containers of play doh before getting this set. So, the photo is for size comparison of how small these containers are v. the standard sized containers. You can also see the letters.Secondly, my kids (3 and 5) have a hard time getting the letters out of the molds. If they are lucky, they get half the letter out. Usually, I have to help them with each letter to get it out which is hard because I have an infant and no free hands to constantly pull letters out of molds. Also, often I end up ripping the letters when getting the play doh out of the mold even when I am trying to be careful.I did give it two stars because my kids still like to play with the letters, tell me the sounds they make, and try to get the play doh out of the letter molds. I think if the letter molds were bigger it would be easier for the kids to get out. I would probably not recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNW334U7N4AK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JYEWH8#wasThisHelpful","RNW334U7N4AK1","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, I have a lot of skechers shoes and I love the fit. I also usually get a Mary Jane style. I get them because I need extra comfy shoes for walking around NYC. I also carry my baby in a carrier on me, so I need shoes that are completely supportive. At first when I tried these shoes on and stood up they were so comfortable. The memory foam feels amazing, they run true to size and just felt great.Then...I started walking around in them. My heel kept slipping up when I walked. I tried tightening the strap as far as it would go, but still, my heel slipped up in them. The rest of my foot was secure but my heel was loose and slack. Now, I have a foot a bit on the wider side, so the slack heel is not due to having narrow feet. Plus, I know how skechers usually fit me, especially mary jane skechers, which are one of my go to shoes, and I have never had this problem. I think the issue is on the placement of the strap. If it was a little higher up on my foot or a little thicker, maybe that would have helped.Anyway, I am so disappointed. These shoes are perfect otherwise. They are a mesh, breathable style, which would be perfect for the summer. Since they have free returns they are worth trying on. Maybe they would work for your foot? But for me, the issue was not discomfort and the size was correct, it was just being slack in the heel that made me decide to return them. I attached a photo so you can see how they fit on me and so you can see how the mesh type of shoe looks when worn.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLCOFWZCMHGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1W3XB8#wasThisHelpful","R2VLCOFWZCMHGP","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great on the go powder formula dispenser. It has three compartments and I measure out the amount of formula that I need for each feed (so I fill each compartment with pre measured formula). Right now I only do three scoops of formula per compartment for a six ounce feed and there is plenty of room (I think each compartment holds 9 oz of formula). When I am ready to do a feed I just open the lid over a compartment with formula in it and dump it into the bottle. The lid can be moved around (twisted) so that the part with the hole on the top can be moved from compartment to compartment.I have had no problems with leaks even though I throw it in my diaper bag. If you want to be extra cautious you could put the container in a large ziplock baggie, but there is probably no need as the lid clicks on securely. When I want to wash it I just throw it in the dishwasher. It is perfect for on the go.

"I am a fan of John Frieda products, especially their Frizz Ease line. So, I was excited to try this product because my hair does best if I air dry my curly/wavy hair (blowdrying can make it frizz out badly, unless I decide to straighten it). Anyhow, this product worked well. To compare, I air dried my hair without this product a few days before trying the product. Without the Dream Curls product my hair air dried in uneven, sort of frizzy waves/curls. It also felt dry.When I used the Dream curls on my hair, after air drying it a few days later, it really produced a much better result. My hair looked smoother and not frizzy. The waves/curls laid well and yet I still had good movement with my hair (i.e., it did not clump together like it does with some other conditioning/taming products). The product did enhance my waves/curls and my hair did not feel as dry as it does when I air dry it without this product.

"These cheese itz have an extra layer of flavor which makes them more cheddar jack. You know how the original cheez it is feels dry when you touch it? Well, it's as it you dipped this cracker in a seasoning. So, your fingers have this coating of the seasoning on it and you do need to wash your hands after eating it, just like you would after eating Cheetos. And the flavor is more intense. My toddlers like the regular cheese itz that have more of a mild flavor. This cheddar jack flavor is more suited to an adult or older kid. Some younger kids may gobble them up but if you have little kids who are used to more mild tasting things, they may not like them.Personally, I find them irresistible. The coating of seasoning on them gives me just the right amount of kick that makes me want to devour the whole bag and before I know it its gone and I have consumed like 800 plus calories.

"The quality is pretty good. It is pretty cute and we used it for fourth of july. The headband fits an adult and even fit my toddler's small heads. The letters do bounce around with the coils, which they are supposed to do. The challenge was keeping the letters somewhat straight. The letters had a tendency to go askew, and sometimes the ""S"" letter would go behind the ""A"" letter, etc. So, I was readjusting them occasionally. Still, it was only a minor inconvenience and these headbands were fun. We got some nice pictures wearing them and people complimented us on the headbands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ROYDYF3SGQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061WH2XY#wasThisHelpful","R1ROYDYF3SGQW","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this swing. I like that it can rock the baby from side to side or from head to toe, depending on the baby's preference. The seat also has a recline option. My old fisher price swing ran on batteries, so it is great that this swing has a plug in option.The baby also really likes looking up at the mirror. The nature sounds are soothing and there are a lot of different nature sound options to choose from.  I really like that it has secure 5 point straps to make sure the baby doesn't slip out of the swing. In 2010, I had a fisher price swing with just a lap belt and my son almost completely fell out of the side of it. So, I am glad that this swing, has a secure body harness so I don't have to worry about that.The swing can fold up for storage and the swing fabric is machine washable and easy to remove, wash and replace.The swing also looks really cute with the puppy design and I have received compliments on it. It is perfect when wanting to lull the baby to sleep and the speeds are relaxing and not too fast. I would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJOAZ53DY736/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGA06JQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PJOAZ53DY736","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You will gobble it up like a monster. You will try to have one bowl, and you will have three. Limit the amount you buy because you won't be able to stop yourself from having, yet, another bowl.It tastes like cinnamon toast only ten times more sweeter.

"I love coke zero. It doesn't have the slightly chemical taste of Diet Coke. Instead, it tastes like a close alternative to regular coke. It has a smoother and sweeter taste than diet coke. It doesn't taste as sweet as regular Coke, but it comes pretty close.Now, for the Diet Coke fans, don't think I am hating on Diet Coke. I actually love the taste of Diet Coke too. It has a distinctive taste that I am hooked on. Whether I choose Diet Coke or Coke Zero just depends on what I am craving because the two tastes are very distinctive.So, f you are looking for the closest taste you can get to regular coke then choose Coke Zero. If you like the traditional taste of diet sodas then go with Diet Coke.

"I am a Sketchers Go Walk fan. I have worn the first pair that I got about a year ago so often that they look a bit beat up. But they still fit well and actually don't look that bad considering all of the wear and tear that I have put on them (Manhattan city streets).But, I decided to add this pair of Go Walks to my collection. They are wonderful. They are so light, and when they go on, they feel like a slipper. They run true to size and they hug your foot. But they are not uncomfortable. I have tried some other slip on shoes that are either to loose so my foot slides around or are so tight that the material cuts into the top of my foot. That is not the case here. These shoes are formfitting and secure, which allows you to walk comfortably with no foot sliding, whatsoever.Also, since they are lightweight, you feel almost like you aren't wearing shoes at all. Also, the sole has good traction, the shoes have good flex and they breathe well, even in the summer. I had knee surgery, so I can only wear supportive shoes. I have several pairs of Merrells that I love, but they can be a bit heavy and bulky. With these Sketchers I can walk for miles, and have no knee pain, which is amazing to me seeing as this is a lightweight slip on shoe.Finally, these shoes, slip on your foot very easily. Nothing is worse to me than a slip on that you have to spend 5 minutes cramming your foot into in order to wear it. Nope, instead, these Go Walks slip on quickly like a dream. I love them and see many more pairs in my future!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIC1CAYND7G4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5IGSXW#wasThisHelpful","R1WIC1CAYND7G4","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Huggies are our go to swim diaper. They basically prevent poop accidents in a pool by containing it in the diaper. They don't absorb pee so you have to put them on right before you get in the water or else pee will run down your child's legs if they are standing around in a dry swim diaper for awhile. My other advice is to change your child right away if they do poop because though the diaper contains it, it can leak if poop is left in there too long.Also, they say 32lb + but fit my 37 lb 2.5 year old fine. They have elastic waist and elastic leg holes so they stretch to fit.

"I was dubious that a toy like Sophie the Giraffe that cost around $20 would be worth it but I because so many people raved about it, I tried it. And of course, it became my daughter's go to teether. She loved the sweet face, squeezing the squeaky body and gnawing on Sophie's legs and nose. It really seemed to ease her teething discomfort.So, when looking for a gift for my friend's baby I was so excited to see a new version of this teether. I watch my friends baby a few times a week and she absolutely loves her Fanfan the Fawn. She loves to squeeze it and chew on its soft body. It is one of her favorite things to hold. I am pregnant now and plan to also buy Fanfan for my next child.My only recommendation is to buy a leash for Fanfan. You can find them on websites like Etsy. My daughter used to love to throw her Sophie teether out of the stroller and at $20 a pop, replacing it got costly. So, I went on Etsy and bought a Sophie the Giraffe leash to tether it to my daughter's shirt. After that, we didn't lose anymore teethers and I am sure that a leash will also work for Fanfan (it loops around its neck).Anyhow, even though the price is steep for a teether, you won't be disappointed. Your baby will love Fanfan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQTMPOTEV1OC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBVO364#wasThisHelpful","R1MQTMPOTEV1OC","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was so disappointing. I loved the first two Bridget Jones books, especially her romance with Mark Darcy. If you were looking for that in this book, you can forget it. The description states that she is dealing with ""loss and single motherhood"". So, it should not be a spoiler that Mark is not involved in the story. Instead, Bridget is middle aged, boy crazy and obsessed with Twitter.The book is silly and ridiculous, which are the things I loved the most about Bridget in the other two books. But, in the other two books Bridget also had profoundly deep moments, and her love affair with Mark was so real, raw, and captivating. I found none of that here. Her interactions with the guys she is interested in seem superficial and completely lacking substance. Her children and her past relationship with Mark seem like an afterthought.I gave it two stars because you will still find the silly Bridget in this book. I think readers who haven't read the other two books may enjoy this book more because they won't be so disappointed at how Mark's absence was dealt with, since they would not be attached to his character. What I wish, was that this book focused on Bridget's newlywed life with Mark and how they came to have their kids. Bridget bumbling around as a newlywed and first time mom, peppered with romance with Mark, would have been so fun.Instead, I felt that the idea of jumping from a young Bridget who is starting a new life married to Mark (in the last book) to a middle aged woman after younger men (in this book), was just flat out disappointing. And that is how this book left me...feeling disappointed and wanting more closure regarding Bridget's life with Mark.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FME3CA5B84YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CNQ7CRI#wasThisHelpful","R1FME3CA5B84YC","A2BD4PA680QAY1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD4PA680QAY1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I should mention that I love pumpkin pancakes. I have bought many pumpkin pancake brands looking for the perfect pumpkin pancake. If a pumpkin flavor is what you are after, then pass on this pancake. But, if you can do without much pumpkin flavor and just want a good tasting pancake then buy this mix.It really does have a pleasing taste. It tastes like a pancake with just the right hint of chocolate from the chocolate chips. The chocolate flavor is complimentary and does not overwhelm the pancake, which I like. To make it, you just add an egg and some melted butter.I would purchase them again if I wanted more chocolate chip pancakes, but if I crave pumpkin pancakes I would try another brand. Sometimes we add a can of pumpkin to our pumpkin pancakes, but I have not tried that with this mix yet.

"I got these dolls for my two year old and she really likes them. The outfits are cute, with nice detail and they appear to be well made. I wanted to get her a more toddler version of the doll because I didn't feel that she was ready for the Barbie type Anna and Elsa dolls.My only complaint is that when she removes the crown (it is held on by plastic rubber bands which toddlers remove) the dolls have this sort of short hair around the head that has the texture as if it has been hair sprayed (I am not saying it was hair sprayed, it jsut has a tough texture compared to the rest of the hair). And this short hair around the head sticks up in all sort of crazy directions when the crown is off. Without the plastic rubber band holding the crown on it does not stay on. So the dolls sort of look weird with this hair sticking up around the top of their heads. That said, I just try to sort of smooth it back and figure that if my daughter loves the doll, crazy hair and all, then that is what matters.Also, my kids really liked the plastic Olaf.

"I am not sure why amazon prices this so high. You can find it elsewhere (like Sam's Club) for around $30. Or, if you buy it in a store like target you can call Similac for $5 off coupons that stack well when it goes on sale.Now, I have used Similac for both of my kids. The Go and Grow worked well. The powder is cheaper than the ready to feed bottles. My kids loved the flavor. I actually tasted it out of curiosity and it is a bit sweeter than some other formula brands (for example, it is sweeter tasting than Enfamil). Maybe it is the sweeter taste, but I have heard from other breast feeding moms that had to supplement that their baby took to Similac over some of the other brands because it is more similar to the sweetness of breast milk.Over all, Similac has been our first choice in formula.

I had tried one other brand that I found to be too bitter so I was looking for a different coconut water with a less intense flavor. I saw people recommend this product on one of the online groups that I am in. Several people recommended the C20 brand of coconut water over the competitors for flavor and natural ingredients. When it arrived I was not disappointed. It has a light and refreshing flavor. The coconut flavor is not overly sweet, but has enough sweetness to be enjoyable. And it did not have a bad aftertaste, like some of the other coconut waters that I tried. I enjoy having it after a long walk or when I need a pick-me-up at 3pm when I tend to get tired.

"After a failed marriage and separation from his adopted son, forty-year-old Nick Hansen lives alone with his rescue dog Riley and still hasn’t come to terms with the death of his college sweetheart some twenty years earlier. His world was shattered in an instant when Marissa Minor, the love of his life, died along with others in a house fire at her campus residence.  Her death has never made sense to Hansen and he has carried the torch (no pun intended) for all these years.Now two decades later while on a mundane trip to the grocery store he thinks he sees Marissa again, just as she looked before the fateful fire.  When he approaches the girl to speak to her, she bolts from the store.  Was what he saw some ghostly apparition or someone who looks amazingly like his lost love?A visit from a local police Detective the following day produces a startling revelation that Marissa’s “dead ringer” is indeed dead and the cops are looking for answers as to why the victim had Nicks name and address in her pocket. What then unfolds in this tense drama is a replay of Nick’s memories of the months preceding Marissa’s death coupled with a lot of suspense as Nick becomes fanatically obsessed with finding answers not only to what happened to Marissa and her room-mates but also discovering what caused the ostensibly motiveless murder of her look-alike.With SOMEBODY I USED TO KNOW, author David Bell proves that he is a natural story teller gifted in moving the plot along.  This is a fine showcase for his talent and will present readers with plenty to think about with its diverse cast of flawed characters and themes of murder, survival, betrayal, and love. While Nick seems to be suffering from OCD when it comes to Marissa and the ending is somewhat predictable and a touch cheesy, overall it is still a pretty good read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYTIWEQE5Q87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451474201#wasThisHelpful","R1EYTIWEQE5Q87","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Mike Cuggy's well researched observations also help to justify the vigilante mentality of his protagonist as we see the money lenders prosper while their customers flounder in a sea of uncontrollable debt with governments removing more and more individual liberties with promises of keeping us safe and protecting us from the threats that they themselves have been instrumental in creating.KILL THE MONEY LENDERS is a morality tale of sorts that takes a frightening look at the precarious financial status of monetary systems around the world and it's tone of impending doom coupled with the insane acts of Charlie Nobbs ( a Charles Bronson doppelganger)  is enough to guarantee a loss of sleep for the reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C74Q0ZM3ANQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T690OMA#wasThisHelpful","R3C74Q0ZM3ANQK","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever read a novel and felt that you had “been there, done that” before?  That is the feeling I had while reading Alan Winter’s ISLAND BLUFFS.  The story of forensic dentist Carly Mason and her husband Gabe Berk who, having exhausted innumerable tries to have a baby, relocate from Manhattan to Island Bluffs at the direction of a eccentric scientist/fertility doctor named Teplitsky, a man who guarantees them not one child but twins.  Desperate to conceive, Carly will do almost anything to have a child of her own - - even if it means agreeing to the crazy conditions set forth by the doctor.Island Bluffs itself is an insular town peppered with some unusual yet likable characters, like BUCK, the local handyman. The town and its residents all have their stories and a heretofore undisclosed history.  Even the house purchased by the Berks holds secrets.On the readability meter you will find ISLAND BLUFFS to be a trip to the dark side of human nature that is reminiscent of Ira Levin novels such as  ROSEMARY’S BABY, THE STEPFORD WIVES, AND THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL with Alan Folsom’s THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and a touch of FAUST thrown in for good measure.3 1/2 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKUP00T1ZC5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193750686X#wasThisHelpful","R2MKUP00T1ZC5K","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve been craving a little something that’s different, look no further than ONE STEP TOO FAR by Tina Seskis.  In it you will meet a most unusual and dysfunctional family.  Francis Brown is the mother of “the twins” Caroline and Emily, sisters who couldn’t be more different.  Caroline, is pretty and seemingly outgoing but is really a jealous, seething outsider.  Emily is sweet and smart and mom’s favorite.  Dad, Andrew, is a piece of work who will bed anyone he can.  The girls grow up in this chaotic environment and Emily later marries safe and sane Ben. One fine day she decides to leave her marriage, for reasons not divulged to the reader and begin life anew as a woman named Cat - - and thus the quiet wife with the haunting secret reinvents herself as a hard drinking, drug user who is not above a bit of “sticky fingers” activity.Author Seskis takes us from Emily’s departure in the opening pages, back to her early life and then forward to her present incarnation as Cat.  Similar to viewing a CD, she moves us through Emily’s life as she leaves the present to show us Emily’s past then rewinds the years and picks up where she left off.  The picture she paints with her words is substantial and brings us into the lives of complex characters with intertwining back stories that keep the reader thoroughly enmeshed in the lives of Cat, Angel, Caroline, Ben and the entire crew.Of course the reader has to abandon a certain amount of logic in this post 9-11 world to accept the ease with which Emily disappears and then reappears as Cat with nary a problem.  It seems that it should be a little more difficult for a woman with no criminal connections to have all the appropriate documentation to carry off this caper.  That complaint aside, you could do worse than take this journey into the sometimes amusing, often traumatic aspects of one woman’s life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8XE0333H7PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062340077#wasThisHelpful","R3H8XE0333H7PV","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TRUST NO ONE by Paul Cleave is one of those novels that offer no middle ground.  You will either love it or hate it. Jerry Grey, a writer of crime novels, is cast as the unreliable narrator of this saga. Why is Jerry unreliable?  Well, seems he is suffering from early onset Alzheimer’s and can’t seem to distinguish fact from the murderous fiction he created in the dozen of thrillers he wrote under the pseudonym Henry Cutter.The novel ping pongs back and forth between the past and present with the past being visited via Jerry's ""Madness Journal"" that he began keeping when he realized that ultimately his memory would fail.  His wife, Sandra and daughter initially provide a great support system but Jerry becomes unruly and combative with neighbors.  Subsequently, when bodies start piling up a confused Jerry starts confessing – even though he is currently residing in a nursing home and couldn’t have left the premises……..or could he?  The cops think it’s a definite possibility and a confused Jerry, who at this stage of the game doesn’t recognize most of his family or friends, develops a case of galloping paranoia and begins to suspect everyone of the murders, including himself.A cat and mouse game ensues and while the book holds your interest right up to the bitter end, the conclusion is not all that satisfying.  Of course, how many happy endings can you expect for a 49 year old suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.?","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MB2ENC3S9MFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476779171#wasThisHelpful","R3MB2ENC3S9MFR","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE BOYS IN THE BOAT BY Daniel James Brown is as much an inspiring story of the eight young rowers at the University of Washington during the Depression Era, as it is a good look at the events surrounding the rise in Germany of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi Party and the propaganda efforts behind the games.For Hitler, the 1936 Olympics were an opportunity to present The Third Reich as the symbol of “the grandest civilization of all” but even putting the German and Italian boats in the most favored lanes did nothing to hinder the gold medal winning US teammates from victory as they edged out both Italian and German teams by six tenths or a second and one second, respectively.Interspersing stories of the rowers lives and the challenges faced by the team during the Depression Era as they literally had to pass the hat throughout Seattle to come up with the money to take the team to Berlin; we meet committed young men like coxswain Bobby Moch, coach Al Ulbrickson and peerless boat builder, yeoman George Pocock, whose shop produced seventeen of the eighteen shells used in qualifying for the Olympic games. All are unlikely sports heroes but the primary focus of Brown’s tale is the rower in seat two Joe Rantz.  Joe’s is an “up by the bootstraps” success story that will bring a swell of pride to your chest and a lump to your throat.If a story of underdogs with a tenacious capacity to win is your cup of tea then THE BOYS IN THE BOAT is surely your type of read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PMJHN6VOX6Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVFZPF4#wasThisHelpful","R1PMJHN6VOX6Q0","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Grief—is the most painful and universal of emotions.  No one can live untouched by it, yet all experience it in profoundly different ways”.  Welcome to SECOND LIFE where even the darkest secrets can’t stay buried forever and the past can rear its ugly head at the most inopportune time.Julia, the protagonist of Second Life is a woman who is tough to like, but we become riveted by her questionable character: her lack of strength and common sense coupled with her lack of clarity of mind as she deals with past problems and addictions while searching for her younger sister’s murderer. Comparable to Gone Girl and Before I Go to Sleep, Watson’s book dissects the effects of Julia’s dysfunctional childhood and obvious lack of a moral compass on her seemingly happy marriage with drastic results.Her husband, Hugh, is a relative zero in the sex and romance department and she finds herself drawn to Lukas, a guy she meets on-line while searching for clues to her sisters’ murder while at the same time mooning over her lost love, Marcus.  Then there’s Anna, her sisters Paris room-mate whose support and guidance she seeks more and more, to the exclusion of her long time friends - - and let’s not forget Julia’s adopted son Connor – a typical 14 year old (which means he’s obstinate).  Overall, I cannot name one admirable or relatable character in this tome (except perhaps Julia’s friend Adrienne).  Everyone in this convoluted narrative has some sort of “axe to grind”.  You can choose your poison, so to speak, from among this potpourri of bored adulterers looking for some extra-curricular sex, sociopaths, self-involved schemers, and implacable vengeance seeking betrayers.This is a bottomless pit of coincidences peppered with a plethora of needy characters whose motives and excuses will leave the reader wondering “What are the odds of so many unsavory, screwed up people coming together” - - - but then again we have to remember that this is just the product of one writers vivid imagination and does not have to be grounded in an sort of reality.The bottom line is this - - if you choose to abandon all logic and can become invested in characters possessing few redeeming qualities – you may enjoy S. J. Watson’s second offering in thrillers featuring a troupe of psychologically and emotionally impaired miscreants.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34HBYSPCX5GN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062060589#wasThisHelpful","R34HBYSPCX5GN7","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Desolation Sound is a captivating mystery based on a true story that is just crying to be made into a movie.  The novel itself reads like a movie script and is a graphic look at the dark side of human nature. Masterfully rendered by authors Fraser Heston and Heather McAdams the narrative takes the reader to a fog shrouded Pacific Northwest island where over a dozen running shoe clad severed feet have turned up at various intervals over the past eight years and the Mounties don’t seem to see it as the work of a deranged and brutal serial killer but as multiple “suicides”.  (Sort of like being shot in the head multiple times and having your death declared a suicide).For those who enjoy a trip to the dark side, these authors pull no punches fashioning a thriller that doesn’t let up until its gripping resolution. Crime scenes and situations are graphic with the complex cast of players offering a number of possibilities as to the identity of the killer, the terror is tangible and the motives unusual.Now on to the prospect of a movie based on the book.  I see Damian Lewis as the determined, alcohol soaked former American cop Jack Harris, Ray Liotta as Knifeblade Bob, James Marsden or Rupert Friend as William Timmons,  Michael Biehn as Frank Richards, Sarah Michelle Geller or Claire Danes as Liz MacDonald,  and Ryan Phillippe as Doug Fouche.  The book is a taut thriller that is a quick and captivating read so it should take you no time at all to gobble it up and see if you agree with my casting choices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151IPN57CLGS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514193949#wasThisHelpful","R151IPN57CLGS5","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author, Anne-Laure Thieblemont, is herself an art reporter and trained gem specialists, known for her investigations into stolen art and gem trafficking. Is it any wonder that with THE COLLECTOR she has given us a brilliant novel that combines intrigue, action, suspense and more than a smattering of art history. Her descriptions of various art and gem pieces competently guide even the most unfamiliar or untrained reader through an appreciation of what it takes to authenticate art pieces.Her protagonist, Marion Spicer is an expert in eighteenth century art working for a Paris art house who suddenly inherits an estate including a large, prestigious and tremendously valuable collection of pre-Columbian art from a father whom, for the past thirty-three years, she believed was dead. Wow, Marion is an heiress with a potential fortune, but as with all things that seem to be too good to be true, so it is with this windfall. First, there are the stipulations set forth in her fathers will stating that she is to locate and recover three priceless sculptures before she can inherit so, of course, she sets out to do just that. Second, are any number of individuals, from her father’s assistant to his mistress to other collectors with voracious appetites for acquiring beauty who stand in her way and some of these folks are not above committing murder to achieve their ends.With scenes from Marion’s personal life neatly interwoven into the mystery the tale becomes a measured, slow burning read with compelling characters and secrets that reveal themselves slowly proving that in literature, as in life, not all is what it seems and we must always expect the unexpected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZWHG2CNAZC7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939474442#wasThisHelpful","RZWHG2CNAZC7Z","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HOUSE OF ECHOS is presented more as a gothic mystery than a straight-up horror novel.  It describes the events surrounding a writer named Ben, his wife Caroline who has lost her lucrative banking job and their two sons Charlie and Bub as they leave Manhattan and relocate to the country where they hope to open a B&B and Ben can hopefully overcome his writer’s block and continue to pursue his writing career.They purchase The Crofts, a four story sixty five room Castle like structure on the edge of the Drop, overlooking the village of Swannhaven and begin the gargantuan task of renovating their new home.  Ben and Caroline have suffered some past marital difficulties due to Caroline apparent post partum depression brought on by the birth of their last child, Bub.  Coupled with the difficulties and bullying Charlie has experienced at school, their decision to relocate from the big city to a small village where his “gram” once resided seems like an ideal solution to their various problems.  Surrounding their “castle on the hill” is a forest which, to their son Charlie, is a precious world apart; its familiarity and sameness offering him a sort of comfort helping him cope with the changes in his life outside of its bounds.The villagers of Swannhaven, a town that appears to be caught in a time warp, present a strange and often weird collection of individual personalities whose family histories and beliefs seem to be a strange melding of Christian and pagan observances stemming from a two hundred year old community event called the Winter Siege. Ben’s ultimate discovery of the secrets the town has been hiding results in the unraveling of the very foundation of everything he knows about himself and his family and culminates in dangerous and life threatening events for he and his family.This novel is reminiscent of Tom Tyron’s 70’s tome HARVEST HOME and Robert Marasco’s BURNT OFFERINGS with touches of Stephen King and Shirley Jackson thrown in for good measure.  It is sure to appeal to readers of the aforementioned authors as well as lovers of cult horror movies like THE WICKER MAN.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173KJD8IDZ3Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178119#wasThisHelpful","R173KJD8IDZ3Q7","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I listened to THE DARK TIDE by Andrew Gross on a cross country trip, so one could say I was a captive audience since it was either the book on CD or listening to talk radio or some inane hip hop music station (and no, I don’t have Sirius radio). At any rate, the book began with an interesting premise and could have been fairly compelling read (or listen) had it not been for some of the following:  (1) the author repeated the same information over and over again as I trying to fill up pages (maybe he gets paid by the word), (2) the antics and downright stupidity of the “betrayed” wife began to wear on me about half way through the story as did her redundant and numerous inner dialogs and couldn’t or refused to see what was right in front of her face, (3) the  “romance” between Karen and Detective Ty Hauck was at  best improbable and at worst unbelievable, (4) as a seasoned Detective, Hauck’s behavior as he investigated was more in line with what readers came to expect from a 30’s or 40’s noir novel where the “hero” did whatever it took , B&E to murder, to apprehend the bad guys (rules, ethics and legalities be damned) (4) the inconsistencies in the story were myriad and I found myself listening just to have yet another “aha, gotcha” moment when the ages of children changed or a character’s hair or eye differed from one chapter to another.I could go on ad nauseam (as does the novel) with my observations but suffice to say that unless you are stranded on a desert island and  THE DARK TIDE is the “only game in town”, you would be best served to move on to something that is worth the time and energy you have expended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXZVHOAOH4CNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062199897#wasThisHelpful","RXZVHOAOH4CNN","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Annie Barrows spins an excellent yarn about a Southern Community and provides her readers with a very human context for the larger event that was The Great Depression. As a young woman, Layla Beck, a Senator’s daughter and Washington socialite finds herself exiled (in a manner of speaking) to Macedonia West Virginia after angering her father by refusing to marry his choice of husband and finds herself living as a boarder in the home of one Jottie Romeyn.After having been unwillingly hired as part of the Federal Writers Project sponsored by the WPA, Layla has been somewhat is commissioned to gather background information and write the history of Macedonia.  Of course, everyone she interviews has their own version of the town’s history and their family’s place in it which they are eager to share. Independent Layla, however, prefers to conduct her own investigation and is instrumental in digging up the true history, romance, deception and family tragedies of years gone by.While Layla investigates the town’s history, twelve year old Willa Romeyn has a mission of her own that involves some investigating (or spying if you prefer) on various family and community members in an attempt to discover secrets long held by her father Felix and his sister Jottie.  Her junior Sherlock Holmes persona is equal parts endearing and annoying.Overall, Annie Barrows tells an engaging tale rooted in real life with a handful of characters, some personable and others repellent with some prone to selfish and self-serving actions while others are selfless and noble.Nothing beats a books’ power to transport us to a different place and time and until we master time travel, books like THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO US are a great way to explore and understand a different era in our countries history.  It also provides an inside look at the inner workings and eccentricities of life in a small southern town.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPXCGWNM60IIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385342942#wasThisHelpful","RPXCGWNM60IIP","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First W. Bruce Cameron gave us A DOG'S PURPOSE, a story that vibrated with its own special magic as it told the story of a dog who never truly died but returned again and again in many incarnations as it sought to fulfill what it saw as it's purpose.  The story now continues with the sequel, A DOG'S JOURNEY which, while poignant in places, doesn't quite live up to the first book as it continues the spiritual journey of Buddy/Molly, Max, et al as he/she relentlessly helps a young woman to chart a course through her abysmal childhood and adolescence and directs her toward a promising future.Once again Cameron, via his four legged protagonist, teaches lessons in perseverance, trust, unconditional love and second chances.  While this second offering is a bit more melodramatic than the first it does serve to illustrate two important things - (1) that dogs tend to bring out the best in most of us and (2) that those we love are never truly gone since they continue to live on as long as there is someone who remembers them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQ3LFAXWWCSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765330547#wasThisHelpful","RHQ3LFAXWWCSX","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Suddenly his past has caught up with him and now Marianne, a woman he once saved from a dive off the Golden Gate Bridge, is calling to request his help.  She has discovered she has a “gift” and is now working as a psychic consultant.  Recently she has had a vision of the hillside burial site of victims of violent unsolved crimes.  The only problem is that in that same vision she has also seen her own future as it relates to this case and that future is pretty grim.  Marianne is not really sure of where the bodies are buried but has a general ""feel"" for the area.

"Horace Torrington, once owner of an 18th century manor house called Sterne, is dead and his widow Charlotte and their children now occupy the house.  Charlotte, much to the chagrin of her children, has now married Edward Swift who, as the story opens, is departing the estate in hopes of acquiring a loan to save the family manor.Set in England in 1912 the Torrington-Swift family is preparing to celebrate the 20th birthday of middle daughter Emerald.  Even though the family is in dire need of funds and obviously living far beyond their means, an over the top celebration has been orchestrated with family and friends invited to the festivities. Plans go awry when a train accident occurs nearby and some of the individuals involved, most of whom were “third-class” travelers, arrive at the estate seeking assistance and disrupting the flavor of Emerald’s special evening.  Among the uninvited guests is Charlie Traversham-Beechers, a malevolent character from Charlotte’s rather questionable past who shows up claiming to be a survivor from first class.An ensuing storm, uncooperative guests and an unusual parlor game add tension and threaten the evening in this tome that takes extreme delight in dissecting the pretension and stagnant social mores prevalent in Edwardian England.While Sadie Jones writing is descriptive and delves into the minutia of everything from the servants to the preparation of the dinner being served, it is also much in keeping with the behavior of the residents of Sterne and overall tone of the story – stuffy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35W2D9XCW4JGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062116517#wasThisHelpful","R35W2D9XCW4JGK","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received one of the nickel lined copper mugs in return for an honest review and here it is.On the plus side, these are a nice weight and the hammered look is aesthetically appealing. These would be a great eye-appealing addition to use and display, if you have a formal bar area in your home. The mug is also ideal for hot summer days when you are looking for something cold and refreshing to quench your thirst since it keeps your drink icy cold for hours.  One small problem is the bottom, which is not completely flat.  I’m not saying it rolls around like a child’s “tippy” cup but it does rock ever so slightly.Be sure to use this cup for cold items only because, just as the copper keeps things very cold, it also keeps them very hot.  Do not make the mistake, as my husband did, of pouring a cup of coffee into this cup.  Not only does the surface of the cup stay hot, hot, hot – so does the handle. (ouch!)No dishwasher for these babies either.  Only hand wash and (excuse me if I’m stating the obvious) don’t use any abrasive cleaners or you may cause some permanent damage to the beauty of the copper.Overall, I was pleased with this product and I would say these cups would be an appropriate wedding, anniversary or birthday gift for friends or the perfect addition to your own home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RY0091HJDCZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X98FHG2#wasThisHelpful","R2RY0091HJDCZG","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a great tradition of mental illness in fiction.  We all remember books like Jane Eyre with the crazed Mrs. Rochester neatly tucked away in the attic.  The last few decades have brought improvement in the way mental illness is treated and the way it is portrayed in literature and more recent works like Wally Lamb’s She’s Come Undone or Judith Guests Ordinary People have attempted to more realistically portray mental illness.In ANOTHER NIGHT, ANOTHER DAY by Sarah Rayner the common thread of mental health issues confronting both male and female characters are examined with sympathy and insight.  Initially focusing on three characters, Karen, a woman attempting to come to terms with the deaths of her husband and her father; Michael, a man dealing with the failure of his life’s work, and Abby, mother of an autistic child whose husband has basically washed his hands of the situation and left her to cope with their child on her own.  All these lives intersect at the Moreland Psychiatric Clinic where each has come seeking help in dealing with various emotional issues ranging from panic attacks to anxiety and depression.  There is also a supporting cast whose back-stories, illnesses and coping mechanisms are almost as compelling as those of the central characters with each individual’s reaction to their circumstances molding them into who they are.At times I found the book unnerving and even a bit depressing, but ultimately came to the conclusion that this novel is attempting to warn each of us that we should never judge another's actions or motives nor assume that we know what is going on in someone else’s life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UR6Z1XHJZL2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250066093#wasThisHelpful","R3UR6Z1XHJZL2W","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After discovering a locked garden on their property and becoming intrigued by a photo of the garden in its previous incarnation, Marin engages the services of Joss Fowler, a local gardener to assist with investigation and restoration.Ninety years earlier Eleanor Sanderson, a vicar's daughter, is mourning the wartime death of her brother and seeks comfort in creating a memorial garden. She is assisted in her endeavor by an itinerant gardener hired by her father. While Jack Taylor, is more than willing to assist Eleanor and share his knowledge of horticulture, he is less inclined to share any information about his past. Needless to say Eleanor, against the advice and wishes of her sister, finds herself more and more drawn to Jack.What links these two storylines are the often querulous relationships between the siblings and the vast difference in expected social behavior in each era, the way in which both Marin and Eleanor become fixated on the gardeners who come into their lives and finally, the role of the garden itself plays is helping each individual come to terms with the grief and guilt in their lives.Author, Katherine Swartz skillfully ushers us between the worlds of two women separated by time, but connected by chance, fate and a piece of earth that is instrumental in allowing their lives to blossom. 4 1/2 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF633D4AGJJEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJPKPOO#wasThisHelpful","RF633D4AGJJEF","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HISTORY IS A SET OF LIES AGREED UPON. The title is a quote from Napoleon Bonaparte… not a man respected for his honesty, yet this statement is pregnant with truth.  Exactly how much of the history we accept unquestioningly is fact and how much is fiction.  What part of reality is hidden by myth?.On Sunday, 15 July 1815 the French fought the British under Wellington and, against all odds the battered Prussian army arrived on the field of Waterloo just in time to turn the tide of battle against Napoleon Bonaparte, who reluctantly surrenders to the British. The question now is , “Was he really stripped of every vestige of power, and exiled to the stifling, windswept island of St. Helena to fight the endless boredom awaiting him there or was that the fate of an unknown and here-to-for unnamed double?  Was Napoleon, in fact, given a new identity and under the guidance of a British agent named Bernard Lacey, hidden in plain sight on the Isle of Wight in order to assist the English in establishing and maintaining peace by putting an end to the perpetual threat of war with France (the two countries had been at war almost continuously from 1066 to 1815).Author Carolyn McCrae has offered a fresh perspective on this oft-told story by imagining for us an alternate version of the life of Napoleon in her gripping historical novel that portrays him not as a prisioner but as a family man, friend and neighbor as she takes the fate of this well known historical figure and modifies everything we thought we knew about him.Moving smoothly between the 1800’s and the present day and utilizing themes of family secrets, dangerous deceptions, conflicting loyalties as well as spotlighting the duplicitous political double talk and paranoia that has survived throughout the centuries we are transported back and forth in time as modern day historians attempt to unravel the secret chronicles compiled by Bernard Lacey and discovered quite by chance some 200 years later.Entering into this narrative and enjoying it does not depend on having an interest in Napoleon nor an in depth knowledge of history .  This book should appeal to a plethora of readers since it is a richly imagined novel of ”what ifs” that reads like part biography, part family saga, part mystery and part modern romance. What more could you ask for?","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10VVSL256LUAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKE5T42#wasThisHelpful","R10VVSL256LUAF","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Welcome to Lamb’s Corner, South Carolina, a town with loving and somewhat eccentric inhabitants and a main square filled with shops as quirky and unusual as the folks who work in them.  John Dodge, an itinerant entrepreneur who buys failing businesses, makes them successful and then moves on has arrived in town following his latest purchase a collectible pen store in Lambert Square previously owned by Bob Lee Cowpers whose parting gesture was to provide Dodge with short written character sketches of some of the towns more “notable” residents.On his first day in town Dodge spots Julia Darrow, a young widow with a houseful of rescue dogs and, owner of Cocoon, a luxury linens and lingerie store as she makes her way to work dressed in pajamas. It seems that Julia and her employees wear their designer pajamas as their daily uniforms. Darrow likes to isolate herself and although attracted to Dodge refuses his initial overtures to join him for dinner.While Julia and Dodge soon become the subjects of speculation and gossip, the arrival of owners and employees of Kallsjo, Swedish auto-maker with plans to set up their first U.S. plant in the struggling town temporarily diverts the attention of the town mavens and set them all a-twitter with anticipation.  Among those “twittering” are Mayme Hurt, Exa Stabley and other females Julie employs as well as several of the men of Lamb’s Corner, who are not above engaging in a little gossip themselves.  With names like Heep, Link, Big Dove, LRoy Swagger, Dodge and Bean Hurt it appears that author Rosina Lippi was attempting to give the reader some perspective and  insight into the character and emotional make-up of the citizens based on their names.Filled with a glimpse of small town life and Southern charm PAJAMA GIRLS is also an amusing, romantic tale of the different aspects of love,  loss and acceptance as well as an inside look at what on can lose when a fear of commitment rears it’s ugly head.  While a bit on the “fluffy” side this could be the perfect book to take along on a long plane trip or relax with on a warm summer day at the beach.  3 1/2 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUL7FR5RLVVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013M31F0#wasThisHelpful","R1JUL7FR5RLVVW","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the whimsical tale of a widow named Melody, a guy called Joe and a very opinionated cat named Max who isn't afraid to take action when he thinks it's called for.  When Melody's husband David was murdered two years earlier by what seemed a random act of violence, Max was the only witness to the crime.  Heartbroken Melody first became reclusive and later began using alcohol and men as a coping mechanism.  Max has reached his breaking point with Melody and has demonstrated his displeasure with her ""men"" as cats will --- with generous samples of his urine strategically allocated.Max sees himself as smarter than the average cat (or human for that matter) and feels he can do better in the ""finding a mate for Melody"" department.  This cagey cat's mission and what follows presents the reader with a delightful feel-good read that isn't too taxing on the grey matter.  There's a taste of mystery, a dash of romance, a scintilla of sex, a sprinkling of drama, a smidgen of suspicion and of course solutions and answers to multiple questions.For those who are animal fanciers and/or like their mysteries on the light side this is the ticket.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2HH13A9BERN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087IE3QO#wasThisHelpful","R1K2HH13A9BERN","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VANESSA AND HER SISTER is Priya Parmar's historical and fictionalized tale set in London in the early part of the 20th century that focuses primarily on the lives of writer Virginia (Stephen) Woolf and her artist sister Vanessa (Stephan) Bell.  It explores the complicated family dynamics of the Stephen family and the even more complex relationships and social mores of the Bloomsbury Group.  The group itself began as a social clique: a few recent Cambridge graduates and their closest friends would assemble on Thursday nights for drinks and conversation. Its members were committed to a rejection of what they felt were the strictures and taboos of Victorianism on religious, artistic, social, and sexual matters. They remained a fairly tight-knit group for many years; and Ms. Parmar has attempted to unravel and detail their tangled personal relations.  It appears that this was a group, with their open marriages and scandalous and less than conventional lifestyles, that would have fit quite nicely into the 21st century.Vanessa, is the narrator of this tale which relies on her perception of events as well as letters, telegrams, and postcards accompanied by the journal entries created by Ms. Parmar to advance the storyline. While competition, jealousy and a touch of malice fuels the sisters relationship they were in complete agreement when it came to their love and admiration of handsome brother Thoby.When it comes to her marriage to Clive Bell, Vanessa portrays herself as the betrayed as well as the betrayer while painting Virginia as a mentally unstable, selfish, possessive and envious.  The story is one of the tortoise and the hare with slow and steady Vanessa maintaining her home, marriage, and children, as well as a lover and her dedication to her painting while the ever resentful Virginia races from pillar to post in her quest for center stage and the spotlight.While most of the characters in this book are gifted virtuosos whose work deeply influenced literature, aesthetics, and economics as well as sexuality, very few of them can be lauded for their personal life choices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYQKCS1HPF28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417637X#wasThisHelpful","R3LYQKCS1HPF28","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE FORBIDDEN ROOM BY Joanne Lewis offers a story of conflicting loyalties and dangerous deceptions that quickly engage the reader in a psychological murder mystery that revolves around wealthy Sara Goldstein, a fifth grade teacher standing trial for the murder of her uncle Charlie. Defense attorney Michael Turner is young, relatively inexperienced and quite smitten with his client, having become involved in a personal relationship with her against the continuous admonitions of his grandmother, a famous female jurist who is a pro when it comes to navigating the judicial system.The narrative opens with Sara fainting in the courtroom just as the verdict is about to be read and waking up in a hospital room.  Michael informs her that the reading of the verdict has been postponed until the following day and in the meantime the reader is taken back over the events of the past fifteen years in Sara's life - which involves the childhood of Sara and David (she calls him soldier boy), the FORBIDDEN ROOM of the title where Sara's father keeps his collection of antique trains and carousel horses, their parents tempestuous relationship, and the murder of her parents, an event that has left she and her brother the beneficiaries of a very large fortune.Both Michael and Sara share in explaining the whys and wherefores of this complex tale from their alternating perspectives.  As layer upon layer of the story is peeled away, the threads of their individual stories converge.  With all of the past details revealed, the reader is whisked backed to the courtroom where the verdict is read and the question of Sara's guilt or innocence is answered.While the story is not extraordinary, it is enjoyable and one you can knock off on a lazy afternoon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WNFAGEQPR0FE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLWVLMG#wasThisHelpful","R1WNFAGEQPR0FE","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Mick Herron's Nobody Walks is rugged, resilient and somber, much like its anti-hero Tom Bettany.  It is a tale of a man with a secret and often violent past as an MI5 operative who, years before, left his family and his clandestine past to work in a meat packing plant in France.  He thought that he had put his previous life behind him but now he has received a call informing him of his estranged sons mysterious death and is compelled to try to make up for things left undone and unsaid by returning to England to investigate.  He realizes that this act could put his life in jeopardy and unfortunately it does when his probing brings him face to face with people from his cloak and dagger past.It is difficult to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys in this tale since each and every character is self absorbed and dedicated to their own agenda.  From drug kings, to a video developer to Tom's former MI5 boss, all of the characters in this tale of regret and revenge are pretty slimy and hard to like.This dark, emotional and action filled tale, complete with its fantastic climax, is one that most readers will find it difficult to walk away from.  Reading NOBODY WALKS is akin to having dinner with writers Ian Fleming and Len Deighton and having Red from T.V's BLACKLIST drop by for dessert. 4 1/2 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEROS30JLI52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954868#wasThisHelpful","RAEROS30JLI52","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author, Stephanie Elmas writes with prowess immersing readers in each moment. In THE ROOM BEYOND she provides cohesive narrative that maintains a fluid sense of time, moving smoothly between past and present.  We meet Serena as she begins a new life at 36 Marguerite Avenue where she is engaged as a nanny to young Beth Hargrave.The plot is an engaging one featuring an unusual and numerous cast of characters. The narrative is part love story and part supernatural mystery shrouded in Gothic undertones.  Elmas intertwines the modern day story of aspiring artist Serena and the dashing Raphael with that of the nineteenth century affair between an abandoned wife, Lucinda Eden, and her ne'er-do-well married neighbor Tristan Whitestone whose sick and forbidden love is the stuff of which nightmares are made.  The common denominator in all their lives is the house - and at its core the fact that someone, on this side or the other, just flat out refuses to let go.  There is creep factor on every page of this atmospheric offering with a sense of foreboding that eventually gives the reader an electrifying perspective on life, death and the supernatural.THE ROOM BEYOND should find a willing audience in the fans of movies like The Others or The Innocents or authors like Peter Straub. 3 1/2 STARS","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI7MRWMTJOTC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ433QK#wasThisHelpful","RI7MRWMTJOTC4","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nomi Eve's HENNA HOUSE an expansive historical novel that vividly depicts the exotic world of Yemeni Jews in the first decades of the 20th century.  It is a riveting portrait rooted in real life. It tells not only of a lost culture but deals with the domestic lives of Jewish families (particularly the women) in that particular time and place as it addressed the Jewish tradition of tattooing with henna, family relationships, marriage, betrayal, karma, love, forgiveness as well as an arbitrary statute known as the Orphans Decree which authorized the state to confiscate orphaned Jewish children and raise them as Muslims.The central character in the story is Adela Damari, the daughter of a sickly Jewish cobbler and his petulant wife.  Due to her fathers illness the family is terrified at the thought that Adela could adopted by a Muslim family and forced to convert.  With the arrival in their small village of her father's brother and his son it appears that an engagement to her cousin, Asaf, may offer the solution to five year old Adela's problem.The book goes on to detail the various events of Adela's life over subsequent years and those family members, like Aunt Rahel and cousin Hani, who introduce her to the art and meaning of the henna drawings.While the history of the Jews of the Saudi peninsula is informative and instructional, it is the interaction between the various characters that truly drives this story while utilizing henna as the conduit for the unifying themes of family, art and storytelling.Nomi Eve's exhaustive research and her love of her subject matter is evident in this fascinating book and the plethora of material for discussion should make it a must read for every book club.  Personally, I learned and I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCIIERO040J8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB6TA#wasThisHelpful","R1OCIIERO040J8","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"HISSING COUSINS is a most appropriate title for this dual biography of first cousins; plain Jane First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and willful, vain and politically astute Alice Longworth Roosevelt as it delves into the on again-off again rivalry that peppered the lives of these two strong women, cousins whose circumstances in their childhood initially brought them together. Perhaps their early attachment had more to do with the similarity in their parentless backgrounds than familial love.Two people in this telling appear to be the glue that held this dynasty together - their ""Aunt Bye"" whose home was the central meeting place for the young members of the family and Theodore Roosevelt whose solution to most uncomfortable family situations appears to have been rallying the family with giant ""bear hugs"".If genetics and behavior come into play at all in determining the fate of the members of any family, then the amount of alcoholism, unfaithfulness, political in-fighting and inter-marriage in this clan, make one wonder how the Roosevelt family as a whole turned out as well as it did.What is really evident is that most of the women in this family, from Franklin's mother Sara to the two ladies who occupy center stage in this telling are strong willed, powerful, independent and opinionated women who operated behind the scenes in the political arena quietly wielding their power to advance their individual beliefs and goals and who, in stressful times, stuck together like glue. (Sort of makes one wonder if Alice and Eleanor's perceived rivalry was in reality just a performance guaranteed to generate press).What is evident is that politics have not changed much over the last 100 years. There are several other clans whose family business, much like the Roosevelt's', is politics.  (The Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes, and Rockefellers are just a few that come to mind).  Also evident is that the deception and in-fighting within the parties as well as the perpetuation of outright lies is, and always has been, the order of the day in a game where winning is all that matters.Readers will find the handy family tree located in the front of the book helpful and absolutely necessary in keeping track of all the like-named family members who occupy both branches of this particular tree.  This book is not only informative, it is entertaining as well......a feat not easily accomplished when it comes to biographical history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTWX1P1ISC9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536011#wasThisHelpful","R2LTWX1P1ISC9U","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am the happy ""mom"" of two shi-tzu's who are allergic to most dog foods and/or treats that contain wheat or corn in any form which is one reason why I was happy to give Natural Balance Burger bites a try.  While I thought that the mini burger complete with grill marks concept was cute and the smell okay (sort of like the beef jerky sticks we humans consume) the ""kids"" were reluctant to accept something new.  They finally did accept one - the male was more willing to give this new treat a try than the female who has to see her brother eat it before she will accept it. (She probably thinks she is royalty and requires a food taster - LOL).At any rate, the dogs did consume all of the treats over a one week period with no side effects (like the scratching of their bodies and chewing of their paws reactions that has been experienced with other products).Overall my pets gave this product an ""okay"" but when it comes to something they really love that is made in the USA and has no side effects I would have to recommend the Carolina Prime Chicken Breast and Sweet Tater filets.  They contain only three ingredients, are healthy and my dogs absolutely love them.

Her neighbor Celia has been murdered and Dana was the last person to see her alive.  Unable to remember all of the details of exactly what transpired during her last meeting with Celia she is currently obsessed with discovering if it was she, or someone else, who killed Celia.  The cops and an Assistant Prosecutor named Lenora White are tip-toeing around the fact that she is the prime suspect and to make matters worse she finds herself strangely attracted to the chief investigator on the case, Detective Jack Moss, who also has a dog in this fight, so to speak.What is horribly obvious is not merely that she is ill, but that she is married to a man, Peter, whose treatment of her borders on mental abuse.  She has also discovered that Peter has been having an affair (and perhaps more than one) and Celia is likely one of his partners in the ""extracurricular activities"" department.

"Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Ben Carson is a man with a no excuses, speak your mind approach to abandoning the invisible intimidation of political correctness as he encourages the country to come together to solve our vast social and financial problems.In ONE NATION, utilizing successive chapters, he uses examples from his own less than perfect childhood to illustrate the value of education and parental involvement to encourage others in their pursuit of the American Dream. Using situations from his own life and career he outlines and illustrates problems facing our country today and offers his solutions to problems ranging from our out of control national debt (which greatly concerns him) to ways of improving government efficiency and finally, outlining action steps we all can take to help improve ourselves and ultimately, our country.Carsons impressive rags to riches story coupled with a common sense approach allows him to relate to the many varied segments of society.  This is a man who has worked hard for all he has achieved, is unafraid to express his opinions and ideas and serves as an inspiration, not only to black youth but to all of us, as he advocates for respect and common courtesy, the setting aside of party lines and agendas allowing for a common ground exchange of ideas and potential workable solutions. For a better understanding of Dr. Carson, check out his National Prayer Breakfast Speech on-line or consider his statement on why he doesn't focus on race:  ""You see, when I take someone to the operating room and I peel down the scalp and take off the bone flap and open the dura, I'm operating on the thing that makes the person who they are.  It's not the covering that makes them who they are,""No matter what your political leanings may be Dr. Carson's ONE NATION is an eloquent inspirational tome in which one man shares his life experiences letting us know that the American Dream is not a myth and that he is living proof that with persistence and hard work it is available to all.

"HELLO FROM THE GILLESPIES is a warm and cozy tale about affable people living in the Australian outback and begins with an annual Christmas letter that is a departure from the ""normal"" once a year re-cap one usually receives depicting the perfect family.  From there the narrative blossoms into the sort of read which fans of Maeve Binchy and Rosamund Pilcher would appreciate and enjoy.  Like the tales told by the aforementioned ladies, this story too is character driven and it was very easy to develop a genuine fondness for each and every member of this British/Australian/Irish family and their friends.  The only exceptions might be Aunt Celia who most of us would give a pass because of her advanced years, and Lindy's ""friend"" Jane who is just a jealous and manipulative little shrew and difficult to like on any level.All of the Gillespie clan, from family matriarch Angela and her husband Nick to their three grown daughters and adolescent son Ig, are easy to relate to and a joy to read about.  Some dubious career and relationship choices have brought the sisters; Victoria, Lindy and Genevieve, back home again which is putting a strain on the already challenging relationship between remote and isolated Nick and Angela, whose ""fantasy family"" has almost become a reality for her.I have never been to Australia or even considered living on a ranch in the middle of nowhere, but author Monica McInerney's depiction of the area and the folks who inhabit it is so vivid that the reader feels like they are part of the action.

"THE POSTCARD KILLERS is a joint writing effort by James Patterson and Swedish crime writer Liza Marklund.  In this effort a grungy NYPD cop Jacob Kanon has been chasing the pair of vicious thrill killers all across the Europe. Why his obsessive interest?  Seems that the killers first victims were Kanon's only daughter and her fiancé.Before each murder, the egotistical pair sends postcards with cryptic messages concerning their next kill to a reporter at a local newspaper.  In Stockholm, that reporter is Dessie Larsson.  Kanon enlists her help and, against her better judgment, they join forces in their search for the methodical and devious perpetrators who delight in committing bloody and brutal ""artistic crimes against couples"" After the kill they add insult to injury by stealing and selling valuables belonging to their victims and also maxing out their credit cards. Then they move on, to the next country and their next victims.Our stubborn detective and his resourceful reporter side-kick ably piece together the clues that have escaped the bumbling police in several European cities (obviously Inspector Clouseau has family members serving in police departments all over the globe) and are soon closing in on the killers who are obsessed with living their art.  Although most of the characters in this story are stereotypical and some of the scenarios portrayed are fairly improbable I will admit that there are a couple of clever twists and turns that offer a smidgen of redemption.This is definitely not as satisfying as Patterson's earlier works like ALONG CAME A SPIDER or JACK AND JILL. They were more like a full meal with dessert while THE POSTCARD KILLERS falls into the soup and salad category.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYWNLCVDP1NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JTHXRW#wasThisHelpful","R1CYWNLCVDP1NH","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written with the humor and understanding that are trademarks of her writing, Maeve Binchy's final tomeA Week in Winter takes the reader to the west coast of Ireland where a woman named Chicky Starr has returned to her hometown of Stoneybridge and begins to restore an old, decaying mansion and turn it into an inn where folks can come to escape the problems and hustle-bustle of their everyday lives.  Once again she has populated her story with a large cast of often endearing, sometimes quirky and always beautifully developed characters that are a joy to get to know.  The inn, Stone House, serves as the meeting place for this diverse group of players and even minor characters are an important part of these inter-related stories.  Doctors, a psychic, a frustrated musician, a retired headmistress, a couple whose main occupation is entering and winning contests, and of course the bad boy with the heart of gold are just a few of the folks who populate the pages of this enchanting tale.I have loved Maeve Binchy's books for years.  Her gentle, charming tales illustrate the attitudes, ambitions and relationships of her characters while exploring the effects of contemporary and traditional Irish customs and lifestyles on the folks who inhabit and visit her windswept Emerald Isle.  While this is not the best of her books (try Evening Class or The Copper Beach) it nevertheless gives one the warm, cozy feeling you experience when visiting an old friend.  So snuggle up with the warm beverage of your choice and settle in for A WEEK IN WINTER, another pleasant visit to the time-honored, vivid and definitely unforgettable Binchy style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G4GI5VZ1LA6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MYARTO#wasThisHelpful","R2G4GI5VZ1LA6Q","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this pillow in return for an honest review, and since honesty is the best policy, here goes.  If you are someone who enjoys ""roughing it"" - you know what I mean sleeping outdoors on the hard ground with a rock on which to rest your head you will love this pillow.  It is verrrrry firm (you might call it rock like) and does not easily mold to your head and neck.While I found it extremely uncomfortable for sleeping, I did not give up. Waste  not, want not has always been my motto. With a bit of experimentation, I found that this pillow does extremely well in providing firm support for anyone who enjoys sitting up in bed and reading before calling it a day. It's firmness makes it a great back and head rest and it's ventilation feature keeps you cool. Also, I am a side sleeper with a back that aches through the night. I found that the shape of the pillow works well as a support between my legs and helps to alleviate my back pain.  So as you can see, all was not lost.Overall, I don't like it for sleeping but it is wonderful for the alternate uses I described.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y634U1J3WC0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLQ898#wasThisHelpful","R2Y634U1J3WC0O","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Commencing in the year 2000, an 81 year old Lenka Maisel and 85 year old Josef Kohn meet again under unusual and slightly unbelievable circumstances after a 60 year separation.Josef and Lenka, the young lovers in this tale, are newly married and although deeply in love, one of the driving reasons for their hasty marriage is so that Lenka can be considered a family member and eligible to be sponsored by Josef's cousin in the United States for relocation. The year is 1939 and the Nazis are just steps away from their invasion of Czechoslovakia.  Lenka is stubbornly resolute in her demands that Josef's U.S. family provide sponsorship and passports for her parents and younger sister as well as herself or she will not leave.  Unable to satisfy Lenka's demands,  Josef and his family leave for America while Lenka and her family remain in Czechoslovakia.For those reader's expecting one of those tear-jerker stories of two Jewish people, desperately in love, who are separated by circumstances beyond their control, this is not that story.  Both of these individuals make conscious choices that determine their futures. In fact, a great many of the characters in this book make choices that are based on emotion and denial and not on logic.  Lenka, for one, knows that the German's are closing in, but chooses to abandon her new husband and the safety awaiting her in a new country for an uncertain future with her sister and parents. No one, even after their removal to Terezin (a Nazi camp I had not previously heard of)wants to acknowledge the possibility that there could be death camps and crematoriums awaiting them.Ultimately, the ""love story"" becomes secondary with the true message of the narrative focusing on the Jewish children interned at Terezin whose talents were employed by the Nazi's for their own purposes and the unusual pieces of art hidden within the walls of the camp that have survived to this day.  Also explored are the haunting effects of the war on the survivors who never truly recover from their psychological scars and whose survivor's guilt prevents them from experiencing real happiness.While this book was not at all what I expected, it does present the reader with an object lesson in the cost of complacency and what the true loss of freedom actually looks like.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROUWY8DVVK52C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ERIK56#wasThisHelpful","ROUWY8DVVK52C","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the second of his Spenser novels,WONDERLAND, author Ace Atkins once again picks up where Robert B. Parker left off.  This time it's Henry Cimoli, an old friend who runs the gym where Spenser and his guys (Hawk and Native American Zebulon Sixkill - Z for short) work out, who needs help and he need it fast.  Cimoli has been physically threatened, and some of the elderly residents of the condominium complex in which he lives are in are being pushed to sell their units by an out of state developer who wants the property in order to build a casino.  Since most of the owners are reluctant to sell some local muscle has been dispatched to change their minds.  It's Spenser and his trusty NEW sidekick Z to the rescue.  Spenser successfully does his tough smart-mouth older guy thing, but the outcome for Z is another matter that leaves him a little off-kilter both physically and emotionally.Ultimately a deal is reached between the developer and the residents that satisfies all participants.....but wait.....then the skirt-chasing developer is murdered and Spenser is approached by the widow to find her husbands killer....AND naturally the plot thickens.  What happens next is an exercise in control, greed, jealousy and mayhem.While die-hard Parker fans might miss the presence of the old regulars like Hawk and Spenser's main squeeze Susan in this telling, their absence does not detract from the overall story and Atkins style of writing is a fresh take on the Spenser narrative.  While it doesn't over-tax any brain cells, WONDERLAND is an enjoyable ""escape"" read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1T4TUIEPRAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFPVPMM#wasThisHelpful","R1W1T4TUIEPRAY","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In WOMAN WITH A GUN, Phillip Margolins latest offering, it's hard to judge who is the central character in this tale.  All of the blurbs would have you believe that the story is about Stacey Kim, a young woman who has relocated to New York from the Midwest to pursue her dream of becoming a best selling author.  She is currently stuck in a receptionist's job that she hates.  Using her lunch hour to visit an art exhibit at MOMA, she sees and is captivated by a photograph depicting a woman in a wedding dress, standing at the ocean's edge, holding a gun that could easily have been held by Dirty Harry as he commanded ""make my day"".Stacey begins to imagine a variety of possible stories the picture could tell which could serve as the basis for her, as yet, unwritten book.  All of this occurs in the first seven pages of the novel and the elusive Stacey does not re-appear until page 168 when she decides to leave her dead end job and relocate to the ""scene of the picture"" in order to pursue her true love......writing.  In the intervening 161 pages we meet Megan Cahill, the subject of the photo, two of Mrs. Cahill's lawyers Glen Kraft and Henry Baker, Assistant Attorney General Jack Booth who has more than a passing interest in photographer Kathy Moran as well as an assortment of other peripheral individuals, ranging from an ex-husband to a bar owner to a drug supplier, all of whom float in and out of the story at various intervals.What we ultimately have is a tale of love, revenge and murder perpetrated by an individual whose identity, when revealed, will come as no surprise to most readers. The motives for the crime(s)are a little more involved, but relatively simple.  Having previously read several books by Phillip Margolin I was expecting this book, like his GONE, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN, to be an exceptional and riveting reading experience. Instead, what was delivered was a less than gripping, run of the mill tale that does not live up to the ""haunting, unforgettable thriller that provides a compelling insider's view of criminal behavior"" hype promised on the books' back cover.This is an okay read that will keep you occupied but not necessarily engrossed.  I can recommend it over becoming involved in a mind-numbing conversation with the guy seated next to you on a long flight, but that's about the extent of my endorsement.  Barely 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROBP1MP80JHZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062266527#wasThisHelpful","ROBP1MP80JHZ8","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of us have daydreamed about those ""what if"" situations in our lives....what if I hadn't gotten married, what if I had taken that trip to Europe, what if I had moved out of state after college.  Well you get the scenario.Cynthia Swanson pursues the age old question of ""What if my life were different"" in her new novel THE BOOKSELLER. Set in Denver in the early 1960s, Kitty a thirty-something, single bookshop owner begins to have haunting dreams of an alternate life in which she's a housewife named Katharyn, a mother of three and married to the man of her dreams(pun intended). Eventually the lines between her reality and her almost perfect dream life begin to blur, and she is driven to uncover the truth about her seemingly parallel lives.Kitty's is a thought provoking journey in which she is drawn to her dream life while she and her best friend/partner Frieda desperately try to hold on to their bookshop, whose location and steadily declining customer base, have brought them to the brink of bankruptcy.  This is an emotional and thought-provoking story, the focus of which appears to be how the lack of understanding and control over things in ones life can lead an individual to utilize sleep as a method of coping with, rather than facing head-on, the unpleasant realities fate often throws at us.While most of the characters in this book are pretty stereo-typical and I did see the ""reveal"" coming about 200 pages into the story, I will not go any further with this review, lest I divulge some pertinent plot points that may ruin the story for others. Just let me say that Swanson's Kitty/Katharyn character is one most readers will identify and sympathize with as they observe her frustrating struggle of self-discovery,love and loss.  3  stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MV1CT22S3HCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333003#wasThisHelpful","R3MV1CT22S3HCH","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been many years since I read THE GREAT GATSBY and I thought it was about time that I re-visited Fitzgerald.  I had forgotten how much imagery, symbolism and allegory permeates the story being related by Gatsby's neighbor Nick Carraway, whose ""seeds"" of observation are the basis from which this story sprouts.Since Fitzgerald and his wife spent much of their time post WW1 in Paris one can only assume that he was not enamored of what had become of life in the United States.  Nicks depiction of the land between the ""EGGS"" and New York City as a barren, grey valley of ashes may very well have been F. Scotts vision of American society in the 1920's with the haves and have nots obviously delineated........from the lavish parties thrown by Gatsby and the money spent on acquisitions by Tom, Daisy and Jordan , juxtaposed with the circumstances of George and Myrtle, put to rest (at least in Fitzgerald's eyes) the idea of the United States as a classless society filled with opportunity for all.  Fitzgerald, however, does point out rather eloquently that for all their wealth and material possessions the rich are for the most part just as unhappy and dissatisfied as their poorer counterparts.  Both classes are always waiting for the ""green light"" to pursue their dreams to acquire their hearts desire.GATSBY is both a morality and a mortality tale of a Godless land in which ""the eyes"" (of society?? of God??) are always watching and the fear of living is almost as great as the fear of death.  I'm glad that I ventured back into GATSBY territory because the passage of many years has opened these eyes to the greater depths of the story that I missed the first time around.  Perhaps re-reading those books most of us found so boring in English Lit class would be a good challenge for each of us to undertake.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R44RXGLAEGZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6OMEU2#wasThisHelpful","R1R44RXGLAEGZV","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you enjoy books with unreliable narrators who keep you guessing as to the veracity of their words then you should certainly appreciate THE GOOD HOUSE by Anne Leary.  Hildy Good, the book's narrator, is a woman of ""a certain age"" who successfully sells real estate, maintains a good relationship with her homosexual ex-husband, has two grown daughters and a grandson, and has (after an intervention) gotten her excessive drinking under control and her life back on track.....at least that's what she would have her daughters and several residents of her Massachusetts home town believe.  We all know, however, that devil's in the details and in case of Hildy's addiction it's the denial found within the details that allows the devil to do its work.Hildy considers herself a MENTALIST of sorts when she says, ""I can walk through a house once and know more about its occupants than a psychiatrist could after a year of sessions"". ""Alcoholics, hoarders, binge eaters, addicts, sexual deviants, philanderers, depressives -- you name it, I can see it all in the worn edges of their nests.""  Hildy doesn't seem to realize that she is viewing the town and its inhabitants through an alcohol soaked perspective, so the accuracy of her observations regarding her friends and neighbors is questionable. Couple that with the frequent blackouts and memory lapses she suffers after belting down a few (bottles that is) and is it any wonder the reader would question Hildy's insights.While alcoholism is the firm anchor that grounds the book, it is Hildy's relationship and interaction with the supporting cast that really imbues the story with an underlying uncertainty that drives the plot.  Her friendship with the obsessive Rebecca, her inter-action with the parents of a special needs child and her on-going (since high school) romantic trysts with town handyman/garbageman Frank Getchell as well as the consequences that result from her uncontrollable drinking are just a few of the factors that will draw you in and keep you reading into the wee small hours.Granted, Hildy is a mess, but I really liked the sixty-something year old broad and I think you may too.  She's a survivor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14RK82D80AVD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RLWBC4#wasThisHelpful","R14RK82D80AVD8","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you, like I, tend to be the type of reader who is usually drawn to novels filled with plenty of action and edge of your seat plot twists then you will find Pulitzer Prize winner Marilynne Robinson's LILA to be a little slow.  It falls into the category of more traditional themes and straight-forward storytelling with LILA sharing her innermost thoughts regarding everything from the events in her childhood and the early wanderings that brought her to Gilead, Iowa to her life as the wife of an elderly country preacher.While listening to this book on CD I found it difficult to follow the narrative which is as disjointed as the life of the woman whose story it tells.  The narrative lazily meanders back and forth in time taking the reader from Lila's rescue at age four by the itinerant Doll, to her difficult life on the road where she relies on her instincts and survives by working as everything from a field hand to a cleaning woman in a whorehouse, and finally to her arrival in Iowa, her marriage and pregnancy (events not necessarily told in chronological order).There is an abundance of scripture quoting and examination of the Calvinist doctrines and theology which, while essential to the telling of this particular story, were not particularly absorbing.  While Robinson is recognized as a masterful writer, it was difficult to stay awake for Lila's spiritual search for the meaning of life. This is one of those books with beautiful prose but essentially less than captivating subject matter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30EKXYUZN63FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374187614#wasThisHelpful","R30EKXYUZN63FJ","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With THE ORPHANS OF RACE POINT author Patry Francis has woven a sledgehammer of a story while subtly providing bittersweet insights into love, friendship, forgiveness and redemption.  Set in a tight-knit Portuguese community on Cape Cod, and covering dozens of years ORPHANS is essentially a morality tale told from the alternating perspectives of three of the stories primary characters, Hallie, Gus, and Mila. Several members of the ""supporting cast"" in this richly layered tale also have stories that are equally touching and often tragic but, never fear, Francis has arranged her characters stories in such a vivid and exquisite way you will find the overall tone of the book to be inspirational.Beginning with an act of violence that will forever follow him, Gus Silva faces impossible odds with great courage and resilience and the support of doctor's daughter, Hallie Costa and best friend Neil Gallagher. Building from this starting point Francis has concocted an engrossing plot, a setting so vivid, and a range of continuing themes ranging from revenge to resignation, hatred to hope and grace to greed with each life story connected by the continuously spinning wheel of time and change that illuminates the ways in which each of us finds meaning in our everyday lives.Part a tale of abandonment, part mystery of the battle between good and evil, and part love story, ORPHANS has all the ingredients necessary to make this one of the most unforgettable books you will read this (or any) year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28L0P9DICIZ8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062281305#wasThisHelpful","R28L0P9DICIZ8R","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CUT AND THRUST, Stuart Woods's latest installment in his Stone Barrington series is a foray into the underbelly of the political scene that lays bare the dirty dealing, backstabbing, and formation of back-room alliances required to secure a parties Presidential nomination. In this case the candidate being backed by Barrington is Kate Rule Lee, Director of the CIA and wife of the current President.Barrington and his entourage have traveled to Los Angeles for the convention and to grease the wheels of the Kate for President Express, when he is advised of a death threat against his candidate.  Stone quickly enlists the aid and support of his old friend, SANTA FE RULES lawyer Ed Eagle, to ensure Kate's safety as well as the confirmation of her party.  Just one small thing, Ed has a problem of his own......seems that his homicidal ex-wife Barbara, has not been deterred by her previously unsuccessful attempts to kill Ed and is having another go at destroying him by whatever means necessary.Actually, the Ed/Barbara component of the plot line is much more interesting than the ""Stone Barrington - Filthy Rich Master Political Manipulator"" portion of the story, in which Stone hosts sumptuous parties for the rich and famous of Hollywood and Washington while taking thinly veiled little jabs at the ""other party"".  (Yes, Stu we get the message.

"I began The Paris Wife and was instantly drawn into this atmospherically gritty and smartly nuanced look at Paris in the 1920's.This is a layered and complex portrait of Hadley Richardson, a woman more prone toward the ""vine covered cottage"" sort of life but is instead caught up in the whirlwind life of her husband, Ernest Hemingway.  We follow along as she attempts to navigate the booze filled, free living lifestyle of the City of Lights, as well as cater to the needs and wants of her judgmental and self-absorbed husband.Author Paula McLain has created in interconnected world where the likes of Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein and others engage in sometimes outlandish and often volatile actions and urge the Hemingways to follow suit.This is an intense look at the often bizarre behavior of a group of artistic American expats during the Jazz age, and one woman in particular as she attempts to cope with their Bohemian lifestyle and antics in a valiant attempt to save her marriage.Hadley comes across as woman who has put aside her needs and wants in order to satisfy those of Hemingway while he presents as a morally bankrupt alcoholic whose childhood demons constantly haunt him as he pursues, to the exclusion and alienation of those around him, the recognition he so desperately craves.I am a voracious reader of historical fiction and Paula McLain has done a bang up job at satisfying my appetite.

"It has been 80 years since the Roseland Ballroom opened in 1919 and in her old age the famous dance hall has become a metaphor for the rhythm of life at its various stages. While some of it's patrons are active participants in their own lives others are mere observers and still others resemble the ballroom itself - old and tired with peeling facades that show they are definitely past their prime.The cast of characters range in age from very young to very old and although you get a glimpse into their lives and what drives them, the author never really give you a true in depth look at what it is that lies beneath the surface.  There appear to be only two constant themes running through the narrative and they are - the effect of their mothers on their lives and the sense of satisfaction and temporary fulfillment that dance brings into each of their lives.Despite its developmental shortcomings, this book is a nostalgic trip down memory lane for all those of a certain age who remember going out on a Saturday night to socialize with friends and dance at a local ballroom.  (I personally remember the Aragon and Trianon ballrooms in Chicago and the weekly radio broadcasts where one could vicariously enjoy the ""big band"" music even if you couldn't get to the actual venue in person).This book gets five stars in the areas of dance and nostalgia, but unfortunately only a three in story and character development. 3 1/2 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J6YKZ6KOFEU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062323032#wasThisHelpful","R3J6YKZ6KOFEU1","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The retirement home called Pine Haven is the place where a multitude of human lives converge.  From the pierced and tattooed unwed mother known as CJ who styles the hair and massages the feet of the elderly residents to the thrice married Joanna who sits at bedsides, offering comfort while holding the hand of the dying. Each character in LIFE AFTER LIFE has a story to tell and even the dead come forth to comment on their own passing.Everyone, be they caregiver, resident or visitor uses Pine Haven as a refuge of sorts.  Some seek to avoid facing the consequences of past mistakes while others use it to escape the ugliness lurking in the outside world, where animals are abused and children ignored.Neighbors in the homes adjoining Pine Haven present personalities ranging from weak and oblivious to downright wicked.This is a magically emotional read in which author Jill McCorkle has used a loving touch to create a cast of characters whose strengths, weaknesses, wisdom and hidden secrets (both past and present)are slowly revealed, often providing the reader with a deeper and more meaningful look at aging while showing us that very often solace is found in most unexpected places.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZWH2TMEUADJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565122550#wasThisHelpful","RZWH2TMEUADJZ","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading CARTWHEEL by Jennifer duBois is akin to picking up an issue of The Star or the National Enquirer at the local supermarket.  Most people will be aware that this novel was inspired by Amanda Knox, an American foreign exchange student who was tried for the murder of her roommate.  The Knox case was, and continues to be, fodder for the tabloids.  In duBois's very imaginative fictionalized version of the tale, Lily Hayes is the sexually active, priveledged, and morally complex young woman accused of the murder of her roommate and fellow exchange student Katy Kellers. Kellers is also sexually active and more than a little devious but displays a faade of freshness and innocence.The reader is taken back and forth in time as each character in this sizable cast recounts their actions and interactions with and between the two women from their individual perspectives.  From Lily's put upon father Andrew and Sebastian, Lily's next door neighbor and part time boyfriend to her younger sister Anna, each narrator comes with plenty of personal emotional baggage.  For the most part, all of the characters in this book are not very likable - from the victim herself and the smarmy Sebastian down to the Argentine prosecutor Eduardo Campos, who is possibly the most interesting and complex character. Eduardo is a man advanced in years who seems to have a genuine dislike for young people and their youthful peccadillos .  While he never really stoops to actually altering the facts in the cases he prosecutes, he is not above omitting certain data while at the same time utilizing everything from biased media depictions of the two women (casting them as virgin and vixen - young girl versus woman) in order to manipulate and adjust public perception. He is a bitter climber with an agenda.The author manages to bring to life the sights, sounds and smells of Argentina as she leads us through the unfathomable nightmare that results from what was supposed to be a young woman's fun filled cultural experience.  Lily, it seems, is her own worst enemy.As for the title, Cartwheel, it is the perfect metaphor for the mental gymnastics the reader goes thru as they turn the details in this narrative over and over while conducting an inner monolog in attempt to arrive at a viable answer to the question ""Did a young woman who appears to have everything going for her really commit murder""?","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MRKJWOAYQT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995864#wasThisHelpful","R5MRKJWOAYQT7","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sleepwalker's Guide to Dancing is compelling stuff, engaging the emotions from the first page and becoming almost impossible to put down.  It is a vibrant, imaginative family saga that spans 20 years and is, by turns, amusing and appalling but hard to resist.  Mira Jacob manages to balance the caustic humor and heartfelt compassion surrounding this dysfunctional family, originally from India and now living in the US, in a way that draws the reader in as each family member deals with their own individual demons.SLEEPWALKER'S GUIDE focuses on the interaction between the Eapen family; Kamala, Thomas, Akhil and Amina as well as and their adopted/extended family.  Narrated primarily by Amina, a once successful Seattle photojournalist who has abandoned that career following a tragic incident and is now following her passion for photography via wedding assignments. Having always been a ""daddy's girl"" of sorts Amina returns to Albuquerque when her mother informs her that her brain surgeon father, Thomas, has been carrying on lengthy conversations several deceased relatives. Are these conversations merely a coping mechanism for the brilliant surgeon or is there something else at the bottom of his behavior?Moving back and forth in time we experience the many aspects of the family's secrets as well as the losses that have made each of them who they are today.  The title itself alludes to the various times when sleep, sleepwalking and lack of sleep are instrumental in the outcome of various situations confronting this family.Despite its sometimes abrupt jumps from one time period to another as well as the swearing and sex scenes that often seemed out of place in the story, this is for the most part a credible, relatable and complex story whose almost 500 pages move along at a steady pace as we follow the book's protagonist as she makes surprising discoveries not only about her family, but about herself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3IW6AHCHKY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994787#wasThisHelpful","RD3IW6AHCHKY2","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?""  A version of that question could also apply to Dennis Lehane's latest book THE DROP which began as a movie script based on a 10 year old unpublished Lehane novel which he used as the basis for a short story called ANIMAL RESCUE, about an abused pit bull, that now serves as the inspiration for a movie script he wrote for the film called (what else) THE DROP. (James Gandolfini's last movie).Now that we have that out of the way, let me give you a brief overview of the novel (hopefully just enough to whet your appetite without divulging any of the secrets).  THE DROP is the tale of an abused abandoned puppy left in a trash can by a psycho named Eric. The pup is rescued by a quiet unassuming bartender named Bob who works in a neighborhood bar called Uncle Marv's.  Marv is Bob's cousin, and ostensibly the bar owner, however, the bar is no longer his since being taken over by a Chechen gang who use it (along with other places around the city) as a ""drop"" for illegal money. In addition to the aforementioned trio there are several other quirky characters making appearances throughout the story, including the very Catholic and unusually observant and persistent Detective Torres, the reticent Nadia, a woman with a questionable past who helps Bob take care of his rescued pup, and an assortment of nasty Chechens whose methods of persuasion are right out of a Jason Statham flick.  Are you intrigued yet?Just know that there is a lot of story and plenty of action crammed into the scant 207 pages of this little gem. There are definitely more sinners than saints peppering its pages and the back story of each character is more than a little intriguing.  I finished this book in one evening, so that should tell you how quickly the narrative moves along and how truly adept Dennis Lehane is at seducing his readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXU1L2WCA0JVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365444#wasThisHelpful","RXU1L2WCA0JVN","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"W IS FOR WASTED is a parade of lives wasted due to addiction, extortion and estrangement.  Author Sue Grafton takes us on a trip back in time to the 1980's with her ever independent straight shooter of a P.I. Kinsey Millhone as she is caught up in a double edged mystery involving two dead men, one a private eye with questionable ethics and the other a homeless stranger who, for some reason, has left Kinsey a bequest in excess of a quarter of a million dollars.How did a homeless man amass this amount of money?  Why did he disinherit his three grown children and leave his money to a complete stranger?  How are the deaths of these two men connected?  In her pursuit of answers to these and other questions, orphan Kinsey's family tree grows larger when, in the course of her investigation, she comes upon some new and previously unknown relatives from her father's side of the family whose antics set her teeth on edge.Making a surprise return engagement is Kinsey's former lover Robert Dietz as well as some old favorites like her octogenarian landlord Henry and his neurotic brother William, who has returned from a recent trip with a  Japanese bobtail cat in tow.No need to detail the particulars of the novel, however, let it be said that the fundamental themes of unbridled greed and flawed characters runs through both narratives, which seems to be more than appropriate for the ""me -me-me"" materialism of the time period being portrayed.Once again, Sue Grafton has delivered a choice little time capsule of enjoyment to her readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90S1ZXIN0GAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425271579#wasThisHelpful","R90S1ZXIN0GAH","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LUCKY US by Amy Bloom is a novel that is full of observations and surprises, some good some questionable. It is the story of two half sisters, Eva and Iris who share the same father but different mothers and the people who change the trajectory of their lives as they experience and survive abandonment, poverty and the period before, during and after the Second World War.  Set primarily in the 1940's it examines the way that war forever changed the level of integration in this country, the treatment of ""non-Americans"",  as well as the roll of women, taking them from housewife to wage earner and providing them with a freedom not previously experienced.The narrative is non-linear and has, for this reader, an added bonus.  Since I love epistolary books, I was pleased to find that a portion of this book was written in this form, with letters, both sent and unsent, revealing the inner thoughts of the sisters, their father and Gus, a German man whose life and fate is dramatically and unjustifiably altered because he stands in the way of Iris's personal needs.Like another book I read recently (LILY LOVE), this author too has used the titles and/or words from jazz, blues and popular songs of the era as the heading for each of her chapters providing the essence of that chapter's content. This tactic provides a stroll down memory lane where cultural divides were often bridged by popular music.Bloom definitely has a way with words and in LUCKY US paints pictures of symbiotic relationships that are often amusing, sometimes heart wrenching and occasionally decadent and sexual in nature.  (For those who harbor an aversion to the inclusion of any type of GLTB theme in their reading material - consider yourself warned).Overall, this is a gem of a book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP7DUPZSDA0FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067243#wasThisHelpful","RP7DUPZSDA0FL","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the time we were small children and read fairy tales we have been exposed to the idea of individuals making a deal with the devil in order to achieve something in their lives, be it fame, fortune, beauty or power.  Sometimes the devil's name was Rumpelstiltskin, in Little Shop of Horrors it was Audrey II, and in the movie DEVIL""S ADVOCATE John Milton delivered dreams on demand. Now, with DOWNFALL, author Jeff Abbott gives us a new deal making/ wish fulfilling, master manipulator of a devil. His name is Belias and he can fulfill your every wish IF you're willing to pay the price by doing his bidding.Abbott's protagonist Sam Capra is an ex-CIA agent, husband, and father.  He is in his mid-twenties and is the quasi-owner of an international network of bars that are in reality owned by a secret group known as The Round Table. How and why Sam came to ""own"" the bars and how Belias gained his power are part and parcel of this story.Much like Lee Child's Jack Reacher character, Sam has a talent for inadvertently becoming involved in other people's problems while just minding his own business and trying to lead a ""normal"" life. While checking in at one of his bars, The Select in San Francisco, he is drawn into a convoluted game of murder and mayhem when two killers enter his bar in pursuit of a young woman named Diane Keene who begs Sam for help.  Ever the chivalrous, macho male, Sam rushes to her aid and when the smoke clears one of the attackers is dead and the other seriously wounded.From that point forward the reader, along with Sam, is drawn into a fast moving, multi-faceted; Gordian knot of a tale where no one and nothing is what it seems and it is difficult to separate the good guys from the bad.  The denouement, takes place over several chapters as Sam deftly unties the knots leading him to the infamous Belias.While reading the two previous Sam Capra books would have provided more back story about Sam, I do not feel that beginning with DOWNFALL in any way lessened my enjoyment of this novel.DOWNFALL is recommended for fans of Vince Flynn, Robert Crais, Allan Folsom, Robert Ludlum and of course, Lee Child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLENV83RNN7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455528420#wasThisHelpful","RMLENV83RNN7D","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are all sorts of love - the love you have for your child, the love you share with your significant other, the special love that sibling's share, the love that grows from chance encounters and the fleeting love of caring strangers who come in and out of your life.  With LILY LOVE author Maggi Myers has touched on all of the above as she takes the reader on a voyeuristic journey into the life of a woman dealing with a special needs child while simultaneously attempting to find some peace and comfort in her own life.Since this book explicitly details the daily challenges faced by a woman with a special needs child and since Ms. Myers other novel THE FINAL PIECE also deals with the same subject matter and also because her novel's dedication page contains the same message as the one penned by Lily's mother Caroline in her novel, I am fairly certain that either Ms. Myers or a close friend or family member does indeed have a special needs child that has provided the author with an up close and personal view of struggles and obstacles confronting all  caregivers.Ms. Myers must also be a pop music enthusiast hence her use of various appropriate song titles as the headings for each and every chapter (she even devotes two pages at the end of the book to recognizing the recording artists who made each ditty a hit).There are a few instances early in the book where Caroline's angst over her daughter's situation and her somewhat selfish need to be Lily's one and only caregiver, the trauma of her divorce from Peter, and her self-imposed guilt trip take on a maudlin and mawkish tone but Ms. Myers manages to regroup, diverting her protagonist and re-directing her onto a more positive path. This is a graphic illustration of overcoming the hurdles that confront each of us before we learn to accept and appreciate how mysterious and beautiful life really is. Overall, not a bad read.  3  stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12OR6AW1COZ1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477822429#wasThisHelpful","R12OR6AW1COZ1V","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sue Vreeland's LISETTE'S LIST is essentially written on two levels and while it does an admirable job in recounting certain aspects of WWII as well as presenting an art history lesson focusing on the fate of paintings by Pissarro, Cezanne, Picasso and Chagall during the German occupation of France it is not as effective in fulfilling expectations in the areas of plot intensity nor in character motivation and development.Lisette, the title character, is a Parisian girl raised in a Catholic orphanage where she experiences the beginnings of her appreciation of art.  After her marriage to Andre she reluctantly relocates to his home town in Provence in 1937 in order to provide care for his elderly grandfather Pascal, a man who has accumulated several works by the aforementioned masters. Pascal's reminiscence concerning his acquisition of the various works becomes part and parcel of the story.With the outbreak of WWII and the Nazi occupation of France, Andre enlists in the military, but not before hiding his grandfather's precious paintings and Lisette is left to try to assimilate into a town where some view her as an outsider who resists their culture and provincial ways while a handful of others befriend her.In the ensuing years Lisette overcomes many obstacles and the reader is invited to follow along as she copes with everything from Nazi's looking for Pascal's paintings to the unwelcomed advances of a local townsman to learning how to make cheese, all the while bent on determining the location of the missing paintings.When one takes a step back and considers the overall story, it is obvious that this book succeeds less effectively as well plotted work of historical fiction than it does as a primer into the history and interpretation of certain works of modern masters and their use of ochre pigments within those works.As a long standing fan of Sue Vreeland, I am sorry to admit that this is not one of my favorites.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NR73A3AL1AOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400068177#wasThisHelpful","R3NR73A3AL1AOK","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG by Elizabeth Gaffney uses a Brooklyn Heights neighborhood and a select group of its inhabitants to tell its story.  Gaffney has managed to encapsulate a time in U.S. history from post WWII to the""police action"" in Korea and give the reader an overview of those times.  Throwing into dramatic relief an era of wartime situations and focusing primarily on the emotional sacrifices made by four women during this time period as well as the changes in social convention the reader is swept into the lives of Wally Baker, her mother Stella, grandmother Gigi and Loretta the maid - the person who provides the emotional glue that sustains these women through trying times.  Confronted by separation from loved ones and multiple losses these women are forced to face their challenges as well as the consequences of the choices they have made.This is a novel that will take you back to a time when rationing was the order of the day and the women on the home front, who had previously been delegated the roles of homemaker, stepped up to display a strength and power they had been previously required to keep under wraps.Told from the viewpoint of Wally, the young protagonist, the book also deals with, among other things, interracial relationships, infidelity and suicide.  If all of this sounds like it might be a promising basis for a soap opera, you could be right.  While the book does hold the reader's interest as it examines this particular time in history, it is also a little ""over the top"" in the amount of calamity that it heaps on one family.  For that reason 3 ½ stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226B4JILSFBBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400064686#wasThisHelpful","R226B4JILSFBBY","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3D3M8MJ07BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's start off with the good.  This cutter has 2 cutting wheels, feels good in your hand and does a great job cutting pizza.  And it's well-priced too.  In fact, I own another Cuisinart pizza cutter and it has held up pretty well.Now the bad.  I feel that the design is inherently quite dangerous.  Let me explain why...This pizza cutter has nearly razor sharp blade wheels.  Two of them.  And normally, that's a great thing, as it will obviously cut better with sharp blades.  And the wheels have a plastic cover to protect the blades and your fingers when not in use.  So far so good.  And the unit opens for cleaning.  Seems like another nice design feature.But...Opening the unit requires that you grasp the sides of the case and use a little bit of force to pull the case open, leaving your hands and fingers right next to razor sharp blades.  I was quite careful but cut my thumb knuckle anyway.The instructions, in tiny print, merely state to ""pull the case open"" and to ""use caution"" around sharp blades.  But in my mind, that's not enough of a warning and I do believe that there is a hazardous design flaw involved here.By the way, it is possible to open the case with the blade guard in place, but that's not obvious nor is it stated.So...Pros.  Good feel, good cutting ability, good brand, favorable price.Cons. Potentially dangerous.  I believe there is a design flaw which represents an safety hazard that will cause many/most users to cut themselves.I like Cuisinart products, so I almost feel bad about giving the product such a poor rating.

"There are a number of these wine aerators on the market, and they all do pretty much the same thing, i.e. aerate the wine which often improves the flavor.I tested Tanors Wine Decanter Aerator with a bottle of Unruly Red, which is an expensive red blend and interestingly, apparently the #1 selling wine at BevMo.  While this wine is solid for it's price, it's not exactly high-end juice.  But it's tasty enough for a cheapie.The differences between wine straight from the bottle versus wine poured through the Tanors Aerator was evident.  The wine was smoother, more open, and just more all around enjoyable.Would I use this Aerator on some really, really good stuff?  Frankly I'm not sure.

"Very bland.  I don't taste basil in it.  You really need to add some seasoning to it.  It's full of tomatoes, but no vitamin C, so that's kind of odd.  Where did the vitamins go?Personally, I prefer the canned cheapie tomato soup to this.  This soup does have little piece of tomato in it, but as noted, very bland with minimal basil flavor.I don't love these cartons.  For some, they can be very difficult to open.  If you are a senor, or have disabilities, you might have problems with the packaging.Also, these have a relatively near-term expiration date (5 months out), so they don't have the shelf life of a canned product, which again, I prefer.

"America maintained a large presence in Europe during the cold war. A lot of it was initially in France, which had served as an allied logistics base during the conquest of Germany. France made sense. It was close enough to the Iron Curtain to support a war should one break out, but far enough back to be safe.DeGaulle's pride would not have it. He asked the Americans to leave, and so they did. They relocated their European logistics center from Orleans to Zweibruecken, just over the border. They took over Kreuzberg Kaserne, a former Germany army base. The focus of the activity was a large IBM 360 computer. As Dan Feltham writes in Big Blue Goes to War, Army supply had been automated since the 1960s.It was a good post. Army people enjoyed accompanied tours. Department of the Army civilians often ""homesteaded."" They grew to love this place. A fair percentage learned German; some married Germans. There were a few other hangers-on such as those of us from IBM who supported them. This is a collection of stories about this group of talented, adventuresome souls who were there during the time of America's ascendancy and Germany's resurgence. A good glimpse of life and times.There are several recurrent themes in the book. As the installation was right on the French border, people often had to deal with border guards. Try explaining to a customs agent who asks you to open the trunk that a Corvette has no trunk. Another was the wonderful and spontaneous parties. The French being one of the three occupying powers, there was a French base in Zweibrücken. We could buy very drinkable French sparkling wine. The buildings had foot thick walls with casement windows on the inside and outside. At Christmas time every year they would put the sparkling wine on the windowsill between the two windows. At an appropriate hour the afternoon the windows would open, corks would pop, there would be a delicious spread of sausages, smoked meats and cheeses.Another theme was the French restaurants right across the border. Every little town seemed to have a restaurant/hotel ""Cheval Blanc,"" or white horse, offering an inexpensive table d'hote that was invariably delicious. People would trek the 10 or 15 miles to a restaurant and have wonderful dinners.There are a number of memorable quotes. Ernie Richards noted that Perrier was not much on its own, but it was the best thing that God could have created to mix with Scotch whiskey. Perrier was cheap and plentiful, and it probably still came from the artesian well that they show in their advertisements.One of the afterwords in the book, by Laveeda Liggins, is entitled ""Women's Lib in Support Group Europe."" The substance of her comments are that there was no need for women's Lib. Laveeda notes that she and Mary Green, the author of this book, succeeded on their merits. That is one of the great things about the field of programming. If you can do the work, you will get recognition. If you can't, you don't. These women were both outstanding.A theme entirely absent from the book is the treatment of other minorities. The book includes sections by and about people who are black and gay. Mary does not find it even worth mentioning. Everybody in Zweibrücken accepted them as they were. Those were simple times, when tolerance was a virtue that one simply expected of well bred people, and this worldly group was able to assimilate people of goodwill and ability whatever their background. It need not be remarked on, and it certainly did not need to be enforced. Zweibrucken was a much more comfortable place to be than a modern university campus.It helped that the Army had been the first major institution of the United States government to be fully integrated, by President Truman in 1948. Advancement in the Army was a function of standardized tests and evaluations. My experience in Vietnam had been that it was as colorblind as any process could be. Zweibrucken reinforced that observation. This is a group of talented people who respected each other's abilities and worked together to get the job done. And, as this book and the 40 years of reunions demonstrate, the mutual affection was deep and genuine.Let me recount a couple of personal reunions that took place in Germany.  The first was with a computer.  An IBM 1401 that had been in Danang, Vietnam when that was my territory in 1969 was relocated to Kaiserslautern, Germany when I was in Zweibrücken.  Even more amazing, the officer in charge turned out to be a Capt. Campbell - one of the beneficiaries of Truman's integration - who had run a supply operation when I was in Danang.The book concludes with photographs taken over the years at reunions. For a large percentage of the people there, Zweibrucken was the defining period of their lives. This book is worth reading for an appreciation of how good it was to be an American at this point in history, and how gracious the American people truly were.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162P4ZNMC6J5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1495175790#wasThisHelpful","R162P4ZNMC6J5C","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SJW's infiltrated the gaming industry, an odd corner of the business universe of the social universe that few of us pay attention to. As Vox Day says, gamers got no respect either from the left or the right. People look at gaming as pretty much a waste of time, an exercise for losers, and discount the fact that there are serious people in the business, doing serious things and making serious money.Vox Day is one of them. In this tight little world, he enjoys high standing.This is a personal story, told with passion. It is well-organized – told in a series of lists and bullet points. The beauty of the book is as much in the language as anything else. Vox Day is articulate, incisive, and as his critics will say venomous with great effect. His visceral hate of all the social justice nonsense comes through on every paragraph.Vox Day starts takes the existence of social justice warriors as a given. There is a long history he does not investigate. It goes back by my recollection to the Herbert Marcuse's in the Frankfurt school, the campus radicals of the free speech movement, the political correctness of the 80s and 90s, and it culminates today with the social justice warriors. The premises are the same, and the illogic is the same.Vox Day quotes some historical sources going back to Aristotle and some modern sources such as Theodore Dalrymple writing about communists, Roosh V who writes and blogs in the manosphere, John Derbyshire and Nicholas Nassim Taleb. But his story is not really what makes a social justice warrior – he'll leave that for somebody else – but how to fight them when they infest an organization you are associated with and threaten to bring the organization's progress to a halt and to end the association of you, the unsuspecting white male, the fair-minded white male, with the organization.  Get you fired or ejected.An extremely valuable book.  It succinctly describes a major social issue and concrete steps to deal with it.  Five Stars.  That ends a short review.

He studied in England and Berkeley, coming up in what is called the London school of psychometricians, following in the steps of Francis Galton, Charles Spearman and Karl Pearson, who developed the science of statistics as much to research human intelligence as for any other reason. Working with Hans Eysenck and other scholars of the age, he embraced sociobiology from its inception with EO Wilson and Richard Dawkins in the 1970s.Rushton's research into human differences brought him into conflict with the academic leftists who had ascended to leadership positions in the major universities. These included Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin, and Steven Rose. The cultural Marxists pursued and persecuted him everywhere, preventing his work from getting published, having him banned from conferences, and physically attacking him.  Google ""Resolute Ignorance on Race and Rushton"" for a well written account of the abuse that he took.This is a long book, laden with tables and accounts of statistical studies. This is as it must be in order to present a convincing argument. The human being is inherently difficult to measure. It is literally impossible to get a representative sample for any statistical study. The truth must lie in the correlation of many, many studies. In this instance, the correlation of studies of populations in the United States, the Caribbean and Africa. The correlation of people who are black by genetic analysis, self report, and skin color. Factoring in the admixture of other races. Using school samples that knowingly omit, must omit children who are not capable of performing schoolwork and children who have dropped out. Rushton writes extensively about his methodology, and extensively once again on the large numbers of studies that more or less concur in order to support his theses.I recommend that the reader Google ""rushton-the-great-theoetician.pdf"" (with the misspelling intact) for a 20-page paper that quite aptly and fully summarizes his work. Turn to this complete book for the thorough analysis necessary to support his conclusions.All the previous researchers in the London school, in fact all psychometricians, have observed that there are racial differences in average intelligence. Although there are geniuses in every population, such as Thomas Sowell, Paul Robison and Clarence Thomas among modern Blacks, the average measured intelligence of African Blacks, American Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics, Caucasian Americans, North Asians and Ashkenazi Jews is spread out over a wide spectrum.  At the extremes, less than a 10th of one percent of black Africans would be smarter than the average Ashkenazi Jew. Joseph Conrad's portrayal of the races in ""The Heart of Darkness"" rings true.Rushton advocates what he calls the life history approach to racial differences. Succinctly put, there are two broad reproductive strategies among sexually reproducing organisms. Aspens and oysters produce a vast number of fertile seeds which they disseminate into the water in the air. Only a very few grow, but it is enough to perpetuate those species. Avocados and orangutans invest a great deal in protecting their progeny. The avocado fruit and seed are very rich, and the orangutan bears a child only every three or four years, investing a great deal of maternal attention in that child.  Baby avocados and orangutans have a good chance of reaching adulthood.These divergent reproductive strategies are called r/K selection:  r for rate of reproduction, K for carrying capacity.  Researchers have found a high degree of correlation among many traits associated with r/K selection.--------  Family characteristicsLarge litter size  --------  Small litter sizeShort birth spacing  --------  Long birth spacingMany offspring  --------  Few offspringHigh infant mortality  --------  Low infant mortalityLittle parental care  --------  Much parental care--------  Individual characteristicsRapid maturation  --------  Slow maturationEarly sexual reproduction  --------  Delayed sexual reproductionShort life  --------  Long lifeHigh reproductive effort  --------  Low reproductive effortHigh energy utilization  --------  Efficient energy utilizationLow encephalization  --------  High encephalization--------  Population characteristicsOpportunistic exploiters  --------  Consistent exploitersDispersing colonizers  --------  Stable occupiersVariable population size  --------  Stable population sizeLax competition  --------  Keen competition--------  Social system characteristicsLow social organization  --------  High social organizationLow altruism  --------  High altruismRushton found that these apply as well to human populations.  Though all humans are highly K specialized, Mongoloids are the most, and Africans the least.  This is the source of the controversy.In summary, I recommend that the curious reader first look at the two articles I cite above, and buy the book if you want more.  Also see The Ulster Institute web site for related publications.  A group of highly talented academics is continuing his work and making his writings available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SV8QER2OV4Q1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1291389555#wasThisHelpful","R2SV8QER2OV4Q1","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the phishes described in this book is reputation mining.  Both authors are Nobel prize winners in economics.  We know Shiller especially from his Case Shiller index of housing prices, a highly useful tool for predicting events such as the 2008 housing bubble.  The book will sell on the strength of these reputations.George Ackerlof is married to --- Janet Yellen.  I had not known.  I found that fact via Google only after reading the book.  It has a lot of explanatory power for the contents of the book.The book's fundamental premise is that we are all taken for phools some of the time, and we should be wary all of the time. The Milton Friedman school of economics was premised on the idea that everybody knows and acts upon their own best interest, and that the aggregate of everybody acting in their own self-interest leads to an optimal arrangement, a concept that dates back to Adam Smith's ""Wealth of Nations"".The modern instantiation of that concept, according to the authors, is modified only by the recognition of externalities and income distribution. But, the authors tell us, the torrent of recent books on financial illogic tells us otherwise. They quote Freakonomics author Steven Levitt, ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" author Daniel Kahneman, and several others. They do not mention Dan Ariely, Michael Shermer, Robert Trivers and others who write in the same vein. The bottom line, however, is exactly as the authors say. We act according to our wants rather than our needs. We do not recognize our needs, and our wants are often perverse. They name, as especially egregious examples, gambling, tobacco, alcohol and drugs.Jumping to the conclusion, part three of the book seems more an exhortation, a defense of the status quo than an evenhanded presentation of the facts. They discount the severity of regulatory capture, and trumpet the benefits of government oversight bodies such as the FDA, the securities exchange commission, and the interstate commerce commission. They laud the positive outcomes of Social Security, Medicare, and other transfer programs. There is no discussion whatsoever about the sustainability of these programs, or the phishing aspect of their enactment. In my words, the promise of benefits today to be paid for by taxpayers tomorrow is a very popular political phish. Free lunch; something for nothing. Although how long this phish can go on has to be a topic of pillow talk for Ackerlof and Janet Yellen, no such discussion finds its way into the book.The authors do not touch on many topics that would complicate their case. Technology is exacerbating income inequality. Smart people are becoming more productive, not so smart people are becoming increasingly superfluous in the American economy. During what they call the Age of Reform, 1890 to 1940, America was still largely governed by the scions of the founding fathers. The common good and the Protestant ethic were seen to coincide. Since that time America has experienced vast immigration by North Asians and Jews, who though very competent and successful maintain identities apart from the founding stock, and by Hispanics, Muslims and others. America's involuntary minorities, American Indians and especially Blacks, have gained political power. The increasing level of mutual mistrust is evident in crime reports in the daily newspapers, throughout the blogosphere, and in every political situation. The authors should recognize that a large amount of phishing involves appealing to tribal instincts. Every author must set boundaries in order to craft a book small enough that people will read it. While the authors did a great job with the topics they chose, I would observe that they could have edited down the good material they present to find room for some more relevant topics.The book is well written and has an excellent bibliography. It is very centrist, very much an establishment work, as one would expect from the Princeton University Press. For what it is, it deserves five stars. For what it is not, the reader owes it to himself/herself to look to other sources.That's the end of a short review. Here follows a chapter by chapter analysis.Part One – Unpaid Bills and Financial CrashCHAPTER ONE Temptation Strews Our Path.The economy functions not by satisfying our needs but by satisfying our wants. The mortician does not sell you a reasonable priced funeral, the car dealer does not sell you what you need for basic transportation, the grocery store does not sell you what you need for nourishment. If they did they would starve. No – on the contrary they sell you what you will buy, even if it is not what you need, or detrimental to your self-interest.CHAPTER TWO Reputation Mining and Financial CrisisA good reputation is built up over a long period of time. A company can cash in on a good reputation, turning it into money by taking advantage of people who continue to believe in what once was. They cite the rating agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, as examples. I will name my former employer IBM. It had a reputation as an outstanding employer, phishing those of my coworkers who stayed on in the expectation of secure employment and a decent pension. Defaulting on that trust brought the company a lot of profit for many years. I will add a reputation that these authors pointedly omit. The United States' worldwide reputation for sound money ensures that Ukrainian mattresses are stuffed with dollars, not Euros.  Our reputation has allowed the US to sell treasury bonds throughout the world. In monetizing the federal debt, selling it to foreigners, we have abused that trust. The phish have gotten wise. As this book comes out, China is dumping treasury bonds faster than the government can print them.PART TWO Phishing in Many ContextsCHAPTER THREE Advertisers Discover How to Zoom In on Our Weak Spots.The best part of the chapter is a history of three early advertisers, Albert Lasker, Claude Hopkins, and David Ogilvy. These geniuses managed to add value to oranges by turning Sunkist into a brand, exalt the process that every brewer used to the benefit of one brewer in particular, and turn an ordinary soap, Palmolive, into something the promised beauty. Advertising is a classic phish. Create a story, such as the Marlboro Man, that the buyer can identify with and they will not research the actual merits of the product.CHAPTER FOUR Rip-offs Regarding Cars, Houses, and Credit Cards.This chapter focuses on the big transactions in life. They pit buyers, who confront these situations infrequently, against sellers who do so every day. The buyers get ripped off on origination fees, points, financing terms, unneeded insurance and a million other costly extras. Credit cards charge an unconscionably high interest rate to those who do not scrupulously pay their bills when due.CHAPTER FIVE Phishing in Politics.Voters are dumb. We vote emotionally. The authors cite Senator Charles Grassley making a commercial of himself riding on a lawn tractor, portraying himself as a common man. That's what wins votes. A topic they might have explored is how emotional issues such as gun ownership/gun control are so key to getting politicians elected and so irrelevant with regard to what they do once in office.CHAPTER SIX Phood, Pharma, and PhishingThe story here is Cinnabon, which floods airport lounges with the scent of cinnamon just when the traveler is tired and hungry. The high calorie content and the price are irrelevant. People buy what is not good for either their pocketbook or their waistline, and the company coins money.CHAPTER SEVEN Innovation: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.Some very interesting research here. Innovation accounts for 7/8 of the improvement in our standard of living, increased capital investment only 1/8. However, not all innovations are good for us. They provide histories of slot machines and Facebook.CHAPTER EIGHT Tobacco and Alcohol.The authors have nothing good to say about any of these. They provide a good history of the demonization of tobacco, and a good litany of the unmeasurable damage that alcohol does. In this regard I would be somewhat of a contrarian.  Alcohol fills an important social role. I am fond of joking that without it, Germans could not breed. It is certainly an integral part of the culture where I live now in Ukraine. The downside is not to be dismissed, but there is also an upside to be acknowledged. I'll concede that it is harder to find arguments for the upside of tobacco, gambling or drugs.CHAPTER NINE Bankruptcy for Profit.This is a chapter on the techniques of corporate looting. It includes a good account of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, and something of an insight into how the ""Keating five,"" including Senator McCain, got compromised.CHAPTER TEN Michael Milken Phishes with Junk Bonds as BaitThis is a balanced chapter about an enigmatic character. Most of what Milken did was legal, and the crime for which he went to jail was a frame job. Nonetheless, his operation immorally took advantage of the gullibility of investors. One of the metaphors used throughout the book is rotten avocados, products presented as one thing but actually representing another. Milken used an obscure book on the profitability of fallen angel junk bonds issued by reputable companies that had fallen on hard times, and twisted the story to support the purchase of newly minted bonds which were junk from the start. It was a very successful financial phish.CHAPTER ELEVEN The Resistance and Its Heroes.This chapter leads the reader toward the happy conclusion. It is an endorsement, in general, of the forces that have made the marketplace safer and the economy richer and more productive over the years. These include the muckrakers such as Upton Sinclair and Ida Mae Tarbell, the governmental agencies that were set up starting in the Age of Reform, and nongovernmental groups such as the American Chamber of Commerce, the Better Business Bureau, the industry standards groups that rigorously define methods of classifying wheat by type and grade, and others that band together to ensure the general integrity of business.PART THREE Conclusion and Afterword.  This is the rosy conclusion alluded to above. Fret not, all is well. The government will look out for your best interests.  I advise readers to sample pessimistic blogs such as zerohedge, the Unz review and oftwominds for differing points of view, then decide who is phishing whom..","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EO8P669QBM2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAM14RE#wasThisHelpful","R2EO8P669QBM2S","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very long book review – my reading notes, and reactions, as much as a review.  In brief, it is an excellent book, touching on all of the relevant topics.  Bobo Lo has a deep knowledge of Russia, and is able to describe in excellent detail the weaknesses in the way Russia manages its affairs.  Though not his central theme, he also writes accurately on the west's misperceptions about Russia.Dr. Lo writes on behalf of the Brookings Institute, a very establishment, left-centrist think tank in Washington D.C.  This book's intended audience will be diplomats and academics.  Though he pitches it towards Russia itself, it is unlikely to be widely read there.  The academic English makes it inaccessible, the source makes it suspect, and the message will be unwelcome.The book is divided into three parts: background, then specifics elements of Russian foreign policy, and lastly a look to the future, what would be best for Russia to do, and what they are most likely to do.  Here is the table of contents:Part I: Context1 The Domestic Context of Russian Foreign Policy2 Two WorldsPart II: Performance3 Russia and Global Governance4 A Postmodern Empire5 A Turn to the East6 Engaging with the WestPart III: Possibilities7 A New Foreign Policy for a New Russia8 Russia and the World in 2030The book is strong on diplomacy and foreign relations, somewhat weaker in its analysis of economic and business trends, and relatively silent on demographic trends.The book is well conceived for its audience.  It will be a must-read for people dealing with Russia in the realms of diplomacy, defense and business.  Truly a five-star effort.That's the end of a short review.  Here follow my reading notesDr. Lo claims that you cannot know what is going on inside the Kremlin. Those who know don't say, and those who say don't know. Putin, however, is a known quantity. People continue to fall out of his favor, and people who know him intimately have given extensive interviews. For an example, google "" Yuri Shvets."" What comes out is the following:1. He never impressed anybody is a genius during his rise to power. Yeltsin picked him from obscurity because he thought he was a guy who could be trusted not to disrupt Yeltsin family interests.2. He has surrounded himself with people from his days as deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. People he has known a long time and whom he trusts. As Custine says in ""letters from Russia"" this has been the trait of czars throughout history. The nature of power in Russia may be absolute, but it is not possible to delegate effectively. Witness how ineffective Medvedev was and remains. Putin cannot trust him to take initiative. The same is true for the others from the Petersburg days. The result is that Putin suffers from a lack of good advice, the lack of a kitchen cabinet that will refine his ideas. He also lacks truly competent subordinates fishing carry out his plans.3. He is described in his youth as a man who drank excessively and was unfaithful to his wife. He is narcissistic – wedded to his workout regimes and facelifts in Botox. Projecting his masculinity, as Dr. Lo sells, seems to be an important psychological trait.Lo accepts without question the liberal agenda of the West. He does not give any credence to Putin's view that global warming is a canard, a liberal ploy to seize power – a position held by a significant number of serious scientists in the West, expressed in recent books such as The Neglected Sun – Why the Sun Precludes Climate Catastrophe. He criticizes Putin's refusal to share world concern about famine, water shortages and the like. The opposite side of the coin is that Europe is being inundated with immigrants that it is unable to assimilate but unwilling to identify as such.  Uncritically accepting the modern liberal European view appears to me to be a cultural blindness on Lo's part.  Putin's notion of what we owe our fellow man – less than what we owe ourselves and our progeny - appears to be closer to the world consensus than that of the altruistic West.Putin and the West both tend to overestimate their strength with regard to Ukraine. Many Ukrainians are skeptical about the multiculturalism and destruction of the family taking place in Western Europe. For instance, there was little sense that Putin had overstepped himself in the Pussy Riot and the gay propaganda cases, which took place before the invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainians are culturally conservative. Their orientation toward the West is a pragmatic matter – the West is where the jobs are, and where they would like to shop and vacation. Culturally they still have more affinity for the conservative Orthodox Christianity that Putin hypocritically espouses.Ukrainian culture is not identical to Russian. There is a continuum, albeit with a somewhat steeper cline on the eastern border of Ukraine. The Russians, as The Marquis de Custine wrote, are a docile people who are inclined to tolerate and even support a strong czar. They put up with Ivan the Terrible and Stalin. As Timothy Snyder writes, Ukrainians suffered as these despots impose their will on them as well. Ukrainians were diluted as Catherine the great and Stalin settled thousands of ethnic Russians among them, and scattered Ukrainians throughout the Russian Far East. Nonetheless, Ukrainians are more like their neighbors to the west in their sense of freedom and fair play. Yanukovych and Putin underestimated the degree to which Ukrainians are not like Russians. Yanukovych thought that he could steal as wantonly as Putin does in Russia, and Putin expected the citizens of Crimea and Donbas would embrace the Russians. Both were disappointed; their control comes through repression, not the love of the citizenry.The West, however, also misjudged the Ukrainians. They conflated Ukraine's desire to conclude an association agreement with the European Union with the desire to join the union. No, the Ukrainians mostly wanted travel and trade. American neocons such as Victoria Newland were disappointed that for the most part Ukrainians just wanted Yanukovych out.Dr. Lo does not talk about the Yanukovych depredations during the years between 2004 and his ouster in 2014. The theft was blatant and shameless. It was also artless. One could say that he broke as much as he stole. His behavior discouraged foreign companies from investing. The grain embargo he imposed in 2011 in order to enrich himself through granting licenses to his friends was immensely harmful to farmers and international grain traders such as Cargill. It was a badly executed theft. The vicious tactics of his tax police collecting from small entrepreneurs, while the oligarchs were blatantly able to shift their profits offshore, created a great deal of resentment. The Ukrainians resented Russia as much for their support of Yanukovych as for anything else.Lo absolutely gets it right when he says it is richly ironic that Putin has developed a reputation in the West is a clever chess player.  His lack of strategic insight or sense of danger points to just the opposite – as no less of an authority than former world chess champion Garry Kasparov has it observed. This is absolutely true. He is playing it by ear.The blunders are evident even to a civilian such as myself. He moves his troops all over the place along the Ukrainian border, placing between 50,000 and 100,000 of them in the border stretch between Rostov on Don and Chernigov.  He sent a similar number on exercises and the Russian Arctic just to make a point. Such misuse of the military is incredibly demoralizing to the troops. A soldier wants to feel he is being used effectively, and Russian troops cannot feel anything other than being jerked around. The same goes for the troops that he has actually deployed in the Donbas. His commitment to deception dictates that support for the separatists must be arm's-length. The supplies he gives them, and the financial support he gives to the civilians in those occupied areas, is intermittent. Russia cannot afford more, either financially, or to be seen giving more. He denies Russian soldiers when they are captured or killed. This means that Russian staying power in Ukraine must be limited.Dr. Lo writes aptly. ""It is difficult to identify a cohesive Russian strategy toward Ukraine. Instead there is an odd mélange of mystical vision, historical and geopolitical anxieties, feelings of strategic entitlement, gut instincts, and tactical dexterity. Putin's approach reflects the contradictory influences of the two worlds that shaped his foreign-policy more generally. On the one hand, the Kremlin conceives of Ukraine, and Russia's relationship with it, in terms of historical inevitabilities. On the other hand, developments in the real world act as a constant reminder of the artificiality of such hopes.""He divides the former Soviet Union countries into three tiers on the basis of Russia's level of interest in them. At the top of the first tier is Ukraine, in a class by itself. Also of great interest are Belarus, the other fully Slavic country in the FSU, and Kazakhstan, physically the largest and the closest to Russia. The second tier consists of smaller countries that are not quite so central to Russia's interest: Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The third category is the leftovers: Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Armenia.Dr. Lo uses quotes from several places to express the idea that without Ukraine, Russia is just an ordinary country. He quotes Putin telling Bush in 2008 that Ukraine is ""not really a country."" Russia cannot seem to let it go. I will provide a bit of history that Dr. Lo does not. Kiev is the historic center of the Slavic peoples, who coalesced into Kevin Rus in the first millennium A.D. It held sway for a couple of centuries, but was riven by dynastic infighting. There was seldom an adequate plan of succession when a powerful leader died. In the 13th century the Mongols swept in with superior fighting tactics – mainly their horses – and conquered most of what is now both Russia and Ukraine. The Mongols were never as good at administration as they were at conquest, and when they receded in the 15th century Moscow to came out to be more powerful than Kiev. Each government seems to be involved in interminable wars, Ukraine the more so because its geography has it surrounded by enemies: Turkey, Romania, Hungary, the German states, Poland, Lithuania and Russia. In the 17th century Ukraine fought off the Turkic Tatars to their South only to be attacked from the west by the Poles. They ran into the embrace of Russia, which did not let go.The Russians were not kind masters. Catherine the great brought in Russians and Germans to settle the steppes which had been freed from the Tatars. Stalin moved Ukrainians out by the thousands to populate Siberia, moved Russians in to fill the vacuum, and lead the Holodomor which killed 3 million people (by Dr. Lo's reckoning – it could have been twice as many). They forced the Russian language on the Ukrainian people.The upshot is that Ukraine is the largest bilingual country in the world. More than half the population speaks both languages fluently. Putin would like to pretend that Ukrainian is no more than a dialect of Russian, but it is vastly more than that. This reviewer found it easy to learn Portuguese on the strength of a knowledge of Spanish.  Learning Ukrainian on the strength of Russian turns out to be more difficult. There are significant differences in the root words of the vocabulary – Ukrainian is closer to Western European languages – and far from trivial differences in the sound structure: consonants and vowels.Dr. Lo cites a statistic that Ukraine is 17% ethnically Russian. That kind of number that is very difficult to know, and would change significantly depending on who was asking the question and how it was phrased. A respondent would be stupid to call himself a Ukrainian in the Crimea of 2015, or a Russian in Lviv. Since most speak both languages and pretty much looks the same the answer will often be whatever is most convenient at the time. This reviewer's wife speaks native Russian – the language she used in school – whereas her parents speak native Ukrainian, the language they used in school.The Russian exercise of power has always been heavy-handed. The czars were despots. The Marquis de Custine captured their essence, Tocqueville wrote about them, Russian literature describes him in these terms, Archie Brown writes that Soviet history is a long reign of terror. Putin follows in this bloodthirsty, ham-fisted tradition.During the Yushenko and Yanukovych years Putin would clamor for higher prices for natural gas, then turn the gas off in the middle of winter (2006, 2009) if he didn't get his way, freezing hapless souls in Western Europe – not a good idea. He would arbitrarily ban imports of foodstuffs from Ukraine such as candies, meats, wheat and other commodities. The pretexts were transparently contrived: veterinary inspections and the like. Archie Brown wrote of the Communists that they not only lied, but they lied in such a way that you knew they were lying. It was a demonstration of power to force people to swallow obvious lies. Putin seems to operate on the same principle.  Today he is lying about the absence of Russian soldiers in Ukraine and guilt in downing MH17, among other things. This lack of diplomacy does not work in the 20th century. The victims can fight back, among other things by simply publicizing Putin's bad behavior. He is in bad odor throughout the world for his transgressions.Dr. Lo often cites the extreme corruption in Russia. He says that the APEC (Asian-Pacific economic conference) in Vladivostok in 2012 cost $22 billion, 50 percent more than the London Olympics a month earlier. To put this into perspective, it is roughly 1 percent of Russian GDP of 2 trillion. The Sochi Olympics cost 2%, and the World Cup soccer championships will also be vastly expensive. All these projects are dogged by mismanagement and cost overruns. Instead of displaying Russian prowess, they showcase the worst aspects of a dictatorial economy.  For an appreciation of how deeply ingrained these practices are in Russian culture, read How Russia Really Works: The Informal Practices That Shaped Post-Soviet Politics and Business.Dr. Lo repeatedly says that the Russian orientation has always been toward Europe rather than Asia. Although it likes to call itself Eurasian, 80 percent of the population lives west of the Urals. The people are European. They simply do not understand Asians very well. There is a collective desire to distance themselves from the Mongols, who dominated them for two centuries. The historical orientation established by Peter the Great and Catherine the great was toward the west, from which they borrowed what they could of Enlightenment ideas and modern methods in manufacture, agriculture, science and literature. Although Russia participates in many Asia-Pacific groups, it appears not to take a leadership role.Dr. Lo repeats often that the mindset of Russian diplomacy is that of a big power. It jealously guards its prerogatives as a nation sitting at the big table with the world level players: the United States, Japan, China, and the European Union. Russia displays little finesse in dealing with smaller countries, and shows little appreciation of the power these can wield in the modern information oriented world. This is especially true in Asia. Outside of China, Russia has relatively few important trade relationships. Russia simply has little to contribute in Asia.Dr. Lo writes ""… Russia is generally viewed in a negative light – as a country with a stagnant political system, non-modernizing economy, and complacent elite. Many Asians doubt its capacity and commitment to contribute meaningfully, except as an exporter of natural resources and weapons.""The backwardness of the Russian Far East is a drag on Russian aspirations to be accepted by the Asian countries. This area has historically been poorly managed by tsars, commissars and now Putin. The rest of Asia looks at it as a source of natural resources and as a market. It certainly does not give Asia any prestige.  The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival gives a clear portrayal of life in contemporary Siberia.Dr. Lo repeatedly says that Russia's Asia policy is very Sinocentric. Russia shares a 4000 km border with China and depends on China to at least be neutral in the scraps that Russia picks elsewhere in the world, notably Ukraine and Georgia. Russia lacks the finesse, the resource, and the shared interest that would draw it into greater partnership with others.Dr. Lo writes ""To alter this fate Moscow will need to recognize that tired strategic habits and an indigenous neo-conservatism offer Russia nothing. But such a message is not easily absorbed. Today the Kremlin's self-satisfaction appears stronger than ever, driven by the anticipation of a new multipolar order in which Russia stands as an equal with the United States and China. As long as this illusion persists, the likelihood of a productive approach toward Asia will be slim, and the “turn to the East” will remain a fantasy.""  To me that is the essence of his message, despite sounding a somewhat hopeful tone in the conclusion.I add that the stove pipe, totally hierarchical decision-making structure that has always persisted in Russia is antithetical toward good diplomacy. Diplomats by their nature have to be empowered to engage in their opposite numbers and to work out creative solutions to mutual interests. They need to be heard and appreciated, and they need some authority. Moscow has never granted either.Dr. Lo stresses the fact that Soviet diplomacy envisions a world of great powers, and discounts the influence of the smaller countries. This is absolutely true, and I would like to add a couple of notes. Putin did not anticipate the moral force of countries such as the Netherlands and Australia when their citizens were killed in the MH 17 disaster. Another major factor is the diaspora communities. There are strong Ukrainian communities in the United States and Canada, even Argentina and Australia, and they have a significant can't impact on the legislative process in those countries. The Russian immigrant community is not so useful. It includes a great many people who are extremely happy to be out of Russia and will do nothing to support it. On the other hand, it includes a lot of rabid Russophiles, the Internet trolls who spread Putin's propaganda on all of the conservative and libertarian websites. As overwhelming as they are, they are ultimately self-defeating. They get tangled in their own lies, which become all the more evident as the Ukraine crisis approaches its third year.  Ron Paul, Mish Shedlock and Paul Craig Roberts may hate Obama, but it is becoming more difficult to see Russia as an alternative.Dr. Lo traces the US – Russian relationship from the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union. There are three periods of relative thaw: the early 1990s, post-9/11, and the Obama reset in 2009. Each of these was relatively limited. Both Russia and the US sought some quid pro quo on topics of interest to their countries, but they did not put in place it the foundation for a long-term relationship. The 2009 reset simply ran out of steam, and was overwhelmed by issues such as Syria, the anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow, and of course Ukraine. Lo forecasts a long period of an uncomfortable relationship before things can be reset again.Absent from the discussion is the consideration of the economies. Russia is in a depression brought on by low energy prices. Half of its foreign exchange earnings come from energy, and that price has fallen from above $100 to below $50 a barrel. What Dr. Lo does not mention is that the United States and Western Europe seem to be teetering on the edge of recession themselves. Their central banks have employed quantitative easing to expand the money supply in each of these countries, and the game seems to be coming to an end. Russia, with less debt as a percentage of GDP and a history of enduring hard times, may be in a relatively strong position to outwait the West.Dr. Lo could investigate other aspects of Europe's lack of resolve. The nationalist parties are becoming increasingly anti-immigrant. Germany is facing up to 800,000 asylum-seekers in 2015 alone. The latter figure would represent almost 1 percent of their population. They have been signally ineffective in absorbing the prior waves of immigrants. Ethnic Germans are increasingly restive, demonstrating in the streets against the government policy. One can anticipate that it will only become worse in the upcoming financial crisis. This is worth mentioning only insofar as Dr. Lo's projections for the future are predicated on a stability that appears under imminent threat. The enmity between Russia and the West may be overtaken by events. Domestic issues might consume both parties, reducing their interest in international involvements.Dr. Lo does not discuss the attraction of Russia's cultural conservativism to people in the West. The nationalist parties in Western Europe and libertarians in the United States are drawn to Putin's advocacy of the white man and rejection of Western gender politics, embodied in feminism and the homosexual rights movement. The Western elites appear to be out of step with their people, forcing them in directions that they are loath to go. Moscow is benefiting and will benefit more from the reaction to the elites' ""New World Order"" agenda.Dr. Lo recognizes that Russia's current power structure is very conservative and unlikely to change. This is absolutely true. It is in the mold of Russian power structures for the past several centuries. It is an environment in which the cream does not rise to the top. Talented people such as Google's Sergei Brin immigrate to the United States, as Lo says, and to other countries in the West. Because in Russia prerogatives are jealously guarded by those in charge, talented outsiders rarely have an opportunity. Note that Putin himself was allowed to rise to power because he was considered a mediocrity, and he has surrounded himself with mediocrities. This is an ongoing problem for tyrants everywhere. By the way, this aspect of Soviet culture was very visible in Ukraine under Yanukovych.  He installed thugs in positions of power, and they were resented. Thuggery is highly visible in the governments that Russia has established in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk. Putting puppets in charge may ensure loyalty, but severely compromises competence.Dr. Lo's assertion that something must change is at odds with the conservatism he describes. Russia has needed change for centuries. Although the people in power have changed, the nature of the society has not. It appears quite unlikely to do so now. Russia has no external enemies to speak of. China may infiltrate over the long eastern border, but even if it does it will not impact Russia to any extent whatsoever. None of its neighbors on the west covet Russian land. Russia can easily remain the static backwater that it largely is today. It can remain dependent on natural resources extraction and agriculture. If it fails to modernize, the people will not suffer anything more than they suffer already.Dr. Lo may be correct in writing that ""A Russia that fails to adapt to the demands of the New World disorder will remain backward, in comparison not only with the developed West, but also with the rising non-West. It would be less actor than acted upon, unable to defend its interests against the competing agendas of others. Such an outcome would be more than merely unfortunate; it would represent a terrible betrayal of Russia's vast potential, and the on unprecedented opportunities offered to it by the current international contacts.""Russia's isolation and conservatism will protect the people from the financial excesses that the West is now enduring. Social conservatism will protect them from the forces which are depopulating the West. The family is coming apart in the West. Feminism, homosexuality, and the very individualistic lifestyle, the lack of family values, have deprived the west of the ability to repopulate itself. Every society in the West is being overrun.  They are tending away from European and more toward the social values, their societies of the immigrants: Middle Easterners, Africans, and Hispanics. Russia itself is experiencing immigration from within – the expansion of the Muslim minorities. What will inspire the Slavic, Orthodox population to once again be as fruitful as it was two centuries ago is an interesting question. Orthodoxy is a more likely bet than Western liberalism.  It appears that the post-Enlightenment west has passed its apogee and is decaying.  Per Helmuth Nyborg's thesis in ""Doubly Relaxed Darwinian Selection,"" Russia may indeed rise again, having served as a repository of a western culture and genetic inheritance that the West has squandered through unchecked immigration and an unwillingness to reproduce.In the last chapter, dealing with the future, Dr. Lo downplays the West's interest in Kiev.  Russia certainly doesn't see it that way, and my view from Kiev is that western NGOs and diplomats would like to see Ukraine adopt their values.  Although few in the West want to see Ukraine quickly join the European Union, they hold NATO out as a promise and will probably continue to do so. Moreover, the West would like Ukraine to validate its own courses of action in the realms of diversity, gender politics and social policy by adopting them.  The Western banks and international lending institutions such as the IMF and World Bank would like Ukraine to bear enough of a debt burden that it is beholden to the west.  Ukrainians are appropriately suspicious.Dr. Lo offers the proposition that Ukraine will probably continue to be dysfunctional. My observation is that there is a lot of dysfunction remaining in the ministries. There is vast corruption in the healthcare, roadbuilding, customs, and education ministries just a name four of them. However, the light is now shining on this corruption.  The Poroshenko government has appointed ministers who saying the right things about cleaning them up. This is a long process, but the progress over the course of the year and a half has not been negligible. Ukraine is under the gun to do something. Poroshenko is as aware as anybody of the West's inclination to give up on Ukraine, and he cannot afford that. Poroshenko needs the West for investment, trade, and the military equipment to hold off Russia. It must continue to improve, and however slowly it seems to be doing that.  If nothing else, Ukraine has gotten rid of stupid oligarchs (Yanukovych, the Klyuyev brothers, Abuzov) in favor of smarter ones such as Akhmetov and Kolomoisky who have some talent for improving assets they steal.The book concludes with the chapter offering Dr. Lo's opinion as to how Russian foreign policy will evolve, and the advice that Dr. Lo would offer Russia, knowing of course that it probably would not be followed. Like most forward-looking chapters at the ends of books like this, it tends to be a bit optimistic and to overlook factors that the mainstream players are loath to admit exist. The bottom line is that Dr. Lo expects Putin to continue more or less as he is, inasmuch as he has painted himself in a corner. Though the closing chapter does not say as much, Dr. Lo makes it clear earlier in the book that Putin is riding a tiger. Having invaded Ukraine, he has left himself no face-saving exit.  He cannot face the Russian people if he lets go, and he cannot deal with the Ukrainians themselves or the West if he pushes ahead.  The status quo, however, is bleeding him to death.  The fact that there is no well-defined way out means that any prognosis is bound to be problematic. Ukraine is not Russia's entire problem, however. It is bound up in the problem of the top-down management structure that has always characterized Russia. Putin does not get good advice coming up from his supporters, and is unable to put the most competent people in positions to execute his will. His personal power depends on absolute loyalty from people who will not question his decisions.The biggest factor absent from Lo's equation is the impending economic crash. Most pundits, even the mainstream media joining them within the last month (August 2015), are looking back at the crisis of 2008 as only a prelude. The problems have not been fixed, and central bank activity has only exacerbated them. Other complicating factors that have not been reversed, only accentuated, are the flood of immigrants into North America and Western Europe, the declining birth rates of Caucasian and North Asian people in their homelands, and the intractable gap in educational and workplace attainment between those Caucasians and North Asians and the immigrants who would replace them. To revisit his title, Dr. Lo's analysis is predicated on a stability that is unlikely to persist.  There are many reasons to expect, however, that the coming disorder, due largely to financial overextension and immigration issues, will affect Russia and Ukraine less than Asia and the West.  It is not inconceivable that a smug (and lucky) Putin may in five years be smirking ""Told you so"" from his solid perch in the Kremlin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I52TUFX1IQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0815726090#wasThisHelpful","R1I52TUFX1IQA","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just as only blacks are permitted to talk honestly about race in the USA, so only an African can do so on that continent.The German title is not nearly as fitting as the French, which I would translate as “What if Africa doesn’t feel like developing.”  The book has a curious publication history.  L’Harmattan, associated with l’École Polytechnique in Paris, first published it in 1990 under the title “Et si l’Afrique refusait le développement?”The phenomenon of a highly articulate African author willing to speak plainly about Africa’s problems slowly gathered a kind of cult following.  Grioo.com, a francophone African web site, developed a very active discussion of its theses.  A German publisher first brought it out in 2001 under this title “Weder Arm noch Ohnemächtig,” which translates quite directly as “Neither Poor nor Powerless,”  It has appeared in Italy as  “E se l'Africa rifiutasse lo sviluppo?”revived the original sense of the title.  Strangely for a book that has been under discussion for 25 years now, there is no English translation.The Italian Amazon reviewers’ titles tell the story.  “Africa, it’s your own fault” and “Development? Africa doesn’t have any excuses.”  The lead sentence of the latter translates as “Africa is backwards and stagnant because it rejects development with all its might.”  The top German reviewer on Amazon calls it “Mandatory reading for all Third World Activists.”There must be yet more story behind the story.  A fairly persistent Internet search did not divulge Kabou’s present whereabouts and activity, though the Italian reviewer indicates she has been in exile in Canada since 1995.  Though the biographical material on the book cover indicates that she taught university level English, the book has not yet appeared in our language.  And despite the fact that the 1990 cover stated that she was in the process of writing a book entitled “The African elites of the 1970s,” nothing new has appeared under her name in these fourteen years.Kabou’s first chapter echoes the title.  “Africa doesn’t want to develop.”  To roughly paraphrase her lead paragraph: “Certain ideas owe their durability to the nobility of their context.  You have to believe in Africa’s will to develop in order to justify its fight for independence.  Development is among those venerable beliefs that one cannot abandon without committing a sacrilege.  However, all appearance are to the contrary.  Why is the international community so upset, after thirty years, that things are as they are?The myth of Africa’s will to develop, she says, satisfies three essential needs.  First, to excuse the political class of any suspicion of incompetence by turning the argument towards an interminable international plot, because they can justify staying in power as long as it endures.  Secondly, to place Africa permanently among those parties whose energies are diverted to frivolous development projects. Lastly, to enrich the legions of experts on perpetual missions and studies the futility of which suffers no discussion.Thus, by page two the theme of the book is well established.  The reader immediately knows whether to love it or hate it.  Kabou, in her somewhat highflown and literary French, composes some delightful turns of phrase to advance her arguments.  Her language is the book’s greatest strength.  Organization is weaker.  One comes away with a good many pithy quotes but little sense of thematic development, inasmuch as she drives home the same points chapter after chapter.  Her issues are:1. African pride is offended by the observation that their culture has invented nothing and created nothing.  They are too proud to adopt the Western concept of development.2. Africa imported a series of intellectual models from the missionaries, communists, capitalists and third-worlders, all of which were used by elites as excuses to bolster their autocracies, and none of which were appropriate to the African environment.3. There is nothing wrong with the intelligence of Africans.  Their inability to develop is attributable to illiteracy, a late start in development, and the profound sense of inferiority fostered by the westerners with whom they have come into contact.4. Africa's refusal to develop is central to its sense of self.  ""Africa isn't dying: she is committing suicide in a kind of cultural drunkenness, intoxicated with her own moral gratification.""5. Africa has no tradition of self analysis.  No politician can afford to tell the truth.  She cites the fates of those who have attempted to do so.  As noted above, one could probably add the name Kabou to that list.6. Africa is neither poor nor powerless (the title of the book in German).  She has been an equal party to, and is hence at fault for creating the supposedly unequal contracts, treaties, and debt obligations of which she continually complains.Though Kabou doesn’t provide it, a bit of history is essential to her argument.  African slaves appear commonly in Greek and Roman accounts, and the Arabs had maintained an active slave trade on both coasts of the continent since Biblical times.  Modern Europe first established contact with black Africa through Henry the Navigator’s search for India in the mid 15th century.  European law, inherited from the Romans, fully described a slave’s position in society.  It was a matter of chance that other institutions such as serfdom were better suited to Europe’s culture and economy.  Portugal had no particular use for the slaves Henry’s seamen brought back.  There were more than enough landless peasants who could cheaply accomplish whatever menial work needed to be done.Black slaves were initially a solution in search of a problem.  Portugal devised the problem herself with the discovery of the warm, fertile and uninhabited Atlantic island of Madeira.  It was ideal for growing sugar.  Since farm laborers had to be imported in any case, why not use the Africans?  That model had proven to be an economic success by the time Europeans turned to exploiting the agricultural possibilities of  the New World.Three centuries of European slavers had no desire to penetrate the continent’s interior.  They were perfectly content to let Africans bring their African captives to coastal slave markets, which with their myriad diseases were insalubrious enough.  The entire dark continent north of South Africa was still virgin territory when Dr. Livingston searched for the source of the Nile in the mid 19th century.  The European powers, having long since colonized all of the Americas, India and the Far East, turned to equatorial Africa only after all else was taken.  Black Africa bore the yoke of colonialism well less than a century.  Though it was onerous indeed in places, such as the Congo as Belgium established rubber plantations, most black Africans were not much affected by European pretensions of sovereignty.  It is clear beyond a doubt that black labor was more ruthlessly exploited, over a much greater period of time, in Brazil, the Caribbean and the United States.  The success of countries with longer and harsher colonial histories, and of blacks themselves outside of Africa, makes abundantly clear that colonialism cannot be the root cause of Africa’s problems.Kabou says Africans cherish the myth of an edenic life before the arrival of the Europeans.  ""Everywhere,"" writes Mohamadou Kane, ""the thesis is the same, pushed by the works of historians and inspired by the nationalisms of the hour, to know that traditional Africa was a coherent and dynamic world the functioning of which was blocked by the Europeans and which therefore provoked a decline.""  Included in the myth are histories of great empires, peaceful coexistence among tribes, and abundant literature and culture.Kabou defines five philosophies, more or less equated with historical epochs, of African’s relationship with the West:MissionaryThird world MarxistNeo-liberal, that is to say, IMF and World BankLeftist reaction to Western influence and return to original culturesThe cold war muddleShe rejects the idea of an innate inferiority, suggesting rather that Africans, only recently as much as 20% literate, may ground their opinions of development on 19th century European notions of race.  The occident’s pretensions of a “mission civilitrice,”or civilizing mission, did not disappear with independence, but were rather heightened by the tensions brought about by the cold war.Kabou writes on the ravages of “Fridayism.”  Daniel Defoe’s literary invention thrives on the anti-dependence theme of authentic, endogenous development.  Did Levy-Bruhl write that they are childlike?  Did Octave Mannoni write that they instinctually see the European colonizer as their superior?  Kabou maintains that Africans feel they must continually disprove these myths, dating from missionary times, of their inferiority by demonstrating that they envy nothing of the occident, that they want to guard their own culture souls against the penetration of modernity.  Kabou continues with the biting observation that anyone who has visited Africa will confirm it is hardly in danger of Westernization.Fridayism, ""Vendredism"" in the original, is the mystical belief that the tradition of doing nothing will carry the African through.  White men have nuclear arms?  They will blow themselves up.  They have invented airplanes?  They will die in crashes.  They have a materialistic culture?  They will lose sight of their traditional values.  Kabou says that the Africans contentedly wait in their villages, letting time pass them by, as they wait for the developed world to collapse of its own weight.Fridayism is the second of Africa's two faces.  She quotes Robert Arnaut and Edgard Hazoumé claiming it ""has at least two faces, a formal face of numbers, statistics, official declarations, the flip side of which is everyday life ruled by sinuous laws and the unspoken secret codes the observance of which impedes the imperatives of development.""  The elites appear ashamed of their occidentalism and work to present themselves as true to Africa's culture and traditions.  ""One cannot but be struck by the tenacity with which the Africans refuse methods and organization.  They squander their meager resources, sabotage all that which might profit the greater number over the long term.  They detest coherence, transparency, and rigor.  Every level seems to favor tinkering, improvisation, and navigation by eyeball.""Fridayism is a rural mindset, and she observes that rural life works fairly well.  Within the discipline of tribal life everyone has a role.  The tribe has little use for layabouts.  They plant, they hunt, they gather, they buy and they sell.  It falls apart in the crush and anonymity of the cities, in which no tribal order is imposed and no tradition dictates how one will occupy one's time.  ""The refusal to develop ... flourishes less in the villages ... than on the macadam of the capitals where one sees how true African values have vanished since independence.""  She continues that it is paradoxically the Minister of Development, the Minister of Culture, the Minister of Education who continue to trade on the wars of liberation as excuses for the striking immobility of modern Black Africa.Kabou holds the Japanese up as a model to be emulated.  They are another people upon whom the Europeans dominated militarily and looked down, but who were wise enough to distinguish what was worth borrowing from the invaders from that which was worth keeping of their own tradition.  The result is a society that is both materially rich and very traditional.""African Mentality"" is a theme to which she returns so repeatedly that it begs the question of how the book is organized.  She cites the authors of theories of ontological superiority based on cranial capacity, culture, etc.  On every occasion, never citing by whom, she asserts that the issues have long been laid to rest.Her repeated explanation of why Africans have never invented anything of note, display little curiosity, and are unable to devise or follow organizational systems in either enterprise or government is one of proving the white man wrong.  She imputes to every African the attitude that ""the white man thinks his is the only way to live and I am primitive for not adopting it.  I'll show him.""  The African is too proud to do things the foreigner's way.  It is the ""self esteem"" argument that has held sway in the United States since Brown vs. Board of Education.  Kabou notes, however, that most peoples of color in Latin America and Asia have successfully borrowed from Europe.The government of India is alleged to have surveyed the rural population around 1957 to determine how their lives had changed in the ten years since the end of the two-century British Raj.  Three out of four never knew the British had been there.  Likewise, it seems probably that even today, and certainly for most of the past four centuries, the average African has had too little contact with Europeans to have nursed any notion of inferiority.Occam's razor proposes that the simplest explanation of any phenomenon is the most likely, the default to be disproved.  It would hold that absent any proof to the contrary, the demonstrated levels of African organization, literacy, creativity and enterprise reflect the people as they are.  That mere assaults on the Africans' collective self esteem could account for so much dysfunction over such a long period is the theory that begs for support.  Two books that go straight to the point are “IQ and the Wealth of Nations” and “Race Differences in Intelligence.”  Both are politically incorrect to the extreme, but their statistical analyses have never been refuted, successfully or otherwise.  They have, however, been successfully buried.Kabou often touches on the lack of scruples of the higher classes.  These would be for the most part the educated elites, the civil servants and government officials.  She finds their rapacity, or ""dents longues"" inexcusable.  Any official who can do so loots the government and whatever investment funds enter the continent under whatever program.  An entrepreneur will get a loan, sell the shell of the business to the government at a huge profit in a ""nationalization"" move, or vice-versa, buy a business from the government for a song.She notes elsewhere that corruption pervades African society.  Theft is endemic.  Everyone has their hand out for a bribe.Applying Occam's razor again, it is worth questioning whether the ""take the money and run"" attitude makes sense in its context.  The alternative of honoring contracts, investing, and long term planning is predicated on expectations about the future.  It assumes that labor and capital can be organized to produce a profit, that the currency will be stable and exchangeable, that government will enforce contracts and respect private property.  If the people are smart enough to recognize that they are incapable of organizing and managing for a profit, it is rational to export, hide or spend rather than invest capital.  As Kabou notes, the queue of first world do-gooders willing to throw more money into Africa seems never to end.  They meet their fundamental needs by debt, deception and improvisation.Three recent books illustrate the more recent problems of Africa.  The Crisis Caravan: What's Wrong with Humanitarian Aid?  documents how Western do-gooders and media feed the problem, and Into the Cannibal's Pot: Lessons for America from Post-Apartheid South Africa is a sobering history of South Africa’s slide since the black majority governments came to power in the 1990s.  Racism, Guilt, Self-Hatred and Self-Deceit is a bracing account of how the Africans describe themselves to an outsider.She writes of the presumption of African leaders.  Houphouët-Boigny refusing to sell his resources “below market.""  Also, ""Africa has two faces.""  First the formal one of figures and statistics and official declarations.  She suggests these are hasty and “suicidal” assimilations into a very traditional culture.Two quotes from the book:""I am black.  The Black didn't invent the computer.  The computer is anti-black.""  and ""Technology degrades family live and human relations.  Even the Occidentals say so.  Therefore, Africa ought to reject technology.""  and ""We are victims of colonialization, so the Europeans owe us indemnities.""  These views are taken defensively, she says, in defense of Africa's refusal to develop itself.  ""The sociological and especially psychological conditions of the success of free enterprise are not met yet in Black Africa, far from it. Their emergence initially depends on the introduction of a vast debate on post-independence African mentalities, and the relationship of the latter to the concept of development itself.  Africa must be invited to reconsider its ideological and social choices, to be brought to understand clearly why generalized economic liberalism can lead only to catastrophe.  In other words, instead of  encouraging the Africans to cut their throats by programs self-imposed austerity and deprivation, we should first seek to know why audacity, imagination, and inventiveness remain so rare after thirty years of independence.  One needs, in a word, to realize that Africa saddled itself with a powerful cultural device making it possible to repress any desire for creativity.""  Aren't these almost an echo of the complaints about black schoolchildren in the United States?  And if so, are blacks being somewhat unfair when they blame their situation on white racism?The notion that Africa is undergoing cultural change is a myth. Today's African mentality is a kind of jail in which an impervious border separates the notions of ""a Black thing"" and ""a White thing."" . Indeed, far from prefiguring a promising a liberating synthesis of new energies, this conscience is a rather desiccated object surrounded by barricades. The fallaciousness in the dualism  of ""tradition and modernity"" is in this: it postulates the progress of mindsets towards an opening which will occur all the less because African sensitivities are ossified and shrunken and contorted after having demonized the values of modernity. This drama is far from being finished. We will see it when we address the current misadventures of the negrism. For the moment, let us specify that, as opposed to what implies a African literature of African identity which would preach reconciliation today, after having promoted, from 1960 to now, the myth of a conflict","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33F3KN7BB7AW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01000U10I#wasThisHelpful","R33F3KN7BB7AW4","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first sentence is ""thick books can be intimidating."" It is a tribute to the author that he has been able to arrange so much material in such a useful fashion. He addresses a number of themes which seem to have only very loose connection with one another, but pulls it together into a cohesive book.A good place to start would be to read about the author, G. Edward Griffin in Wikipedia. It is not flattering, saying ""he is the author of The Creature from Jekyll Island (1984) which promotes conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve system.""There are a number of conspiracies described in the book, starting with the secret conclave that took place on Jekyll Island in 1910. The fact that it took place, and the secrecy surrounding it are well known. The conjecture as to what took place has to be based on the historical record after the fact. The Federal Reserve is a fact. The fact that Wilson was elected by virtue of Teddy Roosevelt's being induced to run on the Bullmoose party ticket is a fact. The legislative histories that he cites are fact.He presents other stories, and theories as to what is behind them, which one will certainly not find in the average American history book: Andrew Jackson's fight with Biddle over the second national Bank of the United States. Some very interesting observations on Abraham Lincoln, strong pluses and strong minuses. The ongoing and hidden involvement of European bankers – yes, primarily Jewish – in the American economy. The hidden connections between eminently Protestant bankers such as J.P. Morgan and the Rockefellers and the European Rothschilds and Warburgs. The conspiracy to draw America into World War I through the sinking of the Lusitania in order to protect the interests of the European bankers. He describes the very close relations between England and the United States, and offers a theory that its efforts to protect British interests led the Federal Reserve to make policies which promoted the Great Depression. The same with regard to the American entry into World War II. Griffin provides extensive footnotes for his sources. He is modest enough not to claim absolute authenticity for most of these histories, but leaves it as a.challenge for others to refute them or present more plausible explanations.Going back to the Wikipedia entry, it appears to be contrived as a smear more than the source of information. It associates Griffin with other conspiracy theories. It labels him as an HIV/AIDS denier. The very colored word ""denier"" convinces me that the Wikipedia authors in turn hold a bias. It turns out that I have read and reviewed a book by one of the prominent such ""AIDS deniers,"" Peter Duesberg. The book makes sense to me, and most telling, the Wikipedia entries for Duesberg and Nobel prize winner Kary Mullis, who wrote his forward, are similarly slanted. I assume if there were any reputable scientific research to refute them, it would be mentioned on Wikipedia. No – only ad hominem attacks against the authors. He raises my suspicion that Griffin, Duesberg and others are probably right in many or most particulars.The Jekyll Island book was published in 1994 and has been through about 20 printings since. It is organized according to these general topics, according to the book's outline.  These are Griffin's titles, augmented by my explanatory phrases:1. What creature is this? – What is the Federal Reserve?2. A crash course on money – gold, fractional reserve banking, fiat money.3. The new alchemy – how bankers create something from nothing and grow Rich4. A tale of three banks – the first three central banks of the United States5. The harvest – the immense profits occurring to bankers from the Federal Reserve system6. Time travel into the future – what the author foresaw in 1994.We learn in the ""crash course on money"" that the United States currency was backed by silver until it was gradually phased out between the 1930s and the 1970s. In my youth there were silver certificates on which were printed the statement that the United States would exchange five dollars in silver for the certificate itself. Those are history. The first step was to reduce the amount of precious metals available to a fraction of the currency outstanding, followed by abandoning any backing by metals whatsoever. What we have had since Nixon is pure fiat money.Griffin asserts that the way the system works is purposefully convoluted, in order that the common man not understand it well. The essence of money creation is as follows. The United States treasury needs money. It sells treasury bonds, receiving dollars in the present in exchange for a promise to repay at a stated interest rate sometime in the future. Five years is a common maturity. The Federal Reserve buys those treasury bills via an electronic transaction. No real money changes hands. The Federal Reserve books the treasury bills that it has as assets. It is then able to create offsetting liabilities by printing Federal Reserve notes. These circulate as money.The mechanisms are far more varied than this, but the essence is that they create money from nothing. Actually, printed money is only a small fraction of the money in circulation. The mechanisms used to create bank credits are the same in that the banks make"" something from nothing,"" but they are able to make vastly more of it.Whichever mechanisms are used, the outcome is always the same – inflation. The government creates money for its use. As the amount of money in circulation grows more rapidly than the fundamental value of assets in society, the value of money shrinks. Today's dollar buys only two percent as much as it did when the Federal Reserve was created. Inflation is thus a hidden tax. The loss in the purchasing power of the fiat currency accrues to the benefit of the government. Griffin says that this tax amounted to about 50 percent over the period of World War I. It is an ideal tax because it is hidden and never subjected to a vote.Griffin makes the theme repeatedly that the banks take advantage of the lack of financial sophistication on the part of the average person. Central banks control the availability of money, and interest rates. They are able to induce citizens to borrow by setting rates low, then force foreclosures by setting rates high in making money tight, leading to the inability to roll loans over and loss of the employment needed to service loans. The banks have an advantage over the bank customer.  As I write, in 2015, the Federal Reserve has set interest rates so low that all investors who are obliged to seek a non-zero return – insurance companies, pensions, etc – are being forced into stocks.  The PE ratios of stocks is at an all-time high, and the accounting tricks used to conjure them up are likewise at a peak. The federal government turns a blind eye to financial manipulation by others, since they themselves are so dependent on deception.At another level, the major national banks have an advantage over local banks. Local banks, following standard banking practice, leverage their deposits and make loans totaling several times their asset base. When they get into trouble they have to turn to the big banks to bail them out. The big banks, on the other hand, have the Federal Reserve to back them up. The Federal Reserve has the power of the United States government. As has been witnessed in the crises of my lifetime, the savings and loan debacle and the crisis of 2007 come to mind, the government has simply created money to prevent the banks from failing. Big banks bail out little banks, and the taxpayer bails the big banks out.This is a ""heads I win, tails you lose"" sort of proposition for the megabanks. As long as the federal government stands behind them, they cannot lose. In good times they make very strong profits and pay high salaries. In bad times the taxpayer shoulders the losses. This may come in the form of direct bailouts, inflation, or through other combinations of mechanisms.Loans to sovereign entities are another issue altogether. Banks love them because they are large in size and quite profitable. There are fees to be made upon initiation. There is interest to be made as the loans are repaid. There is money to be made refinancing the loans when, as is almost inevitably the case, the borrower cannot service them. Griffin makes the case that the banks and do not want to be repaid. They would like the loans to be rolled over forever. Witness what's happening in Greece today. The banks simply refuse to accept that Greece is bankrupt.Griffin makes the case that the banks actually enjoy loaning money to profligate dictators like Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe they know that he will steal the money, and that that will not be repaid. They will make their money renegotiating it, and being paid back through bailouts provided by the taxpayers of the rich countries. American taxpayers have bailed out any number of insolvent countries, enriching bankers in the process. In the most recent bailout of Greece, in this year 2015, I read that 80 percent of the funds went to banks, primarily Germans.Griffin contends that bankers like war. He says that the international banks made loans to both alliances leading up to World War I, and actually encouraged war because war always increases business for bankers. This goes back to the foundation of the house of Rothschild, funding wars in Germany. When the five Rothschild sons moved to the capitals of Europe, they would often wind up funding both sides of a conflict. The bankers won regardless of the outcome of the war.Critics charge Griffin with being anti-Semitic, but his charges are really anti-banker. He says that the bankers are rather bloodless sorts who have no affection for their customers and generally have no patriotism. They pursue profits regardless of human concerns. The fact that Jews are disproportionately represented in banking, and that Jews tend to have the intelligence that required to excel at the profession, is simply a circumstance.The book hangs together remarkably well.  Moreover, though it is twenty one years old it also describes today's situation extraordinarily well.  Though the conspiracies described may not have all played out exactly as described, the gist seems to be on target.  This is a book you will remember…. especially when the house of cards comes tumbling down.  The foundations are shaking as I write.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJN2HH9AZUODV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=091298645X#wasThisHelpful","RJN2HH9AZUODV","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first chapters of the book are a fascinating account of political intrigue at the highest levels, a century ago.  Even back then the politicians and bankers were lining their pockets at the expense of the little guy, as well as less well-connected banks and businesses.Mullins documents his sources extensively.  This is good.  However, in one very telling instance it leads to a major problem.  Mullins gives an account of a 1773 meeting convened by Mayer Bauer, later to call himself Rothschild, of thirteen Jewish goldsmith/moneylenders.  Per Mullins, Rothschild presented a 14-point program whereby these men would band together to dominate world finance.Mullins cites as his source a book by William Guy Carr entitled ""Pawns in the Game"" for a lengthy address supposedly made by Mayer Rothschild (Bauer) to a group of Frankfurt goldsmiths in 1773.Locating and downloading ""Pawns in the Game"" on the Internet, I find that this privately published 1956 book with an overtly Christian theme has a 24 point program which includes Mullins' 14.  It cites as its source Professor S. Nilus in 1901. Google says that this would be Sergei Nilus, a Moscow mystic Christian.Googling Sergei Nilus, I find the entry ""Sergej Nilus und die ""Protokolle der Weisen von Zion"" He is the supposed author.  Looking that up, I find that the 24 points track exactly those named in Wikipedia for the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  The Protocols of the Elders of Zion has been fairly thoroughly discredited as a manuscript. It is a well-crafted fraud, aligning neatly with widely held fears of Jewish financiers, but a fraud nonetheless.I do not think that this single error totally damns ""Secrets of the Fed,"" but it does support the anti-Semitism critique and leads one to question the authenticity of other sources. Still and all, I believe that most of the reportage on the founding of the Federal Reserve is probably factual. It hangs together and is consistent with what I know of the history of the era.  I am, however, reading ""The Creature from Jekyll Island"" as a more credible source.I add, reading Jekyll Island, that while it does not cite the specifics of the Elders of the Protocols of Zion, it makes a strong case for the involvement of cabals of Jewish bankers behind central banking.  This would fit in well with what evolutionary psychologists have said about Jewish interests.  They are a separate population with interests antithetical to their Christian hosts.  There is in general no love lost, whether in Inquisitions, Holocausts, porgrams or holodomors.  The thesis in Jekyll is that bankers, who skew quite Jewish, rather coldly take advantage of their host countries' populations' lack of financial sophistication.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S350AXNZ5O5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979917654#wasThisHelpful","R3S350AXNZ5O5F","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"J. Philippe Rushton posed an immense problem for progressives.  It was tough enough to dismiss intelligence researchers such as Murray, Herrnstein and Jensen who continually reinforced findings dating back to the First World War that there are significant differences in the average intelligence of the races.  They smeared them as mightily as they could, and disparaged the whole field of intelligence measurement.Then came Rushton advocating a life history approach, an r/K approach to explaining differences among populations, that integrates observations and measurements of every facet of the human animal: the big 5 personality traits (OCEAN, for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism), educational accomplishment, criminality, fertility, sexuality, muscularity, physical dimensions, length of gestation, incidence of twins… literally hundreds of measurements.  Rushton demonstrated that all of the variables correlate along a continuum: black – Caucasian – East Asian.  Moreover, his life history theory provided a satisfactory evolutionary explanation of how these differences came about.  It all fit together.Rushton had to be silenced.  In this the left was effective.  They managed to prevent some papers from being published.  They worked feverishly to get him fired, despite tenure.  They prevented his speaking at conferences.  They smeared him, quite effectively, as a sex-obsessed racist.  Please, readers, let us know what you have heard of Rushton via your comments on this review.Though the major thrust of this book is the substance of Rushton's work, a theme running through most of the articles is the abuse that was heaped on him.  Rushton's only defenses were his impeccable manners, his absolute refusal to be ruffled or to give up, and his prodigious intellect and energy.  The piece by Linda Gottfredson which describes this perfectly appears independently on the Internet.  Google ""Resolute Ignorance on Race and Rushton"" for the excruciatingly well written and documented paper describing the systematic abuse to which he was subjected and the willful misinterpretation of science.The r/K theory of reproduction strategies is the unifying theme running through Rushton's work.  r-specialized organisms produce vast numbers of offspring and make no parental investment in them.  Oysters spew hundreds of thousands of eggs into the water.  Enough of them survive to perpetuate the oyster.  The K-specialized gorilla, on the other hand, gives birth every five years, but a high percentage of those young gorillas survive to adulthood.  In brief, r-specialized animals make sure via copious reproduction that there are always young animals in place to fill an available niche.  K is a shorthand for carrying capacity.  K specialized animals' strategy is to saturate the carrying capacity of their ecological niche.  r/K is non-controversial, mere common sense when talking about oysters and elephants, aspens and avocados.  When applied to human beings it becomes highly inflammatory.  Yet, as Rushton shows, it fits.East Asians have less sex, smaller sex organs, longer gestation, bigger skulls, higher intelligence, fewer babies, less testosterone, less musculature, less impulsiveness, less crime, more stable societies, higher levels of education, higher levels of life achievement, etc. etc. than Caucasians.  Nobody disputes this.Why this is so seems clear.  As humankind migrated out of Africa about 50,000 years ago there was strong selection pressure for traits that enabled them to survive in the cold.  They needed to develop clothes and warm housing.  They needed to plan ahead, as plant foods and even game animals were scarce for substantial portions of the year.  They needed to cooperate in the hunt… they became so effective that they hunted the mammoth to extinction, whereas their African cousins left the elephants alone – other game was easier.  They needed the stability that comes with pair bonding.  They could not afford to have men competing with one another for sex, and there was more and more to teach the children.These suites of traits appear to have evolved independently, but the r/K driver was the same for each.  Caucasians, under less severe environmental stress, evolved in the same direction as the East Asians but by almost every measure to a lesser extent.  No argument here either.  The controversy attaches itself to the populations at the other end of the spectrum.  That is why progressives, and their confederates in academia such as Stephen Jay Gould, were so vicious in their attacks.This book is a collection of papers which had appeared elsewhere.  If you Google rushton-the-great-theoetician.pdf (with the misspelling intact) you will get a 20-page paper providing a much fuller summary of his contributions to science than this review.  For readers who prefer the convenience of an e-book, the Ulster Institute offers this book in downloadable form.This book absolutely rates five stars.  It provides a good overview of Rushton's life work, a survey of the state of the art in Evolutionary Psychology, Behavioral Genetics and Differential Psychology.  It describes Rushton the man and the hostile intellectual environment in which he worked.  It affords the statistician a good overview of the uses to which the most advanced statistical techniques are being used, and of Rushton's contribution to that field as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2JRS61RLEIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0993000118#wasThisHelpful","R2H2JRS61RLEIH","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book by an economist. As is de rigueur in their profession, it involves a number of economic equations. Mathematical expressions to explain why actors act the way they do. Economists are inclined to confess with some honesty that the models are not perfect, but they're the best that they have. Is there question is not the models don't work, but that no model is perfect.The model in this instance is the tournament model. It is kind of like game theory. If the costs of going to war are small, and the rewards are large, leaders will go to war. They get the glory, and the peasants get the shaft.That simple rule seemed to prevail in late medieval and early modern Europe. The countries were always at war. The kings and princes benefited from war. As the author points out with an impressive array of statistics, kings and princes rarely died when they lost, however many subjects may have died, and they gained great riches and renown when they won.  If you were a sovereign, war was the thing to do.His thesis is that European powers were always at war, that war brought about innovation and improvements in technology, and that because Europe can was the first to innovate, especially with gunpowder, the singular most important invention of the period, they came to dominate the world.The author says that other people have had theories as to why the West came out dominant, and those theories are lacking. There is Jared Diamond's Guns Germs and Steel which posits that it was a matter of geography. The geography of Eurasia allowed agricultural technology to spread East-West and allowed the Eurasian peoples to develop civilization earlier. There is a trade argument. Once the Portuguese in particular learned open ocean navigation, the Europeans had advantage. They could trade easily with one another on the open Atlantic, as well as the Mediterranean. More than that, their ships carried them to the four corners of the earth. As Hoffman indicates, they were able to bring their war machines which were more effective than any of the locals they encountered. They were certainly vastly more effective than those of the Native Americans, Stone Age people who simply could not resist Pizarro, Cortez and the other conquistadores. But Europeans also dominated in Japan, India, Indonesia and other places where they touched down. Western technology simply overwhelmed the natives' ability to defend themselves. As always, as the author carefully points out, there was dissension among the tribes wherever they went, and certain of the locals found it beneficial to ally themselves with Europeans.To quote from the book, "" Above all else, we want to explain improvements in the gunpowder technology and understand why the Europeans pushed it further than anyone else. We can distill what the model says on that subject into four essential conditions for advancing the gunpowder technology via learning by doing:""1. There must be frequent war. Rulers must therefore face similar political costs of mobilizing resources and must be battling for a prize that was valuable relative to the fixed cost of establishing a fiscal system and a military apparatus. There cannot be huge differences in the size of their countries or economies or their ability to borrow, although credit can allow the ruler of a small country to fight a larger opponent.""2. Frequent war, though, is not enough, for rulers must also lavish huge sums on it. Once again, the prize must be valuable, but in addition, the rulers’ political costs of summoning resources must not only be similar, but low.""3. Rulers must use the gunpowder technology heavily, and not older military technologies.""4. Rulers must face few obstacles to adopting military innovations, even from opponents. Each of the four conditions is necessary with high probability: if one of them fails to hold, the gunpowder technology will likely fail to advance.""Together, however, the four conditions are sufficient. When they all hold, learning by doing will in fact improve the gunpowder technology. Greater relevant knowledge (so the model also implies) will spur innovation to an even faster pace and ensure that it does not wane as the gunpowder technology ages.""The author's attempts to mathematicise history, to devise formulas to explain his thesis, are interesting.  It involves parametrizing historical financial data – productivity, GDP, prices – in a way that can be compared across very different cultures and across time.  This is difficult enough.  He then goes into the productivity of soldiers.  How do you measure their productivity?  Their killing efficiency?  It is a bold effort even to attempt.  By doing so, however, Hoffman gives good insight into the ways in which weaponry, tactics, and even the psychology of soldiering changed through the period under study.Though the introduction and first chapter would lead one to think otherwise, Hoffman is, in the end, quite modest in the claims he makes for his models.  They are useful tools, but they are only that, a tool to augment the standard techniques of historical explanation.Hoffman's publisher being Princeton, a bastion of political correctness, may have led him to leave important variables out of his equation.  He discusses evolutionary anthropologists at length.  These academics would attribute differences in inventiveness to cultural factors.  He makes no mention whatsoever of evolutionary psychologists, who have a lot to say about the evolution of intelligence.  Other authors such as Harpending and Cochran, Clark and Wade write extensively about major, recent evolution among different peoples.  Evolving intelligence would appear to be a variable not to be left out of the regression.Overall, a five-star effort.  Hoffman's book has a lot of explanatory power, and it introduces a useful synthesis of tools for analysis of history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32THZ2BRL6U11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U58Y4EA#wasThisHelpful","R32THZ2BRL6U11","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an inspirational book. It is a two hour read, 130 very loose pages. The purpose is to inspire the reader to do what it takes to be successful.Jen Fraser cites research by people such as Howard Gardner, famous for his ""Multiple Intelligences,"" to say that genius is a hard thing to measure and is not essential. Anybody can succeed.She has a lot of good advice for how to succeed. First and most important, make up your mind that that's what you want. Secondly, avoid all of the distractors, like Facebook and video games and drugs that divert your attention away from success. It does not take a genius to recognize the wisdom in these observations.What does take genius, on Mrs. Fraser's part, is to pull absolutely perfect quotations from a great number of historical figures. Her genius is also on display in her graphic art. She is a gifted artist. And I would have to agree with her, not just gifted but also accomplished. It is clear that she recognized she had some talent and did what it took to take maximum advantage of the talent she had.Mrs. Fraser shares a very revealing quote towards the end of the book.  ""I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say “I know, we could get Jen to Photoshop....” She is the person who can make things happen. You don't have to be a genius to do most things, you just have to set your mind to the task and see it through. In our age being able to use software, like she does, is a wonderful measure of a person's willingness to do what it takes to get the job done.If you do it well enough, you can transition from being ""a person who can do XYZ"" to ""the person to see for XYZ.""  That transition invariably requires all of the virtues that Ms. Fraser recommends.  Intelligence doesn't hurt, but the other attributes are more within an individual's control.  That is a central message of this book – take control.Fraser disparages Mensa, the high IQ society, as mostly a bunch of self-absorbed naval gazers. I'd like to quibble with her on a couple of counts, neither of which detracts whatsoever from her argument.First of all, they aren't that smart. The cut off is an IQ of 130, which is two percent of the population. If you discount the people who don't graduate, that's three percent of high school graduates. Take into account the fact that smart people usually go to the same schools, and I would bet that 15 percent of the people you readers graduated from high school with were Mensa candidates. It is simply not that selective.Second, she would like to say that Einstein wasn't that smart, citing 160 as his estimated IQ.  That would be one in 30,000, meaning that perhaps 10,000 living Americans are as smart as Einstein was.  That can't be true.  The top intellects of our time – Pinker, Dawkins, Hawking, Craig Venter, James Watson, Richard Feynman, John von Neumann and perhaps Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs and Steve Gates in business – are not nearly that numerous, and their achievements are nowhere comparable to Einstein's.  Give true genius its due.  Also note that they were all extremely curious.Here I will turn one of Einstein's beautiful quotes back on her.  ""If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.""  Very few people I know are intelligent enough to explain even simple theories.  More important, most people are not curious enough to try.  I would ask readers of this review to ponder whether you have ever wondered about, then explain in your minds, the following:• Why is there dew in the morning?• How many degrees above the horizon is the midsummer sun where you are?• How did Columbus decide the world was round?• How do bicycles balance on only two wheels?• What is the theory of evolution?• How did language develop?• Why do we have both particle and wave theories to explain light?Call it intelligence, curiosity or simply the ability to explain, they seem to run together.  Curiosity is something born into every child.  Fraser's challenge is for a person not to let go of it.This is a wonderful book of inspiration.  It is a great source of quotes.  It is also something that might stand a prayer of getting read if given as a present to a high school child.  Going back to Einstein, Jen Fraser has the gift of explaining it simply.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3807X1JCYVVSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUJ37E8#wasThisHelpful","R3807X1JCYVVSP","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a short, accessible book.  Fourteen articles by white people in situations in which they deal with Blacks (mostly) and Hispanics.  It addresses the effects of forced diversity in schools, the military, construction trades, public safety and neighborhoods.  He concludes with a chapter by author Geladiah Brown of Racism, Guilt and Self-Deceit which distills the high points of Brown's decades of experience in South Africa.These are first-person accounts of how the facts that scholars spell out dispassionately in books such as Bell Curve, Race, Evolution & Behavior and Race Differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis play out.  Blacks in America average a full standard deviation lower in intelligence.  This correlates directly with their much lower empathy for the suffering of (and suffering they inflict upon) their fellow man, their lesser ability to perform almost all jobs, whether or not they would be called ""cognitively challenging,"" and their criminality.Many of the authors have lived through the changes they describe.  They write of a better balance before the liberal courts began to challenge every manifestation of unequal results as prima facie evidence of white prejudice and forced integration in all spheres of American life.I myself witnessed it in my California childhood.  All of society accepted DuBois' assessment that the ""talented tenth"" of blacks could compete on a par with whites, and should therefore provide moral leadership allowing the rest to rise to whatever levels their ability would permit.About the time of Martin Luther King the argument shifted from achievement based on opportunity to entitlement based on a presumption of equality - an equality which self-evidently did not exist except as a figment of the wildest liberal imaginations.  This was the '60s, however, and decades of scholarship yielded to wholly unsupported fantasies.  This book documents some of the outcomes.  I experienced a few - being confident that Black Army officers in Vietnam were more or less equal in ability with their white peers, whereas that was surely not true in enlisted ranks.  Finding myself, as an employee of the world's largest computer company, which had the hubris to assume it could on its own right society's wrongs, working for people whose intellect I could not in the least respect.As a parent, trustee and teacher in private schools I observed diversity first-hand.  The schools were careful to limit their scholarship (in Washington D.C., black) students to about 15% of enrollment.  They were of course careful to choose those most likely to succeed, in terms of family life and demonstrated ability.  Nevertheless, the spectrum of ability distribution among Jews, Asians, Whites and Blacks was quite evident.There were relatively few Hispanics.  One science student constantly whined that she could not do written work because English was not her native language.  Fine, I relented, do your report on the coqui (a frog, national symbol of Puerto Rico) in Spanish.  It turned out she was a double threat - illiterate in both languages.The writing is very consistent, and amazingly good to have come from the blue-collar authors.  One suspects that they had quite a bit of editorial help.  Their tone is relentlessly non-emotional, just-the-facts ma'am.  It is probably no coincidence that this is exactly Jared Taylor's style.  While I believe the incidents as reported, the voices do not seem wholly authentic.Writing openly and honestly about the actualities of race in the United States is Jared Taylor's forté.  He has recently expressed increased interest in the state of the races in Europe, which has some strong parallels.  Replace the descendants of slaves with native Africans, and Hispanics with Muslims, and you have the picture in Europe.  An important exception is that the situation cannot be blamed on slavery.  Europe's racial problems are only a few decades old, dating back to the large-scale immigration of guest workers to Germany in the '60s, relaxed immigration requirements for former colonials of France, England and Portugal, and the more recent liberal-inspired humanitarian resettlements.  Laurent Obertone has written about how this plays out in France, Thilo Sarrazin about Germany, and Jan Sjunnesson about Sweden.Taylor finds common ground with the European nationalist movements, most especially the French.  He speaks fluent French and is friends with many leaders of the French nationalist movement: Alain de Benoist and Guillaume Faye among them.  [I am pleased to modify this review in March of 2015.  In mid-2014 I wrote that Taylor appeared on the verge of allying himself with Vladimir Putin - Putin's pet philosopher Alexander Dugin was a scheduled speaker at the Budapest conference last fall.  In a turnabout, staunch Latvian nationalist Konstantins Pupurs, no friend whatsoever of the Kremlin, is scheduled for the April 2015 conference.]It would have been wrong to assume that Vladimir Putin has the answer.  Not at all.  Moscow has become about 25% Muslim on Putin's watch, and Putin himself- not the Muslims - for his own political ends initiated a terror in Chechnya that wiped out about 20% of the population.  He is now threatening Ukraine and the Baltics, not in the interests of the white populations, but rather rebuilding the Soviet Union, the collapse of which he considers history's greatest catastrophe.  He could not care less what happens to white people in the process.  He is killing them.  We are ""Russian-speaking"" because it was forced on us repeatedly, against our will.  Putin wants to do it again.White Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century, Taylor's book focusing mainly on the American situation, does not provide much guidance as to what to do.  Retake control of the borders - then what?  Whites are still being outbred, and still harbor an innate, however nave and misguided, altruism.  My call to Taylor would be to support still-white Eastern Europe against encroachment by the multiculturalists from the West and a revanchist Russian Empire from the east.  We may need it.Taylor does not advocate emigration.  Given the current situation in the United States, well documented in ""Face to Face with Race,"" he should include it among the options.  The United States may be beyond salvation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JGUKCQIXME57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQM9ZHM#wasThisHelpful","R3JGUKCQIXME57","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Return of Kings was just a fuzzy memory (I had reviewed founder Roosh V's book Bang Ukraine a couple of years back) until I read Ann Sterzinger's excellent write up on this book on Taki Magazine. I bought it yesterday and couldn't put it down.Today I read a few articles on Return of Kings.  They are good, but Quintus Curtius has to be about the best.  This review is therefore just what it says - a take on his 37 essays, and a bit of an aside on a phenomenon of which I've only recently become aware, the ""manosphere.""Most of the 37 essays deal with what it is to be a man.  Curtius draws on classic sources, most significantly the Stoics, in his attempt to define what a man should be.Virility, courage and resolve, perhaps best distilled into the single word ""character,"" define a man in Curtius' world.  Many of his essays focus on endurance and physical bravery: World War I hero/writer Ernst Jünger, people who survived catastrophes by sheer force of will, and those driven to prove themselves such as the tunnel rats of Vietnam.Other essays address resolve in getting things done despite the pettifoggery, log rolling and indifference of those around them.  The epic search for John Paul Jones' corpse, and that of Everest climber George Mallory.  The fights to publish an authentic anatomy of the human body, and photographs of the Civil War.  These efforts took courage of a different kind.  It took men with the intellect to understand the importance of their missions, and the resolve to carry them out, often over thankless decades of toil.Quintus only partially addresses the question of how a society forms such men.  He is clear that today's society does not.  Education and every avenue of socialization weakens, feminizes a man.  Quintus is a classicist: he offers valuable pieces on ancient authors who are almost certain to be unknown to modern readers, and whose observations on the human condition and what it means to be a man are all the more relevant today.He is not afraid to let his sources do the talking.  ""A Program of Education"" presents without much modification Pier Paolo Vergerio's Renaissance era distillation of classical wisdom with regard to how to educate a man.  The contrast with today's pedagogues, the likes of Alfie Kohn and the Sadkers, is striking.Quintus does not delve more deeply into how a society forms men.  It is an expensive process.  That truly virile men may rise to the top, others must be tested and found wanting.  Some die in the process.  It takes a society, rather like the classical world, in which women bear many sons in the knowledge that not all will survive to adulthood, and not all of those will achieve manhood.Contrast that with modern society, in which the little darlings - often adopted from other, more fecund peoples in order to avoid the bother of gestation and lactation - are endlessly shuttled by mothers or their surrogates, in car seats from (female) expert to expert in an effort to teach them how to be human.  God forbid that any should perish in the process, or even that parents should conclude, whatever the justification, that any particular kid just doesn't have the right stuff to make it.The upshot is that raising true men requires the commitment of women just as much as men.  Like the women of Sparta, who admonished their sons to come back with their shields, or on them.  This, in turn, requires a commitment to the notion that the society transcends the individual.  We began losing sight of that truth with the Enlightenment, and it has been wholly ignored for the past century or more.  The question is not our personal survival but that of our culture and genome.  Putting the individual first, we have lost our society.  Quintus is headed in that direction, but in his focus on virility in the individual he does not emphasize why a society so desperately needs it, and how society must achieve it.Quintus has two essays on learning foreign languages.  As I write this, working on my seventh language in my eighth decade, I have to say that he is a bit too demanding and too optimistic.  Learning language takes both hard work, which he emphasizes, and talent.  I recommend that anybody seeking to duplicate his success first contact 2LTI (Google it) to have your aptitude for foreign languages tested.  No sense beating your head against a wall.  Once you conclude that it is worth the effort, and you have the ability, his advice is very sound.This is a beautifully written book.  It will make any reader long for the classical education that has been absent from our educations for decades now.  Given that you can't have the real thing, this is an excellent substitute.  I recommend as well Full Circle : How the Classical World Came Back to Us, which ties the classical era back to our own.Quintus says that classical authors, especially historians, looked at everything they wrote as a vehicle for moral instruction.  He lives up to the standards of his idols.

One I composed myself is in three parts:• A fundamentalist doesn’t believe in evolution.• A liberal believes evolution among humans stopped cold 50,000 years ago, when we migrated out of Africa.• A realist believes in evolution.This message is the core of Troost's book.  He has read Darwin very thoroughly, as well as the authors like Daniel Dennett, E. O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins who carry on Darwin's tradition today.  It is a pleasure to read a book written by a truly literate man, somebody able to draw convincingly on the wisdom of the ages.Troost pulls no punches in describing the difficulties of writing in a politically correct time.  Other reviewers note that his standing as a University of California professor was not enough to get him published by a major house.  This is no accident, and no great tragedy.  The leading intelligence researcher of the 20th century, Arthur Jensen, had to publish his magnum opus through such an unknown house because ""The Bell Curve"" made mainstream publishers afraid to touch it.  The same can be said for Philippe Rushton, Richard Lynn, Tatu Vanhanen, Jared Taylor and many others.Nicholas Wade, the science editor of the New York Times, was the apparent exception.  Was.  His 2005 ""Before the Dawn,"" which Troost cites, was extremely bold, especially for a Times writer.  His 2014 ""A Troublesome Inheritance,"" however, provoked the Times to fire him.  I hope his publisher, Penguin, has the courage to stand up to abuse.  I mention Wade because Troost draws significantly on his work, also that of Cochran and Harpending and Stephen Pinker.I was impressed that Steve Sailer and John Derbyshire gave this book good reviews.  They are two of the boldest and most intelligent voices in the blogosphere.  Their endorsement means far more than mine.  Moreover, they are people that anyone with an inquiring mind should be reading.  They are good about identifying the best contemporary thought on evolution.  For that, read, the important implications of evolution, human biodiversity.  For that read, difference among the races.Troost devotes quite a bit of space to a discussion of religion.  In this he seems mostly to be repeating arguments made by Dennett, Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and the rest of the gang who brought out books on the subject a couple of years back.  Yes, fundamentalist Christians believe things that defy scientific explanation.  And???  The more interesting question to me is why people believe, and more to the point, why religion may be fundamental to our mental health and our reproduction.  The religious peoples of the world are the ones having babies.  To heck with science, it is evolutionarily successful.  Troost mentions but does not investigate this paradox.  Sir Arthur Keith did so in his 1944 Evolution and Ethics, downloadable for free.This book's great virtues are (1) the broad literature it references, classic and modern, and (2) the author's dedication to the truth, no matter how unpopular it may be.  A five-star effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YC4XQ9B4O2RK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X27W12#wasThisHelpful","R2YC4XQ9B4O2RK","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The public is finally, after seventy years, wearying of the Zionist message.  Supporters of Israel are encountering an uphill fight.Weir's succinct, powerful account of the deceit, propaganda and political pressure surrounding the establishment of the Jewish state is finally falling on a receptive audience.  The American public is awakening to the fact that it has been had.  That our youth have been dying in the Middle East not to serve American interests but those of a foreign power.  Weir's gift is to pull together what so many other books such as Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict, New and Revised Edition and those by Noam Chomsky, mostly by Jewish authors, into a single, powerful, compact statement.As a fourth grader in the 1950s I proudly wrote my first term paper on the subject of Israel.  A heroic tale of kibbutzniks fighting against all odds to establish a pioneer nation in the empty deserts of the Middle East.  In college I listened with interest to the stories told by Leon Uris, Saul Bellow and the legions of star authors, songwriters, dramatists and newsmen, who all seemed to be Jewish.  What a coincidence!  These gifted scribes are all telling somewhat the same story, about this brave new nation of Jews.They were a hard crowd to please.  When I attempted to ask some penetrating questions about inconsistencies in the stories, I was called variously a social Darwinist, a reactionary, and an anti-Semite.  I don't like being called names.  It caused the worst of all possible reactions.  I started to think for myself, and resent those who called me names.  Fortunately, I had no great position in society to lose, so it would not have been worth their while to attempt to undo me.  They had bigger fish to fry.  Which they did.  But I came to the conclusion that I had been conned, and actually came to resent it.We note that even today Israel's supporters, the neocons and whoever, never admit they are/were wrong and never give up.  They constantly fill the dialog with controversy, disinformation and distractors.  Now that the Israel story is being undone, I ask, who else?  What other pack of lies?There are two competing, contradictory packs of lies today.  One is foisted on us by the progressive establishment in the United States: problems in the schools can be fixed with money; white bigotry is the source of the problems; the Federal Reserve is in control of the situation and printing money will work us out of this temporary impasse; immigration is good for us.The other story, favored by libertarians of the Rand Paul/Pat Buchanan/Paul Craig Roberts persuasion, is that Russia somehow has the answer.  Vladimir Putin is a true Christian who is being unjustly put-upon by a vindictive and corrupt West enamored of sexual deviancy, debt and other moral degeneracy.Both stories - all stories, for there are certainly more - are supported by massive deceit and propaganda.  The take-home point from Weir's account, for me, is that one should be very, very skeptical.  Go with Andre Gide, quote, ""Seek those who seeks the truth.  Avoid those who have found it.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYV1VBFWSJA0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0LXYLM#wasThisHelpful","RYV1VBFWSJA0G","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did not review this book on Amazon because Amazon did not then exist. I picked it up after twenty years to read it to see if I could get any insights into skirmishes here in Ukraine.Yes, I did. Most of the book describes the levels of war long ago. Warfare among primitive tribes and warfare with bladed weapons, and then warfare with gunpowder.Equally important are the mentalities or the philosophies of the warring parties. Some, mostly the primitives, fought wars of limited engagement, not battles to the death but rather skirmishes. This even characterized the highly successful horse warriors such as the Mongols and the Huns. They would swoop in on and devastate an area. However, they were not committed to a battle to the death. If they met firm resistance, they would retreat.The Greeks with their phalanx warfare represented another step. They were fighting for something they believed in, their way of government, their city state, and their society. And they would, in their phalanxes, fight to the death. This willingness to maintain their ranks and to bravely fight until it was done was adequate to defeat the Persians and a great many other enemies. It led Alexander the Great to conquer the world. The Romans improved on Greek tactics, and especially, improved on organization and weaponry.Keegan says that the next great advent came from Islam. It was to unite the people behind an ideology, in this case religion. The Muslims' belief in the righteousness of their mission made them an overwhelming force. This happened again in the Napoleonic wars. It was the first war of mass conscription, in which all citizens of the country were armed and sent to the field to represent the interests of that country. Napoleon was able to overwhelm his enemies because the soldiers felt that they were citizens of France, not simply serfs and servants of some lord someplace.European warfare developed a set of principles of war, articulated by Clausewitz in the early 19th century. There had to be a reason for going to war, an Enlightenment style, rational purpose for going to war. War was, as he wrote, the continuation of politics by other means. The Europeans adopted rules of warfare to prevent mass civilian casualties and to ensure relatively humane treatment of the wounded and prisoners. The objective was to win, not to annihilate the enemy. This set of rules worked fairly well for the century between Napoleon and World War I.By the time of World War I the technology has changed so radically that it led to a murderous slaughter between motivated citizen soldiers. It left vast numbers of them dead. The same happened again in World War II. Keegan notes that the European powers fighting in these wars did have some respect for the opposition soldier, and took some care with the prisoners of war. Notable exceptions were Japan, which was barbaric in its treatment of Chinese in Manchuria and then the Europeans whom it took prisoner in the Pacific. Russia was not terribly careful with the Germans it captured. Keegan reports that 3 million out of the 5 million taken as prisoners of war died before the end of the war.What is relevant today? The first thing is the use of irregular forces. The first six pages of Keegan's book are about the Cossacks. The very same Cossacks that Putin has resurrected as his palace guard in Moscow, and has sent to Ukraine as irregulars, insurgents, rebel forces to cause trouble in Ukraine's Southeast. This is not an accident. The Cossacks are, as Keegan reports, a border people, a tough people, and xenophobic and rather unprincipled warriors. The same adjectives apply even more to the Chechnyan mercenaries that Putin has sent to Ukraine. This is therefore a battle between a Ukraine which espouses European values and would like to consider itself a friend of the European Union and NATO, and the descendents of steppe horsemen who do not respect any of those conventions of war. The irregular and deceptive tactics that Putin has been using illustrate the difference in philosophy.We see the difference again in Iraq, where religious fanaticism is carrying the day against a corrupt warlord type government installed by the West. It is happening as well in Afghanistan. The West simply does not have a means of fighting warriors who do not value their own lives or understand their own self-interest, as we in the West would like to conceive it. This is our own shortcoming. We simply do not see the world the way they do. In our decadent, self-centered way, we do not want to take the risks that they willingly assume in order to achieve ultimate victory.I recommend this as a book for the ages. There are new chapters to be written, of course, after 20 years. I think that the most significant are the two just mentioned - Islam's wars against the West, and Russia's resurgence. But overall they stand well within the historical context that Keegan sets. He doesn't need to rewrite the book, just to add a chapter on the new manifestations of old phenomena.It was a five-star effort in 1994, and remain so today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39V29RK74I3L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JDTVL2#wasThisHelpful","R39V29RK74I3L3","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrei Kurkov is a novelist living in Kiev with his English wife and three teenage children.  He is also a diarist - he has made a habit of practicing his craft by capturing his impressions of each day's events.His diary rings true as just that - a diary.  It is entirely in the present tense.  It has not been redacted to look prescient, nor has the author gone to much trouble to ensure that a reader who is not familiar with Kiev, Ukraine and the politics of the area knows what is going on where.The Maidan uprising and subsequent Russian invasion have been awash in propaganda, mostly from Russia though the West does its part.  This diary serves as a database of observations by a (very alert and well connected) common man of events as they happened.  He assumes that the readership of his diary shares the common knowledge of people in Kiev.  He does not go out of his way to make the case that:* President Yanukovych was Putin's choice for President of Ukraine, and Russia was deeply involved in installing and manipulating him.* Therefore, the Russian FSB (national security service), successor to the KGB, played a large role in Ukrainian politics.  Under Yanukovych Ukraine's analogous SBU did likewise, though their service of Ukraine's real interests after Yanukovych left has impressed this reviewer.* Putin is aggressively working to reestablish Russia's empire.  This has been evident through his wars in Georgia and Moldova, and his constant bullying of Ukraine Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Baltic states.  He uses natural gas prices, promises of loans and trade restrictions to constantly jerk them around.* The Moscow Patriarchy of the Orthodox Church is essential an organ of the government, subordinate to Putin.  Peter the Great brought them under his control three centuries ago.The evidence of the diary will convince the reader that these suppositions are correct.  Kurkov makes a number of wry comments about the transparency of the lies offered by Yanukovych and Putin, and about Yanukovych's stupidity.  This diary quote could have come from anyone in Kiev: "" This country has never had such a stupid president before, capable of radicalising one of the most tolerant populations in the world!""There are some very important terms that Kurkov does not explain.  For example:* The titushki are paid troublemakers that Yanukovych bused in from the countryside to cow the more civilized urbanites of Kiev.  They are thugs: members of local fight clubs.  They would be promised 400 hryvnya (then, about $50) to raise havoc.  One of Yanukovych's many mistakes was to constantly stiff these thugs, paying them less than the agreed amount.* The berkut were the highly trained riot police.  They use tactics going back to the Roman ""turtle"" and improved during the US antiwar riots of the 60s and 70s.  They generally moved in a phalanx, protected by large shields.  They were armed with truncheons and rubber bullets. Disciplined as they were, they would probably not have used live ammunition without authority.* The byudzhetniki (the root word is budget) are low-level civil servants, encouraged/coerced to turn out in support of the government.Wikipedia will be useful for looking up others.The diary describes where events took place.  It will be convenient to keep Google Earth open in a window as you read the book.  Important places are:* Lazarevka is where Kurkov has his dacha, his country house.  There are tens of places by that name.  This has to be the tiny village 40 miles west of Kiev.* The places he describes in Crimea are along the southernmost coastline, a beautiful and rugged stretch reminiscent of the Amalfi Drive, France's Corniche, or California's Big Sur.* Downtown Kiev is quite small.  It is a five-minute walk from Kurkov's house to Maidan, another five to the houses of parliament, and just another five to the presidential mansion.  All of the action took place within ¼ mile of the main drag, Khreshetik, which is a bit more than a half-mile long.The diary assumes that the reader is familiar with events.  He does not describe the shootings on Maidan or the invasion of Crimea, assuming that the reader knows what is going on.  It will be useful to have a chronology of events at hand.This book ties in neatly with other books on Russia and the war.  Letters from Russia (Penguin Classics) clearly describes the tsar's power, his instruments for projecting that power, and the country's foreign policy objectives.  They have not changed in 175 years.  Archie Brown's The Rise and Fall of Communism describes how it worked in the 20th century.  Timothy Snyder's Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin describes how Russia and Germany made Ukraine the bloodiest place on earth for a decade and a half.  John Keegan's A History of Warfare starts with a description of the Cossacks - the same Cossacks that Putin has revived to serve as his palace guard and terrorists in Ukraine.  Lastly, Putin's Wars: The Rise of Russia's New Imperialism describes the extensive planning that went into the wars in Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea and now Ukraine.  Nothing is by accident.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MF7KD1FWJQLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCRNIZA#wasThisHelpful","R1MF7KD1FWJQLP","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Russia has been an expansionist empire for the past 500 years. When it fell apart, during the Bolshevik revolution and after the fall of communism, instinct drives them to put it back together.  The desires of the subject peoples - Poles, Balts, Georgians and Ukrainains - are never taken into consideration.  The rest of the world often acknowledges Russia's ""sphere of interest"" and does not probe deeply about human rights.Russia tried democracy in the decade starting 1991. It didn't work. The elections were far from fair, and the people are not democratic in nature. Nobody was excited about the government. Vladimir Putin, who took over in 1999, had the insight that what the country really wants is a tsar.Putin invented ""sovereign democracy,"" the system with enough trappings of democracy to satisfy an uncritical West while allowing himself unrestricted control. Custine wrote 175 years ago that the Russian tsar had more power than any single person in the world, and that the Russian mentality was okay with that. Putin has re-created the czarist system, and his approval rates are hovering in the 80 percent range.The the book details the elaborate planning that goes into supposedly unplanned events such as the war in Georgia and the ""rebellion"" in southeast Ukraine. Elements include the use of irregular forces such as Cossacks, Chechnyans, and local thugs, and the massive use of propaganda.  Russia's ability to sway the libertarian right and the nationalist movements in Western Europe has been awesome. The book describes how and why it is done.It is amazing that a book published in February could so accurately predict the way the war in Ukraine has unfolded in the half year since. The entire thing has been driven by Russia, in an obvious drive to reestablish its empire. This is done with no regard for the Ukrainian people, including the Russian speaking majority from he pretends to be protecting.The author's introduction briefly describes the three parts of the book.  I copy it below.Part I : ""Russia and the Curse of Empire"" (chapters 1- 5) In this part I analyze the role of empire building in Russian history and look at the similarities and differences with empire building in Western Europe. Why is it that in Russia empire building and despotism have always tended to go hand in hand? What are the differences and similarities between the legitimation theories used for empire building in Russia and in the West? This part ends with a chapter on ""empire fatigue"" in post-Soviet Russia and suggests that empire fatigue came to an end with the arrival of Vladimir Putin, who considered it his historic role to reestablish the lost empire. In the final chapters of this part the different diplomatic initiatives of Putin are analyzed, such as the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Russia-Belarus Union State, the BRICS, the Customs Union, as well as his most recent project: the Eurasian Union.Part II: ""The`Internal War'"" (chapters 6- 9) Part II analyzes how Putin, convinced that in order to rebuild the empire he needed to rule for at least twenty years without interruption, put a system in place that guaranteed this continued rule. It analyzes in detail how he eroded and dismantled the democratic reforms, manipulated the party system, introduced fake parties , falsified elections, and transformed the ruling party ""United Russia"" from a centrist party into a revanchist and ultranationalist party. One particular chapter describes the activities of the Kremlin's youth movement ""Nashi,"" which enabled the Kremlin to inculcate its adherents with its ultranationalist ideology and strengthen its grip on civil society by harassing and intimidating opponents. Another chapter describes the new role, assigned to the Cossacks, who function as Putin's praetorian guard and auxiliary police force after the mass protests of 2011- 2012.Part III: ""The Wheels of War"" (chapters 10- 16) In this part the wars of Putin's regime are analyzed and compared with other recent wars fought by (Soviet) Russia. In the first chapter three lost wars are analyzed: the war in Afghanistan , the Cold War, and the First Chechen War. This analysis is followed by a chapter on the casus belli, which offered (then) Prime Minister Putin an opportunity to start an all-out second war in Chechnya: the so-called ""apartment bombings"" of September 1999, which killed hundreds of Russian citizens. The Kremlin ascribed these attacks to Chechen terrorists, but the official Kremlin version is put in doubt by allegations that the FSB, the KGB's follow-up organization, masterminded these explosions. This chapter is followed by a chapter on the Second Chechen War, a war characterized by purges, torture, and forced disappearances. I explain that this war had a triple function for the Kremlin: to consolidate Putin's position, to legitimate Putin's power, and, additionally, to enable him to roll back the democratic reforms. In the final chapters the 2008 war with Georgia is analyzed. I distinguish three phases in this war: a ""cold"" war, a ""lukewarm"" war, and, finally, the ""hot"" (five-day) war. Despite the Kremlin's declarations that this war came as a surprise, I present and analyze the many circumstances indicating that this war was preplanned with the objective of bringing about a regime change in Georgia.The last two paragraphs of the book offer an excellent summary - and a prescient warning:...""The Kremlin's blackmail was successful. Yanukovych refused to sign the agreement-- the result of six years of hard , protracted negotiations-- in exchange for the Kremlin's offer of a $ 15 billion loan and a discount in the price of Russian gas. Yanukovych met with mass protests at home. The protesters were not reassured by his statement that a Ukrainian membership of the Eurasian Union was not (yet ) on the agenda. It is clear, however, that most European governments, treating the relationship with Ukraine as a technocratic problem, have massively underestimated the important geopolitical implications of Ukraine's choice. However, it is not sure that this is also the case for Moscow. If Ukraine were to opt for deeper integration into the European Union, a Georgian scenario could not be excluded, in which the Kremlin could provoke riots in Eastern Ukraine or the Crimea, where many Russian passport holders live. This would offer Russia a pretext for intervening in Ukraine in order ""to protect its nationals"" and dismember the country. Unfortunately, such a scenario cannot be excluded. It is a corollary of the five principles of Russian foreign policy, formulated by President Medvedev on August 31, 2008. The fourth principle he mentioned was ""protecting the lives and dignity of our citizens, wherever they may be.""  It leaves the door open for military adventures throughout Russia's ""neighborhood.""""In 1992 Brzezinski warned: ""The crucial issue here . . . is the future stability and independence of Ukraine.""  In 2012-- twenty years later-- in his book Strategic Vision, Brzezinski repeated this warning, writing: ""It cannot be stressed enough that without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire, but with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire.""  Brzezinski's warning is, more than ever, still relevant today. It is not without reason that Polish analysts especially , or analysts of Polish origin, warn about the dangers of Russia's new imperialism.  Their country was, in the twentieth century (and in the centuries before), the main victim in Europe of the aggression from the imperialist powers, which dismembered and occupied the country. When the Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski was asked: ""Can you imagine any kind of renewed geopolitical conflict to your west in your lifetime?"" he answered ""I have a vivid imagination, but no, I cannot imagine an armed conflict between us and Germany.""  When asked: ""Does your imagination extend to the possibility of a future conflict to the east ?"" he answered: ""Our relations with Russia, like yours [U.S.A.], are pragmatic but brittle. And unfortunately , after the war between Russia and Georgia, I'm afraid conflict in Europe is imaginable.""  Another East European politician, Czech President Vaclav Havel, expressed the same concern sixteen years earlier: ""I have said it so often: if the West does not stabilize the East, the East will destabilize the West.""  This is a warning that should be taken seriously.<end of book>","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39B0RWX6W97LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442231378#wasThisHelpful","R39B0RWX6W97LZ","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book covers the first three years of Buchanan's association with Richard Nixon, from 1965 to 1968. The opening chapter provides a bit of history leading up to that point. Nixon had been a very successful politician early in his career, elected to Congress in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950, then becoming Eisenhower's Vice President in 1952.  By 1960, only 47 years old, he had gained vast exposure on the world stage traveling on behalf of the US government and the Eisenhower administration.Despite losing the presidency, the Democrats had expanded their presence in both houses of congress and statehouses during the Eisenhower administration.  Registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by about two to one.  Eisenhower, who could have run on either party's ticket, was simply not a party builder for the GOP.  The lack of political infrastructure, and a consistently hostile press, were handicaps that proved impossible for Nixon to overcome.Buchanan has some good observations on the way the campaigns were run in 1960. They involved a lot of personal appearances, as neither candidate had yet figured out how to fully leverage television. When they did, it benefited Kennedy more than Nixon as he was the more telegenic man.Buchanan, as an editorial writer at the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, saw what few others would have imagined: that Nixon was likely to be a contender again in the 1968 elections.  Quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes ""It is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived,"" Buchanan approached Nixon with an offer to serve.After losing to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon planned his comeback via the governorship of California. California politics was then as now a rather confused.  As always, the press treated Nixon viciously.  Unable to rally the support of the fickle California GOP establishment, the camp of Knowland, Kuchel and Earl Warren, Nixon lost to Edmund G ""Pat"" Brown, the father of the present Gov. Jerry Brown.  After his loss, he decided to wash his hands of politics, and the press was quick to dismiss him.Nixon moved to New York and founded the law firm of Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie and Alexander. His national and international exposure was extremely valuable for attracting clients, and the firm prospered. Practicing law, however, bored Nixon, and he kept his hand in politics.  When Buchanan called, Nixon decided he could use somebody to help with the writing and the planning of his travels and appearances. He subjected Buchanan, young and not highly credentialed, to a very thorough interview before inviting him as the anchor member of his reelection team.The substance of the book starts with the 1966 by-elections. At that point Johnson's Great Society was in full swing, programs put in place with a veto proof majority in both houses of Congress. The Republicans were unable even to function as a loyal opposition, questioning the wisdom of Johnson's social programs or the war in Vietnam.The Republican establishment, Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Jacob Javits to name three, had refused to support Barry Goldwater actively in 1964.  Nixon, despite reservations about some of Goldwater's rhetoric, campaigned for him in 36 states.  Though the candidate was thoroughly trounced, conservatives remembered Nixon as a loyal friend.Again in 1966 Nixon took it upon himself to become the best-known Republican to campaign nationally on behalf of Republican candidates. He focused his efforts more on rookies, those without the advantage of incumbency, and earned a great many debts of gratitude as the Republicans gained 47 house seats in 1966.The press did not give him credit for the success, nor did they see him shedding his loser image or reemerging as a candidate for 1968. This contented Nixon. Leaving Romney and Rockefeller to fight it out for the limelight, he was satisfied to remain in the background, continuing to do good works on behalf of the party.The 1960s was a time of huge social issues and turmoil. While Buchanan does not dwell on the sexual and the drug revolution, he dedicates a great deal of space to discussing the antiwar movement and the race issue.The protesters against the war behaved as though their cause was so just, that the war was so immoral, that they were justified in breaking whatever laws were necessary in their protests. I observed it as a student at Berkeley in 1964. My take at the time was that these antiwar activists did not really have a coherent point of view, that the protesters could not articulate what they were fighting against and could not talk rationally about the war. They did know that they did not want to be shot at, and powerful social trends had eroded their respect for their elders, government in general and the war effort in particular. Their opposition had been subdued when Kennedy had been President, but it blossomed when the unsympathetic Southerner Lyndon Johnson took over.Buchanan's take at the time was authentically conservative. A society without rule of law, a society which cannot conduct arguments civilly, is not healthy whatsoever. It is a dangerous society.  It was wrong to indulge the antiwar protesters, as the liberal establishment and the media did.The same applied to violence in race questions. The liberal theory was that blacks had been held down, systematically mistreated, and now they were only demanding what was fair using the only means at their disposal. Buchanan's observation is that Blacks in America were materially better off than most peoples in the world, and were poor only in relation to whites. Moreover, Blacks had enjoyed relatively equal and open access to the benefits of American society. There were many successful Blacks that one could point to in the 1960s: US Ambassador to the United Nations Ralph Bunche, Sen. Edward Brooke, and many figures in professional sports and in business.  There were, in fact, many successful blacks even in 19th century America.  It simply was untrue to say that the blacks had been oppressed to the point that they could not succeed.The Black resistance, chronicled by Tom Wolfe in his article Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers, was not a just rebellion against oppression, it was a question of Blacks doing what they could get away with.  My view, as a National Guard soldier, echoed those of Wolfe and Buchanan.  I was driving a 2 ½ ton army truck, trying to avoid badly parked Cadillacs in Watts. The irony was striking - Cadillacs in front of single-family homes are not a symbol of a poverty-stricken society. Moreover, curiously, the businesses the Blacks burned were the very businesses that served their communities in Watts, Hunters Point, and later Washington DC. The damage they did was felt most severely by their own people. Buchanan, as a native Washingtonian, felt the injury when the Blacks in 1968 burned the seventh and fourteenth Street corridors of that city.Buchanan quite accurately saw the Soviets as duplicitous and opportunistic. He recounts how they goaded Nasser to start a war with Israel, and then did not back him up when it blossomed into a real fight. It is exactly the same today.  Putin has induced a motley collection of rebel forces to start fights in Ukraine, but seems unwilling to back up these people that he encouraged to start trouble on his behalf.  As an aside, not in the book, it amazes me that Buchanan is able to claim that God is on Putin's side simply because the West has become so godless.  He may recall that Hitler also claimed God. In any case, Buchanan's accurate descriptions of the Soviet activities in the 1960s are pretty much identical to what is going on in the teens of the 21st century.[British PM Douglas-Home's] focus was on Russia's role in the recent war. The Soviets are in this thing ""up to their necks,"" he said. They have twin goals: make Nasser dominant in the region, and, through him, gain a Soviet foothold in Africa. Asked how this affected ""detente,"" Sir Alec said the Soviets move when they see an opportunity. They always have. Like a knife, they push ahead when they hit butter, and back away when they hit steel. Where they run into unity and strength, relations tend to improve. Soviet policy seeks ""a maximum of confusion for a minimum of commitment."" The Soviets did not intervene militarily in the Arab-Israeli war because they do not commit their military power far from their homeland.""Buchanan quotes Churchill as saying that ""The belief that security can be obtained by throwing a small state to the wolves is a fatal delusion.""  That is true, and the small states currently in play are Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova and Georgia.  I remind Pat should he be reading this review.This book is a satisfying read in a great many ways. Buchanan is as articulate and consistent of a conservative voice as one will find in America. It is a remarkable piece of history for him to have witnessed as a man in his late 20s. He was close to the centers of power, with keen powers of observation, and half a century later he is well served by a great memory and a great many archives to draw from. This book is altogether a five-star effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVSFSK1GCADQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXYLW8K#wasThisHelpful","RGVSFSK1GCADQ","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Governments come and go, but the nature of a people is far more enduring.  Custine, on the basis of an amazingly brief trip to Russia, and without knowledge of the language, was able to capture the character of the Russian people with remarkable accuracy.  And prescience.This book is especially worth reading today, in 2014, as Western Europe appears to be weakening due to excesses in the individual freedom championed by the Enlightenment.  Although Custine does not identify a ""Eurasia"" in the same way as Putin and Putin's Rasputin, Dugin, he definitely sees Russia as a creature apart.A historical context is useful for understanding Custine.  Slavery still prevailed in both Russia and the United States.  Russia had expanded eastward as far as Alaska and even Northern California (viz, the Russian River).  Poland had been unwillingly and unhappily divided between Prussia and Russia some decades earlier.  Russia clearly showed imperial ambitions, constantly threatening her neighbors, and conquering and incorporating them into its empire when they could.  The tsars who proved best at this, Peter and Catherine, earned the sobriquet ""The Great.""Among Custine's observations about the Russians are that:1) It is a provincial society.  The distances are so great, and communications so poor, that it is difficult for people to be well informed.  The physical structure of the country calls for the kind of autocratic government Russia has always had.2) Russians are plagued with a superiority/inferiority complex vis-à-vis Europe.  They feel morally superior to the libertine Europeans, but also feel a gnawing inadequacy when confronted with the accomplishments of European science, business, and writers.3) Deceit is built into every stratum of Russian society.  One must not present the truth to one's superiors, lest it cost one's life.  Conversely, those in charge cannot afford to recognize that they are being lied to.  This led to great contradictions within communism, well captured by Alexander Zinoviev in Homo Sovieticus.  The inability to see reality led to Putin's mis-assessment of the consequences of his invasion of Ukraine, summed up by Angela Merkel: he ""lost touch with reality.""4) There is a lack of creativity, of innovation among the Russians, which dooms them to be perpetual imitators.  Entrepreneurship is feared and suppressed, and with it the evolution of business.5) Russians prize order and predictably over freedom.  In fact, they do not know how to exercise freedom, and are happy to submit to a strong master.  Custine goes on at length about how willingly they submitted to one of history's cruelest and most arbitrary despots, Ivan the Terrible.  This is a consequence of the point that....6) Russian tsars enjoy more unlimited power than rulers anywhere else on earth.Enlightenment enthusiasm has led us of the West to believe that all men are brothers under the skin.  Rationalism and technology, it is believed, are not merely products of western thought, but universals the application of which will lead to Fukayama's ""End of History.""It has not worked out that way.  The French have been as deeply committed to this philosophy as any, and have been equally profound in analyzing why it is not true.  Custine's contemporary, Alexis de Tocqueville, is still renowned for his analysis of the then 50-year-old experiment called America.  He saw its much strength.  He also saw the limitations one would face in attempting to replicate American institutions elsewhere, and bravely identified the seeds of America's destruction, the lack of a brake on the liberal impulse to extend the franchise to people who do not contribute to the wealth and well-being of the country.Frenchmen of this era are writing incisive criticisms of contemporary France.  The Problem of Democracy, Convergence of Catastrophes and La France orange mécanique have defined the shortcomings of democracy in the French setting quite well.Here are some quotes from the book that especially appealed to me:""There is not a single man on earth today who enjoys and exercises such power: not in Turkey, not even in China. Imagine the craft of Western governments, tested in lengthy exercise, put to the service of a society that is still young and savage; the departments of our civil service assisting an Oriental despotism with all the experience of modern times; European discipline supporting Asiatic tyranny; the police dedicated to concealing barbarism in order to perpetuate, instead of eradicating it; disciplined brutality and cruelty, and European military tactics serving to fortify the policies of Oriental courts. Imagine a half-savage people who have been regimented, without being civilized: then you will understand the moral and social state of the Russians. """"If there are better diplomats among the Russians than among peoples more advanced in civilization, it is because our newspapers warn them of all that happens and is planned in our country; and that instead of prudently disguising our weaknesses, we are ardent to reveal them every morning; while their Byzantine policies, on the other hand, working in the shadows, carefully conceal from us what is thought, done or anticipated in their country. We step forward in daylight, they advance in the dark: the match is unequal. They leave us blinded by ignorance, while our sincerity enlightens them; we have the weakness of ready speaking, they the strength of secrecy: it is this, above all, that explains their craft. [...]""""An immense and inordinate ambition, one of those that can take seed only in the souls of the oppressed and be nourished by the misfortune of a whole nation, seethes in the breast of the Russian people. Essentially a nation of conquerors, made greedy by privation, its debasing submission expiates, in advance and at home, the hope of exercising dominion over others. The glory and riches it expects are compensation for the shame it endures and, to cleanse himself from the impious sacrifice of all public and individual liberty, the slave dreams, on his knees, that he will dominate the world.""""Russia sees in Europe a prey which will sooner or later be delivered to it by our dissensions. It foments anarchy among us, in the hope that it may take advantage of the corruption it has furthered, in the furtherance of its own ends: this is the history of Poland replayed on a larger scale. For many years Paris has been reading revolutionary newspapers - revolutionary in every sense - financed by Russia. `Europe,' they say in Petersburg, `is following the same path as Poland. It is agitated by empty ideas of liberalism, while we remain powerful, precisely because we have no liberty. Let us be patient in our chains, for we will make others pay the price of our humiliation.'""""However, this overweening power damages itself. Russia will not put up with it for ever; a spirit of rebellion is simmering in the army. I agree with the Tsar: the Russians have travelled too much, the nation is hungry for instruction, the customs house cannot control minds and armies do not exterminate thought or ramparts hinder its advance; it travels underground. Ideas are in the air, they are everywhere, and ideas change the world. The outcome of all this is that the future, the brilliant future of which the Russians dream, does not depend on them; that they have no ideas of their own; and that the fate of this nation of imitators will be decided among nations with ideas of their own. If passions are calmed in the West and unity created between governments and their subjects, the avid desires of the conquering Slavs will become a chimera. Hence the danger of allowing them to intervene in our politics and those of our neighbours.""The French edition is much longer.  The editors claim to have squeezed out a great deal of repetition.  Given the amount that is left, one has to believe that claim an appreciate their efforts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU32GOBJW812X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HO11CMS#wasThisHelpful","RU32GOBJW812X","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The thesis of this book is that the United States is overstretched. The country is spending more than they can afford on defense. We are currently protecting countries which would be better off protecting themselves.  We could defend our national interests with less of an outlay. In fact, reducing our presence elsewhere in the world would reduce the level of antagonism against America.Posen's focus is on conventional military power and conventional strategy and tactics – warfare between states.  His assumption is that the tools and tactics of the existing military will be appropriate to combat the threats he sees, but it is a question of balance.Posen would like to see more military strength focused on ""the commons,"" the oceans, skies, space and the communications sphere, and less on land-based armies.  The United States' greatest assets are its geographic location, isolated, with access to two oceans, and its technology.  It should exploit those.This book anticipates non-state aggression such as that we are observing today (June 2014) in Iraq.  While he proposes countermeasures, he does not anticipate that this will be the major form of threat to be countered.More significant, Posen did not anticipate the ‘hybrid war' being waged in Ukraine. What is special about it is that the new technologies are being used simultaneously, combining hard and soft power.  It is a war of information, disinformation and propaganda; of intelligence and counter-intelligence; cyber warfare; use of highly trained commandos, ""green men"" with no insignia; use of the non-government actors, including business, NGOs, religious organizations, criminals, and private persons; state use of terrorist)tactics using women and children as human shields in attacks on military and civil objects; energy warfare; economic warfare; corruption to compromise the loyalty of the political and military leadership.  It involves the use of bloggers – some might even comment on this review!This hybrid war is designed to frustrate conventional countermeasures.  So far it has enjoyed the ""blitzkrieg"" factor, the advantage that new and unconventional tactics always enjoy for at least a while.Posen introduces two concepts that I find very useful. Cheap riders, similar to free riders, enjoy the benefits of American defense protection without paying the costs. Germany and Japan had this list, although it includes most of Europe.  Reckless drivers are countries that take advantage of the immunity provided by American defense guarantees in order to provoke enemies in ways they should not. Chief among these is Israel, although others such as the Georgia could be named.Posen talks about Liberal hegemony, the world order which emerged after World War II. The United States is the leader of this hegemony, supported by the vast number of supposedly democratic states which depend on the United States for protection and trade relations, and which to some extent or another share in the modern Western culture.In Posen's words ""Despite some important disagreements among its proponents, it is liberal because it aims to defend and promote a range of values associated with Western society in general and U.S. society in particular— including democratic governance within nation-states, individual rights, free markets, a free press, and the rule of law. The spread of these values is not only seen to be good in its own terms, it is seen to be positive, if not essential, for U.S. security.""The United States has worked to expand its Liberal hegemony, attempting to change the fundamental nature of other countries to make them more like itself. This has been a clear failure in the Middle East. The rich countries of the Far East still retain their Confucian or Buddhist character, including their own inscrutable and undemocratic power structures, despite American attempts to impose Western liberalism via constitutions and the so on.In doing so the United States has put a lot of pressure on Russia, Iran, China and other players. Their hostility is in American long-term interests. Dealing with that results in short-term costs.Posen would recommend that we be content to leave people the way they are.Posen's assessment of the United States and the West in general is guardedly optimistic.  He talks about how the crisis of 2008 could easily have provoked a widespread depression, but appears sanguine that the problems are in hand, not merely postponed.  He does not mention the underlying causes, which appear to have only worsened: the demographics of the labor force and dependent populations; levels of national debt; the inability to balance national budgets; the growing disparity between educational attainment and ability on one hand, and labor market needs on the other.The book assumes – it has to assume as a baseline – that the United States loses its relative financial power only gradually.  The book could not factor in ""black swan"" events, although simply given its breadth and time horizon supposedly unpredictable events seem more likely than not.  He is content to note –give him credit, as a man of the center for being this brave, that:"" It is difficult to tell whether the anemic growth, high unemployment, eroding middle class living standards, deteriorating infrastructure, and fiscal imbalances presently plaguing the United States are transitory difficulties or represent some deeper set of structural problems that will continue to erode our economic vitality, and hence our power.""Posen is right to say that America is wrong to project its almost uniquely sectarian culture onto the rest of the world, remaining blind to the fact that""National identities often integrate within them ethnic and religious roots but nationalism is a modern idea. It holds that a group, united by language, history, and culture, should be protected by the power of a state that it controls""He writes that """" Liberal Hegemony cannot rest on its laurels. It is inherently expansionist and seems destined to drift regularly into military action.""  Though Posen does not say as much, this bias towards action is certainly influenced by the political structure of America.  Eisenhower's military-industrial complex remains a powerful player.  He does mention Israel's disproportionate influence on American policy making.His conclusion is a very accurate summary of the book:""In this book I have explained why Liberal Hegemony has not worked particularly well. The strategy has precipitated some balancing by other nation-states and will likely precipitate more as the relative power advantage enjoyed by the United States wanes, and others feel more capable of tilting against the United States. The strategy has made the United States the center of political attention in a world undergoing rapid social, political, and economic change. The United States is sufficiently strong and omnipresent to be blamed by the losers but not strong enough to do much affirmatively to alleviate the stresses and strains that rapid development often causes. The strategy underrates the enduring power of nationalism and the inclination of self-aware peoples to resist direction by outsiders. And the strategy overlooks the extent to which the capacity for organized violence has diffused, rendering even relatively small counterinsurgency efforts hugely expensive. Finally, the strategy leads directly to the issuance of blank security checks to U.S. allies. Some cash the check for increased welfare spending in their own societies, as do the European allies and Japan; they cheap ride. Others cash the check to pay for their own extravagant security adventures; clients as different at Afghanistan and Israel drive recklessly. For all these reasons, Liberal Hegemony has proven an expensive and counterproductive grand strategy.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTCNCK08EK9NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNPMS2A#wasThisHelpful","RTCNCK08EK9NN","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a campaign document.  It is smoothly written, generally kind to people still in power who might be helpful.  It puts the requisite blame on George W. Bush, but does not go overboard in doing so.There are no fresh insights to be found in the areas of interest to me.  She glosses over relations with Russia and Ukraine, without ever getting into the details of the issues.  ""Energy,"" ""repression"" and the standard lexicon suffice in place of any detailed explanation.  I would have been interested in why she thinks NATO is in the interests of Georgia, Ukraine and others, and especially how she thinks that NATO could be effective in resisting Russian aggression in its ""near abroad.""  There is nothing more than refined, erudite Washington words.She artfully gives credit where it is not due.  She credits Obama with the ""surge"" in Afghanistan, whereas my recollection is that he waffled endlessly until his military convinced him it was the right thing to do.  It goes by so quickly, absolutely without explanation, that there is hardly anything to which to take exception.She uses the term Eurasian, a highly prominent word in Putin's vocabulary, only a couple of times.  She is right to say that Putin would like to fence off a very large piece of geography in which Russia happens to be by far the most powerful actor.  He claims that the world needs a counterbalance to America and Europe.  His true agenda, as she notes, is recreating something in the form of the former Russian/Soviet Empire.  With Putin at its center.Of Maidan, she writes that ""Many Ukrainians, especially those living in the capital, Kyiv, and the non-Russian-speaking sections of the country, were inflamed by the about-face. They dreamed of living in a prosperous European democracy, and now they faced the prospect of coming once again under Moscow’s thumb.""  She is half right.  Ukraine is not, never has been and does not want to be Russian.  On the other hand, there is a cultural affinity.  There is fairly widespread appreciation for Putin's stands against Pussy Riot, gay propaganda and immigration.  Ukraine, for the most part, has simply wanted to be left alone.  It will be interesting to see how the country moves under its widely respected, pro-European new president, Poroschenko, who is not mentioned in a book despite the fact that the grab of Crimea is.Clinton's take on Latin America and especially Cuba and Chile is strictly party line.  She, nor anybody else, can afford to say a good word about anybody on the right.  She writes ""The role of the United States in the 1973 coup that brought Pinochet to power and our support for his right-wing regime is a dark chapter in our involvement in the region, but our more recent relationship was strong and productive. Michelle Bachelet, elected in 2006 as Chile’s first woman President, was trained as a pediatrician…""  The fact is that Chile, like all the Southern Cone, was beset by Marxist guerillas during the 1970s.  Chile's MIR faction was especially nasty.  They played a role in communist Salvador Allende's election (in a democratic process, but by a distinct minority) in 1970.  Allende was not effective, and the right, incensed by the electoral loss and increasing chaos, took over in a CIA supported coup.  Pinochet then suppressed the guerillas in a dirty war, put the economy on its feet, and voluntarily stepped aside in favor of a new president in elections which he himself organized.  Picking up the story, as Clinton notes, the current President, Bachelet, is a successor to that process inaugurated by Pinochet.  True, he has the blood of perhaps 3,000 leftists on his hands, leftists whose own hands were already quite bloody.  The question that nobody even asks is whether there has ever been a leftist dictator who left a better legacy?  Or even left power voluntarily?Clinton supports the party platform with regard to climate change.  ” The problems posed by global warming were evident, despite the deniers. There was a mountain of overwhelming scientific data about the damaging effects of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases.  Thirteen of the top fourteen warmest years on record have all come since 2000.  The claim of 13 out of 14 is one that I have not seen elsewhere.  A search of the book does not yield a single reference to the IPCC, the UN panel driving the climate change argument, but even they are chagrined that there has not been much measured change over the past couple of decades.She airily writes that ""…we offered plans to curb emissions, improve energy efficiency, and develop clean energy technologies"" without reference to what would amount to hard choices, such as raising the price of gasoline, and without reference to scandals such as Solyndra.That's my take on the book.  It is a campaign document, very professionally produced, designed not so much to enlighten as to persuade.  My bet is that it will succeed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NK63KTUEJX5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476751471#wasThisHelpful","R2NK63KTUEJX5S","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is not that this philosopher says anything particularly objectionable. It is that how he says it is entirely unintelligible. He talks about the fourth political theory. There is no theory. That is the essence of the book. It is not there, and yet, there is a great need for a theory. Liberalism, as he correctly points out, does not work. Neither did Communism or Fascism. There needs to be a path forward.This book doesn't even deign to dance around the question of a coherent philosophy. It is simply vapid, empty, nothing here.Handing Putin this empty vessel, this vapor in which he can see whatever he chooses, is as dangerous as giving Hitler the German philosophers and romantics such as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Wagner to draw on.  The philosophical underpinning of his aggression against Georgia, Ukraine and the Baltic States seems to be a concept called Eurasianism, one of Dugin's pets.Nonetheless, in the grand tradition of deconstructionism, reading between the lines, trying to make sense out of a text which makes no sense, I am writing a lengthy review.  I am doing this in two parts. This review itself is an overview, a collection of opinions about the work. Because I'm afraid it will be rather tedious, I include chapter summaries as a series of comments.Dugin's writing style is definitely postmodern. Postmodernists do not believe that the text alone can carry meaning, but rather, it has to be deconstructed. They devalue text. Dugin's text certainly should be devalued. It flows on endlessly, without really saying much.To add to the confusion, he employs the common philosopher's trope of pretending that a concept can only be well represented in its original language, which he happens to know, and he will attempt for the sake of the unwashed to explain.  In German he uses the word Dasein, in Russian narod.  Dasein means being, and narod means people.  There are nuances in the languages, but let me assure you as a writer who knows German, Russian and French quite well, more is lost in the obscurity of using the foreign words than could possibly be gained through understanding the nuances.  In this case, language obfuscates rather than clarifies. It does cultivate a certain reverence for the author's erudition, which I suspect is the major purpose.  My English words for the practice include pretense, sophistry, pedantry and rhetoric.  The French poseur and the German Luftmensch would not be amiss.Dugin's bibliography is very extensive. If ever there were an occasion to dismiss dead white males, this is it.  They are mostly philosophers.  The sociologists and anthropologists he cites did their best work in the 19th century.Such a narrow limitation might be justified in some contexts. If I were writing a cookbook, you would expect that most of the bibliography would consist of other cookbooks.  However, the subject here is the condition of man. Dugin is writing about political orders, how should we manage our lives. The science of what people are, how people act, and how we became the way we are is extraordinarily relevant. Yet, all of the people he cites are other philosophers, people few have ever heard of.More strongly, Dugin expressly says that he does not believe in science. The opening of Chapter Two begins ""Being a supporter of cyclical development, and an opponent of Francis Bacon and his theory of knowledge....""Francis Bacon was the father of the scientific method - empiricism. The idea is that in science you form a hypothesis, and then you formulate one or more devices to test to see if the hypothesis is true. Using the scientific method, it is possible to immediately disprove some hypotheses, such as ""bricks always float.""  If you cannot disprove it, you increasingly act on the assumption that it might be true, or is probably true, gaining confidence as it stands the test of time.If you reject Bacon, you not only reject a body of knowledge, you are left without a theory of how you know the things you know.  You are free to make it up.  This book is an exercise in making it up.  Just like Marxism.Like most pure philosophers, Dugin is working in the realm of nice-sounding but untested hypotheses. Marx had a number of theories about how society is organized (rigid social classes) and how people operate (altruistically).  He never put them to a test. When Communism was implemented, it was found that he was radically, gravely wrong on both. Fascists likewise discovered that people don't always put the interest of the state first.  Democracy makes the nave assumptions that people are equal in ability and that they know what is good for themselves.  All are wrong in matters of degree.  There was ample opportunity for Dugin to say something useful, but he missed it.Never putting his ideas to the test, Dugin, for instance, is able to believe that racism is bad but ethnos, believing in your own people, is good.  His Eurasia theme is based on the notion that peoples within a ""civilization"" have common interests and should be mutually supportive.  A quick mental survey of the real world reveals this to be nonsense.  His arguments beg for examples, none of which he provides.The great danger and Dugin is this his work might be taken as the foundation for political philosophy by the likes of Vladimir Putin. It has never been tested - it is only a collection of ideas that might look good on paper. To rush them into practice without testing them is the heart of folly. Yet, it is exactly that kind of folly which ushered in Communism and Fascism in the 20th century, and almost every lame brained school reform in history. One must be wary.It is as if a vast number witch doctors all wrote books on how to cure patients of their various ills. They all reference one another's increasingly fantastic descriptions of incantations and potions, but none of them reference actual patient cases, and none have a track record of curing anything.  So why should we believe philosophers who do nothing except quote other philosophers? Philosophy has to be tied to real life.Dugin doesn't have a thing to say about the evolutionary psychologists, sociobiologists, geneticists and other living scientists who are investigating what man is and how he came to be the way he is.  Dennett, Dawkins, E. O. Wilson, Pinker, Ridley and Nicholas Wade are nowhere to be found. These are the scientists have earned their wings expanding the realm of human knowledge and gone on to write a bit of philosophy. They earned their place on the podium from which they can talk with authority about the nature of man.  Moreover, the average literate person has actually heard of some of them.Contrast this with the pure philosophers of our age, people like Richard Rorty, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and now Dugin. They refer mainly to each other. Each has a hard core of advocates - it would not be amiss to call them nuts, like Marx' Bolsheviks - who absolutely revere them. However, the mainstream thinkers, and academics, don't know or care who they are. This obscurity is merited. These people haven't contributed anything lasting to the world of ideas. They contribute conflicting opinions, but opinions without substance, opinions that cannot be validated, but can only be argued in coffee houses amongst the navel-gazing circle of philosophers.What about the ideas in the book?  Here are some of the major themes.The world has seen three major political theories since the Enlightenment: liberalism, Communism and Fascism.  They appeared in that order and are disappearing in reverse order.  Dugin sweepingly writes that liberalism exalts the individual, Communism the social class, and Fascism the state.  Even in theory that is an oversimplification.  In actuality, with which Dugin rarely troubles himself, the latter two have only been implemented as dictatorships.  His definition of liberalism embraces every manifestation from Hayek and Friedman's libertarianism to modern state socialism.The key features of liberalism, per Dugin, are that it is all about the individual, not the state, the people, or presumably family.  Tribes and races are irrelevant, and have no claim on the individual.  People own private property, and they are bound, even in government, by contract.  Free markets dominate.Liberalism has expanded into globalization.  Dugin universally condemns globalization.  To me this means a global marketplace for goods, both tangible and intangible, services, media and cultural artefacts.  I searched the book in vain for a similar description by Dugin.  Anyhow, to him it is bad.  It is bad mainly because it is driven by the archfiend of the unipolar world (two of his words), America.This is one of many areas in which I long to agree with Dugin, but find nothing concrete to which I can say, ""Yes!""  I resent that the traditional fairy tales have been replaced by Disney; that my neighbors' kids are learning English by watching the awful TV show Monster High; that manufacturing is having a hard time getting a foothold in Ukraine because the Chinese do it so cheaply, and Western banks make credit difficult.  Why couldn't Dugin come up with such a list himself, to illustrate the ills of globalization?Dugin celebrates the narod (народ - Russian for people, folk, ethnicity, any of which terms would work just fine) and the civilization.  Here he uses Huntington's categorization of civilizations: Western (US, Canada, Western Europe), Chinese, Japanese, Islamic, Indian, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and African.  His vaunted Eurasia, the counterweight to America and the EU, has the Slavic-Orthodox civilization at its center.  He forces himself into two tight spots.First, he posits that there is a commonality of interest within each civilization.  He fails to notice that the one civilization which seems to have united, the European Union, is fraying badly.  He also ignores the fact that the other unions seem stillborn.  Arab countries are wary of each other.  Latin American countries still nurse grudges dating back to the 19th century War of the Pacific and War of the Triple Alliance.  The Chinese and Vietnamese are at each other's throats, and his own Eurasia is having great difficulty pulling itself together even as a weak customs union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia.Ukraine has made it abundantly clear it wants no part of Russia, especially not being part of Russia.  That has been done before, and it was miserable. Perhaps as a sop to Putin, Dugin writes ""The Western border of the Eurasianist civilisation goes somewhat more East of the Western border of the Ukraine , making that newly-formulated government a fortiori fragile and not viable.""Most of Ukraine speaks Russian, it is true.  Just like English in Ireland, it was forced on them.  Many Ukrainians were exiled to the Russian Far East, where they had to speak it.  Quite a few Russians were resettled in Ukraine.  Moreover, Russian is a world language, like it or not.Language is not a reliable measure of the people's sentiment.  Their national symbols are a better indication.  Ukraine's symbol is the Cossack, fighting against all odds to be free.  Russia's is the bear, smothering everything in its tyrannical embrace.  Russia's attempts to Russify Ukraine first by charm, then starvation and then dilution have all failed.  Today, even the eastern oblasts, what Putin wants to call ""New Russia,"" are showing little enthusiasm for Putin's attempt to force it into Russia proper through the terrorism of the ""little green men,"" Russian soldiers without insignia and mercenaries he has smuggled over the border.  No, the border of Eurasia, if such exists, runs along Ukraine's eastern border.One of Dugin's intellectual comrades in arms, and a man who has written something intelligible, is Alain de Benoist.  I give a good review to his The Problem of Democracy.  Tellingly, de Benoist supports the opinion that Ukraine is its own country and ought to be left alone.The second point he misses is that the named civilizations map more or less to races, which he would like to pretend don't exist.  Nicholas Wade, tracing the evolution of man, says that all other races split from the Africans 50,000 years ago; Europeans from Asians 30,000, Amerindians from Asians 15,000 years back, and Indians and Semitic peoples from Europeans about the time of the agricultural revolution, the Japanese from Chinese somewhat more recently.  Per Harpending and Cochran, evolution has been especially rapid in the last 10,000 years, resulting in differences in physiognomy, temperament and other mental qualities among the different ""civilizations.""  If you catch the drift of the previous sentence, I can narrow down which civilization you might belong to.  If you are offended, I know exactly which one.  Anyhow, peoples, however you choose to label them, think differently.The book ends with a whimper.  Without ever saying what he is for, Dugin lamely concludes the book with a paragraph about what he is against:  ""But there are some who think otherwise. Who are aligned against such a project? Those who want to impose uniformity, the one (American) way of life, One World. And their methods are force, temptation, and persuasion. They are against multipolarity. So they are against us.""As promised, I will add comments detailing the chapters.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TVQAKTFLZ651/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907166653#wasThisHelpful","R2TVQAKTFLZ651","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glenn Greenwald was approached by Edward Snowden in December of 2012.  They finally met in Hong Kong in June of 2013. Why the long delay?Most important was the question of security. Snowden had to be sure that their communication could be secured, and he knew very well the many ways in which it could be compromised. He attempted to coach Greenwald on the intricacies of encrypted email, and was ultimately not able to do so.In the meantime Snowden contacted another journalist whom he trusted, Laura Poitras, and she and Greenwald eventually found themselves together with Snowden in Hong Kong, where he revealed his identity.The meeting in Hong Kong took place despite several obstacles. The administrative and legal apparatus of the Guardian newspaper, and other publications involved slowed things down, imposed administrative hurdles, and threatened the anonymity of Snowden himself. Even after it became clear what a huge story that was, the self-protective instincts of the publications involved delayed publication time after time.It came down to fear versus greed: eventually, the Guardian's greed for a monumental scoop overcame its fear of legal consequences and they were the first to publish. The first article was on the ways in which the NSA had compromised Verizon and other telecommunications companies, forcing them to reveal metadata collected on not only foreigners but US citizens. The second article, the following day, was on the PRISM program, which compromised virtually all of the major Internet providers in the United States, forcing them to give the NSA backdoor access to Internet traffic.The book is very much about the media itself. The message is that government intimidation has been effective in restricting what the media will report. This is an era in which media holdings have become increasingly consolidated. They have much more the character of business, and less interest in investigative reporting, especially stories that are adverse to government. Greenwald is especially hard on the two publications that hold themselves out to be at the vanguard of investigative journalism, the New York Times and the Washington Post. To a large extent they are captive of the government they are supposed to keep honest.Snowden was unusual as a source in that he was a patently intelligent, rational, balanced human being. It would be hard to tar him with the same brush as Julian Assange and Bradley Manning. He had had extraordinarily wide access, and in fact had come to the conclusion that the NSA's activity had to be exposed a couple of years prior to actually revealing it. This gave him time to change jobs, taking a pay cut to join Booz Allen in a position which would give him access to more complete data on the story that he wanted to tell.Once the Guardian newspaper appreciated what they had, they at least offered him protection and they released the story in the sequence and the style that Snowden had requested. It was calculated to have a maximum of impact, the maximum leverage to awaken the world public to the dangers being posed to their privacy. Snowden intended the story to minimize his own personality. He knew from observation that there would be vituperative attacks against his person, and he wanted to make the data itself the story. That is why he chose Greenwald and Portias to tell it.Part of the plan was to reveal Snowden as the source after the first few stories were published. Once this was done, the rest of the media quickly figured out he was in Hong Kong and descended on his hotel. It was a scene of chaos, and Snowden escaped with a disguise, going to save houses in Hong Kong and rather shortly thereafter attempting to escape to Latin America via Russia. That plan being foiled, he remained in Russia. The book does not concern itself at all with his exile there.Chapter 4 delves into the breadth of NSA surveillance and the need for it. The NSA's stated objective, per the book, is to read absolutely every communication throughout the world, giving themselves the power to sift through them. This is done in the name of thwarting terrorism, although there is little evidence given anywhere that the NSA has been effective in satisfying this mission. What they have managed to do, quite successfully, is to dampen criticism of governments. They make citizens reluctant to join movements such as Occupy Wall Street or the Tea Party which threatened the powers that be.Chapter 5 documents Greenwald's own treatment in the year since the story came out, and especially the way that members of the media, David Gregory by name, attacked his standing as a journalist and his right to protect his sources and publish the documents he received.  Both the United States government and the British government have been quite severe in their treatment of him, and abusive in their treatment of the Guardian newspaper which published him.Snowden has taken refuge in Russia. He cannot be at ease with what the Russian government has done in Ukraine, but on the other hand, this book documents the growth of a totalitarian mentality within the supposed democracies of the West. It begs the question of how different Putin really is. We would like to think that the West is a citadel of democratic values and protections. This book tells quite a different story.I followed this story from a distance as it unraveled, not wanting to waste time following the personal drama involved.  Although written in the first person, clearly from his individual perspective, I found that it filled in the story as I knew it quite well, and provided a plausible account of both actors and actions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18EWR87U936RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0CZX0G#wasThisHelpful","R18EWR87U936RY","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought What's Going On In There as a reference for evolutionary biology. I wanted to know specifically about the evolution of speech.I got much more than I bargained for. It is a book by an evolutionary biologist about how children form.  It is from her perspective as a parent.  She interprets observations about her own children in light of her lab experience and reading.She talks in general about the evolution of the nervous system throughout the history of life, coming really quickly to the primates, giving a brief summary of the seven million years since we parted from our primate ancestors. We still have a lot in common with them, to which she stresses throughout the book. We have likewise changed quite a bit. In particular, our brains are four times the weight of those of our nearest relatives, chimpanzees. That additional functionality has gone mostly into the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain which is far more developed in humans than every other animal.An infant is born with his brain far from fully formed. There are more neurons there than will ever be used, but the connections among them are still few and unformed. The first couple of years of life are dedicated to making connections that will be needed and eliminating neurons that are not.What is needed of course depends on the child's environment.  With regard to language, neural paths needed to recognize and produce the ambient language are strengthened; unused sounds are not supported.  A child with obvious deficiencies such as eyes or ears that don't work will not need the corresponding parts of the brain; the neurons that would be dedicated to seeing or hearing are eliminated.  The same is true, unfortunately, for certain social genes. The child learns to be social by socializing, and the corresponding behavioral parts of our brains develop as they do.Post-natal wiring is an economical way of allowing a highly evolved animal to emerge from the birth canal in a small package.  All the parts are there, but it is not fully assembled.  The multi-year self-assembly process is both genetic – prewired – and epigenetic, depending on the environment in which the child finds himself.One of the most interesting chapters deals with adverse impacts on the foetus during pregnancy. Substance abuse, the wrong pills, unfortunate infections, everything that can affect the growing baby. There are a vast amount of old wives tales on the subject, and it is a delight to find the relevant data on most conceivable conditions in one place from an authoritative source.She hardly addresses abnormalities due to faulty sperm, citing only lead exposure.  The more obvious risks on the father's side have to do with not getting pregnant in the first place.  It only makes sense that what the mother does before and during pregnancy has a greater effect than what the father may have done beforehand.  Whichever gamite may have been responsible, most nonviable fetuses are spontaneously aborted in early pregnancy.She goes into some length about the malformation of the neural tube which results in anencephala – the lack of a brain – and spina bifida.  There are quite specific measures to take against the occurance of these deformities.With regard to language learning, my topic of interest, the brain is wired to acquire language on a prescribed schedule. She credits Jean Piaget with mapping the developmental calendar of a newborn, and emphasizes that every infant of virtually every race follows pretty much same sequence of developmental steps.  The first things that sound like words may appear shortly before a year, and by the age of 2 ½ they are speaking in sentences. These are sentences that they earnestly understand, whether or not the parents do as well.  They are working hard to mimic what they hear. They love to make sound, and they love to repeat sentences, very consciously practicing to get the sound right.I highly recommend this book to any parent or parent-to-be.  It is full of practical advice on how to maximize your baby's intelligence and sociability.  She repeats the conventional wisdom in support of breast feeding, and goes on at length about the benefits of physical contact, and especially massage.  My toddler son loves it, I am happy to say, and it is my conviction that early and frequent interaction with me is an important way to form his conception of himself as a man and future husband and father.A five-star effort throughout.  Easy to read and valuable at every step.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQ9L3CZT48DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SEK4L8#wasThisHelpful","R1UQ9L3CZT48DX","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicholas Wade is a science writer, not a scientist himself. His genius is to survey what is going on on the frontiers of science, collect reports from many different frontiers, and compile a composite picture of what is happening in the world.This is ostensibly a book about the science of human evolution.  Whatever its intent, it will be treated, or rather, egregiously mistreated, as a political screed.  The era of free scientific inquiry which began with the Enlightenment is pretty much at an end.  Most scientific questions of our age - global warming, the nature of human sexuality, and certainly human evolution - have implications for public policy.  Powerful interests have a vast stake in the status quo.  Wade is like Galileo challenging the Pope or Darwin challenging creationists.  Government is the establishment church of our era, with acolytes in the educational establishment and the press.  Wade has to believe fervently in the truth to summon the bravery to challenge them by writing this book.Wade is self-aware.  Rather than adopt the stance of a disinterested scientist, he acknowledges the abuse he expects, from which quarters, and why.  He inoculates himself in two ways.  First, he goes into great detail with regard to the treatment meted out to the sociobiologists and intelligence researchers by government, academia and the press.  Secondly, quixotically, he has chosen to attack some figures like Stephen Pinker  who would seem most support his arguments, and laud the expertise of others like Acemoglu and Robinson who are politically correct down to their toenails.  He seems to be claiming, ""See, I'm one of you.""  I can guarantee him, this puny amulet will not ward off the witch hunters.  He would have been better not to try.His topic is human evolution, and especially, the implications of the past couple of decades' research in genetics.  His main points are:(1) There is genetic validity to the traditional classification of mankind into five continentally-based races.  The dates at which the breeding populations separated can be fairly well established.  A small band left Africa about 50,000 years ago.  Some of them arrived in Australia 46,000 years ago, after which they remained isolated.  They founded the New Guinea/Australian race.  Others headed north into the heart of Eurasia, splitting 30,000 years ago into Europeans and East Asians.  Amerindians form the fifth major race: they split from the East Asians about 15,000 years ago.  These findings confirm work done some decades ago by Cavalli-Sforza and Spencer Wells using more primitive means.(2) Humans have evolved more dramatically in latent characteristics, their temperament, intellect, aggressiveness/passivity, and work ethic, than in their visual characteristics.  He draws useful comparisons with the evolution of our domestic animals.  Moreover, the genome co-evolves with culture.  The Chinese genome is adapted to Chinese culture, for instance.  Wade has a highly useful chapters on the Jews, drawing mostly from Harpending and Cochran, though (to my surprise) not Kevin MacDonald.(3) Human evolution accelerated after the exodus from Africa.  Darwin's theory of evolution posits that changes in environment put selection pressure on any species, favoring some alleles over others.  Inhabiting cold climes, collaborative hunting, and warfare using weapons placed immense evolutionary pressure on Homo sapiens hunter/gatherers.(4) Evolution accelerated even more after the invention of agriculture.  Hunter/gatherers had lived in communities of up to 150 people, not many more than our chimp-like ancestors of five million years back.  All of a sudden we began living in cities, engaging in trade, specializing as craftsmen, and organizing large-scale governmental structures and wars.  The cognitive and social skills required were immense, as was the selective pressure.Some exciting science that is new to me with this book is Wade's identification of genes that are under significant selective pressure today.  There are about 200 genes in each of the major racial groups: Europeans, East Asians, and Africans.  Only a few of them overlap: for the most part, evolution is following a separate path within each race.""How can you know?"" is the big question.  Geneticists are generally confined to the DNA of living people.  Wade's discussion of the way the genome evolves is scientific deduction at its best.  Groups of physically adjacent genes are generally passed on as a group.  If one of them is beneficial, the others come along as free riders.  Measuring the incidence of free riders points scientists to the genes under selection.Wade advances the novel theory that there have been two breakthroughs in evolution over the course of our civilized history: the move to settled habitations, and the industrial revolution.Settlement is generally agreed, although Wade adds some interesting detail.  We began sedentary life about 15,000 years ago, well before the beginning of agriculture and pastoralism.  There were advantages to living together, but it took a lot of evolutionary time for the genome to change enough that we could live and work together to the extent required for the next step.Building up to the industrial revolution, Wade draws extensively on the work of economic historian Gregory Clark of the University of California at Davis.  Clark's research into historical records in England reveals that violence decreased systematically and markedly during the decades from 1200 to 1800.  In this he echoes Stephen Pinker.  At the same time, the general levels of intelligence rose.  First, richer people had more children.  Second, because population was static, those people regressed in social status, bringing their intelligence down to the common ranks.  Third, literacy and other indirect measures of intelligence grew steadily.Though Wade documents this phenomenon in England, he implies that it happened as well throughout Europe.  The mechanisms in East Asia were different - the Mandarin system of competitive examinations, among other things - but the result was similar in terms of intellect.  The result in terms of culture and temperament -related factors - was different in Asia, a topic Wade investigates towards his conclusion.There is much more to say, but readers weary of excessively long reviews.  I've posted comments with other observations for those who are interested.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPKRPOUBXAWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L7VFM#wasThisHelpful","RRPKRPOUBXAWR","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It addresses the various Christian thinkers of the time, Niebuhr and Tillich among others, and the tensions between their thinking and that of more conservative Christians on one side and a secular society on the other.His central thesis is that the 1950s was the last decade in which most Americans believed that there could be an American consensus, a common set of American values and beliefs which would be recognized if not embraced by all Americans.European Protestants had dominated America from the time of the founding. Marsden finds them to have been somewhat overzealous in excluding Catholics, Jews, and of course other religions from the American consensus. The descendants of American Protestant founders pretty much ran things.Marsden cites the rise of intellectualism as a defining phenomenon of the 1950s. He is certainly right to the extent that European intellectuals were widely discussed in American contexts. The French existentialists, Sartre and Camus, were popular among the beatniks and the high school students I hung with in Berkeley. Although, as Marsden points out, though the 1950s represented a high watermark in church attendance, those attendees were more of our parents' generation than our own is also correct in saying that our Christianity was held alongside of a belief that the founding fathers had more or less set things up right, and that the discoveries of science would somehow prove to be compatible with the two. It did not work out that way.My view from Berkeley is that the Jewish influence on American intellectual life in this decade was far stronger than Marsden would credit. They were not simply starting to make inroads - they were dominant. Everybody read Mortimer Adler, Walter Lippmann, and a host of other Jewish columnists and pundits. It was the apex of our belief in the science of psychiatry. Woody Allen, Mike Nichols, Elaine May and a host of other Jewish actors both celebrated and spoofed it. The intellectuals loved Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce, and in music it was Tom Lehrer -- I can still recall the lyrics of many of his songs.  David Gelernter claims that they pretty much took over academia in this decade. I was a math major at Berkeley, and the professors I remember seem to have been Jewish.Kevin MacDonald writes that the Jews, not by design but as a matter of an unarticulated evolutionary strategy, supported causes which chipped away at the beliefs of the Protestant governing class. They ridiculed the red scare at the time, primitives like Joe McCarthy. Marsden does as well. It turns out that there was some substance to the fear that communists spies were attempting to infiltrate America and form American thinking. We have this from not only American historians but former Soviet historians. There is no doubt, however, that McCarthy was a bit of a buffoon and a political opportunist. Is being partially right is not a defense of his behavior.Marsden judges the civil rights movement as an idea whose time had come. As MacDonald points out, supporting the civil rights movement allowed American liberals to occupy the moral high ground and push defenders of traditional values into an indefensible position. White Southerners were charged as irredeemable racists. Marsden repeats the claim. A prominent Swede, Gunnar Myrdal, was invited to America in the 1940s by the Carnegie foundation to study race relations. Myrdal arrived with absolutely no former exposure to people of different races, but no shortage of opinions, and cranked out a 1500 page volume entitled ""An American Dilemma"" prescribing what the liberals thought should be done. He was correct in pointing out that continuing to treat citizens differently based on their color was absolutely unsupportable either legally or practically. He was naïve in assuming that if the legal bars were removed, the two populations would behave more or less identically. This has not been the case. As an interesting aside, modern Sweden is grappling with these issues today. As written in The Swedish Story: From extreme experiment to normal nation, their liberal convictions led them to invite large numbers of African refugees, who have not turned out to be model Swedes.In retrospect, it could well be that Southerners understood better than Northerners, who did not have the experience living in a racially mixed society, the kinds of problems that might arise from the relaxation of segregation. However, it was morally indefensible, and the mainstream press and activists made sure everybody understood that. Marsden seems unwilling to acknowledge that there are differences among the races, a fact which can be readily confirmed by a look at South Africa today, and every country in the Americas and Europe in which there are substantial African minorities. The moral way to reconcile the differences is a legitimate topic of discussion. Not to recognize the differences, as the liberals in the 1950s just like liberals today refused to do, only allowed problems to perpetuate themselves.  Bull Connor, whatever his faults, would not have had to deal with flash mobs and polar bear hunting.Returning to Marsden's theme, the decade of the 1950s witnessed the beginning of a soon-to-be large rift between white liberals and conservatives. That rift was defined along religious grounds - secular humanists versus religious fundamentalists - and also by geography, increasingly the coasts versus the flyover states. Marsden's history does a good job of documenting the growth, and the politicization of conservative Christianity. There was a growing conflict of fundamental values. Conservatives claimed that they were the legitimate heirs of the founding fathers, sustaining their beliefs in individual self-reliance and freedom. Liberals might claim the same, pointing to the founders' non-dogmatic theism and belief in science.Marsden exaggerates the unifying power of a common enemy, the Soviet Union. Already in the 1950s, in fact, dating from the 1920s, there was fairly widespread sympathy for the Soviets among liberals. A great many on college campuses believed that the communist threat was overblown. This became expressed in popular culture through the folk singers who came on the scene in the end of the 50s. Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Woody Guthrie, Peter Paul and Mary, and a host of others were quite dedicated liberals, and they contributed a great deal to the split between conservatives and liberals.Science turned out not to be the liberating force it had been hoped to be since the days of the European enlightenment. Physics and chemistry did not inform political arguments, although nuclear physicist certainly came down on both sides of the political questions surrounding the atomic bomb. In the social sciences, liberals rallied to the side of the anthropologists such as France Boaz and Margaret Mead, and the science of psychiatry. Liberals place a great deal of faith in the propositions that the talking cure could remedy our psychic ills, that medicines like lithium could cure whatever was physiologically based, and that education, which some would have liked to call a science, could bridge the gap between the races in terms of educational achievement, income, and criminality. Conservatives were more inclined to line up with the intelligence researchers, and later the sociobiology movement, which believes in more fundamental differences among men.Marsden's conclusion is unsatisfying. He dwells at length on a Dutch politician named Kuyper who managed to reconcile all of these conflicting interests and beliefs in the Holland of the turn of the 20th century. His apparent hope is that we can somehow turn back the clock, forget our differences, and once again find some sort of an American consensus. I am more pessimistic.As Marsden points out, religious belief and science cannot easily coexist. Even in the 1950s it was possible only by rigorously delimiting the spheres in which each could operate. As the consensus on religious issues dissolved, the only common ground could be sought in the area of science. Even at that, liberals and conservatives managed to find their own scientists and disagree in that sphere as well. Even more to the point, fewer and fewer educated people anymore accept the major religious dogmas such as virgin birth and so on. They are following the path of the groundbreaking Protestant theologians of the 50s in rejecting that which is hard to believe, but rather than rationalize some set of spiritual foundation for their lives, they are not retaining much of any religious belief at all.The tenets that are held with religious fervor today have nothing to do with religion itself. These include the belief in global warming, the belief in the inevitability and propriety of homosexuality, the belief in the absolute equality of the sexes, the belief that genetically modified organisms are deadly, and the belief that tap water is bad for your health. There is also widespread belief in propositions about what we owe our fellow man. Following the UN charter on human rights, we believe that everybody is entitled to health care, a decent job, and an adequate retirement income.  These beliefs are more easily held when somebody else is paying... as is increasingly the case and Western Europe and the United States. As mainstream Protestant theology has shifted its focus from the spiritual well-being of mankind to physical well-being, that is, come to side with the liberals, it has become more and more the province of coastal elites and the beneficiaries of their belief system, immigrants and minorities. Meanwhile, middle-class white Christians turn more and more to fundamentalism, and as they attempt to define what they would like to prevail in their own lives - stable families, grandchildren, no drugs or abortion - they also attempt to force their views on others. There is less and less compromise between the sides. And, in a paradigm shift, they have less and less to do with anything that has traditionally been held as religious belief.  Christianity may serve as more of a marker than a belief.This is a long review - an essay in response to a very thought-provoking book. I would recommend that anyone reading this review ask themselves whether or not the topics discussed are of interest. If they are, read the book. It is extremely well written, with an absolutely fantastic bibliography. If, as I rather suspect, most of the issues raised here have nothing to do with your religious or philosophical beliefs, then this book is probably not relevant. The issues will be sorted out by brute force in the realm of politics, not by polite discussion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R57VAL967DGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465030106#wasThisHelpful","R1R57VAL967DGR","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book because I had questions about what was possible with 3-D printing. This book gave a pretty good overview of what it can do, who the players are in the industry, and the prospect of future developments.So these are the questions that I had:What materials can it work with? The answer is that 3-D printing is most commonly done with plastics. The printhead melts plastic and applies it layer by layer to form a solid three-dimensional object. This is useful for forming models or creating die casts. One limitation of the process is that since each layer must be supported by the one underneath, a figure in which one part descends below everything else must be supported by props of one sort or another.  You could build a cow from the legs up, but the udder would need a support.  This doesn't seem like a tremendous shortcoming.  Other limitations of plastic (melting temperature, hardness, and the fact that it is only a single material) are more significant.What materials can be printed? For the time being, plastics are the most common. Ceramic and metal powders are also printed.  They are suspended in a binder material which holds the work together as it is created.  The end product is about 40% binder, 60% target material; brittle and infirm.  Additional steps are used to remove the binder and infuse the product with metal (or whatever) to create a durable, solid product.In some cases, plastics and metals can be applied in other than powdered form.  They can both be melted.  Certain liquid plastics can be ""cured"" optically, hardened by the application of light.  One process has refined this to the level of individual photons; it can create incredibly detailed models.  The limitations are again in the materials: they have plastic's inherent weaknesses, and they are expensive.It appears to be difficult for the time being to mix multiple materials in the same 3-D printed object. This limitation is being overcome to some extent.  Nonetheless, there was no indication that it was now possible, or would ever be possible, to print such complex devices as a motor with insulated electrical windings, or even a ball bearing. It seems that the tight tolerances, the need for lubricants or bushings and so on would make these things impossible to render with today's technology.What is it used for today? Models, such as those to test the aerodynamic properties of race cars, prototypes so that people can look at what you propose in a design, casting masters for lost wax type for sand casting of metal parts, and direct manufacture of a few types of parts.One of the problems with almost all 3-D printing is that it is slow. Just as an inkjet printer is slower than a LaserJet, the 3-D printing processes described here pretty much involved moving a single printhead back and forth over an area. It has to traverse two dimensions at a time, and is stepped up through the third dimension layer after layer. The process is therefore quite time-consuming in all of the methods described.There is one exception, which is to do laser type printing of different layers, and then use a physical glue to put them together. This is mentioned as sort of an afterthought; it is not really 3-D printing.The idea of printing living tissue into three dimensions is also mentioned. How they do it is not. We know that skin grafts and some other tissues can be grown fairly effectively in laboratories and then applied pressure. Presumably, undifferentiated skin cells could be applied by some sort of a printing process.  It seems unlikely that more complex organs could be grown. They did not discuss, and I cannot imagine how one would devise something as complex as a kidney using this process. The cells within such organs are differentiated, and at this point in time 3-D printing is not able to deal with so many different materials. Perhaps they could do it by using the same cellular material and trigger different gene expressions, making the RNA generate different types of cells. They are doing some fairly magical things in biotech, but this would seem to me to be on the outer fringes.It is well-known that there are plans downloadable from the Internet for printing firearms using 3-D printing. It does not seem to me from reading this book that it would be possible to put together rifles with rifled barrels, the kind of thing that would yield an accurate and reliable weapon. One can conceive that you could create a chamber and a barrel capable of receiving a round of ammunition and firing it. But it seems unlikely that it would be nearly the quality of a machine manufactured rifle.That is my take away from this whole thing. There are a lot of manufactured items in today's world, but relatively few of them are simple enough to be readily adapted to today's 3-D printing technology. It does not have the ability to deal with a large number of different materials, and does not have the ability to give those materials the physical properties that one needs for most manufactured items.3-D will be useful for the things issues for now, models. It will be useful for producing one-off parts, such as a transmission gear for a 1941 Ford. If you can describe it in a computer what is supposed to look like, and it can be made out of solid steel, it would be something that would lead itself to 3-D printing. Producing the entire transmission would not seem to be possible, because it would not be able to produce the bearings/bushings and other such parts.My take as a technology investor is a 3-D printing will continue to grow in applications. There will be some fairly substantial annual growth among the companies in the industry. However, it will never come to a sudden, revolutionary adaptation of 3-D printing, resulting in instant fortunes of the type made on such companies as Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco and Facebook. This is an industry for the long slog. It employs a lot of great people, and there is a lot of innovation, but no single innovation is likely to arrive that will have dramatic industrywide repercussions.As far as home use goes, despite the author's enthusiasm, it is hard for this reviewer to envision a compelling reason to own one of these. I compare it to the color printer. I didn't get a color printer until they were cheap enough that it was a choice of why not.  This is unlike the laser printer.  I and many others ditched our dot matrix printers for lasers the moment we could, in the 1980s.  It filled a major preexisting need, and HP made a fortune.  I don't see that here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQWIR0WXW6PM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CNPF0ZK#wasThisHelpful","R2EQWIR0WXW6PM","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charles Hugh Smith claims that explaining things is his great gift. He has a genius for surveying a body of human activity, summarize it in bullet points, and present the bullet pointed list of the implications.Two years ago I was attracted to his ""Why things are Falling Apart and What We Can Do about it."" It was a very solid analysis of the problems that beset the governments of the Western world, especially the United States, and a prescription of steps that might be taken to alleviate problems. Since then he has restricted his scope a bit. It is no longer ""what we can do about them"" but ""what you can do about them."" Smith has accepted the reality of the fact that a person who would buy and read his books is above average. He will probably achieve success by virtue of those characteristics that set him above the common man.  Therefore, rather than preach to the common man in the hopes that they will come to their senses, he now offers advice to individuals with regard to how to cope with the world as it is, common men included.This volume builds on Smith's theses in ""The Nearly Free University and The Emerging Economy: The Revolution in Higher Education.""  The American system of higher education, like that of most of the world, was established decades or centuries ago.  The rationale was that education had to be centralized because (1) educational resources, primarily books, were scarce and expensive, (2) education had to be delivered in person, and (3) communication and transportation were slow, so students and educators had to be in the same place.Higher education created a cartel.  They control a scarce commodity, a credential called the ""University Diploma,"" which is perceived as necessary for a person to advance into the workplace.  They perpetuate the misconception that this credential is some kind of a testament to the capability and attainments of the graduate.  Not only is this not true, but it has become increasingly less true as more and more students, increasingly less qualified students, are funneled through the system.  The price of tuition has risen much faster than inflation, at the same time that actual learning has diminished.  This is an overripe field for the kind of creative destruction that the Internet has brought to so many other fields, such as travel, law and newspaper publishing.Every sector in which expenses, especially compensation, has grown out of proportion is ripe for ""creative destruction.""  Costs that cannot be sustained will not be sustained.  Health care, government and K-12 education are massively inefficient.  Rather than calling for reform, as he has in previous books, Smith merely warns his readers to avoid these sectors of the economy.  Just because some Newport Beach lifeguards have been able to retire at 50 with a $100,000 pension does not mean that one should look for that job today.  No – that particular sinecure has been bled dry.  The tax and tuition money is simply not there to support historical growth trends in government, medicine and education.  An S curve graph depicts the birth, growth and stagnation of just about any field of endeavor.  Higher education was in the growth phase of the S curve right after the war, when there were lots of returned servicemen and a great demand for educated workers.  It has now peaked.  College has an unsupportably high cost structure, and many graduates, mired in debt, cannot find professional jobs.Smith's point is that people need to take charge of their lives: education, career, and personal lives.  At the most fundamental level, people should not pay you unless your work offers them value.  This is self-evidently true of paper boys, tax preparers and auto repairmen.  If they can't fix your car, you don't hire them.The fields to avoid are those in which the consumer has no choice.  In public education, the parents have little choice over the teacher.  Under socialized medicine, they have little control over the doctor or the costs.  It is all controlled by bureaucracies.  The bureaucracies must eventually collapse of their own weight and become unable to support all of the deadwood, employees who add no value.  It may be a long time coming – and in that time the overpaid, deadwood employee is stultified by unfulfilling work and, due to being overpaid, not free to easily find something more satisfying.  There is a reason why postmen ""go postal"" and teachers burn out.  They feel trapped.This book includes a number of useful lists.  Here is what he says about professionalism.Commit yourself to continuing to learnApply your knowledge as you master a subjectBe adaptable, responsible and accountable.Take ownership of your work.Learn to work collaboratively.Master the art of communicating, orally, in writing, and via numbers and graphics.Continue to build your networks.Lastly, the only technical mastery in the list: learn to keep and to read financial and project management records.Smith offers a number of suggestions for building your networks, building your value to an employer or client.  The take-home message is that every individual must take charge of his or her own life.  Institutions that claim to have an interest in your personal development generally do not.  They, and their employees, are more interested in their own success than yours.  Learn to look for opportunities to excel, how to present yourself so that you are given the opportunity, and how to take credit for your successes in a way that you can pass on to other prospective clients and employers.A five-star book.  My only caveat is the obvious one.  The majority of people do not have the innate talent to follow his advice.  Of those who do, a majority will still look for the easy way out, a steady job rather than taking charge of their career.  It leaves room for those who really want to succeed – Smith's readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5S9QPHLFP60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJX2KZM#wasThisHelpful","R2E5S9QPHLFP60","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read many of the authors  Fitch cites, enough to appreciate that he has pulled together a remarkable synthesis of thinking in the field of language evolution.  His message is that the field is vastly complex.  Language doesn't fossilize.  Neither do the soft organs that produce it.  What researchers have to work with are hard fossils – bones – and what they can deduce from observing modern populations and languages.The book does not deal with events since the dawn of civilization, the agricultural revolution.  After a concise but very well done recapitulation of evolution from the emergence of life, 3.5 billion or so years ago, through the time of our Last Common Ancestor (LCA) with the chimpanzees, it builds on theories of how we as a species evolved, and especially, how we came to acquire language.Some of the authors he draws on – Philip Lieberman and Stephen Pinker, to name two, have written books on language evolution for popular consumption that are more compelling reads.  Fitch's gift is to summarize the major thesis of each of these, and opposing theories proposed by others, and leave the reader to understand that for a majority of the major issues there is no overwhelming consensus.  What role did music play in language development? Did language evolve via gesture? From animal calls? Fitch outlines arguments on both sides.There are some positions he favors, if ever so slightly.  Great apes have a fertility problem: given the attention and nourishment that a baby takes, they go six years between children.  Language may have helped Homo sapiens over that hump.  Men (and other relatives) support a human mother in ways that allow her to bear every two years or so.  Language is useful to coordinate social arrangements.  Our use of tools and weapons may have afforded us enough protection that we could afford to be noisy.  He repeatedly uses the German Mitteilingsbedurfniss (need to inform) to describe how we relate to one another.  He writes on the social benefits of gossip.His bibliography is incredibly broad: anthropology, sociology, evolutionary psychology, linguistics, anatomy, and of course, evolution.  He gives the reader a great appreciation for the genius of Charles Darwin, citing many, many ways in which Darwin anticipated not only research, but conclusions that would not come for more than a century.I have only two reservations about the book.  First is political correctness.  Although he surely knows better, he pretends that Stephen J. Gould's ""Mismeasure of Man"" and Gardner's ""Multiple Intelligences"" are the last word on intelligence research.  Wrong.  Jensen was the premier researcher of the last century, with Gottfredson, Lynn, Vanhanen and others.  Problem is, the latter authors' work, though it represents a widespread consensus among psychometricians, does not pass PC muster and is therefore ignored as often as possible.  I would hope that a scholar such as Fitch would be above that.  Observe, for instance, how deftly Pinker dodged the issue in ""The Blank Slate.""  An author doesn't have to tell the truth, but he doesn't have to break his back kowtowing to the gods of political correctness by publishing things he probably knows not to be true.Second reservation is simply that this book is too daunting for anybody outside the field.  Fitch must have written it thinking of graduate students within the above-named disciplines.  They will find it extremely valuable, both for the overview and the extensive bibliography.  A five-star effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2X0QTPOUUZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004123DG6#wasThisHelpful","R3L2X0QTPOUUZR","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The introduction suggests that this book is going to rehash some fairly common themes. Then, delightfully, the first chapters veers off on an unexpected tangent, followed by an equally astute, and unexpected second chapter.The introduction suggests that we are in for a time of either inflation or deflation, and that they are both equally dangerous. The thesis he repeats throughout the book is that central banks favor inflation for a number of reasons, but that they are having a hard time forcing inflation it to occur. There is simply too much slack in the economy in the form of unused labor, capital, and production capacity. Other authors argue that increases in productivity are inherently deflationary: if automation reduces the cost of manufacturing a car, competitive pressures will force manufacturers to sell them cheaper.The federal government must have inflation for four reasons. Deflation causes an increase in the real value of the federal debt.  It has an adverse impact on the debt to GDP ratio. Third, although banks may benefit initially by being repaid more than they lent, the risk of default increases dramatically in a deflationary environment. The fourth and final problem with deflation is that it reduces federal tax income. As nominal earnings decrease, the tax rate schedules, which are graduated, yield less revenue in real terms.  Though asset value may rise in real terms, you cannot tax capital gains unless the nominal value rises.Central banks throughout the world are fighting the tide as they work to promote inflation.  The result of Quantitative Easing has been massive malinvestment by those to whom the newly coined money has been funneled.Chapter One covers the financial signals that telegraphed the World Trade Center attack, had anybody been astute enough to parse the evidence.  Rickards consulted with the CIA during the decade of the 2000s, looking for ways in which markets predicted attacks on American interests.  In analyzing how the terrorists benefitted financially from their own act, he offers a broad discussion of financial forensics.  He matter-of-factly documents overwhelming evidence of insider trading and market manipulation.  These are not central to his theme, except insofar as obviously rigged markets make investors wary.Chapter Two discusses financial warfare.  The key insight is that state actors are often more interested in relative than absolute strength.  Every war has costs, but if country A can destroy country B at an acceptable cost to itself, it may do so.  Destroying the dollar would have a major impact on dollar holders such as China, but at the same time increase their relative strength in the world.  His analysis of the way the US used finance to cripple Iran and Syria is quite insightful.  As Russia and China free themselves from reliance on the dollar, they might do the same to us.Chapter Three analyzes the increased involvement of central banks in the economies of their countries, and the general ill effects of central planning.  It didn't work for the communists, and it doesn't work for Yellen.  The Fed gets tangled up when it targets inflation and unemployment statistics, when its own actions influence those statistics, and the Federal Government has ample room to fudge the measurement of the statistics.  Any policy can be justified.Of the four causes of economic depression, Rickards claims that the greatest is regime uncertainty.  People refuse to invest when the rules keep changing.  Amity Shlaes and others have concluded that Roosevelt prolonged the Depression by constantly changing the rules for labor unions and other politically favored groups.  And Obama is doing the same, with the same result.  Entrepreneurs are reluctant to invest, leaving a lot of capital and labor idle.Fed policy of low interest rates is forcing people to take unusual risks in pursuit of a return.  Neither common people nor money managers find it easy to sit tight and accept a zero return on capital for any period of time.  Instead, they have been stampeded into the only games in town - overinflated real estate (again) and a rigged stock market.  Interest rates, and especially the price of gold, have been forced down in order to push money into these bubbles.Chapter Four focuses on China, beginning with a sweeping historical overview of the world's longest lived civilization.  He observes that it swings rather regularly back and forth between centralization and decentralization, each in turn cleaning out the excesses of the other.  This is a time of great malinvestment.  Whereas consumers account for 71% of US spending, the figure for China is only 35%.  For investment, it is 13% vs. 48%.  The latter is an absurd figure, including vast amounts of malinvestment: empty cities, trains to nowhere, and the like.  As in the US, the middle class is the victim.  As their savings receive negative rates of return, vast amounts of money go into mutual-fund type vehicles which in turn invest in the bubble.  It will not end well.Though China, with $3 trillion in assets, could put its financial house in order, it will not.  The powers that be make their money from the malinvestment.  The growing wealth disparity represents a major threat to the regime.Chapter Five is on Germany and the Euro Zone.  It is refreshingly different from the mostly negative analyses most authors offer.  He gives good reasons why the Euro should survive as a currency and cites optimistic statistics about the progress that the PIIGS, especially Greece, have made in cleaning up their economies.  In particular he notes that contrary to the Keynes/Krugman theory of ""sticky wages,"" wage rates have been able to fall by a whopping 22% even without abandoning the Euro.  Moreover, Greece is attracting new investment.The Euro zone is continuing to expand, with the recent admission of Latvia and Croatia, and the potential membership of Serbia, Macedonia and Turkey.On the other hand, the Euro zone does suffer from a lack of uniformity in banking standards and deposit insurance.  A bigger problem is that few of the member states meet the requirements for keeping their finances in order.  They are to run deficits of no more than 3% if their Debt/GDP ratio is less than 60 (very few of them) and no more than  percent if debt is higher.Chapter Six begins with a discussion of the BRICS, then goes on to the GIIPS (nice acronym for the PIIGS) and BELLS.  The latter - Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - was new to me.  His major point is that the BELLS swallowed their medicine after the crisis of 2008, accepting a plunge in the GDP and austerity, refusing to devalue, in order to retain investor confidence.  The PIIGS did what the US has done -  print money, in some cases devalue, and pretend the problem will go away.  The BELLS have fared quite well - the PIIGS not so well.He has a wonderful quote on Russia: ""The Russian economy is best understood as a natural-resource-extraction racket run by oligarchs and politicians who skim enormous amounts off the top and reinvest just enough to keep the game going.""  That has been the game here in Ukraine as well, and the Maidan revolutions of 2004 and 2013 are attempts to wrench the country free of the oligarchs.Chapter 7 - Debt, deficits and the dollarWhat is the meaning of money?  The classical definition is (1) a store of value, (2) a medium of exchange, and (3) a unit of account.  These meanings are important, and Rickards has a great dissertation on the various points of view.  This is a matter of practical import.  Is gold money? Is Bitcoin money?He offers an interesting view.  We are already on the gold standard, in that anybody who wants to is free to buy gold and use it as a store of wealth.  It is not in governments' interest that we do so, which is why they echo Keynes, calling it a ""barbarous relic"" and openly manipulate its price to make it unattractive.  One reads so much about the manipulation that it is worth citing other sources.  It is a major theme on zerohedge.  Paul Craig Roberts did a good piece in January.  The Gold Antitrust Committee covers it regularly, and I review Geheime Goldpolitik: Warum die Zentralbanken den Goldpreis steuern (German Edition).Rickards says that government investment is justified if it satisfies three conditions: (1) only government could do it, (2) they can afford it, and (3) it has a positive return on investment.  Two positive investments were the Interstate Highway System and the Internet.  Most government investments, including just about everything Obama has done, do not qualify.  They channel money the government cannot afford (has to print) to favored groups for investments (solar, education) which will never pay for themselves.Chapter 8 is on the IMF, the banker to the world.  At present the IMF's balance sheet is only about 600 billion, small compared to those of the central banks.  His point is that the IMF is the ultimate backup when central banks fail.  The IMF has recently, quietly gotten permission to act like a bank, lending in excess of the asset base formed by member-state quotas.  The currently allowed ratio is a conservative (for banks) 3:1.  But - the mechanism is in place to print vast amounts, if and when the world's central banks get in trouble.The most interesting part of the chapter is a portrait of Dr. Min Zhu, the Chinese deputy to Christine Lagarde.  He is a man who has seen both the Chinese and the Western systems, is smart enough to see the inherent contradictions within the IMF, and sometimes sufficiently candid to coyly reveal what he knows.  A nice portrait.  NB: Other illumination portraits in previous chapters include Andy Marshall of the Pentagon and Randy Tauss of the CIA.  Rickards knows them not merely as a writer, but from having worked intimately with them.One of the truths that is widely known in financial circles, but seldom admitted, is that today's economic problems are primarily structural rather than cyclical.  Don't blame it on the business cycle.  The changes in demography, technology and society are structural and will not reverse themselves.  Neither Japan nor China will sprout a generation of new workers overnight.  In the US, the number of people entitled to entitlements will not shrink; neither will the cost of ""free"" medicine.His thesis is that the SDR, the IMF ""currency"" formed of a market basket of national currencies, could become a world currency.  Moreover, it could, if his suggestions were followed, be pegged to gold as a deterrent to uncontrollable fiat currencies.Chapter 9 - GoldThis is the meat of the matter.  Gold is money.  The purest money.  It is not a commodity, despite where it may be traded, because unlike commodities it is rarely consumed, but used almost exclusively as a store of value.Rickards writes openly and authoritatively about the ways in which central banks and government manipulate the price of gold.Chapter 10 - CrossroadsRickards writes as a throwaway that our governments are manipulating all the markets.  It is so widely accepted as not to require amplification.There is massive malinvestment, from Chinese ghost cities to US student loans.  While the problems could be fixed, the structure of our political systems will almost certainly not allow it.  The vested interests are too strong.Chapter 11 - MaelstromRickards has referred to complexity theory often throughout the book.  Here he amplifies the discussion.  Systems, especially those involving human beings, are simply too complex to be predicted.  One never knows, by analogy, which snowflake will trigger the avalanche.  All you can know is that an avalanche is likely.He says that the crunch time is here for the Federal Reserve. There is a term used in complexity theory: a system about to fail goes wobbly, much as the top stars to wobble when it runs out of centrifugal force. He says that the Federal Reserve is already there, and it is unable to fill any of its roles other than to continue to monetize debt.ConclusionThis is the pay dirt.  Rather like a Biblical prophet, he lists seven signs of the end times.  And most useful, he gives his assessment of how to brace for the storm.  He would own gold, land, hedge funds invested in hard assets, fine art and cash.Rickards cites a relative handful of sources repeatedly: Krugman, Reinhart and Rogoff, Bernanke, and Robert Rubin's acolytes.  While he has an occasional good word for each of them, he is properly scathing when appropriate.Rickards is more willing to accept official statistics on unemployment, inflation and the like than others.  He does not express skepticism as to whether or not the gold is still in Fort Knox.  The skeptics are well known - look at zerohedge - and I find it impressive that he can build such a strong case for the imminent ""death of money"" even taking government claims and statistics at face value.The book could have been endlessly large.  Subjects which Rickards chooses not to address are the declining quality of our human resources - poor education, and the skew of childbearing to the least capable members of society, the inexorable rise in entitlement spending, and the decline of the work ethic.  See Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010 for this discussion.All in all, a masterful job by a man who has lived with his subject for most of a lifetime, and yet writes with the clarity of a lifelong author.  A rare treat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R196L9W8HKPGUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMFEAF4#wasThisHelpful","R196L9W8HKPGUR","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Combining two biographies, those of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell, is a good device for telling the story of an era in science. The subjects' working lives span most of the 19th century. Though they came from different backgrounds, the two had quite a bit in common. They were incredibly hard-working. The authors go out of their way to tell how genuinely kind they were. They had a true knack for making friends and avoiding long-lasting enmities. The third virtue was of course incredible intelligence. But it seems hardly likely that Englishman of the 19th century alone her were more gifted than other populations and times. Something about that epoch allowed genius to flourish, to reveal itself fully. That epoch is the subject of this rather remarkable book.Faraday was born as of a poor second generation blacksmith from the North Country. He had the good fortune to arrive in London at a time when the city was intellectually very alive. He could bounce between low-paying jobs giving people a chance to notice and take advantage of his talent. One of the most fortunate postings was as a book binder. The work was not mentally demanding, but it put young Faraday in contact with books. He loved to read, and quickly became quite well informed. It also put him in such with the customers for the books, some of whom took note of the young man's alertness and talents. It was not too long before he became an apprentice to the famous scientist Humphry Davy, who brought him along rather quicklyAmong Faraday's attributes was being meticulous, faulting himself deeply when he failed to put out work of the quality he expected of himself. He was kind and generous, and extremely apologetic when he accidentally gave offense, as he did one a couple of occasions. It was a Christian era, and although his religiosity does not appear to have expressed itself as such, it was expressed through the way he interacted with his fellow man.  The authors do not report any conflicts between science and religion in Faraday's life.Faraday lived a long life, toward the end of which he dealt with increasing lapses of memory. It did not affect his character; he remained conscientious to the end.The second subject, James Clerk Maxwell, was born into more comfortable circumstances, in Scotland. His accent set him apart throughout his life. He had more easy access to the university, but still had to be propelled by mentors who were attracted to his talent and guided him to the very center of intellectual life of the times, Cambridge, where he truly shone.Maxwell, per the book, had manifested great intellect at an early age.  He was extremely close to his father, who guided his early education.  He published his first paper, on the use of string and fixed foci to draw complex geometric figures, when he was only fourteen. He continued to work a number of areas, including his of light, vibration, and eventually electricity and magnetism. Another early paper won him a prize while at the university: he concluded, using an elaborate mathematical argument based on the physical properties he could assume for solid disks, liquid, and independently orbiting rocks, that Saturn's rings had to be formed from the latter.  Later, one of his mentors introduced him to Faraday's writing, the deeply perceptive observations in which had yet to be explained mathematically.Each of the men had shortcomings. Faraday never mastered mathematics. He was never able to find a mathematical language to as a vehicle to express his marvelous intuitions and the observations made in the course of his many experiments. Maxwell, on the other hand, was a great natural mathematician, preferably effortlessly coming in second in the manual mathematics competition at Cambridge, to E. J. Routh, a man who later became -renowned as a mathematician.Maxwell's shortcoming was his inability, despite the generous good nature, to express himself cogently in an oral presentation. He wandered. He compensated for this with the precision of his writing, which the authors say made his observations of pleasure to read, and attracted him a great worldwide base of admirers.The book does not budget many words for describing the men's personal lives.  Both were married, Faraday quite happily and successfully, Maxwell to a women with whom others found to be rather shrewish but took good care of her husband. One of the young Faraday's nemeses was the wife of his mentor, Humphry Davy.  She was a snobbish, overbearing and even jealous woman who made a point of putting Faraday down for his peasant roots. It is a credit to the young Faraday that he accepted all of this for general good humor. That said, the stories of personal lives are rather brief, and one should look to other biographies for more depth.Where the authors shine is in presenting the scientific work of the two men. A temptation with a work like this would be to dumb down the explanations in the expectation that the average reader will not understand them. That expectation would be valid with respect to me. I know quite a bit about science, but many of the explanations went over my head. I only half grasped them. I'm confident, however, from the part that I do grasp and from the style in which it is written that it is a thorough and competent exposition of the ideas of these great men.  I expect that it will be a satisfaction to people who have a better grounding in science see these thoughts so well expressed.The latter chapters of the book discuss the great names in physics who built upon Maxwell's theories. An initial inertia followed Maxwell's death. Maxwell had not sought to confirm his theories by experiment at the Cavendish. His thousand page treatise on electricity was rather daunting, the field notes of the first explorer and a new field, not organized well for study.However, a handful of scientists, here called the Maxwellians, plowed through Maxwell's work and devised experiments to validate his theories. Two of the theories which had to be laid to rest were the idea of action at a distance, exemplified by gravity, then the existence or nonexistence of the aether.  The series of brilliant experiments proved Maxwell to be right, and expanded his ideas to make them the foundation of physics.  We are familiar with the names of many of the men involved: Lord Kelvin, Lorentz, Hertz, Heaviside and Michaelson are among them.Let me note one error which escaped the technical editors. The speed of light is 300 million meters per second, not kilometers.There is a quote from Einstein. Given the proposition that he had stood on the shoulders of giants such as Newton he replied, no, he had stood on the shoulders of Maxwell. Maxwell had stood on Faraday's shoulders, and Faraday on Newton's. The final chapter puts Einstein into the context of his time. Others were working with ideas such as the special theory of relativity, but Einstein had had the insights required to distill it down to very succinct formulations and proofs. In retrospect Einstein is often portrayed as a solitary genius. No, he was in the midst of contemporary streams of thought, distinguishing himself as a man who could see more and clarify things better than others, but strongly helped by the fervid climate of experimentation and the discoveries of others.It is extraordinary that Great Britain produced so many great men in the 19th century. Producing great science is a matter not only of genius, but of opportunity. One of the observations the authors make is that both these men were polymaths. They succeeded a number of fields, some quite practical such as architecture, and in several different disciplines within the sciences. This was not uncommon. Benjamin Franklin in the previous century had likewise been a great natural scientist, biologist, and physicist, among many other things.  Such was the nature of the times that there was a small enough body of knowledge that it was possible to be really well read in a number of branches.The author describes at some length how the men's experiences in different branches of science reinforced their intuitions electricity and magnetism, which is the main focus of this work. They were men who were used to working with their hands.  They observed electricity in living fish and dead frogs. They were of course familiar with Newtonian physics, and with Bernoulli's fluid dynamics. James Clerk Maxwell wrote a philosophical article in his college days on the use of analogy in explaining the natural world. He made extensive use of analogies, such as between the flows of electricity and water.An altogether engrossing book.  It raises questions in my mind comparing the science of today with that of the 19th century.  We seem not to be producing many young scientists of this caliber anymore, despite the fact that the schools have constructed a virtual dragnet to identify talented minds at the earliest possible age.  Why not is the subject for an essay, which I may latter append to this review.  (NB - this is done - it is the third comment below).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTA7XHCWSIHF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8EYYJ6#wasThisHelpful","RTA7XHCWSIHF8","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This long review covers (1) the book itself, (2) two great figures of the era who are now somewhat obscure, Schweitzer and the author himself, Norman Cousins, and (3) the era.  I first read the book as a teen, in 1960.  The passage of fifty four years puts its importance in better perspective, and allows me to put the key ideas of the book into historical perspective.Norman Cousins was the editor of the influential Saturday Review (of Literature) from 1940 to 1971.  He was also a dedicated pacific and crusader against nuclear testing.  He had several objectives in visiting Schweitzer's hospital in Lambaréné in 1957.  He wanted to interview the great man; he wanted to make photographic copies of two of Schweitzer's books in progress, started a quarter century earlier and existing only in manuscript form, he was delivering greetings from President Eisenhower and a boy who wanted support in saving a historical church organ, and lastly, he wanted a statement from Schweitzer supporting a nuclear test ban.  He was successful on all counts.By his mid-30s Albert Schweitzer, born in 1875, had become a renowned organ interpreter, especially of Johann Sebastian Bach; a physician and surgeon; a respected Christian philosopher and writer on the early church; and most recently, the author of a well-received book on Bach.  He used the royalties from that book to launch a fifth career, that of a missionary.  He built a hospital on the Ogowe River, about 100 miles inland from the Atlantic coast of French Equatorial Africa, now Gabon.LambareneAlready by the time of Norman cousins visit in 1957 Schweitzer was something of an anachronism. He was a throwback to what one might benignly call the White Man's Burden. He ran his hospital in an authoritarian fashion, a fact which excited, even in the 1950s, some criticism.  His professional staff appears to have been entirely white.  Cousins does not report any meetings with native-born professionals in any capacity.  Though the French had established some institutions for training their subjects in various professions, Schweitzer did his hiring from the developed world, through a process involving the extensive exchange of letters.Schweitzer's ability to attract people to his mission and to get them to stay is one of the remarkable things which comes out of this book.  Many spent the better part of their lives with him serving the Africans. There was no glory in it to speak of. They worked hard, got no pay, and they did not even get to spend a great deal of time in the presence of Schweitzer himself. There was simply too much work to do, as Schweitzer with his five careers had more than enough to keep himself busy. He died at 90 with incomplete manuscripts that had been hanging fire for decades.Visitors to the hospital were impressed at how simple it was. It did not have the usual accoutrements such as clean sheets and separate wards. His philosophy was to make it is fully African as he could. He admitted not just a patient but the patient's entire family. He accepted the fact that they cooked their own food and used the jungle for sanitation.Schweitzer represents the best of the missionary spirit of Christian Europe in the Victorian era. One can ask why these people would spend a lifetime serving Blacks who only sometimes seemed appreciative. The answer has to be a dedication to the Christian life.  Cousins does not make any accounting for the number of African souls brought to Christ through this ministry.  Instead, the emphasis is on the ennoblement of the Europeans' souls through their selfless work on behalf of the Africans.One of the most striking and repeated features of the book is the constant battle between the hospital staff and the witch doctors in the surrounding forest. It was a battle for the hearts and souls of the people, one which Schweitzer never won even after 50 years. The natives would come to the white people for treatment often only after all else had failed and it was a true emergency.  It appears to have been always against the desires of the witch doctors, and his staff had to be personally quite strong to chase away the fetishists and set things straight.There is a lesson in this book for people who think of Christians as aloof, holier-than-thou types. There was no chapel at the hospital. Religious services were held out of doors. They were short. They were matter-of-fact. The music was provided by Schweitzer himself on a decades-old, dilapidated upright piano, and by choirs of African lepers who had learned from the Europeans how to sing Western hymns.  In any case, there is no account of attempts to evangelize the hospital patients.  Permanent residents of the leper colony did put on a nativity play.Cousins makes an interesting digression about the problems of traveling, such as exposure to exotic diseases and to dysentery and to crowds. This is a valuable insight into the times. 1960 was at the very dawn of the jet age, a time when casual international travel was not very common. Travel to the places that Cousins went, such as Southeast Asia and Africa, was out of the question for almost all of his readers. Reading his observations on international travel give the reader a pretty good insight into the times.PhilosophyI excerpt here two of Cousins' paragraphs on the philosophy behind Schweitzer's mission:""There were other thoughts that occurred to me as we flew over the jungle hills of French Equatorial Africa. I considered the matter of Dr. Schweitzer's relationship with the Africans, and the many misconceptions about it that had found their way into print. When the Doctor first came to Lambarene the life of the African had barely been touched by industrial civilization. It was difficult to get Africans to work steadily in putting up the buildings and in doing hard jobs for the Hospital. There was the temptation at first to think that the Africans were naturally lazy. But Dr. Schweitzer very early realized that it made a difference when one lives in a climate and in an environment where the needs are few. Living close to nature, the African saw no need to work beyond that which was necessary to the immediate well-being and the minimal needs of his family. The idea of putting up extensive buildings, making concrete piles, sawing and storing woods--all this seemed to have little connection with reality as the African lived it. But the lack of incentive did not mean, as Dr. Schweitzer soon came to realize, that the Africans would not work hard under any circumstances.""Thus, Schweitzer's main achievement is a simple one. He has been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for a moral principle. Like Gandhi, the power of his appeal has been in renunciation. And because he has been able to feel a supreme identification with other human beings he has exerted a greater force than millions of armed men on the march.""Insights into the 1950sThe book opens with a chapter on Cousins' experiences getting to the hospital in Lambaréné. He traveled to South Africa. This was 1955, a time when apartheid was at its strongest. He writes very perceptively about the internal contradictions of apartheid.  He met with white publishers and black reporters working together to attempt to get news distributed to black citizens during this troubled time. He points out the contradictions and ironies, the difficulties encountered such as when his black companion had to cross the street in one place and he had to cross it in another. He talks about the undercurrents of resentment, and the ways in which the Africans even in the mid-50s were no longer content with the relationship that they had long had with the whites.Contrast this with scientist Richard Dawkins autobiography, A Sense of Wonder. Dawkins writes of the simple open way in which Africans accepted him and his family in Kenya, and of the freedom with which they could travel everywhere. At about the same time, Cousins is reporting from South Africa, from an adult perspective, about nuances in the changing relationship of whites to blacks. I would recommend this book as a source for people who are interested in how modern Africa evolved to its present state. The seeds were there, and Cousins had a fairly good glimpse, albeit only for a short time.  I recommend other books on Africa in these times: Emanuel Derman's Models Behaving Badly and Ilana Mercer's Into the Cannibal's Pot, and books by archeologists such as the Leakeys.According to Wikipedia French Equatorial Africa was founded in 1911.  The French administered it until 1958, after Cousins' visit, when it split into independent states. Cousins reported that the staff spent an inordinate amount of time filling out paperwork for French social medicine. He says that the natives enjoyed French citizenship. This appears from the Wikipedia article to have been only partially true. They did, however, have representation in the French Parliament.  It is a reminder of the degree to which France attempted, however unsuccessfully, to integrate possessions such as Algeria into the French Republic.  It was simply not what the indigenous peoples wanted, anywhere.In another historical reflection, test ban advocate Cousins writes extensively about the dangers posed by nuclear fallout, especially strontium 90. I was a child in the 1950s, and I remember the high level of fear. I now live in Kiev. Strontium 90 and cesium 137 were the major contaminants produced by the Chernobyl incident in 1986. Fortunately, despite this massive release of dangerous isotopes, only 50 people died at the time and the United Nations puts the excess cancer deaths due to exposure to these contaminants at fewer than 5000. People in Kiev do not pay any attention to it.Every era has its own worries, its own bogeyman, its own Armageddon scenario. The scenarios in Norman Cousins' time were a nuclear holocaust in which everybody was blown up, and the twin threat of nuclear radiation, by which we all would die from mutations and radiation poisoning. Neither happened.  Other menaces were DDT - Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, the Red Chinese and smog.  Somehow we survived.  This is not to say that real dangers do not exist, only to note that it is part of the human condition to always worry about something.Cousins spent a lot of ink on world communism, which was seen as a major threat. That also turned out not to be the case. Today's political threat appears to be Vladimir Putin.  Though I live in Ukraine, I'm not overly concerned.Two other concerns appear very differently now than they did in 1958. The first is racial diversity. Europe is dealing with large numbers of very different types of immigrants.  Just as the Gabon natives did not want to remain French in 1958, they are not doing very well at becoming French when they live in Paris, or elsewhere in Europe, in 2014.  This failure to assimilate is prompting nationalist movements in every European country to limit immigration.  They should have taken a harder look at the lessons of their own history which were quite clear to Cousins half a century ago.The other major issue, which would not even have crossed Schweitzer's mind, is sexuality.  Cousins notes how many attractive single men and women were drawn to Lambarene, then notes that there was no time for romance.  He does not record any marriages; I am sure he assumed that they remained chaste.  That is what was expected in that age. Throughout the West, he would say that what he would have called the gift of human sexuality is being perverted. Instead of using sexuality to reproduce ourselves, it has become simply a vehicle for amusement. And, in the process, our society is not reproducing itself either in numbers or in spirit.  We are not producing new Schweitzers, or even people who would find Schweitzer particularly admirable.  If he were listing his worries in 1955, it seems clear that these latter two would have been more appropriate than the ones he was actually concerned with. I'm sure that our descendants will conclude that we also have been worried about the wrong things.Schweitzer did finish a fairly lengthy article entitled ""Peace or Atomic War?"" in April 1957.  Cousins includes it as a lengthy appendix.  He got the letter he sought in favor of saving the historic organ, though there is no note of its effect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4WYYXIMJKRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006AWHYQ#wasThisHelpful","R3J4WYYXIMJKRR","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a brief book – a one-day read, 58 print pages. It contains the estimate essential biographical information one needs.A lot must be sacrificed in such a brief recounting of a man's lifetime. The book does not provide a great deal of historical context. The reader needs to be reasonably familiar with czarist Russia, Nazi Germany, and the first and second world wars, because Johnson simply does not budget pages to provide the background.The writing is superb, as one expects from Paul Johnson. The book flows easily and logically. It touches on the appropriate major themes: the Bolshevik revolution, consolidation of power under Lenin, forced collectivization and the Holodomor, the purges, Stalin's indecisive dealings with Germany and failure to prepare for the war, the beginning of the Cold War period, and his deteriorating health, increasing paranoia, and death.I learned from the book that Lenin was the first to use systematic terror and liquidations to consolidate his power. Stalin merely improved on proven methods. Stalin's great gift was his tremendous appetite for work in his methodical execution of schemes to keep his opponents, real or imagined, always off-balance.The very brevity of this book makes it accessible to people who need to read it, people coming of age in the 21st century. Several historians are drawing parallels between this era and that of a century ago,the last days of the Tzar, World War I, a cataclysmic war which destroyed three empires and significantly rearranged the world power structure. Significantly, the century's three worst despots, Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, got their start in these chaotic times. If we are again facing chaos, it is good to know what can possibly ensue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDHNY4LMRKOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3E4XNO#wasThisHelpful","RPDHNY4LMRKOJ","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Lynn is a differential psychologist. He is interested in differences among people and among populations. He is a man out of his time. This is an era which is dedicated to the concept of equality. Dedicated to the concept of equality, resolutely ignoring any evidence that people and especially peoples are not equal.Lynn refuses to take things as given. He has an inquiring mind, a deep curiosity, and a phenomenal appetite for work. He will receive, or conceive, a large hypothesis, and then structure experiments, surveys, methodologies to determine whether or not there is any substance to the hypothesis.He measures the differences in intelligence, personality traits, and other quantifiable aspects of people. Among whom?  The different races and national groups, and the sexes.  These are of course the lightning rod issues of our time.Lynn had to have a thick skin. All the researchers in this area have taken an amazing amount of abuse. Steven Pinker discussed the vilification, the ostracism, the lack of recognition by the scientific community, in his 2003 book ""The Blank Slate.""  With the death last year of Arthur Jensen and Philippe Rushton, Lynn survives as one of the few remaining giants in the field.Most of the articles in this book involve some statistics. It is often above the level of the average practitioner even in the field of social sciences.  The treatment of statistics gives the reader an appreciation of how difficult it is to arrive at confident conclusions, and how dedicated the researchers are to impartiality, whatever malign motives their ignorant detractors may impute to them.  Lynn, for instance, faithfully reports that measured sex differences in IQ tests have fallen over time.  If he had an agenda, he might have been expected to overlook these results.  No - he holds nothing back, disclosing precisely what the data tell him.Two of the articles are especially illuminating. In one, a North African discusses intelligence tests that were administered among Libyans. It is a beautifully written article on the way that they structured the tests. How do you compile a representative sample of the population? How do you construct the test instrument? Then, having assembled the test results, how do you handle outliers, and ensure that results of the tests represent a normal distribution?  How do you demonstrate that they are statistically valid, meeting all of the standard tests for statistical acceptability, and that they are significant - that they represent something real? This is an illuminating tour through the world of statistics in the social sciences.  I cannot recall other articles that adhered so closely to the rigorous standards of good practice, and so clearly explained why and what they were doing.  The conclusion, incidentally, resulted in no new knowledge.  It amounts to no more than a rigorous confirmation of what had long been established, that the average IQ of North Africans is around 81, comparable to the tenth percentile of the British population.The second one that attracted my attention was the article on sex differences in intelligence. This one involved a lot of structured equation modeling, and confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis. In this one I learned something. The hypothesis is that boys' and girls' intelligences are quite evenly matched up to about the age of 16, but that male IQs continue to grow after that point, ultimately being somewhere around 3 to 5 points above that of females. It is associated with physical maturity.  Women achieve their adult growth earlier, while men continue to grow, in cranial capacity among other dimensions.  Performance by sex on the different subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Survey varies, with women leading men on two of the 11 tests. There was quite a bit of discussion about methodology, the ways in which the measurements could be skewed, and the efforts that the researchers took to offset the bias.The first article in the collection talks about the evolution of general intelligence. It is the formal statement of a purely Darwinian theory that has been around for a long time. It takes more intelligence to survive in a cold climate. Humans need to cooperate more closely in the hunt, make better clothes and shelter, and think ahead to survive cold winters, droughts and the like. A topic that they do not discuss at great length is the impact of agriculture. Other researchers such as Cochran and Harpending have written about the increased demands on intelligence imposed by more highly evolved societies since the dawn of agriculture.  Satoshi Kanazawa advocates a theory of novelty.  The more new phenomena and situations confront a population, the more intelligent they become.  Turning the logic around, the more novel ways there are to die, the smarter you have to be to survive.Several articles talk about Lynn and Vanhanen's2002 book ""Intelligence and the Wealth of Nations"" and the successor volumes. Many writers, going back to the dawn of intelligence testing, had noticed that there were racial differences in intelligence. Lynn made highly systematic studies, assembling a database of metadata of intelligence tests throughout the world. This rich collection of data was useful for refuting several theories, among them the hypothesis that diminished black intelligence in the United States was a function of the historic treatment of blacks in that country rather than an artifact of their genetic background. In fact, due to the admixture of other races, the average intelligence of blacks in the United States, at 85, is significantly higher than the average of 70 found in Africa. Different African populations differ as well; the Bushmen come in at 54, and the North Africans, as reported above, in the low 80s.  It is worth noting that within the history recorded by westerners, Zulus have widely displaced Bushmen and Arabs displaced and/or dominated black Africans down the east cost of the continent.  Natural selection on the basis of intelligence has occurred even among purely African populations.There are a couple of articles on the Flynn effect. All of them note the fact that Richard Lynn observed earlier than James Flynn that intelligences increased secularly, sometimes by substantial amounts. Anther researcher named Tuddenham had written about it two decades earlier. Japan and Korea showed 10 percent jumps from generation to generation. Nonetheless, because Flynn pushed the concept most doggedly, it is called the Flynn effect. While there is no consensus as to the totality of causes of the Flynn effect - better nutrition is certainly part of it - there is a concurrence that its impact is fading in Western Europe and the United States. The Flynn effect has not been operative in England for the past two decades.The most alarming article in the collection is entitled ""The Decay of Western Civilization: Double Relaxed Darwinian Selection"" by Helmuth Nyborg. His argument is that native European peoples are becoming less intelligent generation by generation because the less intelligent among them are the ones who have the most children. Moreover, and ultimately more significantly, the native born are not nearly as fertile as immigrants, and those immigrants from Africa and the Middle East have substantially lower intelligence than native Europeans. He plots the decline of Danish intelligence from approximately 99 down to a projected 93 by the year 2072. He modestly notes in his conclusion that the only common thread among such conclusions is that they are inevitably wrong. The article does not discuss politics, but it seems clear to me that the European welfare state is on the ropes even as I write in 2014, and the welfare state policies that support this dysgenic devolution will end substantially before 2072, perhaps within the next two or three years. Their inability to afford to support immigrants may be the salvation of the Danish people.A final note about the detractors.  All respectable members of the establishment - The New York Times, the Guardian, the Telegraph, universities everywhere - deplore science like this.  Ironically, these are the very people who will tell you how brave Galileo was to stand up to the orthodoxies of the Catholic Church.  There is a new orthodoxy, called variously the New World Order, the Cathedral (by the Dark Enlightenment) or just plain political correctness.  It vilifies and discredits researchers such as Lynn as viciously as ever did the Church, and it dominates modern intellectual discourse.  Call these worthies on their hypocrisy.  Ask them, as they condemn Lynn and his followers and debunk the whole field of intelligence research, if they have ever read Lynn, or if they can cite any peer-reviewed articles which authoritatively refute them.  Ask them to explain why sources such as Wikipedia support Lynn and Jensen's findings.  When they cite Stephen J. Gould's ""Mismeasure of Man,"" which remains about the best they have, ask why they choose a 30-year-old book which itself argued against 19th century straw men rather than attempt to refute his real target, acknowledged, contemporary experts such as Arthur Jensen and Richard Lynn.  Shine a little light.  Stand up for freedom of inquiry!This is a valuable survey of the state of the psychometric community, the world's intelligence researchers.  It highlights their recent findings concerning intelligence differences in sex and race.  Equally importantly, it illustrates their careful methodologies and the evolution of intelligence research over a long span of years, namely Lynn's lifetime.  Its measured, scholarly approach, including the recognition of internal inconsistencies, disagreements, and areas in which more research is necessary, stands as a thoroughgoing refutation of reckless, polemical charges of bias and agenda-driven research.  Those detractors could never assemble any science as credible as this; all they have is shrill invective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2NPKJ4KZR64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0957391331#wasThisHelpful","R1K2NPKJ4KZR64","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1999 and 2000 a trusted member of the Ukrainian President's security detail started bugging the President's office to capture conversations. The participants, and the subject of the conversations are a Who's Who of Ukrainian politics since its independence. The crudity of the language and the schemes used by the politician/businessman involved to steal public money and to frustrate one another are appalling. Not one character in the entire book comes out untainted.The book appears only in English so far. It is not especially well edited, but it does appear to be thoroughly researched, authentic. Though it is about Ukraine, I start with a discussion of corruption in the United States and elsewhere, looking for a comparison.It is not a shock anywhere that politicians are corrupt. Every politician in every country gives in to temptation. All depend on money for election, and the vast majority of them go into politics as a way to acquire power, money, and the things that go with them. The differences that some cultures instill behavioral curbs on politicians' self-serving interests. The citizens of Utah, for instance, will not put up with the same kind of misbehavior as the citizens of Chicago.The new politician arriving in Washington, where I lived for 30 years, finds that in order to be effective he has to join coalitions. You scratch my back and I scratch yours. Even in the cleanest of systems, representatives trade votes. But of course, there are no clean systems. A new politician's introduction to Washington includes introductions to the powers that be among the party hierarchy, the lobbyists, the political action committees and the donors. Even taking money out of the equation, a politician needs friends in order to get things done and get reelected. Therefore one sees blocks of vested interests such as the New York senators strongly supporting banking interests.How, then, is Ukraine so much more corrupt than the United States? There is an absence of consequences. When American politicians go overboard, as Richard Nixon did in Watergate, Clinton did in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Governor Spitzer did with prostitutes and Congressman Weiner did in promiscuously sexting random women, some part of the public gets angry enough to demand action, and and other politicians, seeing which way the wind is blowing, dismiss them from office. The same happens in Western Europe. Dominique Strauss Kahn was brought down by a sex scandal.The difference in Ukraine seems to be that no scandal can be damaging enough to bring down a presidency. These tapes were created in the first place with the hope of discrediting President Kuchma enough to flush him out of office. It simply did not work. Nobody has seriously denied the authenticity of the tapes. It was enough simply to rule that they were obtained illegally, and therefore not admissible as evidence in legal proceedings. Revelation of the activities documented in the tapes did not cause enough embarrassment to force anybody to resign. The politicians captured on these tapes straightforwardly deny even the most obvious transgressions. They change their stories often, flat contradicting what they may have said earlier with no embarrassment or shame. The tortuous journey of these tapes themselves, from the President's office to final publication, was monumentally complex. The interested parties, the chain of possession, the deals and double-crosses are so mind-boggling as to create a plot that a fiction writer would be embarrassed to compose.Why is there no embarrassment? The low level of political awareness on the part of the public is one problem. It is compounded by problems in the press. Just about every media outlet is controlled by some oligarch or another. A lot of news is simply never reported. Other news is reported in such a contradictory fashion by the various news outlets that even people who care despair of ever figuring out the truth. This book does a good job of describing how a fog of doubt was created surrounding even the most blatant misdeeds. It is worth adding that American spin doctors and lawyers, such as Alan Dershowitz and Washington law firm Akin, Gump and Strauss, are not above collecting rich fees for preventing oligarchs from being accountable for their actions.The book covers the roughly 20 year period from Ukraine's independence up to the present. Some things have improved. A bloody war was fought during the mid-90s between rival mafias in Ukraine, Tatar on one side and Jewish on the other, mainly in Donetsk. The Jewish leaders were almost entirely wiped out, and the Tartars sustained grave damage. Some of today's leading oligarchs are among the survivors. The current president earned his spurs supporting the mafias and associated politicians, and secured his power using the crude, heavy-handed but effective techniques perfected in the Donetsk oblast cradle of power.The level of mendacity and doublecrossing is appalling. No politician seems to have been able to trust anybody else. If there is a single instance documented here of two people remaining loyal to each other over the long run, I didn't see it. This absolute lack of integrity in dealing with one another would seem to make it extremely hard to run a government, or to stay in power. It seems to be a legacy of traditional Russian management. In the seven centuries since the time of the Mongols, power has been concentrated to the extent possible in a single set of hands. Underlings are simply not trusted, and because they are not trusted, they are given a minimum of information and authority. It is a cultural trait that will probably take a long time to disappear.One upshot is that there is not much difference between business and government. A businessman has to be in government to protect his interests. Being in government also confers immunity from prosecution, which is a strong inducement for many people to seek office. A person can be elected to Parliament (the Rada) on a party ticket, which means that the oligarchs can pretty much control who is elected. This book documents that it is quite easy to induce people to change parties with the right combination of threats and enticements. The party in power is able to persecute enemies through the tax authorities and courts. This is well documented in How Russia Really Works: The Informal Practices That Shaped Post-Soviet Politics and Business (Culture and Society after Socialism) and Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, Third Edition which I also review.Ukraine has matured over its 20 years of independence. Today's generation of oligarchs got rich by stealing the most obvious plunder from the remains of the Soviet empire. There is not enough booty left to spawn a new generation of similar oligarchs. Today's game is to steal it from one another via the corrupt system of courts. Diverting money from the public coffers, and the proceeds of foreign loans, are also ways to line one's pockets. It is not as lucrative as in the past because the Ukrainian people are already under a seemingly maximal tax load, and foreign lenders are getting wary. Quite a few wealthy people in modern Ukraine have earned their money more or less honestly: creating businesses that satisfy genuine customer needs. Some sectors of the economy are even quite competitive. Retail business, agriculture, and software are relatively clean.It is perversely satisfying to note the respect shown for human life even among those who would take it. Rather than simply being murdered, journalists are beaten up, imprisoned, or forced to emigrate. The few who get murdered are the hard cases who don't take the hint. In contrast to African countries where political murder is a daily fact of life, Ukraine looks rather civilized.The first generation of oligarchs were crude men, often from village backgrounds. Many came to power in brutal, physical confrontations. Many are uneducated, and not very articulate. The generation coming after them are better educated, more worldly, and more articulate. It includes the sons of these pioneers, and strivers who rise through the ranks. They may not be any more moral, but they are more polished and probably less inclined toward violence.The top echelons of oligarchs, whether they got their money through outright theft or by actually providing some economic value to customers, are inclined to use professional managers. American law firms and accounting firms are prominent in the capital. The companies that the oligarchs own are increasingly publicly held, traded on Western exchanges such as London, Frankfurt or Warsaw. Management has a strong interest in getting unqualified opinions by respected Western auditors. Like it or not, they are being led into Western modes of financial reporting, and becoming accustomed to coverage by the financial press. If they want favorable treatment, they have to act somewhat like gentlemen.While there may not be much promise of a broad-based democracy emerging in Ukraine, the rise of this new cadre of professional managers would seem to foreshadow an improvement of the business climate. Just as in Communist China and Vietnam, the politicians will find it increasingly in their interest to allow businesses to succeed. Just as in those countries, the path to free competition, transparent reporting, and an end to bribery and favoritism will at least be long, and maybe unending. However, it seems reasonable to expect that the types of crude shenanigans documented in this book will seem embarrassingly out of place within a generation. Democratic or not, one might hope that stability alone will enable the country to realize a higher fraction of its economic potential.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QDA6ISA8ZZUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0954376412#wasThisHelpful","R2QDA6ISA8ZZUL","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Williamson is a good writer; he has excellent credentials and a vast amount of experience. He chose the title that would sell the book, but it does not describe the book. It teasingly suggests that the developed world will not be able to support its high level of debt, decreasing level of education, and so on for very long. It proposes that when the old is gone, the new which replaces it will be more attractive.The book hits on both sides of the equation. Our system of entitlements, in the United States and most of the developed world, is unsustainable. However it works out - other authors are more articulate - governments will simply have to default on promises they have made for retirement and health benefits. There will be something of a collapse, and somehow institutions will persist after the collapse. The title suggests that the author will lead the reader from A to B. That does not happen. There is no discussion of the nature of the impending collapse, or a suggestion of the mechanics by which healthier institutions will reemerge.He does talk about healthier institutions. Williamson talks about the coercive nature of government and legal systems. He notes that human societies have developed a number of alternatives to formal governments and formal courts of law.  Informal negotiation, arbitration, and community norms would be three of them.He talks about the problems of writing legislation that will actually improve things. There are several strikes against this happening in the first place. First, the electorate is not well enough informed to recognize its own interest. Secondly, the interests of the legislators are not aligned with those of the voters. A legislator wants to get reelected and wants to get rich, most case. Third, there is the agency problem. Even a well-intentioned law has to be implemented by people. Those people have their own venal interests, as time servers until they retire, or worse, selling their office for financial gain. The upshot is that politicians make laws because, among other things, that is what they are elected to do. Those laws rarely improve the well-being of society. Specifically, in this week's news, we learned that Oregon conducted an experiment of providing universal healthcare to some people and not to others on a random basis. The outcomes were the same, even though those who did not have to pay for doctor visits used much more medical service.Society is vastly complex. Even creating models to properly understand how it operates is impossibly difficult. Modelers recognize that they have to simplify, leaving out variables. They hope that the variables which they omit are not critical. Public policy, however, complicates the equation by attempting to change things. We are not simply trying to understand how healthcare works, but we are attempting to change outcomes. The author cites authorities who estimate that public policy only achieves positive results, however short of the intended result, about 10 percent of the time.  Quote: ""Jim Manzi, an entrepreneur and mathematician, examined experimental data derived from randomized field trials-- the gold standard of scientific evidence-- in his 2012 book, Uncontrolled, and his main finding was that 90 percent or more of the policy innovations in health care, education, and criminal justice produced no measureable benefit when subjected to the most rigorous standard of examination.""The author states that politics is a monopoly. It is averse to change, because it is not subject to evolutionary pressures. It does not grow more efficient over time; it grows less so.  Under politics, gross misallocation of material resources can continue indefinitely-- right up until the moment that the material resources run out, in fact. Democratic procedures are insufficient. He quotes James Bovard , saying, `""Elections are vastly overrated as a means for restraining government abuses."" Abuses are the least of it-- politics paradoxically does more harm when it is performing as intended than when it is distorted by lawlessness or corruption.'He provocatively claims that government is violence. Government likes to pretend it has a monopoly on violence. It is by nature coercive. The author draws comparisons between mafias and legitimately constituted governments, historical parallels between the rise of market groups, the Taliban, and English kings. The use of force is always the same. The consent of the government is a matter of choosing the lesser of evils.Making his case for voluntary associations, the author makes the point that reputation is important. Many fracking operations operate with environmentally protective measures for an excess of what the law requires. They do this as a matter of professional solidarity with one another and the result is that when a company does accidentally despoil the environment, if they have been conscientious they will get lighter treatment.The discussions about how to save Social Security are rather fanciful. The analysis of what's wrong with the program, that  there are unsustainable benefits are that is absolutely on the money. The idea of how wealthy might pay more on behalf of the poor is not as well conceived. It is true that the scheme could be transferred either income or wealth to the poor. Or rather, to the trust to be dispensed on behalf of the poor.However, he doesn't go into the problem of free ridership. If the money is there, certainly people will queue up to take it. It is worth more to them than the people from whom it is extracted. More than that, the impecunious would use the small income to have more children, while the more responsible, higher earning people would feel constrained about having children. There would be a constant slide downhill.Williamson says that the rich might be willing to give five percent. It's not that they are selfish, but the money given to politics is used by politics. You cannot trust politicians to efficiently administer give away programs. In that he is absolutely right, although the five percent taken from a family making $150,000 per year would represent a significant bite. It is not easy to raise children even on $150,000 year in the big city. After taxes you have maybe 100,000, And given the state of the schools, after a couple of private school tuitions you're down to half that. The money does not go nearly as far as he would anticipate.Williamson does obliquely concede that the poor may be poor on account of their own bad decision-making. He does not go into whether or not they could remedy that bad decision-making. This is really at the crux of the problem. People make bad decisions for number of reasons, not the least of which is that they do not have the intelligence to do otherwise. Intelligence being hereditary, their children suffer the same deficit. At a minimum there are vast cultural bridges separating the subpopulations of many developed countries, especially the United States.  Williamson would like to think that most of the world shares his rational approach to life. It is simply not so. He should read Gert Hofstede and Robert Putnam to name some uncontroversial authors. Authors whose work is not discussed in polite company, Arthur Jensen, Richard Lynn and Philippe Rushton would propose even more profound reasons for bad decision-making.Williamson does not even mention race and ethnicity. He talks about our altruistic, charitable impulses. These stem from our distant ancestry, and they are certainly stronger toward members of our own kind, that is only to members of the family and tribe, then to strangers. While we certainly celebrate and support genius in any race, the idea of money being transferred from our average children to average or even somewhat above average children of other groups slows down in a hurry. We are a tribal species, we support our own. Williamson uses the word ""blackmail"" quite appropriately to describe how society currently buys peace by transferring money from one group to another. He should not deceive himself that it is willingly given.Williamson has a relatively short but good riff on homeschooling. He darkly suggests that the authorities resented and resist it. Whereas this was the case perhaps 20 years ago, homeschoolers are relatively unmolested in the United States. Germany and Sweden are the places where the government strongly enforces its monopoly.Williamson says that private schools are really an extension of public schools, one which allows people who can afford it a way out of a failing system. He points to the irony of the fact that 40 percent of public school teachers in Philadelphia put their own kids in private school. Private schools are something of an escape valve, in that they can exclude the academically unpromising via admissions, and can expel troublemakers, enforcing classroom discipline. But he does not say is that private and public schools both draw from the same pool of teacher talent. As he says, they are the group which scores the poorest on SATs and other standard measures. They are also exposed to the same relentless education school brainwashing. Private school education is better because the kids are smarter, but not because it differs radically in philosophy. I write this as a former parent, trustee, teacher and education school student. I am homeschooling my second family.The Kindle edition of the book has a significant problem with superscripting, or lack thereof.  In the discussion of complexity, Williamson throws around several very large numbers.  One of those is 4.51*1017.  The problem is, this is not a large number at all. What he means is 4.5110 to the 17th power, which is large. This problem occurs half a dozen times.Williamson uses two words, statist and etatist, which are similar both in meaning and spelling.  The latter, derived from French, means a believer in state socialism. I would've benefited by a footnote as to the etymology of the word. It is not one that one frequently encounters.Overall, the book was a pleasure to read. Williamson is a delightful writer, and his points are well made. I reluctantly give it five stars. The content merits such a rating: the deceptive title, however, is hard to forgive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH3S4SACWPOUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062220683#wasThisHelpful","RH3S4SACWPOUM","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every book is written from a perspective. This one is from the perspective of a divorced mother of a five-year-old who is still quite interested in sex and/or marriage.  Kayt Sukel is a thoroughly modern woman. She is career-oriented and successful. She has made a mark in the highly competitive world of authoring articles for quality magazines, and with this she makes her book debut.Although her mastery of the science of sex sets her apart, Sukel's thinking is quite mainstream for modern American campuses.  There is nothing that will challenge prevailing views. She starts out by defining love. Rather, she discourses at length on how difficult it is to arrive at a single definition.One theme that recurs in several chapters in his the idea that sexual love involves at least three separate elements. One is pure lust, which can most closely be explained by the brain chemicals, hormones and genetic factors that she describes. Second is the feeling of being in love, the butterflies in the stomach, distracted sort of feeling that comes of being head over heels. The third is the deep, long-term commitment.She explains all of these through the use of diagrams of areas of the brain. Our reptilian brains are in control of our most basic functions, and more lately evolved portions drive the reasoning processes which channel and control the reptilian. Although it may not be interesting exactly which areas light up under which stimuli, the very fact that sexologists and neurologists can develop that accurate picture of what's going on in the brain is really pretty amazing. In her chapter on orgasm, she modestly presents a time series of images of her own brain as she was wired into an MRI. Scientists definitely have a clue what's going on in there.All that said, the brain is a highly complex organ. There are large numbers of chemicals: oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin to name three, each of which fills multiple functions. There are receptors for these chemicals, which may in turn do double duty, servicing two or more of them. Hormones govern the release of them, singularly or in groups. Even at a chemical level, it is difficult to arrive at definite conclusions.  This is one of Sukel's strong points. She is content to describe the science as it stands, without feeling a need to stretch beyond what scientists know. In saying that scientists do not know what makes people fall in love, what makes love last, and what exactly pheromones are and do.She talks about a rhesus monkey named Casanova was able to suppress his desire to mate in the interests of maintaining his social standing within a rhesus community into which he had been recently introduced. Not knowing the lay of the land, so to speak, he refused to get involved with the females came on to him. This is a very telling episode. It indicates that even in our primate relatives, and presumably our ancestors, reason and the upper hand over lust. We can control our emotions. She goes on to credit us with generally knowing when to keep our pants zipped and to avoid adventures that will jeopardize our relationships, our social standing and our pocketbooks.Sukel's last chapter deals with love of divine beings, the love of God and others. It is curiously narrow. She talks about the way that love manifests itself in the individual - the same kinds of chemical and hormonal involvement as romantic love. She does not talk about it at all from the perspective of religious people. It is useful to note that fundamentalists preachers talk ad nauseum about the three Greek words for love:  eros, filios, and agape, if I remember them right. One is romantic, the second is brotherly, and the third is love of all mankind. There is kind of a misfit here: she speaks of believers loving Christ as a person, whereas Christians speak of three different ways of loving one another, but no special way of loving Christ except ""with all your heart.""The question of how religious people love is interesting because however misguided their beliefs, religious people seem to be the only ones who are successful in creating offspring and passing their beliefs on down to those offspring. Whatever one may think of Mormons and Muslims, one has to respect the fact that they breed true. The rest of us do not. This is a factor which is not even discussed in Sokel's book.  I think it is relevant: the evolutionary purpose of sex is actually procreation, not self-fulfillment or recreation. If you do not have offspring, and do not raise them to have their own offspring, your seed dies out. There is some kind of love involved in the process. I doubt that it can be defined very well by hormones and chemicals, but I think that there is more research to be done on the higher functions of the brain involved in religious love, and then channeling Sokel's three forms of love - lust, romance and devotion - into the process of creating and nurturing the next generation.In a book which refuses to take a strong stand on any issue Sokel goes out of her way to stress that the chemical reactions involved in homosexual love are pretty much identical to those in heterosexual love.  She repeats the claim that gay people are pretty much that way from birth.  This is the best supported statement of the claim that I have encountered.  Her certainty on this one issue seems rather inconsistent with her refusal to take sides on other issues, but it does give strong credence to the gay community's claims.I include Sokel's table of contents below to help the reader assess the content of the book.Chapter 1: The Neuroscience Of Love: A HistoryChapter 2: The Ever Loving BrainChapter 3: The Chemicals Between UsChapter 4: Epigenetics (Or It Is All My Mother's Fault)Chapter 5: Our Primates, Ourselves (Or Why We Are Not Slaves To Our HormonesChapter 6: His And Her BrainsChapter 7: The Neurobiology Of AttractionChapter 8: Making Love LastChapter 9: The Mommy (And Daddy) BrainChapter 10: Might As Well Face It, You're Addicted To LoveChapter 11: Your Cheating MindChapter 12: My Adventures With The O TeamChapter 13: A Question Of OrientationChapter 14: Stupid Is As Stupid LovesChapter 15: There's A Thin Line Between Love And HateChapter 16: The Greatest Love Of AllConclusion: A Brave New World Of Love","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N4XM7AJHUZEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451611560#wasThisHelpful","R2N4XM7AJHUZEL","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"de Benoist starts with the very definition of democracy.  The word was coined by the Greeks 2500 years ago to describe a system of government used by some city-states.  Its roots are demos  - people and cracy - power.The Greek city states were small.  The number of people who enjoyed citizenship was even smaller.  No slaves.  A citizen had to be born of two citizens.  Even at that, the affairs of state were sufficiently complex, and the voters so numerous, that they generally had to delegate responsibility rather than decide questions by direct vote.The Greek situation was substantially different from any modern democracy in another respect.  The people - polis - were an organic unit.  They were of one stock, genetically and culturally.  Society was more than a mere collection of individuals: in general, the well-being of society was considered more important than the well-being of any individual.  They would sacrifice an individual such as Socrates for the good of the society.  If he was subverting the youth as charged, it was right to put him to death.Modern democracies are atomistic - composed of individuals.  The remaining nation-states such as the Scandanavian countries are being sufficiently diluted with immigrants that the consensus that a welfare state supports ""people like me"" is being severely tested.  de Benoist writes about the exactly the problem they face - a plurality of values:""The harmony Plato dreamed of nonetheless remains a commendable goal. Pluralism is a positive notion, but it cannot be applied to everything. We should not confuse the pluralism of values, which is a sign of the break-up of society (since, while values only have meaning in respect to other values, they cannot all have equal footing), with the pluralism of opinions, which is a natural consequence of human diversity.""The Greek idea justification for democracy was that it would establish a meritocracy, opening leadership roles up to the entire populace.  Given that, they assumed that the actual leadership itself would always be comprised of an elite.  They had no problem with elites and social classes - their concern was for the quality of government.  This was Plato's major theme in ""The Republic.""  The best government would be that of a philosopher-king.  A good man.  They come along occasionally in history - Pericles, St. Louis in France, Edward I in England, and maybe Lee Kwan Yew in Singapore.  But they are rare, and even these men have their detractors.  As Churchill said, democracy is the best of a bad lot: ""Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried.""  Another memorable quote: ""The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.""Abraham Lincoln said in the nineteenth century that all men were equal under the law.  Twentieth century democracy has transmuted this to the notion that the purpose of democracy is to ensure equal outcomes for all people.  The Communists attempted to do it by brute force.  Today's western democracies are attempting the same by softer forms of coersion - income redistribution, affirmative action and school curricula so dilute that they can no longer recognize superior intellect when it is encountered.This has come about by the continual expansion of the voting franchise.  The founders of the United States set up a republican system, representative government, because they did not trust the common man.  Yet, the common man of that era had to be self-sufficient - there was no welfare.  He was generally literate.  In other words, a better specimen than today's average citizen.The franchise was gradually extended.  In the United States, it first went to propertyless white men about 1825, the time of de Tocqueville and Andrew Jackson, when the country started to be known as a democracy.  Then it went to ex-slaves.  Then it was extended to women.  In the 1970s it was extended to teenagers.  Now it is being extended, state by state, in fact if not in law, to felons and illegal immigrants.  Each European state has its own, somewhat similar, history.  Whenever one political faction has power and feels it can strengthen its postion by adding more voters, they do it.The result everywhere is government by some kind of oligarchy.  In the United States it is a professional political class, dependent on special interests for the campaign contributions which keep them in office.  Attempts to control the flow of money in politics are no more than window dressing, usually designed to handicap one party or the other with the threat of legal liability, while all players keep up the same old games.The oligarchies of the West are out of step with the interests of the people.  Significant majorities in most countries oppose unlimited and illegal immigration, for which the oligarchs, their putative betters, put them down as rubes.  When polled, the people say they are generally queasy about the European project, including the single currency, the New World Order, affirmative action programs and much of the progressive program.  Nationalist parties emerge, including the Front National in de Benoist's France, and are widely disparaged by the rest of the political establishment.  Yet, the technocrats and the moneyed interests behind them, most of all the banks, seem to survive.  They have the power to make the platforms of the major parties all more or less favor them, to exclude ""extremist parties"" which threaten them, and to coopt independent legislators should they happen to get elected.As I write, Italy is in gridlock, with what appears to be a genuinely unaligned movement, Beppo Grillo's five-star movement, dead set against the continuance of business as usual.  The banks in Cyprus have all collapsed and the people are up in arms.  It appears as though the model cannot be sustained.This brings one to the weakest aspect of the book.  For all of its exhaustive list of the shortcomings of democracy, it offers no alternative.  There is no evolutionary path away from control by oligarchs who use the structures of democracy to acquire and hold power.  This is true as well in Eastern Europe, China, Japan and the Arab world.  The alternatives have not changed too much since Plato's time, and none of them are clearly better than what we have now.  Churchill was right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEQSXXZRONJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TXXOYU#wasThisHelpful","R2MEQSXXZRONJE","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rhetoric is the art of speaking.  The Greeks both prized and despised it.  Plato gave the Sophists and rhetoricians a bad name which has endured for two and a half millennia, yet rhetoric has been part of any standard curriculum in the West for much of that time.It is well known that there is a vast difference between the truth of an argument and its persuasive power.  Lawyers have always been suspect: they say whatever they need in order to win.  All of America thought that O. J. Simpson murdered his wife, but skillful rhetoric by his attorney Johnnie Cochran got him acquitted.  As far back as Machiavelli, lying and rhetoric have been recognized as essential tools of statecraft.Rhetoric appeals to three aspects of self: logos, ethos and pathos.  The Greeks named them - they have been studied ever since.  The first is logic - the quality of an argument itself.  The second is an appeal to character, or ethics.  The third is an appeal to the emotions, i.e., ""You can't execute this triple murderer- he's just a boy.""Toye identifies three ages of rhetoric.  An oral age, that of the Greeks, when few people read and wrote, and argument was therefore spoken.  It was followed by a literary age, after the invention of the printing press, when authors were able to start to use longer constructions and more sophisticated vocabularies suited to reading.  It was also a time when the topics of argument became more complex: public policy involved schools and bond issues as often as wars.  It is followed by a second oral age, today, which started just short of a century ago with radio, and has accelerated with the spread of TV and the extension of the voting franchise to just about anybody who owns one.Toye offers an invitation to analyze texts for use of the classical rhetorical devices such as the tricolon and antithesis.  He suggests looking closely at the structure of arguments, oral or written. Tricks: ""Have you stopped beating your wife?""  One of the most valuable aspects of the book is the set of problems he poses for the reader, opportunities to explore how rhetoric is used now and in history.Words alone do not carry the argument.  He offers a discussion of the nonverbal aspects of speech: voice, gesture, and the choice of clothing, venue, backdrop and anything else that will visually sway the audience.Rhetoric depends on the shared values and culture of the audience.  A British political speech is pitched at fellow members of the legislature; a speech by the American President nowadays bypasses Congress, working to sway the electorate to put pressure on their Congressmen.Words never mean just one thing.  Context and time are always important.  He cites literary theory and  deconstruction  - Foucault and Richards et al.  He does not get into semantics.  Others such as Chomsky, Hayakawa and Wittgenstein have a lot to say about the meaning of words, and how much meaning they contain.  Kahneman, Trivers and Ariely among others have looked deeply into self-deception, which often means, of course, allowing oneself to be deceived by appealing rhetoric.The book is erudite while still being easy to read.  The work of a man very comfortable with the language, as one would hope.  A pleasant, quick read.Rhetoric stresses the importance of what is not said.  There is a modern campaign, a highly successful one, to rule out discussion of certain topics.  They are not resolved, they simply remain unarguable by serious contenders.  However, PC goes in and out of fashion.  As a book title says of communism, ""Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More""Conclusion - Read if for exactly what it claims to be, a short introduction.  It is also a defense, and a justification for the study of rhetoric for the sake of recognizing and defending yourself against rhetorical questions (viz, my wife had me smell her wrist yesterday and asked ""Honey, do I deserve this  $200 perfume?"").  If you want to practice the tricks yourself, there are many ""How to"" books about rhetoric, on everything from the art of seducing women, from Ovid through RoushV (whom I review), to the art of seducing voters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJQZM7OB55Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BG73FSK#wasThisHelpful","ROJQZM7OB55Z7","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrii Sedniev is a force to be reckoned with.  At the tender age of 24 he has mastered dance, karate, mathematics, CISCO technology, and public speaking.  I am sure that other talents to be disclosed casually, like ""by the way, on my way to winning the America's cup"" or something equally offhand.We in Toastmasters are randomly called upon every week to deliver impromptu speeches, called ""Table Topics.""  The classic notion, dating back to the Greeks, is that a public person should be ready to hold forth on almost any topic at a moment's notice.  More specifically, an executive should be able to articulate and defend his positions, a salesman promote his product, and a politician argue his policies for any audience, anywhere.Though Sedniev does not frequently reference his prior work, ""The Magic of Public Speaking,"" there is an obvious continuity in the themes.  Just like a martial artist, the speaker has to be up for the game - enthusiastic.  He has to be prepared.  He has to have a repetoire of stories which he can tell on a moment's notice, and the ability to segue smoothly from the question being asked to the answer he is prepared to give.There is quite a bit of advice which is specific to short speeches, what would amount to the answers one might provide an interviewer.  Open strongly, if possible taking the conversation in an unanticipated direction.  This provides interest and gives you control.  Make one solid point, which is all one can hope for in two or three minutes.  Make a short, punchy conclusion, if possible wrapping back to the introduction.This review hits only the highlights; the book takes an hour or two to read, and presents its points in a memorable fashion.  While Toastmasters will immediately recognize its utility, I would recommend it to anybody who is called upon frequently to speak in public.NB: Sedniev talks about mastering mathematics as one of his early-life challenges.  He says that he spent a few months figuring out the sum of the infinite series of inverse squares: 1/1^2+1 /2^2+1/3^2.....  I can believe that he did.  This is a classic problem in mathematics , called the Basel problem, posed in 1644 and solved by the famous Euler almost a century later.  It requires a considerable knowledge of number theory.  The answer, BTW, is pi^2/6.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EVVO7NTN8AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRY1AF2#wasThisHelpful","R10EVVO7NTN8AJ","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two great facts with which the educational establishment refuses to come to terms.  The first is that the system, as it is structured, leaves a vast gap between what students achieve and what they could potentially achieve. The second is that potential achievement is distributed according to the pitiless bell curve.Dale Stephens was an exceptionally talented fifth-grader when he researched unschooling and persuaded his parents, a schoolteacher and an engineer, to let him do it. He had to be exceptional not only in terms of intelligence, but in terms of drive and self-discipline. Simply put, most 11-year-old children are not in a position to take charge of their own education.Although Stephens does not say so, his book is most appropriate for people in the upper ranges of the ability distribution, the people who lose the most when their abilities and interests are stifled by the educational bureaucracy. Though it is not his thesis, I add that these are the instances in which society damages itself the most by forcing bright kids into the straitjacket of conventional systems.""Hacking your education"" is about taking the concept of home schooling, or unschooling, to the University level. Several facts are beyond dispute. The cost of university education is rising much faster than the rate of inflation. It is driven by the availability of money, scholarships and student loans made to ensure that students of modest economic backgrounds can get a college education. The result is that the average college student graduates (or fails to graduate) with $29,000 worth of student loans. Moreover, the lenders have finagled the law in such a way that it is the only debt which cannot be discharged by bankruptcy. Student loan debt will follow a person for his entire life. Stephens looks at this albatross as an anchor which greatly limits what a graduate can do with his life. His first obligation is to feed the beast - pay back the loans.Stephens quotes Richard Arum to the effect that most people who are in college do not know why they are there. They look at college as an extension of adolescence, an opportunity to have fun on somebody else's money before they face the serious business of earning a living. His judgment is harsh: if you do not know why you are in college, get out. Do something with your life, and do not rack up debt.Stephens does go to what is called the agency problem. The University is in business to make money. The professors are there to earn fame and fortune through their research. The other students are there to have a good time. Nobody is there to ensure that you learn. Once you realize that your future is in your own hands, that nobody else cares, the next logical question is whether or not you need the University. The book is dedicated to convincing you that not everybody does.At an annual cost well above the salary what one can expect upon graduation, a university proposes to give a young person three things:* A body of useful knowledge* Contacts which will be useful in life* A certificate attesting to the perseverence and  competence required to complete the degree.Stephens' thesis is that the body of knowledge has been dumbed down, the potential contacts are mostly not focused on classwork, and developing a portfolio of references who can testify to your actual achievement in real work situations is more valuable than a diploma as far as certificates go.  Richard Arum notes that there has been significant grade inflation.  Good marks are no longer meaningful except in the hard sciences.  Attracting and retaining a diverse student body is a higher goal than maintaining academic rigor.  The book ""Mismatch"" describes how this hurts minority students.  In fact, the push for diversity also dilutes the validity of the certificate: employers rely more on other criteria, such as recommendations from current employees, SAT scores, and outside references.The book is full of self-awareness and self-improvement checklists. The self-improvement tips are generally fairly obvious, but nonetheless useful. Get up early in the morning. Keep a notebook - write things down. Keep a list of things to do. Keep a list of things to learn. Make a practice of returning calls. Stretch yourself. One list that I love is a challenge to ask questions that are certain to be answered with a ""No."" His examples include asking people on the street for $100 and asking random girls for a date. His point is absolutely valid. A young person is vastly ahead of the game once he has learned not to be afraid of being turned down, governed only by other people's opinions. Other people will surely lead you to mediocrity.The book is tremendously rich in ideas on how to make things happen. Keep it by your bedside: if ever comes a morning that you don't know what to do, turn to a random page and you'll find some useful advice on how to improve your life. The only caveat is that it invariably takes some mixture of chutzpah and hard work. He has some great advice on how to hack the business of making contacts. How to crash conferences, college courses, and other gatherings of people who are likely to be helpful to you. He tells you how to hack emails - how to get in touch with people who can be useful to you, and how to write an email that will get an answer. He made me feel good. I sent him a cold email asking for a copy of this book to review, and this is the result. Useful for both of us, the way things should be.I found the self-awareness checklists to be harder. He asks ""What Is the Purpose of Life?"" This is a difficult question for any person of any age. Stephens is relentlessly secular. He offers only one answer, essentially that of the Enlightenment philosophers. We are here to maximize our human potential, our personal satisfaction, or our happiness depending on which philosophe you choose. I think the list needs more options. Religious people believe we are here to serve God and to raise the next generation of believers. Traditionalists, often religious, believe that we have a responsibility to pass on the culture which we have inherited, again usually through our children. Conversely, Charles Murray is right when he writes about the Europe Syndrome in ""Coming Apart."" Many moderns' attitude is that ""The purpose of life is to while away the time between birth and death as pleasantly as possible."" In the end, I believe that most kids won't have an answer to this most basic question which Stephens poses.The book proceeds by a series of anecdotes chronicling the success of a number of bright, driven people whom the author has known in his life. By being willing to reach out, to make contact with people who might be able to help him, he has developed an extensive network of extremely competent people. They have fascinating stories to tell. However, these are far from ordinary people. They would not have come to Stephens' attention if they were. The message of the book is cast as ""You might be able to do this."" Let's not kid ourselves; very few readers will be able to emulate the success of his examples. Every reader, even those who will find no role in Stephens' universe can, however, benefit by applying the lessons of self-discipline which he advocates.Two examples come to mind. The first was the viral Youtube of Doctor Ben Carson lecturing President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast in February of 2013. The message was that Carson had overcome the handicap of poverty, a bad attitude, and a single-parent home to become the head of pediatric oncology at Johns Hopkins. Therefore, he implies, there is hope for everybody. Joanne Calderwood writing in ""The Self-Propelled Advantage""describes how her homeschooling regime produced four kids in a row who attended college on scholarships, including one who aced the SATs with a 1600. In both cases, rather like Stephens, determination and self discipline were essential. In all cases, however, the kids could not have succeeded without native intelligence, any more than my native talent would get me into the NBA.  The genetic stuff just isn't there. To pretend otherwise is simply naïve, inclined to raise false hope in kids without the right stuff.  On the other hand, we all can improve.  One of Stephens' better examples is a study that shows how much more successful it is to praise children for work rather than high intelligence. Hard work is something they know how to reproduce; intelligence is a fragile judgment that they may be scared to defend. The value of his book, then, is more in the instruction which anybody can follow than the examples which very few could emulate.Interesting for a man who got involved in a gubernatorial campaign as a teenager, Stephens assiduously avoids any political discussion. Cynics say that student loans result from collusion between Wall Street and Washington: financial institutions are able to profit from guaranteed loans, and the government is able to keep young people off of the unemployment rolls and at the same time buy their votes with the appearance of doing something to help them.  Another reason to avoid the traditional path is that a modern college education amounts to a four-year brainwashing in contemporary progressive thought - read David Gelernter's ""America Lite.""  College is absolutely not the place to learn how to think independently. Stephens does go so far as to call the student loan game a ""bubble"" but doesn't find it necessary to name any villains. He is an optimist; much as he certainly appreciates why these things have come to be, he keeps relentlessly focused on the positive - what to do with your own life.Stephens' bibliography, though well-chosen, is rather thin. He is young and has been doing other things with his life than read. He references ""Academically Adrift"" by Richard Arum, ""Teach Your Own"" by John Holt, and ""The Underground History of American Education"" by John Gatto, all of which I review favorably.I'll close this review by taking advantage of the fact that I have your attention to push my own agenda. I got divorced and moved to Kiev to start a new life five years ago, about the time I started Social Security. I have learned Russian, gotten married, fathered a son, built a house and almost completed a book on my plans to homeschool him.Life should change dramatically when we moved to the new place. I had already resolved to follow one piece of Stephens' advice: start a salon. I am adding four to do's to to my list after having read this book. First, as I write speeches in Russian to present at Toastmasters, I will think of other places that I might deliver them and work hard to get on the agenda of conferences and to speak at universities. Secondly, I will pepper Kiev with emails, looking for more information about homeschooling and looking for contact with other parents who are interested. I have already written that collaborative teaching and learning will be an essential part of my son's homeschooling experience. This book gave me some concrete ideas about how to make it happen. Third, I will volunteer my skills as a writer, translator, editor and programmer to people who are doing interesting work on education in Kiev. Lastly, I'll make a point of making coffee dates to get myself out of the house and involved. Please write me if any of you readers have suggestions to contribute in the way of homeschooling my son, or other books you would recommend that I read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33EIQSY7MR01E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159967#wasThisHelpful","R33EIQSY7MR01E","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The most relevant question is ""Support in what style?""  The Earth could support vastly more people living like they do in rural India than in modern America.We see what has happened to India and China in the years since publication.  They are getting richer; automobile use is exploding.  Therefore, the lower end of his estimates, five billion, appears more likely.A trend which Cohen certainly didn't predict is that vast decrease in fertility. It is below the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman) in countries accounting for the majority of the world population.  It is vastly below replacement in every country dominated by whites and north Asians, the peoples who are driving the world economy.  There has been an abrupt cultural shift in those places.  Having children is not valued or supported by the society.  Individuals are not encouraged (much) to marry and have children.  Conversely, lifestyles / sexuality decisions inconsistent with having kids are gaining recognition everywhere.Cohen's groundwork is an essential support for analyzing more recent trends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OX5WP3IT2TLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393314952#wasThisHelpful","R3OX5WP3IT2TLH","A20O7GFP55GFZB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20O7GFP55GFZB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Running, swimmming and cycling, the big three.  Raise your heart rate to the target zone and keep it there long enough to do some good - twenty minutes or more.I started when the book came out in 1968. I initially ran a mile, then worked up to four miles a day.  What the book didn't tell you is that eventually it takes a toll on your knees.  It may be better now, with well-engineered running shoes to absorb some of the impact, but after about twenty years my knees couldn't take the strain.  Arthroscopic surgery, and then a switch to bicycling and a bike machine.And... I still spend thirty minutes a day simulating 18 mph on the exercise bike, and do a lot of real bicycling and swimming in the summer.  Cooper's work was with young people.  My observation is that the age-based formulas for target heart rate are too conservative.  Though the charts indicate a maximum just over 160 and a workout target under 130 for a guy of 65, I kept the exercise heart rate of 140-145 for decades; I never felt like I was straining myself.  I conclude that the body can maintain an accustomed rate of exertion to a greater age than experts would project.A Soviet-style joke (this will cost me ""helpful"" votes, but I'll live dangerously).  Last summer I cycled across Kiev to a Democrats Abroad picnic.  Several of the old war horses, progressives who had progressed past Social Security age, remarked on the fact that I had come ten miles by cycle.  I told them to think nothing of it.

"I was prepared not to like these very much, because so much bluetooth stuff is junk.However, I have to admit that these are not bad headphones at all. Not only do they have a built-in rechargeable battery, but they can also answer calls if paired to your bluetooth capable mobile phone, with controls on the actual earpieces.Operation is easy and intuitive, and I had no trouble at all using them with very little recourse to the documentation. They charge from the USB port on a computer, or a USB wall adapter.While I generally prefer standard, replaceable batteries (you can always use rechargeables), I am getting used to always having to carry around a USB charging device of one sort or another.The fidelity is nice although not outstanding. One huge plus for me was that the designers had the intelligence to include a wired 3.5 mm stereo audio jack so you can use these are regular, non-powered headphones. Hooray! That is the kind of thoughtful and multifunction design that I like to see. If the battery dies, you can always switch to the wired jack and keep on rocking. Brilliant - well done!While not the smalles headphones, they are light and comfortable, and not distressing to wear for long periods of time.Signal reception seems good, and I was able to walk into another room, with a flat screen TV and a wall between the headphones and my cell (playing music) with no loss of signal.They include a USB charging cable and a male to male 3.5 mm stereo audio cable, but no USB to wall plug adapter.I hesitate to only give 4 stars, as they are close to 5, but the fidelity department and lack of a wall adapter are not quite up to the rest of the design quality and thoughtfulness. I only want to take 1/2 a star for that, so they really are 4.5 stars in my book.Good job, Panasonic.Well worth a look and a listen.

"Pretty much Mackie’s answer to the Behringer Xenyx 1202FX mixer. They are extremely similar in function, channels, layout, etc., with only a few parameters like EQ frequencies being different, as well as being a bit larger.One wonders if Behringer is OEM-ing these for Mackie, they are so alike.Sound quality is good, fit and finish are good, except for a sharp edge on each side of the mixer, where the side pieces come up above the main board level. The Behringer version has a better fit and finish - no sharp edges. A small nitpick, but could be important to some.The special effects (mostly reverb, with some chorus and flanging) are pretty much par for the course for a small mixer like this, and I assume they all use the same DSP chip for that. Not super studio high end effects, but usable for many tasks.The connectors are all tight, the slider moves well and seems good quality, all the pots and controls seem to work well, and there is not a lot of noise. This is a very nice little mixer, and I think you would not go wrong if with it if you are in the market for this kind of mixer.These small mixers won’t cut the mustard for your new hit release, but they are great for podcasts, small PA setups, and various other small mixing uses, even computer audio systems. I use a great many of these kind of mixers in my “day job,” and they are great.Now that Mackie has thrown their hat in the ring in this small mixer market, those who are brand loyal can have a nice Mackie branded small mixer to do all those small to medium mixing tasks. I have had to access Mackie customer service directly once in the past due to a reseller’s intransigence, and the regional rep was instantly in touch and fixed the problem immediately without hesitation. That quality of customer service can be worth a lot.A bit more expensive than a Behringer, but then there are a lot of people who feel that the Mackie brand name on an item is worth it. In any case, this is a nice little mixer, and I will not hesitate to put it to work on any number of audio projects.Recommended. Definitely give this beastie a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TGCLY6QMAOK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND1KHY2#wasThisHelpful","R3TGCLY6QMAOK0","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is quite simply one of the best camera packs I have seen.It is a very well made, solid, and versatile way to carry camera (or other) gear.From the solid base (which it stand on quite well) all the way to the top handle, it demonstrates a high level of quality.The interior can be accessed either from the back through a dual zippered flap, or the top. The zippers seem solid and strong.Inside, there is a lime green lining with matching lime green padded dividers which can be moved around and arranged to fit your particular collection of gear. The padded panels attach with hook and loop flaps and can be moved around to fit your needs.There is a strange (but useful) detachable strap designed to support your DSLR hanging in the top part of the pack.There are a couple of extra zippered pockets, one on top, one on the back, which allow more gear to be carried, and which have smaller pockets sewn into them.There are two side straps above mesh external pockets and some reasonably well done shoulder straps for carrying as a back pack.There is also another large compartment on the back where the straps attach, which runs nearly the entire height of the pack, and has an internal, padded pocket.The quality of construction, versatility, and light weight make this a great choice for carrying camera (or other) gear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TAU3QT6AQO81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ8DRDC#wasThisHelpful","R3TAU3QT6AQO81","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This messenger bag turned out to be a bit larger than I expected, but that is not a problem for me. I am constantly on the lookout for good carry gear, and this bag is great.It is solid and well made - I could find no badly done seams or joints anywhere. The material of the main part of the bag is like a vinyl version of ballistic nylon, but seems strong and sturdy. I haven't used it extensively yet, but have been pretty happy with what it can hold and how solid it feels.It is easily large enough for a 17"" laptop, and I have actually carried a VHS/DVD combo player in it, and, although I couldn't close the cover flap, it still transported the player safely. This is a big bag.The interior can be accessed either by opening the flap, or alternatively by un-zipping a zipper on top - an ingenious design which I quite liked. The interior has many, many pockets of various sizes (none really large, though).The very back storage space (for a really big laptop, let's say) is lined in a soft red material, and has some stiffening material to provide a certain amount of protection. The next largest space, also lined, would hold a 13"" laptop or smaller tablet easily. It also has some stiffening material in the walls to provide a bit of protection to the contents.The area at the front of the bag is the largest, and is lined in the same material as the outside of the bag. This is where you will find the various pockets for separating smaller items.There is a handle on top, but it is not centered with the bag's center of gravity, being situated toward the back, which throws off the symmetry and center of gravity when being carried by the handle. The handle itself is 1.5 inch nylon webbing with a leather (or leather-like) handle cover, and is stiched into a row of 2 inch wide nylon webbing running across the back of the bag. This all seems quite well done and very solid.The shoulder strap is 2 inch nylon webbing with a movable shoulder pad, and while sturdy, is a little bit off to my mind. It rests a bit funny against my body, and I think I just have not quite figured out the best way to carry it.All in all, a great messenger bag with considerable potential.If you are looking for a big messenger bag that is also well made, I recommend you give this serious consideration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36F5NN2WGUFZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O23J6N8#wasThisHelpful","R36F5NN2WGUFZJ","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It really does work. It can be difficult to handle, but I did a few experiments in direct sun on a 95 degree day, and I could feel a pronounced difference when I moved my hand from direct sunlight to behind the film (and it is not that dark, so it wasn't just shading my hand).Applying it to a window, on the other hand, can be difficult. You need ot clean the window thoroughly, and it certianly helps to have more than one person to apply it. Imagine trying to use the worst cellophane wrap and a long string of tape to attach to an irregular surface, and you get the idea. I had the film tear on me because the backing would not let go, it kept folding where I wanted to keep it straight, and I didn't have enought hands to hold the edges straight and pull off the backing at the same time.It is stiff on the clear backing, and the backing does not want to come off. The film also wants to stick to everything, flop around, get misaligned, and so on. You need plenty of room and an extra pair of hands to get it to behave. If you are careful and have help, I think you will be pleased.The film is not very dark at all, so if you are looking for something to darken windows, this isn't it. It is pretty uniform and does not introduce distortions to the window if you apply it correctly. (A squeegee-like tool is included to help flatten it out on the window.)I have not had it long enough to know how well it ages, but it is plastic, so there will be limits. It may also off-gas VOCs, if you are someone sensitive to that.If you need to block UV and some IR (heat) form direct sunlight, I would definitely give this serious thought. Just remember to give yourself enough time and resources to apply it correctly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39C4JGYDX2A75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M4X7I#wasThisHelpful","R39C4JGYDX2A75","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a nice surprise. When I first opened the package, I was struck by how cheap and plasticy they looked.I have been using Leight Impacts for some time, and like them a lot. I have to say that  active ear protection has many advantages. On the other hand, you have batteries to buy, etc., and those little orange foam things can work pretty well, too.I was a bit put off by the volume knob, which is smooth and seemed like adjusting it in the field would be a problem. Such was not the case, however. I found them more comfortable on my ears and head than the Impacts, and the volume knob was not at all a problem (I don't get sweaty hands, though, so it may be an issue if you do).The ear seal worked better than the Impacts, at least on my head, and  the Peltors were more comfortable to wear over a long period of time ( I sometimes shoot for 2 or 3 hours). The audio range was similar to the Impacts, but the mics did seem to pick up more wind noise thant the Impacts do. I found them light weight and not at all distracting - they were not burdensome, heavy, or awkward to wear at all.They were a pleasure to use, and I could almost say a delight. I was surprised and very pleased with these. I have not had time to judge battery life or durability, but so far I like them a lot.If you want to try active ear protection, you would not go wrong to start here. (Of course, I still keep a bunch of those orange foam things around anyway - pays to have backup, they are cheap, and they work.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16C5FGB59Z4SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAM0MFG#wasThisHelpful","R16C5FGB59Z4SV","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tomahawks (or ""hawks,"" to the in-crowd) have been popular in certain crowds for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. While primarily a weapon historically, they can also function as a light duty hatchet, among other tools.Popularized by movies and TV for their use in the American frontier as a Native American weapon, they are a variation of the war club, war hammer, truncheon, or similar weapon, which goes back thousands of years. In trained hands, they are pretty effective.Which brings us to this particular beastie.It came with a reasonably sharp (and slightly protected) main blade (sorry if I don't know all the correct ""hawk-speak""). The handle is not as long as most hawks these days, and it is intended as a light weight, light duty device. It is assembled in parts, with the plastic handle piece held in place by a metal collar, 4 securlty screws in the head (star pattern), and two different security screws (hex pattern) in the pommel. It comes with a heavy ballistic nylon cover, which has a 2 inch belt loop out of nylon webbing. The cover has a plastic snap closure.I'm not a trained user of this thing as a weapon, but I did try some wood chopping and digging kinds of things, and it worked pretty well for being so light. With such a light head, chopping wood will be quite a bit more work, but it will also make this hawk easier to carry. The sharpened blade bit nicely into the wood I tested it on, and I was able to chop out a small piece in a short time. With more weight in the head, it would be easier to split wood.I would think that much throwing would stress the head attachment, which does not seem to be reinforced, but rather a simple extension down from the head which fits between two flanges of the plastic from the handle shroud. The metal may extend the entire length of the hawk, but short of taking it apart or contacting the manufacturer, it is hard to tell. I will leave it to others who might put it through more vigorous tests to let you know how it holds up. It seems pretty sturdy to me, and I would trust it for my uses, but those inclined to throwing hawks could tell you much more about how it will hold up to that.As long as you keep in mind its limitations, I think you will find it is a good value. As a light weight, combination weapon/camp hatchet, I would certainly feel reasonably well equipped for many small camp chores with this along.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PRHAT5YR3R5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3QBYIO#wasThisHelpful","R3PRHAT5YR3R5Z","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kind of curtain ring is very useful for hanging heavy curtains, as they handle weight well and roll easily on most curtain rods.I have used these kinds of rings for many years and prefer them for most uses.That said, they do have a few drawbacks - they are metal, and if that doesn’t fit with your decor or you are concerned about rust and such, they may not be for you.Also if you do not have a very heavy curtain, they can flip over, as the metal ball bearings are the heaviest part of the ring, and can rotate if there is not enough weight from the curtain to hold them in place vertically.Those are the only drawbacks I have found, and do like them for most uses.This set seems quite well made, with the rings being “staked” (the metal flattened slightly) to hold the bearings in place. The bearings roll easily, and the finish seems good - no flakes, marred spots, etc.I would definitely consider these again if I needed more curtain rings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJGSTHLZ9G47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTDO8ZA#wasThisHelpful","R3UJGSTHLZ9G47","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to test this bag, as I am something of a carry gear freak. While I have no use for any child care products of any kind, often one can find some very interesting value in bags designed for a different purpose than what one wants.Hence, I have looked at bags like this for cameras, computers, and other tech carry, and I would even consider it for concealed carry, if I did that.The bag is sturdy, strong, and has several useful compartments. I am not sure how I would re-purpose the removable changing pad, but it could serve to protect a tablet or small computer.It is not heavy, and has quite a bit of carry capacity. It is somewhat narrow, and so would not work for more bulky items. It is very much like a regular messenger bag, and would certainly work for that.There is one large main compartment with two narrow pockets attached to the back of the inside of the bag. These pockets would probably just fit a tablet ( I will find one to test), and would almost fit a netbook.There are two similar pockets on the out side, and some bottle-holding type pockets on either end of the bag. Under the flap, there is the detachable pad and two zippered net pockets.Inside the main compartment on either end are two straps with plastic buckles.A very useful bag for many reasons. If you are looking for a bag to covertly carry something other than baby supplies, this bag would work nicely.Well made and good quality carry gear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190JLCOCNGHYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4PXCZY#wasThisHelpful","R190JLCOCNGHYY","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been studying self-help material for many decades, and by now, most of it is simply recycled from the past.This book is different. While the author draws on the past, she also draws on recent research, and packages the material in a fresh manner.While much of the information is already familiar to me, some of it wasn't, and the author's point of view made several things clearer than books I had read before.In fact, in the first 1/3 of the book, I had two major insights simply because of her method of explaining things.She creates her own system and terminology, but I found it useful and beneficial, rather than silly and vain as with most authors who attempt this.Her treatment of the nature of habits and many different techniques for controlling them blend nicely with her description of human emotions and mental function, which were just detailed enough to be helpful - not overwhelming and complex.I can't imagine someone not coming away from this book without gaining something useful.

"I don't do a lot of blending as it usually takes so long to clean blenders after use.This blender, although pretty limited in quantity and only one speed, did a fair job on the few tasks I have set for it, and cleanup was easier than on other blenders I have used.My main test was making whipped cream flavored with chocolate sauce, and it did an admirable job. It was difficult to get everything out of the jar due to the small neck, but an appropriately sized spatula helped.If I was into making green drinks and that sort of thing, I imagine I would use this a lot. I intend to try it on more projects as I do more mixed kinds of liquids in my diet, and will see if I have anything to add after that.The first time I used it, there was a strong ""new motor"" smell. That should go away as the unit is broken in over time.

"Absolutely amazing.As Truman said, the only new thing is the history you don't know. New things reside in this text.I started reading Crowley in high school, along with other authors in many different areas of the metaphysical arena. While I knew that he never wrote anything directly or openly in his works, I didn't realize just how convoluted and contrived it all was.Rumors persisted about his work for British Intelligence, but the degree and extent of his involvement are amazing. In fact, as I read this book and others, like Bosley's Empire of the Wheel, and McGowan's Weird Scenes Inside The Canyon, I can't help but call into question the extent of secret societies' and intelligence agencies' deep involvement in manipulating popular culture. It makes me feel like the last century was one big lab experiment for some sick elite (which, of course, it was).The author details Crowley's travels, referencing his own work, the writings of others, interviews, official records, and so on, linking him to various schemes and spy missions. It becomes clear that much of Crowley's public persona (personas, actually; he was a man of many natures) was a cover for his intelligence activity, and that at least some of his ""magickal workings"" were simply diversions, deceptions, or covers for his real missions. His involvement in the sinking of the Lusitania is a perfect example of this.He may have been the mystic he tried to convince everyone he was, but given the light shed upon his intelligence activities and how much of his ""mystical"" behavior was a front to infiltrate secret groups and create doubt of his sanity and loyality to the Crown, I am left with large questions about just how much of his supposed mystical achievements were real at all.That he was extremely well educated in many forms of mysticism, magick, religion, Asian culture, etc., is not in question. In fact, his intense study of such things would be a requirement for being able to infiltrate secret societies of all kinds and maintain his cover. He obviously had great aptitude for such things, and probably no small talent at them either. However, the reality of his true powers only he could say (and never would).He does appear to have been one heck of a good spy, though, with many people never dreaming what he was really up to.Recommended reading if you have ever been interested in Crowley, Jack Parsons, the OTO, ""New Age"" counter-culture stuff or even the history of spying. Well worth reading even if you just want to see the extent any country will go to spy on or manipulate an ""ally."" It will shed some light on current events and make you look twice at ""celebrities"" and their political and other involvements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XOF21VTKO29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932595333#wasThisHelpful","R1XOF21VTKO29","AU3GYRAKBUAEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU3GYRAKBUAEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first time I've seen a spray conditioner to go with a dry shampoo spray. I am in love with so many of the Luseta products, they feel and perform like a salon quality product. I never had much luck with dry shampoos, the white powdery look wasn't for me. To use this product, you really have to shake it to combine before spraying and you must hold the can a good 10 inches from your hair. It still left a little white on my hair but a quick brush through made it less noticeable.The conditioner is what sets this product apart, it totally eliminates the whiteness and dullness left my the shampoo. It's pretty amazing. You don't need much, just a quick shot and then finger or brush it through your hair.These two products combined are a great thing and can be a real lifesaver on a bad hair day. I had to dock one point for the overpowering scent. It knocked me back a bit, reminded me of Aqua Net in the 70s....I don't know if that's needed as part of the process that makes it work but try not to use this in a closed area...I still recommend highly, it's my WOW product of the week.I received a sample of the product for testing and review.

"I ship 6 days a week and have a reliable postal scale I've used for about 8 years.  The Accuteck All in One Digital Scale has a few features missing in my first.  I like the flip top for large envelopes or overnight pouches and I also like the ample base and the view of the digital readout. When I place a large box on it, I can easily see the weight as oppose to contorting myself and bending sideways. I also like the plug option for when I forget to buy batteries and  still have to have my shipments ready for pickup. The weights are accurate and exact.

"When I took my acne prone teenage daughter to the dermatologist, he explained how even oily skin (especially) needed to use a moisturizer. In teens, the body goes into overdrive producing oil when the skin is too dry. She started using an oil cleaner and never had a bad acne breakout again. Hydrated skin does not need to produce more oil, simple.I have been using one brand or another ever since I saw it work so well on my daughter. You absolutely can use coconut or olive oil but you will be left with that oily coat on your skin. This Beauty Oil is formulated to foam with water and that is what washes the oil from your skin. I'm not sure which ingredient it is, the label is very tiny.To use, take one or two drops of the Thermale Beauty Cleanser and massage in in, I even used it on my eyes to remove mascara. It totally dissolved all make up and dirt! After you're done, add a few drops of water to your hands and massage it intot he oil on your skin. It emulsifies and gets creamy, the final step in removing the oil from your face. I suggest you wipe off with a washcloth and not too much water.It left my skin so soft, no residue, no dryness at all. It has a slight scent but nothing too heavy.If you use this, you do not need a separate makeup remover.

"The Professional Digital Scale is very slim and very easy to store.  It has a Tare feature so the lack of accompanying bowl doesn't matter. You can use any bowl or plate and just reset it to zero to weigh the contents. You can switch to metric with a push of the button. I compared weights with two other scales and the Famili was right on the money. The readout is large and bright and the surface is easy to clean. This really is a beautiful scale that can be tucked away alongside your cookbooks or in a drawer, it's very low profile.I received the item free for testing, evaluation, and review.

"Argan Oil is usually sold heavily scented and although I like the scent, at some point, all these products start fighting each other and my perfume. InstaNatural's Argan Oil is unscented and a little on the thinner side than some I am used to. This is wonderful for my fine hair, less greasy and absorbs really well.I made a wonderful hand scrub with this oil, InstaNatural Emu, the Vitamin C Serum, Hyaluronic Acid and some nice pink sea salt.  I make about a week's worth at a time to keep the ingredient fresh and to keep it all from separating.  The Emu helps transport the Vitamin C into the layers of skin and the Argan and Hyaluruonic Acid combined with the salt scrubs away dead skin and infuses it with moisture and softness you;ll have to experience to believe. I love this line, everything so far has been excellent, generous in size, effective, and very affordable.I received products for free to test, evaluate, and review.

"I never heard of Hyaluronic Acid until I was given a free sample bottle to try. I was four days post a TCA hand peel and my skin was looking like crepe paper. I used the serum just once and it immediately changed the appearance and lessened the old lady look I was going to have to sport for at least a week. I think it actually helped the peeling process by keeping my hands so moisturized, almost like what happens when you soak a blister.I use it twice a day with some added InstaNatural Emu oil. Emu should really be mixed with all creams, lotions, and serums as it helps transport the good stuff through the layers of skin.It is very thin, spreads evenly and quickly, and I didn't experience any irritation at all. It's a pretty big bottle and a little goes a long way.I received this for free for testing, evaluation, and review but will be buying more when it runs out.

"Cailler Makes wonderful Swiss Chocolate and this assortment showcases some of their very best. My first taste of Cailler was from my niece's trip to Broc where she toured the facilities. She sent me some of the most delicious chocolates I have ever tasted. They are quite comparable to ZChocolates without the extra hefty price tag. This assortment is milk chocolate and when it comes to Swiss, you really want the milk vs dark. Switzerland's milk makes all the difference and it's not to be underestimated when added to the other fine ingredients.Note that the word Praline is used here, meaning the Swiss/French ground nuts, not the Southern caramel delicacies.The box arrived in excellent condition, packed beautifully in a double box, perfect for direct shipping as a gift.I am so glad other reviewers posted pictures of the actual content, my box disappeared within minutes of me opening it and I never got the chance to photograph it.

"I like the look of the Crenova WIFI Camera. It's a simple disk vs the usual bulky surveillance cameras. It very light, almost too light but that makes it easier to mount. It just doesn't feel very substantial. The trim is all painted plastic, not metal so that does make it lighter. This is a stationary camera, you can not control its movement through the app. You can swivel it away from it's base and move it manually though. The video was exceptionally clear and easy to see a birthmark on a face some feet away.  The app is easy to install and set up, I had everything running in minutes.I suggest this camera is good for specific surveillance like your front door or out in a barn to keep on eye on tools and or animals. It's not meant to be monitored as some of the others where you can follow the person around.The camera does everything it claims with one drawback. The video is instant unless you have the sound on. With the sound, the camera lags by about 7 seconds. This is not a WIFI issue as it works perfectly without the mic on.I plan on using it for Amazon review videos where a demonstration takes two hands.I received item free for testing, evaluation, and review.

"This is an incredibly useful thermometer if you have a sick child. It's not meant to just do a quick temp check if you think your child is getting sick. It's designed to be worn over a period of time. It's an unobtrusive way to monitor without having to wake them up, and you for that matter. You can preset it to be warned when their fever rises or reaches the point you need to intervene. That means better rest for both child and parent.The battery life is good for continuous use for a year  but obviously,  it should last longer since you won't be leaving it on. The app was easy to install and use, the Bluetooth connected easily to the Galaxy S4.The medical tape bit comes with to secure the thermometer removes without pulling delicate skin but stays in place to do its job.The readings were very accurate, I compared to a forehead, ear, and digital oral to receive the same result as the Temp Sitter.

"This scent of the Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner needs to be made into a perfume. It is so fresh and delicious, I hate to rinse it off. The scent lasts on my hair all day...something to think about if you're sensitive to perfumes. This is a smoothing treatment for your hair and excellent if you straighten with a flat ion. I couldn't believe how the hair just glides through the iron, totally protected from the heat...and no frizz or scorched ends.This is a little too much conditioner for my fine hair so I avoid my scalp and only use on the ends, every other shampoo.

"Compared to the popular, high priced life case, this case is not only better but easier to use and still completely waterproof. I tested with cardboard before putting my phone in and it was completely dry. I do suggest you always do that first, just to be safe.This case is lighter, better looking, and also has easier access to buttons, all without that annoying muffled voice sound. The screen is very responsive and you get a headphone cord extender so you can still use the jack in wet conditions. It also allows easy charging if you use the Apple lightening cord.

"Another great addition to the Luseta line, the Macadamia Hair Oil Treatment is a must for color treated or overly dry hair. I use it just on my ends because I have fine hair and my daughter uses it all over on her curly mane. This is what I consider a dry oil, it absorbs beautifully, it doesn't lay on your hair. When used on curly hair, it helps define each wave and adds so much shine without weighing it down.  On my fine, straight hair, using it on my ends stops the fly aways and brittleness that always occurs after blow drying. This stuff is a keeper.

"For this book review,  I sought the help of a friend who is a high school ASL teacher/friend.The book aims to teach not only sign language but also the respectful etiquette for communication, such as proper eye contact when signing. The book has a lot of signing basics like introductions, colors and some elementary vocabulary.It also touches on the  way the deaf communicate using a TeleTypewriter (TTY).I find Tree Wise to be more an an introduction to the deaf culture than an actual learning  tool. Unless the reader has the guidance of a person  already knowledgeable in ASL, the illustrations of signing would too difficult for a child to on their own but all the signs are accurate.The illustrations were cute and also very basic, the tree being the best by far. I found the storytelling lacking and maybe having the tree drop apples on the kids' heads was not the best choice, especially since the age group this is geared towards take things so literal and like to imitate.It can be a helpful tool to reinforce sign language basics but I don't see any child learning just by reading this book.I received a free copy of this book for evaluation and review","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QD9B730OXYJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628576464#wasThisHelpful","R2QD9B730OXYJN","A3PEOF0GX4EN38","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PEOF0GX4EN38?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are small, which for me, works very well for use in my homemade Bailey's. They were perfectly finished, no chips or scratches and were ready in a little over an hour.

"I chose these glasses to review because I find Wayfarer the most generic design, looking good on everyone and easy to buy sight unseen. What arrived exceeded my expectations and also proves my point. I had to pry them out of my 21 year old son's hands long enough to give them a once over and check them out. That lasted all of five minutes and they've been in his grip ever since. He loves them and says they're very comfortable and the lenses are clear to see from. I found them really comfortable as well , the arms open and close very smoothly and fit perfectly over my ears.  I too find the lens clear and distortion free, easy to wear with contacts.

"I've been reading about Va Va Ajvar in a few cooking magazines and had to try it. People were saying they bought it by the case, it was impossible to find on the shelves. I now know why. It is absolutely delicious. The jar I received was different from the one displayed on the listing and it was bigger, 420 Grams, not 300. The ingredient list is impressive, just red pepper, eggplant, salt, and sunflower oil. It's 100% natural, no GMOs, low in carbs and fat.

"The Pixnor Facial Brush is a very small, very lightweight battery operated facial brush. It actually feels a little cheap, IMO. It comes with7 options and even one for pedicures. There's no comparison to the sonic or high end facial brushes but it does do what it say. For the price, it's much better than a washcloth and the sloughing stone option gives this brush more versatility. Please note, it does not come with batteries.

"Arrived fully charges and ready to go. The indicator lights are very low key which I like. It has dual ports so you can charge two phones at a time and it has the power to charge them quickly. The Power Bank took an I Phone 6 from dead to full in about an hour and 30 minutes. This is the same time as from a wall charger. The indicator lights only decreased by one at the end of the phone's charging. There's plenty of juice left to charge the phone at least 5 more times. Excellent!It's lightweight compared to some of the other higher capacity external batteries but still is heavy compared to last year's lipstick chargers, that didn't work.These external batteries have come a long, long way and this is a really good one.

"I use coconut oil sparingly because it's expensive and I can only get small sizes locally. This was an offer I was so glad to try, a huge jug of my favorite cooking,wearing oil!. It arrived completely melted, as coconut oil does in the heat. It was crystal clear and the fresh coconut aroma was strong and delicious. The taste is impeccable, it's really just wonderful on everything. When ordering any oil through the mail, freshness is a concern. The company sent product with a date code a year away so no worries about quality or freshness. I don't think you can beat the value of this Cold-pressed, Unrefined, organic, virgin coconut oil.

There is a release button the bounces the probe from its resting position and, of course, your choice of either Celsius or Fahrenheit.

It can determine the rising temperature and then lock in the final within six seconds.The value is incredible and the quality is right up there with the big boys.

This oil did not irritate my skin or cause any issues whatsoever. It has a woody yet slightly citrus scent and it is very mild. If you use it on your skin, no worries of smelling like a lumber jack. It's actually a very pleasant scent.I mix three drops of the Cedarwood with about three tablespoons of coconut oil and store it for use as a scalp treatment, bug repellent, and if I have cough or congestion, I add a few more drops and apply to my chest.I love it and find it one of the more useful essential oils, it's versatile and a good value.

"Lancaster Soft Cremes Assorted Tin comes packed for giving. My first impression was these would be wonderful to send as a corporate gift or food gifts to family. The presentation is excellent and I wouldn't hesitate to ship them directly. Please note, even though they are called ""Lancaster"" and are inspired by Hershey's recipes, they are really a product of CANADA, just distributed by Hershey's in Pa. That said, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for a traditional gift or product from Hershey, Pa, this isn't going to be the one to choose.The caramels are made from a lot of ingredients I never put in mine but some are necessary for stabilization and storage of a mass produced item.They taste good, there's nothing inherently wrong with them but they don't taste ""traditional"" or homemade. They're still better than the bag of Kraft's you find in the grocery candy isle but nothing like some of the homemade types you will find around the holidays from the big cooking store or other vendors. I think if you're looking for a gift to send out to 50 employees for the holidays and want to stay away from the catalogs that sell food sized to fit in a miniature dollhouse, these are a fantastic alternative. They're great for around the house or to serve as well, all individually wrapped and the tin is really nice and sturdy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AVZZXRRJ2AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANRDEI#wasThisHelpful","R1AVZZXRRJ2AF","A3PEOF0GX4EN38","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PEOF0GX4EN38?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my experience, De'Longhi is one of the better appliance companies for quality and customer service. I own a few different products and they have all been top quality in their price range. Their 15 Bar Pump Espresso and Cappuccino maker does an excellent job keeping me highly caffeinated. It's a simple plug in, rinse, and prime setup, the same as any other coffee maker. It comes with three grind baskets for your choice of single or double as well as one for espresso pods. I used Lavazza Italian espresso exclusively as it the best I have ever tasted.The handle is a tight fit which is very important if you want to avoid splatters, burns, and decreased pressure. You don't have to work that hard to secure it in place, another plus.I pulled my first cup and was pretty pleased with the crema from such an inexpensive machine. I know the coffee itself has a lot to do with it but I have used Lavazza on inferior machines and it produced an inferior cup. The espresso was steaming hot and delicious. I don't think you really need an expensive machine for excellent results.Using the milk steamer/frother takes a little practice if you've never done it before but it's really simple. Just take care not to burn yourself. I both steamed and frothed two batches of milk and the machine performed flawlessly. My preference is steamed and it was the perfect temperature, not too cool as to ruin the espresso in the cup. Another trick that you can use is to steam your milk first and pull your espresso over it. It keep the coffee from cooling while you work the milk.I feel you have to have both, an excellent coffee and a quality machine or the end result will be disappointing. If you try this machine with a bargain espresso at a few bucks a bag, you'll get a cup of the same value. I also use boxed, shelf stable milk, ALWAYS. It's a trick I picked up from a European barista and it also makes a big difference, to me.I love this machine and recommend, for the value and the quality of the espresso it produces. It's great. This is De Longhi's all stainless steel version, the operating and features are identical to the black and stainless model, differences are all cosmetic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QXFHYTFL0HU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP6ZNU#wasThisHelpful","R1QXFHYTFL0HU5","A3PEOF0GX4EN38","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PEOF0GX4EN38?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I would have been happy to use my phone for part of the video but I would have no way to record it. They would be great for the beach, water-parks, in the rain, or boating.

"I purchased this for my business and the cover is absolutely adorable.  I couldn't imagine a more perfect cover for our point of sale tablets. There is a shine to the cover which gives it a bit of pizzazz. The four corners are elastic so they're easy to slip on and off if you need to remove the tablet from the cover. The interior is a suede like material, soft and very gentle on your screen. It's also very lightweight, it won't add much to the total weight you're carrying around. For price and quality, as well as instant branding for my FragrantAgent-Pink Zebra business, it's a steal.

"This TENS unit is an excellent unit at an excellent price. We just had to return one prescribed by the doctor or we were free to pay thesix hundred dollar, insurance buy out. I laughed and put it in the provided envelope which was promptly returned. There is no discernible difference between this ChoiceMMed and the fancy priced one. You have the option of stimulation or massage, it's about the size of a thin remote so no bulky pack to walk around with and most importantly, it is FDA approved. You have choices too. You can adjust stimulation, intensity, and speed. You can also choose from multiple preset programs to find what makes you feel the best.  It comes with just four pads so you may want to order some at the same time. The enclosed pads are good for 80 or more uses though, depending on how well you take care to keep them clean and how well you store them. This is a good find, recommended for value and effectiveness.

"Set up was easy. The two pieces zipped together without issue. My bigger worry would be how well this held up to being punched. The top part is very light foam. Having access to a wavemaster xxl at work and reading some of the reviews about this one going over easily I was a bit worried.I am 6'3"" 215. I don't think I am a strong puncher but can bench 315 and so far have had no issues with this bag. Where with the wavemaster xxl I can go pretty much all out, here I need to back down a bit, but not as much as I thought, and mostly just on straight punches near the top. You can hammer fist on it, put it on the ground, knee strike it, kick it, etc....... Jabs will rock it back and forth, but get into a nice rhythm and you can hit it pretty hard on the return. Hits to the body area work well and there is not a lot of slide to it. Yeah if you deck it with a full force punch or kick, you will really flop it, but I almost never find myself doing that. I really went back and forth on this for a few weeks before pulling the trigger, mostly worried it would be to little for my needs,but I am very glad I did get it as it was exactly what I was hoping for.Other benefits are that it takes up very little space, is easy to move around, and seems very well built. The top handles are nice to hold onto for certain strikes and you can do sit ups into strikes on it as well. It also looks great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FICMOBQ428JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUXR59M#wasThisHelpful","R1FICMOBQ428JD","A34GM17T6WTJDK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GM17T6WTJDK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great bench. Ordered with prime and came in two days. Box was solid and no damage or issues. Pad is double boxed as are nuts and bolts, so even if outer box takes a hit, the inside stuff should stay safe. Set up was easy and they include two basic wrenches if you are with out tools. I used a socket set but you could put it together just with what they send you.Bench is very sturdy once up. I set it up and tightened the bolts once level and it is stable. No issues. Pad is thick, firm, and seems of decent quality. Steel is of normal thickness and welds looked good to my eye. The pad measures 12"" across, which was my primary reason to go to this even though my older body solid bench still looks brand new. The body solid pad is 9.5"" across. I am 6'3"" 215ish and having been able to use a wider bench outside my home, I think it supports my shoulders more when benching heavy, as well as supports my body better. Having looked around this seemed liked one of the better bangs for your buck out there and I appreciate the reviewers before me giving their feedback. I am happy with it and was what I was looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B6KOH2TKZZ4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLPZGU0#wasThisHelpful","R3B6KOH2TKZZ4E","A34GM17T6WTJDK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GM17T6WTJDK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went back up to a 28 ounce after swinging a 26 for years. I usually pick up a new bat each season and have been fond of Demarinis and Miken. My only Easton was the original connexion. Although now in my 40's I can still hit for power at 6'3"" 215ish. This bat was surprising good out of the wrapper. I don't know if it was the end load or the extra 2 ounces (or a combination) but I have hit this for more power with the newer ASA balls than anything in recent years. Feels good on contact and has both a large sweet spot and pop. I would think the 26 and 27 ounce bats would be equally good and more useable for a team bat.

I will have to see if this one does as well, but no reason to suspect it won't. I like the ceramics as they are very sharp and really work great on fruits/ veggies.

"Delivery was via truck. They called a few days ahead to set up a day and approx. time. They also set up a call for the delivery day to give me at least a half hour to get home.

Easy to move despite it size as the weight isn't bad on it.The chair is large but light enough for one person to move it. The wicker is very thick, much thicker than cheaper sets. Color on the wicker is deep and dark. The pillows are also very well made with good material, density, and color. The small back pillow has a nice color and design to it. This is a high end chair with good build quality. It also looks great in person with the colors. I am impressed.

I don't feel I need the top notch ones for most of my uses anyways so these basics work great for us.

"I had a DC07 for a number of years and replaced it with a DC50 6-8 months ago. This VU3000 by Samsung is very similar in size/shape/weight to the DC50. What I liked about the VU3000 and why I gave it 5 stars.1.) Build quality is good. Equal to the Dyson from what I could tell. Nice heavy plastics. Hose cord uses thicker rubber between ""slinky"" segments which seem to be equal to the Dyson and I think it will hold up fine. MSRP is pretty good for what you are getting here. 5 year warranty posted on the box.2.) Took me just a few minutes to unboxed it, snap a few parts together easily, and start to go. Everything was well marked and intuitive.3.) Cord is longer than the DC50, I can reach my whole floor from a central jack, can't do that with the DC50.4.) Suction is better then the DC50. Both are very low slung in so far as the pick-up head goes and create a nice suction to the floor. With the VU3000 I have to open the ""back off the thrust"" hole in the handle in a lot of places like large throw rugs, etc.....as it really wants to suck down on some surfaces in its full mode. Doing that is easy as there is a small twist in the handle that opens a dime size whole to take suction out of the system when you are getting to much. Backing down suction is always better then not having enough. Take the handle out and I thought the VU3000 was offering some really nice suction at the nozzle, especially with the narrowing attachment on.5.) I like the handle/hose design. I am taller at 6'2"" and I can pull the handle out and hold onto it while the straight piece runs along the floor, etc...You can also remove just the smaller handle.6.) Turning it into a canister vac of sorts is also very easy and works well. Drops the brush head for weight savings and better clearance as you tote it around. Good design, and like all the other snap together areas, it removes/goes together easily but when together is locked in tight. Combine that with the handle design I like in #5 and I like it even more.7.) Canister dump is easy.8.) Came with extra small spinning brush head.The build, suction, and price on this unit it great. I like the Dyson ball feature and if you could incorporate that into the VU3000 it would be about perfect. Even so the VU3000 ""drives"" fine just not quite like the ball. The DC50 also seems to shed hair off the brushes better (actual awesome in this regard, I have two in my house with long hair and the DC50 brushes have stayed spotless). The ergo handle is the same height and style as on the DC50 so they are equal there. Both heads are very slim and fit under a lot of furniture a few more inches than my DC07 ever did. The canister dump is also a bit tight just like on the DC50. My DC07 had more clearance between the center and sides, so everything slid out easily. As the manufacturers have condensed the vacs into smaller/lighter units that distance has closed enough that the picked up material kind of sticks in there and you need to gently pull it out at times. Both the VU3000 and DC50 do it and it is just a trade off for the small size.Last year I gave the nod to the DC50 over my DC07 despite some trade offs in suction, canister dumping, and shorter cord as I liked the lighter weight, slimmer head, hair shedding from brushes, and ball maneuvering. I am going to lose the ball and hair shedding with the VU3000 but keep the light weight, slim head while gaining back suction, longer cord, better stick functioning, and canister mode. It is a close contest but the VU3000 is going to become my main vac.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R135KPFC53DTTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8IUDT6#wasThisHelpful","R135KPFC53DTTY","A34GM17T6WTJDK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GM17T6WTJDK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set up took about 5 minutes and was pretty easy and straight forward. Decent weight to it and it tears into the ground without issue. I previously had a small gas one about the same size that just didn't want to start after a few years and started leaking around the seals. With electric I am hoping for longer life and less mess.

Pea protein is the main component but that taste is hidden ok.

"When this drops in price every so often I grab a bag as it is the best deal I have found on muscle milk. I usually just drink plain whey protein more than this but muscle milk is by far the best tasting product I have found. This is something I actually look forward to drinking for the taste alone.  I like the blend of nutrients and usually have this at work as more of a meal replacement when time is an issue or the hunger pangs hit and do whey at home for adding protein.

"I am 6'3"" 215ish, older but in OK shape. I found the chute to offer a decent amount of resistance but not overpowering. I think that is mostly due to my size (and probably my inability to run as fast as I once did). The quicker you can go the more resistance I found. I prefer the light resistance vs. something that would feel like someone holding a rope behind me.Build wise I thought it was fine for the price. Straps were good, not overly robust but just fine for personal use. The chute itself feels like a thin windbreaker material. Very kite like feel. It comes with a storage bag. I don't anticipate any issues with it in my normal personal setting, but I take good care of my items. It was actually a bit bigger unfurled than I thought it would be. I think a smaller runner or youth runner who could generate some speed would get very good resistance out of the chute. As it is I think I will get some use out of it this summer or give it to my wife who coaches girls track in a few weeks here. If I go that route I will update this review with her thoughts as well as how it holds up it that setting.If you are like me and don't have any hills nearby or want to add add some resistance to a gentle slope this is perfect. Although to avoid looking like a dork I will probably limit my use to a grass infield/park or track. Gives you enough resistance to be noticed without impacting your stride.

"This latest batch of Sony disks is defective. On six different recorders, one duplicator and three PC based systems, these Sony branded disks failed to record past about 94 minutes. Shorter than that, the recordings came out fine, but after  a 94 minute time, nearly 100 percent of the disks failed to continue recording, and would not finalize or play on any other device other than the device that recorded it. The problem stems from a faulty indication of recording time remaining, which is a status track on the disk that reads back to the recorder. This leads me to believe that these Sony disks are Chinese knockoffs and not really Sony disks at all. I had a similar type problem with some Sony branded memory sticks a few years ago, which turned out to be cheap Chinese knockoffs.

"Frankly, I'm amazed these can be sold for four bucks, including shipping. Cree is a major brand name in LED lighting. The small palm sized flashlight light is made from machined, anodized aluminum. It is precision constructed and feels solid as if it was made in the States thirty years ago. While most of these small lights use a 3-pack of tiny AAA batteries mounted in a carrier, the Cree uses a single AA battery that requires no carrier. Less battery cost and less mechanical contacts to make, so electrical connection is solid and there is no flickering. Rather than several dim LEDs on the front, the Cree uses one powerful LED recessed within the frame and focussed by a lens. The result is a bright, even, circular pattern of light that is more usable in more situations. The light is quite bluish in tint as compared to standard bulbs, but on par with LED lights. The rear pushbutton switch clicks solidly on-off with no in between blink settings. It is recessed to avoid accidental power-up in your pocket.The only disadvantage is it takes a few weeks to come over from China, but it's well worth the wait if you don't need it immediately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLLOBIN3VA3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006E0QAFY#wasThisHelpful","R2WLLOBIN3VA3S","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is especially useful for your store location, or if you set up a kiosk for the day at a local event.

The device can swipe a card in either direction, as there are two sensor heads, one on each side of the card slot. The card slot is much easier to use and reads more reliably than the small square device made for phones.The power cord cleverly mounts flush under the base and faces either right or left, depending upon your choice. It stays in place as the base rotates. The charger keeps the iPad trickle charged to 100 percent and also acts as the main power source when plugged in, saving your battery.The iPad app has additional customization settings that I didn't notice on the phone app. The larger screen makes setting up your account and using the service much more user friendly.

"First and foremost, this Bose unit has incredible sound not only for something so small, but for a speaker of any kind. The bass is full, rich and not boomy. It has a smooth and solid bottom end across the entire volume range. High end is crisp and clear as well. It can go loud enough to fill a room with music but is best suited for high end personal desktop listening. At low volume the device will play over twelve hours on a charge, long beyond its claimed time of eight hours. Lower volume has a great deal to do with increasing battery life just as judicious use of your car's gas pedal has to do with better fuel mileage.The build quality exceeds any electronic device I have ever seen. To say it is a precision piece of technology is an understatement. It truly is a finely made metal instrument, not a cheap plastic device like most Bluetooth speakers. It's good ol' American Tech like it used to be years ago.Controls are well labeled and easy to use. All you need to know beyond the basics is press the Bluetooth button quickly to toggle between established connections and new devices, hold the Bluetooth button down for ten seconds to clear the memory of linked devices, and hold the Mute button down for ten seconds to hard reset the device.There are two connectors on the right side. One for power, one for an auxiliary input from something like an iPod. You can also use it as your computer speaker for a vast improvement over what most computers already use.The only thing I wish they would add is an SD card slot in the rear of the device, as it would be nice to use this as a stand-alone music player.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11G2TIECW541J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5Q75RC#wasThisHelpful","R11G2TIECW541J","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 4K video is simply stunning. The sharpness is unbelievable. The color is rich and accurate and the image is clean even in candle light. The large sensor gives a nice depth of field usually not found in camcorders in this price range. Image clarity blows away the best Canon or Nikon DSR images. Every important manual setting has a dedicated button so you don't have to go menu diving. Even when used in the AVCHD 2K mode, the image benefits from the 4K sensor and 4K quality lens. It looks better than 2K shot with a 2K pro camcorder. The image is more than good enough to use professionally (as long as you don't need to use XLR mics), It's big enough to feel professional yet small enough to get away with almost looking like a consumer camcorder.

"INITIALLY:This cheap, Chinese designed and built device failed after thirty seconds. Worse than that, after making an insanely loud pulsating sound, it shut off the TV. Neither the device NOR the TV would power back on. After unplugging and factory resetting the TV, the TV came back on but the HDMI port the Micca had been plugged into was totally dead. Nothing will work in the HDMI port any more, but the analog ports were unaffected. So yes, the TV still works but without the HDMI port.I had this same thing happen years ago with another Micca device on another TV. I would have never purchased anything from this company again, but I received this device as a Christmas gift. This new device felt as if it was much more solidly built than the old unit. I figured by now they must have corrected the problem of burning out the HDMI port. I was wrong. UPDATE:Micca sent me a brand new unit without my asking them to do so. A nice gesture, but it doesn't compensate for losing the HDMI input function of my TV. I was hesitant to try this on yet another TV, so I set it up using an unused analog port first. It worked. I got brave and tried the HDMI port. It also worked. For the fact that Micca made some sort of remedy and the second device plays well enough to use it, I changed my former one star rating to two. FUNCTIONS:In the days of VHS video, you could simply remove the tape from your camcorder and play it in your VCR. The Micca Spec is the inexpensive answer for today's digital home video shooter who simply wants to remove the SD card, put it into the Micca and press Play. Of course, you need to set up the device to find the files through the menu of your data card, but once you do, this device plays the videos without needing to edit or convert them. It will play from any SD card including the newer, faster 64 GIG SDXC series cards. It will also play video, audio and stills from USB thumb drives.You can insert both a USB and an SD at the same time and choose in the menu which to play. Once you select your folder, it will play all the videos in that folder one after the other and then keep repeating them.Many camcorders today shoot one of three main video formats; AVCHD, MP4 and MOV. Some newer, high end cameras shoot a new format called XAVC. This Micca unit will play all four formats, but not perfectly. Also note there are variations of the data rates in XAVC that can well exceed the 50 MPS rate that tested OK here. There is a mild stuttering of the video frames that makes the normally smooth 60 interlaced frame video video take on the look of 30 progressive frame video. Some users may actually like the fact their videos look this way, saying it emulates the look of film. The XAVC video suffered even more from additional stuttering, but at least you can watch the video.Some bright colors tend to peak out and look overexposed. At first I thought it was how the shot was taken in bright sunlight, but the same file plays OK on my computer without looking overexposed. So it's the player, not the file. While the video may not look as good as your camcorder created it, at least you can play your native camera videos easily on this device. You can also play audio files and jpg still images. CONCLUSION:I find this device useful for previewing and sharing footage right away without editing or converting the files. For the low price, the video shortcomings are acceptable. What is not acceptable is the fact this device can wipe out your HDMI port if the device fails. From what I'm seeing plus what I've experienced with other Micca devices in the past, this unit may not last very long. That is also unacceptable. Modern digital technology, no matter how inexpensive, and despite any operational shortcomings, should always work and should never cause permanent harm to other devices connected to it. Other reviews don't paint a rosy picture for long life. If I get lucky enough to have it still working in a year, I'll raise the rating. But for now, I'm hoping for at least six months of use and praying for no damage to my TV.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P4U1O0IIUCLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NO9RRM#wasThisHelpful","R3P4U1O0IIUCLL","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main attraction with this camera is the 4K video. 4K resolution is simply stunning outdoors and in bright interiors. But there is more to life than 4K video. Low light capability, good photo quality, hefty build quality and audio quality. These are important aspects of a camera too, and the FZ1000 is only average in these categories.Shooting outdoors after sunset, the grain in dark objects began to build up rapidly after the sun set below the horizon. Without another camera to compare this with, or comparing it against old technology, many users might accept this as normal. But next to the now similar priced Sony RX10, there is simply no comparison. The RX10 looks crisp and grain free in the dark parts of the image. The FZ1000 image becomes grainy and the edges of objects mush out too soft as the light dissipates. Any 4K advantage is long gone at this point. The Sony's 2K video reigns king in low light.Still images are pretty clear, but are grainier than other cameras in this price range. Still, for most uses, they should suffice. This is, after all, a hobbyists camera and not a pro shooter.The long lens is crisp through the mid sections of the zoom, suffering a bit in the corners with chromatic aberration at wide angle and full telephoto.White balance tends to lag quite a bit. Large areas of one color seem to fool it into neutralizing that color. For instance, outdoor shots come out with faded greens and too much purple because the dominant green color of trees and grass tends to fool the white balance circuitry. In manual control, this isn't an issue.Video data rate choices are abundant from 12 meg per second 2K mP4 files to 100 meg a second 4K files. It also allows several AVCHD modes in the 2K video settings. Shooting 2K video with a 4K camera yields some pretty sharp 2K images.The internal microphones tend to over amplify soft passages, bringing up lots of noise and hiss. The mics themselves often sounded a little muddy with voices fading fast with distance from the camera.  Luckily, there's an external mic input.The camera tends to feel a bit plasticy and creaky at times for a 900 dollar camera.In summary, for inexpensive self contained 4K video this camera is an excellent choice. There isn't much competition at this time period. If other factors like low light capability, accurate automatic white balance, crisp still photos, great sound and solid build quality are important, there are better choices available. And remember, 4K video requires an insanely fast computer to edit and a 4K monitor to view it. As of yet, there is no cost effective delivery medium for 4K home video.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSEU2FB80944R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOUIBZW#wasThisHelpful","RSEU2FB80944R","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Uqique voice recorder is actually three devices in one. 1) It's a simple voice recorder. 2) It's a tiny mp3 player. 3) It's an 8 gig memory stick. The device itself is the smallest audio recorder I've ever seen. It's actually smaller and thinner than most thumb drives.It comes with a set of ear buds and a special cable that doubles as a USB charging cable and data transfer cable. There is no USB connector on the end of the device itself. The cable is the only means of transferring data or charging the device. Don't lose it.To begin recording, simply turn the switch to ON. A small red light flashes for five seconds as the unit initializes, then recording begins. Turn the switch OFF to end the recording. It's just that simple.When you plug the device into your computer, you'll see a file structure that separates the music from the voice recordings. When you want to copy mp3 files to the device for listening, be sure to drag them into the root directory so the player finds them automatically. You can also drag other types of files like text, pictures, etc for purposes of data storage. You'd probably want to add another folder marked FILES for doing that.Plugging in the cable into your computer begins the charging process as well as initiates the file transfer process. It'll charge fully in about half an hour.The recorded files are WAV format with a 48,000 hertz sample rate, recorded at 192KPS. The WAV files will time sync perfectly with most video editing programs. These WAV voice recordings reside in a folder marked RECORD. The mp3 files for your music reside in the root directory. You can switch between playing from the root or RECORD folder by pressing down and holding the (-) button.The unit has no AGC function, so you must regulate your speaking accordingly. Leaving the unit on a desk and speaking a few feet away yields an acceptable voice note recording with minimal distortion. The sound isn't rich and full but it is very intelligible for voice recordings. If you hold the unit too close to your mouth to record your speech, or if you speak too loud, it will distort but you can still understand what's being said. For classroom note taking, the sound is fairly decent from across the room. This is a voice recorder and it functions well for that purpose. Recording music sounds very thin.When you plug in headphones, the unit knows you'll be listening to music. It begins playing the mp3 files in the root directory, but won't play the voice recordings in the RECORD directory until you press and hold the (-) button. The ear buds are very tinny, but a good set of headphones yields pretty decent audio quality when playing mp3 files.Two buttons on the end of the unit double as music skip and volume buttons. Hold it down to change the volume, or click it quick to advance the songs. Being on the end means the buttons aren't likely to get pressed by accident in your pocket.In summary, this device makes a convenient little voice note taker and small mp3 player. It serves its purpose well for what it was designed to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392T59ZY6TUMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJVIZ2U#wasThisHelpful","R392T59ZY6TUMW","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This grip serves several valuable functions. The first is it takes two batteries, making your shooting time basically all day without a battery change. The second is it allows you to grip with a second hand and when you rotate the camera for portrait shots, you still have a solid right hand grip and shutter button in the correct place.One often overlooked advantage of the addition of this grip to your Alpha camera is making it appear as if you're shooting with a 5000 dollar professional rig. Clients respect it more than the camera alone which looks like every other camera. Even amateurs will move out of your way more often when they see this 'big gun' coming.The only disadvantages?

The lens controls themselves, however, do have a smooth and well dampened feel to them. The totally manual focus is silky smooth with lots of travel so you can develop a feel for the focus without looking at the lens. The focus indicator is on the left side of the lens as opposed to the top, which I find a little odd. For cinema use, however, it could be welcome.Another thing that should be made clear is this lens is TOTALLY manual, not just manual focus. The iris is completely and only manual. The camera will not even recognize the iris setting. In addition, there is no image stabilization when using this lens even though the image stabilizer is in the camera body. This is not disclosed anywhere I could see.On the Alpha series, when using the image stabilizer with other lenses, there is a crop factor that slightly degrades the sharpness and wide angle capability. That crop and sharpness factor is also present in this lens even though the stabilizer isn't active. You must change two camera settings to overcome this. The first is to enable the camera to shoot without a lens attached. The other is to turn off the image stabilizer, which you can not do until you first enable the camera to shoot without a lens attached. Only when you do this will you obtain the maximum sharpness this lens can deliver.Those shortcomings having been said, this is an extremely sharp lens. The softness at full open aperture is very minimal, no more than is present in any lens when wide open. It actually enhances the smoothness of skin tones. There is barely any perceptible chromatic aberration. You'll see it only if you pixel peep on a still shot, but you'll never notice it in a video. Sharpness is consistent from corner to corner at any aperture. There is no visible barrel distortion at the edges of the frame. Door frames look straight at any point in the camera frame. The extra stop of light gathering power is valuable in a dimly lit room where the use of external lights is not permitted. That is a strong reason to buy this lens.This lens is primarily designed for cinema use and is even stated so in the packaging. For that purpose, it is exemplary for a 300 dollar lens. Although I am a strong proponent of manual lens control, I do like the idea of using a built in camera stabilizer for my hand held shots. I rarely shoot on a tripod and although I can hold a camera quite steady as I move about the room, I can't create the silky smoothness of good camera work combined with a good image stabilizer. Of course, a steady cam rig would solve this, but I prefer the freedom of using the camera with no rig attached.If you're using such a rig or are locked down on a tripod, you simply can't beat this lens in its price class. For my event uses, however, the lack of stabilization is a deal breaker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WU12HBFIDWYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFRML88#wasThisHelpful","R1WU12HBFIDWYU","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The device fits properly on most camcorders that have a standard size cold or hot shoe. It is one of only two lights that will fit the proprietary gapped shoe of the Sony AX100. No doubt this is Sony's way of selling their lights at double the market value. I bought this because it is one of only two lights that will fit the AX100. Of course, that other one is an overpriced Sony light as well.There is a variable intensity knob. The light beam is intense enough to be used at the lowest light setting with newer, low light camcorders. This allows the two AA batteries to last over an hour. While the quantity of light is more than enough, the beam angle isn't wide enough to cover the entire video frame at wide angle. The edges around the lit area are soft. In some venues like a person standing a few feet away with nothing around them, the light will be fine on their faces while the lack of light to the sides can be attributed to the distance of whatever is behind them.There are a myriad of other lower cost lights that have wider and more even beam dispersion at well under half the cost of this light. I would buy this only if you have a Sony camcorder that can't accommodate a light with a standard mount.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31280ACUIHT1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMTTO0U#wasThisHelpful","R31280ACUIHT1O","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The sound quality is more than acceptable for a device this size. The controls are confusing and take a while to figure out on your own. The key is pressing the mode button which does several different functions. the annoying colored flashing LED on the bottom can be turned off by holding down the mode button. The time is set using the mode button, the FM scanning and saving of stations is done using the mode button and switching from FM to AUX input also uses the same button. The secret is how long you press it down and the button you press next. The volume function and the forward / reverse functions use the same two buttons, again, timing of how long you hold one down is key. The display shows tracks as simple numbers, shows stations frequency, the station presets and the time, one at a time, of course. Good luck deciphering the Chinglish instructions. I found it easier just to experiment and learn the logic myself. Once you learn the confusing controls, it works reliably and sounds pretty darn good. A hint about FM. Radio receivers need antennas. The antenna here is either the power cable or the headphone cable. If you use this without either, there's no antenna. In that case, only one or two really strong stations might come in depending upon where you live and your distance from an FM tower.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15X5MUX96BTM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0HENPC#wasThisHelpful","R15X5MUX96BTM7","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The wires are thin but functional. The real problem is the cable doesn't function as designed. One would expect that the adapter would allow one mike to work on the left channel and the other on the right. If not, then both mikes on both channels. Neither is true. It doesn't work at all because who ever designed the wiring had no clue what they were doing. They have the hot leads grounded, effectively shorting the mike signals. Rewiring the two XLR connectors solved the problem (the 1/8 inch plug is sealed in plastic and can't be accessed). The way it should have come wired is this. Pin 1 of one XLR goes to the tip of the 1/8 inch plug. Pin 2 of the other XLR goes to the thin ring on the 1/8 plug. Pins 1 and 3 on each XLR are wired together and connected to the large ring on the 1/8 inch plug. You'll need an ohm meter to trace the right wires, but if done this way, it works well. I also knotted the wire inside the XLR connector to provide strain relief, because without doing that a sudden pull on the cable would disconnect the wiring inside the XLR plug.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PL56BG6A6KCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTXBXUW#wasThisHelpful","R2PL56BG6A6KCE","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With so many complicated devices being made, I was drawn to this by its elegant simplicity. It does only what it is supposed to do - play music. No clock to set, no annoying flashing lights to waste battery power and no multi-function buttons to hold down for specific lengths of time to access some esoteric function you'll only use once to see what it does. And, of course, no tiny menu that you can't see without a magnifying glass or that crushes into the unit and breaks if you grab it wrong. It's built like a brick outhouse from an aluminum frame. Plus it sounds about as good as can be expected for a device its size.So why only two stars? Because the sound drops out intermittently for a fraction of a second several times over a song. It's almost like someone keeps pressing a mute button every minute or so just for a fraction of a second. I have had three of these units and all three have the same problem.

"So much technical info is already available on this camera, so I'll get right to the point.The video and still imaging created from this camera even using the kit lens is absolutely stunning. Right out of the box, all you need to do is charge the battery, insert an SD card and you can begin shooting incredible images in full automatic mode that compare or surpass the quality of APS DSLR cameras like the Nikon D3200, the Alpha 57 or Canon T3i. Color saturation is near perfect, color accuracy is just about what your eye sees and the exposure control is very smooth to react to changes in light. Auto focus is very smooth and does not hunt and peck in video mode. It seems to always find perfect focus while being nearly transparent to the video, meaning all you see is a consistently focused image from 12 inches to infinity. Chromatic aberration and edge softness are not objectionable even with the kit lens; a result of the camera's firmware ability to correct issues even in the kit lenses. Upgrading your lenses, however, yields even more stunning results.In short, this is the best automatic shooter I've ever used, and I've used hundreds of cameras. Image sharpness is very crisp without over processed edges. Diagonal straight lines show no aliasing stair stepped look when tilted at odd angles, and the kit lens shows no noticeable softness in the edges or chromatic aberrations in videos. Still images look sharp and crisp with only a tiny hint of softness in the corners if you pixel peep into the image fully. It's a really crisp kit lens for all but the most demanding professional uses.Low light capability is very good up to ASA 6400, a notch above even the rave reviewed Lumix FZ1000. At ASA 12,800 and 1/30 exposure, this camera practically sees in the dark at the expense of some subtle film-like grain. ASA 6400 is good and ASA 3200 is excellent. An unusual feature is the ability to pre-program the automatic ASA limits on both the high and low ends anywhere from 100 to 12,800. In short, the manual controls offer the ultimate creative image control in a camera you can fit in a large pocket.Now, automatic shooting aside, you bet there will be times when you want to take control. The A6000 gives you complete manual control of each function individually as you wish rather than tying two functions together. This means you can set your aperture, set your shutter speed, set your white balance to any Kelvin temperature, use manual focus and let the ISO be automatic. Or any other combination of manual and automatic control you desire. And they're all available via a camera knob or button and can be changed on the fly while shooting video. Other cameras I've used give a stair stepped transition in lighting intensity with certain combinations of manual and automatic control but the A6000 transitions are smooth no matter how you set the functions.For those who like automatic functions, you can leave this in full auto mode and get consistently good still shots and awesome video. The video is way better than even most of the Sony Alpha DSLR-sized cameras like the Alpha 57 or Alpha 77. Dabbling with the manual controls brings forth even better imaging when lighting conditions are less than ideal. What's nice is you can select a single manual function while leaving the rest automatic, or set everything manually and leave just the ISO automatic. This becomes really important for video. In ISO only auto mode, you can control your aperture and shutter speed while allowing the ISO to adjust the gain automatically for changing light conditions. But suppose you don't want the gain to rise to the point where the image gets grainy? You can program the ISO to be variable only between two preset levels, say from ISO 125 to ISO 4000, or any other settings you choose. This allows just enough variable light control for the conditions you're shooting in, while not going to the extremes of overexposure or too much grain. White balance can be set manually, automatic, pre-programmed for your favorite three presets or dialed in manually in 100K steps from 2500K to 9900K. In addition, you can fine tune each of those settings to precisely match your lighting, then take it up or down manually to warm up or cool down the image as you see fit. Add in the ability to manually control sharpness and color saturation and you have one heck of a video camera. Video shot with this camera is good enough to use commercially, assuming of course, your client doesn't see you using a pocket sized camera. You can shoot in very low light without dark backgrounds looking grainy. You can shoot spotlight illuminated actors on stage without blowing out the faces with overexposure. It's simply amazing how much manual control this camera allows. You might expect this on a full size 3000 dollar camera, but on a pocket camera under 500, it's almost unheard of.The camera grip provides a secure hold with one hand. The left mounted viewfinder makes for easy viewing without nose smudges on the LCD. Build quality is solid and tight with no squeaky plastic sounds when you grip the camera. An industry standard hot shoe tops the camera. It has the standard electrical contact for use with other brand flashes in addition to having the Sony proprietary contacts for use with Sony microphones or lights.Sound quality is rich and crisp with no undue AGC pumping action. AGC is smooth and gradual without intruding on natural sounds. The internal mikes are on the front of the camera and provide excellent vocal presence for home videos. My advice here is to remove the camera strap holders if you don't use a strap, because they'll rattle against the camera if you don't. There are no adjustments for sound and there are no ports for external mikes or headphones except by using the Sony hot shoe. It's a shame, because the image quality of this camera is good enough to make films that look great.If there's one thing I think is below par, it's the image stabilization. It is OK for handheld shots while you are standing still, but it doesn't have enough latitude for silky smooth videos while you are walking. The little brother to this camera, the RX100, has much better image stabilization. On the A6000, stabilization is in the lens, and another lens might offer better results. Also, the power zoom is a slide switch on the side of the kit lens. It feels rather odd and not intuitive, but it works. Any other lens, however, eliminates this issue.In summary, if you need a small jacket pocket camera/camcorder and want image results as good as a mid level DSLR, the a6000 is one of the best choices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EUYCPZBCE4YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8BICB2#wasThisHelpful","R3EUYCPZBCE4YJ","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent phone for use with a magic jack or similar device. I use it with an ATT wireless home phone device which works through the cell towers.

"Yes, I know two newer models of this exist, but I wanted a camera that could fit in my front pants pocket. A video camera I could always have with me that would also produce professional quality video and good stills. This original model is smaller and less expensive than the newer one. It fits in my pants pocket. The newer one doesn't. The best camera is the one you have with you.When I shoot a paid gig, I bring pro equipment that looks the part and gets the shots. It is disappointing to be somewhere when a video op presents itself and my dinky camera can't cope with the low light. The Sony RX100 doesn't let me down here. When the house lights go down, this camera can see better in the dark than I can see with my own eyes. If I can see it, so can this camcorder. I could literally shoot a paid gig with this, and the results would please almost any client. As long as they didn't see the small size of the camera. On the other hand, at a wedding, using this I blend right in and no one would ever suspect I wasn't a guest. I can get shots with this where my pro gear would make the guests clam up. Shots where the groomsmen speak their mind because they're talking to a friend and not a camera. It's priceless later on.No, this won't get quite the same results as bigger cameras like the new 4K camcorders. When I compare this to any 2K camera, however, I'm looking at results that are closer to pro level than consumer level, and this shoots magnitudes better video than any other camera this size. At this price and size, there still is nothing that can generate pro looking video as good as this camera, save for the newer versions of this model.In full automatic control, the color is accurate and well saturated without looking too much so. Video is devoid of grain until you get down to 6400 ASA, and even then, it's not bad. At ASA 6400, it looks more like 16mm film grain than video noise. Lens sharpness is good corner to corner, but not as tack sharp as the new Sony 4K camcorder shot in the 2K mode. Still, there's no noticeable chromatic aberration (color fringes) around objects in the corners. Exposure is rock solid, and turning off HDR setting gives a film-like high contrast gamma.Some of the features I like are the total independent manual control of all functions. I can program the buttons for my favorites so I don't have to dig through the menus too much. The manual focus ring is smooth and well damped to prevent accidental focus slippage, and the video peaking lets me see exactly when the focus is perfect, even if I can't see the screen clearly. As I stated before, I can create pro results with this thing as I never could with another camera this tiny. Looking at the finished product, no one would ever know I didn't use a pro camera unless they saw me actually shooting with this.Still shots are good but could be better. The lens, though great for video, tends to be just a bit soft for stills. This can be an advantage for portraits, however, as skin tones look quite natural without bringing forth the flaws.In the end, using any camera is about creating visual art. In the hands of someone who knows how to compose the shots, utilize lighting and manage the camera settings, an indie film could be made with this that would hold up on any big screen TV or local theater.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AHODSZNGSTTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00889ST2G#wasThisHelpful","R3AHODSZNGSTTY","A195EZSQDW3E21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A195EZSQDW3E21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently bought a bunch of corsets from Camellias to try and this one is my favorite. Out of all of them it is the most heavy-duty and creates the most dramatic shape. I am no stranger to corsets, I paid $200 for a custom corset. A lot of the Camellias corsets I tried were similar in quality but I'd say this one is the most so. It has real steel bones, I checked them with a magnet, it sticks all over the corset. The one thing that stands out that it doesn't have is waist tape, it may be sewn inside and be invisible but I can't see or feel any.This feel like a heavy cotton twill like my custom but the tag says it is 90% polyester, 5% cotton, 5% elastin.

I thought I would be one of those people when I bought mine but turns out I don't want to wear a corset every day so I wear them for fun, fashion and photo shoots only. I recommend this corset for anyone but the most dedicated tightlacer and honestly I wish I'd skipped the $200 custom and ordered this instead.Sizing: size down from the size chart. I ordered a small and the size chart says I should have a medium, but I am now exchanging most of my mediums for smalls so the corset waist size is 4"" smaller than my natural waist size. I found most of the ones that were my size according to the chart I was able to completely close right away.Tips: 🔹don't pull it as tight as you can when you first put it on. Make it only moderately tight and then after 45-60 mins pull it a little tighter, go gradually. Also only wear them for a few hours a day for about the first week or longer. Or gradually increase the time you wear it. The corset and your body need to both adjust. It will mold the corset to your body shape and make it more comfortable and also extend the life of it.🔹Straighten the back panel as you go. It's stiff (boned) so it won't bunch up and if you adjust it as you go you can get it in the right place.I received this free for honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCQ3489CBK21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FJKMWS#wasThisHelpful","R2SCQ3489CBK21","A2UNWFVHL0JWBH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UNWFVHL0JWBH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately when I ordered this my correct size was not offered so I ordered one size up. It's not tight enough to be worn for any sort of waist training but it's fine for a fashion corset--This would be an excellent waist cincher had I ordered my correct size. The material is strong and thick and it has the same rubberized outer layer as another similar Camellias cincher I got in my size (which I love.) This model is a little different than others I have used. You wrap it around and hook four sets of hook & eye closures in the front, similar to bra straps. Once you are properly cinched in you zip up the front. The first time I zipped it I had a little trouble but then I got the hang of it. You must hold the zipper down with your fingers until it's seated well and aligned and then zip it up, similar to a jacket but since it's tight you have to be a little more careful.Note: I posted photos of it over my clothes. Since I ordered too large a size and it is not tight enough on me to really cinch much I didn't show a photo under my clothes. If I exchange this for a smaller size I will update with new photos.I received this product free for honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPD1MID53F6PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154C54S6#wasThisHelpful","RPD1MID53F6PS","A2UNWFVHL0JWBH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UNWFVHL0JWBH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice corset, it is not a cheap costume piece. I have long been interested in corsets and ordered a custom one for $200 that is actually pretty similar to this. The heaviness and construction is similar, the big difference I can see is the outer hardware on this one isn't as nice or thick as my custom corset. The outer material on this is silk, my custom is a thick cotton denim-like material. This is well made and honestly I'm shocked how nice this is for the price. If I had known I could get one like this for under $40 I would never have bought a custom one. This one looks great over clothes too, I love how it looks with a black dress. There are real steel bones in this, I checked with a magnet.Sizing: I ordered according to the size chart. The fit is good but I feel I could have ordered one size down because the corset edges were completely touching when I laced it up and I would have preferred a gap so eventually I could lace it tighter if I need to. I was able to lace it up just as tight as I wanted, and since I'm not planning on becoming an everyday wearer or a ""tightlacer"" this size is just fine for me. If you are a seasoned corset wearer you will probably want to order one size down from the size chart suggestion.The lacing is correctly done, it pulls tight from the smallest part of your waistline instead of at the bottom. The top lacing and bottom lacing are a continuous loop. I didn't have anyone to help me tie it but it is a lot easier if you have help lacing it, however I was able to pretty easily do it myself.Suggestions:🔹Tie it only moderately tight at first, once your body adjusts (in about 30-60 minutes) you can gradually increase the tightness. Start out wearing for only an hour or two for awhile and gradually increase the time you wear the corset as you adjust to it.🔻Don't tie the laces around the front of the corset, it wears out the material and ruins it.🔹Adjust the back modesty panel as you lace it.* Disclaimer: I received this product free for honest review with no obligations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PI9PSRSDDK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012V68YVC#wasThisHelpful","R23PI9PSRSDDK7","A2UNWFVHL0JWBH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UNWFVHL0JWBH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My boyfriend burns through about one belt a year so I got him this super durable leather belt. It's stiff and strong and I bet this one will last longer than one year. The leather feels like it could use some oil, it feels strong but the stiffness could be lessened with some Neatsfoot oil or leather conditioner.

"This pillow is my favorite, I almost can't sleep without it now. I like how you can put one end under your head and hug or rest your arm on the middle section and hold your knees apart with the other end. Before I got this I kept trying to use a regular pillow between my knees and it would end up on the floor every night. This pillow stays put. When I turn around to face the other direction the pillow hugs my back and keeps the draft out. It's honestly the most comfortable, wonderful body pillow I've ever used. It's soft but somehow keeps its shape and doesn't squish flat. I never thought of spending $60 on a pillow but I would buy this again in a second. My boyfriend calls it my nunchuck pillow.The one thing I don't like about it is the fabric really picks up lint.

"I am very picky when it comes to brushes. I have a lot of different sets to compare, they don't have to be expensive but they have to be the right fullness and weight to properly apply the makeup they are designed for, they can't poke my eyelids or be rough and the bristles can't fall out on my face. These brushes are really, really good. They feel good on my face and blend well. They apply makeup well. I do wish the stipple brush (big full flat top brush) was a bit denser but it's okay, good dense ones that are also cheap are very scarce. I use these brushes every time I put on makeup and I love them. The beauty blender sponge is not the name brand one but it works pretty good though I have never splurged on a real one so I don't know what the difference is. I've used it to put on blush and contour but my favorite thing to do with it is pat it over my foundation and blend it into my hairline to make sure everything is even. These are AWESOME brushes and very affordably priced. I would buy these again in a heartbeat.In my photos there is some makeup on some of the brushes, I photographed them right after using them and you can see how they look after they have a little makeup on them. You can easily clean them with gentle soap (baby shampoo or a soap created for brushes) in cold water and lay them flat on a clean towel or paper towel to keep water out of the ferrule.(Product provided free or at a reduced cost for honest and unbiased review.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29N2A03N6NMJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017B9SSOW#wasThisHelpful","R29N2A03N6NMJU","A2UNWFVHL0JWBH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UNWFVHL0JWBH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am by no means a professional photographer but I really wanted to try some lenses at a low price. For under $10 the price is right for this kit. I found I had to take my phone cover off which might be bad for people with a hard to remove case but for me my case is made of silicone and slips right off. The lenses work fairly well. You have to have them exactly centered over the camera or the edges will be blurred. They work decently well but they are a bit of a hassle because of how you have to have them placed just right and adjust them with the camera on so you can see how the photo will look. To give you an idea if you touch the clip or bump it you will have to readjust it, it's very sensitive.

"This bra is really nice. I usually wear a 34 C-D, depending on the brand. I ordered a 34C and it fits perfectly. It's very comfortable. It's not padded--at least not for lift or size--but it does have a thin foam layer inside the fabric so it's not thin enough to show through, especially in the winter (if you get my drift.) It came with an extender to give this another 2"" or so, making this work for a 34-36. This color does say brown but it is the nice dusty purple just like the photo. The extender is pink though, not sure why there are two colors. The band is nice and wide with 4 hooks and the shoulder straps are wide enough to give support and not dig into my shoulders.

This is perfect for vacations if your hair needs some extra help, especially if you are at the beach or using the pool and exposing your hair to chlorine. My hair feels really dry after being in the saltwater all day and this hair masque really helped. The squeeze bottle has a pretty grey/mint color scheme and a thick, creamy consistency. It has an herbal floral scent, it's difficult to pinpoint what the scent is but it's not overpowering. I wash my hair first, apply the mask and then let it sit while I do everything else to leave it in as long as possible. It says you can leave it on up to 5 minutes and I don't time it but I'm sure I leave it on longer. It rinses out well and leaves my color processed hair much softer.

I have not been great about exercising, my diet is fairly good and I'm inconsistent about drinking enough water but I am thin, just not as firm and shapely as I prefer.

"This is a great book. Highly readable and it answered a lot of questions I've had about effective online teaching. It seems mostly aimed at those who oversee online instructors and online education programs, but if you are a student thinking of taking online classes this is quite interesting since it will help you evaluate your different options to figure out ahead of time which courses or which programs or online sites will be the best for you. As someone who has taught classes (not online, and not recently) I thought it was interesting as well, as when I was teaching I never had a clear idea of what was really expected of me other than a bare outline of a syllabus that was provided for me.

In fact, I would say in general this is a kit that can be a great bonding experience between parent and child but with so many fizzing, exploding, launching things this is just a recipe for trouble if done unsupervised.

"Great, old fashioned style of carrier. I was thinking this would allow your child to sit up a bit higher and I thought great for stuff like parades, but really they sit with a view more of the back of your head. Nice for hiking when there are things to see from side to side, or for grocery shopping (pretty good for keeping little hands from grabbing stuff) at stores with bigger aisles (you might really injure someone just by turning around in a store with narrow aisles, or maybe knock a bunch of stuff over. It's like those kids that get on the subway with a giant backpack on and they have no idea they are suddenly a foot wider from front to back. And by kids, I also mean Silicon Valley nerds on the train.)

Windows 10 installs very easily all by itself.So, after I installed Windows 10, I kind of forgot about this book for a while and just started using Windows 10. It seems pretty easy, a few changes in the interface but overall things are easy to find and not anywhere super weird. I did want to remove some stuff from the startup menu and ended up googling the steps for that and it was super easy.Finally, I thought I'd read this book and learn about all the cool new features of Windows 10. It does go into detail about some new features, but it also contains info about a LOT of really obvious stuff. You could easily upgrade to Windows 10 and NEVER pick up a book about it and never feel like you missed out on anything. If you wanted to be really sure, you could google something like, ""top new features of Windows 10"" and you'd be all set. There is so much of the obvious stuff in the book, that it gets in the way of finding the stuff that may not be obvious. Maybe it could have been organized in a way that made the trickier stuff or cooler stuff stand out or stand alone.

"I started following Kevin Gianni on YouTube about seven years ago when my then-boyfriend and I became vegan and I wanted to find any way I could to help him stick with it and make it about health (for me it was an ethical choice.) Kevin was traveling around the country in an RV with his wife, making a bunch of vlogs and themed videos. I never became a raw foodist, but I did follow a number of raw foodists like Kevin Gianni on their YouTube channels and blogs and took whatever healthy tips/recipes I could from them. Eventually, my interest in these videos waned as most of these people seemed to take a journey away from raw food and also seemed to pimp their own products more and more. I didn't subscribe in order to have someone sell me stuff and Kevin Gianni is one of the worst with the ""all content contains an ad and promotes my wife's skincare line"".So, having said that, this book is, surprisingly, mostly ad-free. Hurray!I liked this book not because Kevin is the best writer (he's not, but he's not terrible, either) or because it answered all my questions about food and eating (it doesn't) but I liked it because Kevin does explore a few subjects in interesting ways. He did remind me of Jillian Michaels, though. I'll explain: If you've only seen Jillian Michaels on The Biggest Loser then this won't mean anything to you, but if you've listened to her podcasts you can really see her taking a journey. She reads a bunch of papers in medical journals and talks to some experts and gets really fired up about certain things and then preaches it to the world. If you fast forward a few years, you will find she is just that much further down the road of her journey, and now eschews at least some of what she was saying before and has a bunch of new ideas. Kevin Gianni is the same...he's on a journey, and really this book reads like he's very much in the middle of it and still getting his act together. In fact, I think he may have published it a bit prematurely. In the meantime, however, he does have a few good pieces of advice and has researched some things in depth, like coffee, although I was surprised he didn't go into anything like roasting your own beans after sourcing them from somewhere like Sweet Maria's. I look forward to Kevin's next book, in maybe another five years, to see how his opinions and ideas have changed over that time.I had originally purchased this for Kindle, but I was then offered a hardcover review copy and I'm really glad I took it. If you have a choice, I recommend the hardcover as it's a very nicely laid out book and a much better experience than the Kindle version.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R0ZKIELU66MJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401946178#wasThisHelpful","R1R0ZKIELU66MJ","A1VQBEW0G4IH1J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VQBEW0G4IH1J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Probably no-one in the hundreds of SUVs and pickup trucks in the parking lot is going to swoop in, detach the trailer from my bike and zoom off with it, but with this cable lock I just have more peace of mind and will even spend longer in the store without trying to glance out the window every ten seconds.

"This rice cooks up quick (20 mins, and if you're lazy don't even stir it) and into surprisingly firm, individual grains for a parboiled rice. It's not my favorite rice ever, but it's great for when you're in a hurry, holds up well under heavy sauces, and it's great in soups where quick cooking and the ability to hold a firm texture is a big plus. Would also make great red beans and rice (I made it and put a curry with garbanzo beans and potatoes over it, but now that I've mentioned it, I want red beans and rice!) Definitely a great thing to have in the cupboard for when you're trying to throw something together.

"I love the design of this cat fountain. It takes the idea of the water bowl with a spot for a jug of water that you tip upside down and improves it by putting a lid on the jug that doesn't dispense any water until the jug is all the way into the bowl. Then, it adds a fountain to the whole thing.My cats didn't seem as enthusiastic as I at first, but this may be partly due to me taking away the old water bowl, installing this in its stead, then setting a couple Aerogardens on the floor nearby that I was cleaning out by running bleach through them. Suddenly, no old water dish, just three bubbling contraptions and the smell of bleach in the air. After that, it seemed like I never saw the cats drinking any water - really, it's not the kind of thing I normally sit around waiting for them to do, but one cat had a tendency to come away from the water bowl with a wet chin and walk around that way for a while and now...no wet chin.It's been maybe ten days and I have now seen all three using it all the time, although no more wet chin so that's odd. The bubbling fountain aspect of it doesn't seem to bother them, but you can give it a little turn and it won't bubble any more just in case. This is also handy if the noise bothers you when you're trying to sleep. (Most people are probably not sleeping in the same room as the cat fountain, but I think there are plenty of reasons you might want to ""turn off"" the noise of the bubbler for a while.I'm not going to take a star off for this BUT I wish this was ceramic and glass instead of plastic. I used to have a ceramic fountain for my cats and I couldn't remember why I got rid of it until I got this one. It was because, as beautiful as it was, and it did have a lovely design, it LEAKED. It also got really noisy if it ran low on water which of. course. it. did. because it LEAKED. This Oster Fresh Sips doesn't leak and it's very easy to tell when you need to fill the tank with water again, and like I said, because of the cool cap thingy on the tank, it doesn't even spill out when you go to place it back in the dish. It just would be a teeny, weeny bit better if it was ceramic and glass.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLS8OGWW87TZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HAWD1W#wasThisHelpful","R3SLS8OGWW87TZ","A1VQBEW0G4IH1J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VQBEW0G4IH1J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have seen some people mention keeping track of the little parts, but they are not that little compared to 11 1/2"" doll accessories or Littlest Petshop pieces (ugh about those) and they are magnetic.

"This wearable toy is pretty awesome. You get to wear the ""repulsor"" and then it tells you what to do as you interact with the action figures on their base stations. You might think doing this without a video screen would be weird or not so much fun, but this makes it seem like interacting with stuff on a video screen is what is weird and limiting. It may be worth it to get a second repulsor, so two can play. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it needs about a zillion AA batteries.

"This book gives the impression that since previous Frozen Hairstyle and Disney Princess books did well, Disney wanted to cash in some more and put out another book but didn't want to put in a lot of effort and ran out of hairstyles.There is information about basic hair care and using hot irons. Then there is some information about basic things that have nothing to do with Frozen, like teasing your hair and different ways to make curls, braiding a scarf into your hair, that look like they came straight off YouTube. We are shown how to glue glitter onto a hairbrush. There are pictures of the Frozen characters here, but their hair does not match the hairstyle you are making.The next part is how to make accessories with a hot glue gun. Again, you are not making anything that matches what a Frozen character wears. Also, the photography looks nice, but if you're looking for explicit how-to photographs, it is lacking.Finally we come to straight-up hairstyles and braiding, and these ALSO do not match Frozen characters except the very first one pretty much does. The instructions aren't very good and there was one I read five times and still couldn't figure out what they were trying to teach us to do. (The ""super long"" ponytail. I finally think I figured it out, but I think it only looks good on the model because of just the right camera angle.)There are a few good tips in this book, but it drove me crazy that other than one long braid down the back you don't learn to make a single Frozen hairstyle, and if you're just looking for a more general hair care and styling book there are better ones out there.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEAF1I0RQPTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940787351#wasThisHelpful","R2MEAF1I0RQPTF","A1VQBEW0G4IH1J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VQBEW0G4IH1J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am overall impressed with how much this doll looks like Mal (daughter of Maleficent) at the coronation in the movie ""Disney Descendants"". The dress is really accurate, although there is a kind of tulle layer between the other layers that I thought they ran out of on the dress on my doll or that maybe they placed it wrong. Looking at the product pictures, I guess they are all like that. Anyway, looking at all the details they really did a good job and even the face is very expressive and she's paler than the other DD dolls, just like the Mal character, and has a sly look on her face. The face is exactly the same as on the other two versions of Mal that are available, but the hair is different. ALL the Mal dolls have weird hair - like the other characters have long hair you can play with and just a little bit of it from the front will be styled and fastened back, but the other two Mal versions just have weird hair that is shorter in the back and longer in the front and quickly loses any style it had. THIS one has her hair up, so in a way it's the best version BUT you're kind of stuck with her having this updo.

"Oh! Before I forget I want to tell you something - it's a little bit of a spoiler but not much and some people may want to know this (but skip this first paragraph if you know you don't want even the smallest spoiler and killing animals doesn't bother you.) In this book, three dogs are killed in a really gruesome way. We don't actually witness the act, only the aftermath, but, although you could argue it was important to the development of one of the characters, I felt it was a pretty unnecessary thing and then it kept being mentioned for the rest of the book. :(Okay...on to the regular review...Overall, this was an interesting book. I had to spend some time thinking about it after I finished and before I started to review. The plot is quite intriguing. Someone has set up a social networking site that asks teens (all from the same highschool, a little less than 700 of them) ""what do you need?"" and there is a blurb on the site about want vs. need. I found myself thinking about want vs. need myself quite a bit and doing that ruined the premise of the story a bit for me. While other kids are saying they need iPhones, Kaylee says she needs a kidney for her brother. Because her need is deemed a genuine need, it's not treated the same as the other requests on the site. BUT...does Kaylee NEED a kidney for her brother? That's my question.As a verb, Need is defined as: require (something) because it is essential or very important.As a noun, Need is defined as: a thing that is wanted or required.Now, those definitions are a little fuzzy. Maybe someone does need an iPhone because their old phone is broken or because they don't have a phone and they can't get a call about a job interview or something else important without a phone. At the same time, Kaylee isn't going to die or anything if her brother doesn't get a kidney.The whole premise is a bit whacko when you think too much about it (which obviously I did) and as I was reading the book there were many times I was like, ""but why don't they just _____?"" Kind of like watching a horror movie and you yell at the characters to not do the obviously stupid thing they are about to do. I mean, watch one of those schlocky B horror movies. In fact, this would probably make a good B movie.I do think if I'd read this when I was 13 I'd have liked it a bit more, but I'm assuming that I might not have been as aware of all the nonsensical parts and just been in love with the creepy premise and perhaps not found some of the hints about what is going on so totally obvious (like the first one is: why would Kaylee's dad disappear/run away? I thought that was completely obvious.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24670N2Z6874T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544416694#wasThisHelpful","R24670N2Z6874T","A1VQBEW0G4IH1J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VQBEW0G4IH1J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute apron of a decent quality. The fabric is good and even the Chalkboard print is overall good and the style and the way the neck strap adjusts, I like all that and I think it's generously sized to fit almost anyone. The only thing I don't like about it is - I didn't realize it was going to say CHARCUTERIE all over it. I mean, there is not a lot of variety in what it says all over it, so it doesn't just say it once in an inconspicuous place.

"This is a great little camera bag for my Nex-6. I've tried a few different bags and a case that is formed to the camera (where you snap part of it off when you want to use the camera) as well as just putting the camera as-is in my purse (BAD idea) and this case is the best, whether storing the camera when not using it or carrying it around. I really like the cross body strap and the inside is the perfect, cushiony protector for my camera. It has a little extra room so if I were to put a bigger lens on it, it would still fit. If I were to make one change to the bag, I'd put a small pocket or two on the outside, just big enough to hold a few things like keys, ID, lip balm and a little money and/or credit card, but I still love the bag even without that because it fits my camera so well and is so protective as well as ergonomic to carry around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U2HNQ951O98K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDYS07K#wasThisHelpful","R2U2HNQ951O98K","A1VQBEW0G4IH1J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VQBEW0G4IH1J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an interesting little book. It's really more a novella. One of those stories you find written to satisfy the gap between two larger books (often published as an ebook only these days.) The prose walks a fine line between well crafted and over worked, between being wonderfully creative and just trying to stretch the story out a bit longer.This all takes place in a rather short period of time. I found it interesting because I feel I've known many Jack Gantoses and can even relate a bit. I went to a high school that was half the children of idealistic hippie parents and half kids that didn't fit in anywhere else and perhaps had been in trouble and were a little lost in life. It was a last stop/chance for many kids who had trouble finding their place in the world and Jack Gantos probably still would have gotten in trouble if he'd gone there, but he also probably would have made some great friends. They could probably write their own novellas that would make a nice set lined up side by side with this one.In the end, I'm no sure this book would make much sense to someone who can't relate. It doesn't magically explain anything. It is a nice diversion and an easy read and probably a must have if you are a fan of the author's other works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IN8IGNQ5NO67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374379955#wasThisHelpful","R3IN8IGNQ5NO67","A1VQBEW0G4IH1J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VQBEW0G4IH1J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: after 3 weeks in the window these had turned almost completely brown on the outside from the UV. I wouldnt bother with these.The package came with 6 blinds, and I was installing them in my 36x70"" windows and I cut two to width, but the blinds were not the same length as they are supposed to be. One fit with several inches to spare and the other was 4"" short with the same amount of stretch.  Basically, just use black art paper and cut to fit, you will lose the pleat, but if you have to pull it out to get the necessary length, it isn't going to matter anyway.These aren't bad, just a bit expensive given they are just a pleated piece of paper, and given the poor quality control with each blind being a different length means I wouldn't recommend these, but they are great as a temporary blind, they block most of the light.  They will last me the month until I get real blinds.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6UNN9F51BYIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SDTEAG#wasThisHelpful","R6UNN9F51BYIZ","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bottom line is this is an inexpensive and light weight phone that is great for web browsing, running casual games that don't take much processing power, and general use phone, however the graphics performance is distinctly low end.  My 3d Benchmark Unlimited tests scores were only a bit over 4000, which is not very good compared to the near 20000 from my S6 Edge or a similar priced unlocked Amazon Fire Phone.  What do these numbers mean?  Not a lot, but if you game you will have very jerky video on this phone, it was only able to maintain 10 or 15 fps on a 720p video game rendering (both Fire Phone and my S6 edge could do 60 fps).Gaming aside, this phone is very slim and light and will fit many users needs as a basic web and smart device.  It is lacking some relatively standard features like NFC, and the screen resolution is noticeably worse than something like my S6 Edge.  However, the value is fair for an unlocked no-contract phone, but you do get what you paid for.  When the Fire phone was a similar price it was a much better buy since it was such a high performance device, however it is bulky and fairly heavy.So nice phone overall, but has some limitations which will put off some users.  If you can get an Apple, Samsung, LG, etc flagship phone on contract for the same price, it will be a much better phone, but this phone is not bad at all.Also note, that if you have ATT, this will not be LTE in most areas, but you can still get 4G which is fast enough for almost anything, I was able to get 3 Mbps up/down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYTOE41CO1TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01513HSMS#wasThisHelpful","R1XYTOE41CO1TS","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First let me start by saying that this watch is 5 star quality, but the shear size of this thing means I will never wear it.The stainless construction is nice, and the looks with the wire are great (except thickness from the side).A huge issue is the weight. The watch weighs almost 1 lb. I can't type at the computer, it throws my stride off, my arm is noticeably fatigued after wearing it for a short while, and it makes using my smartphone very awkward.The crystal is a nice anti-reflective piece, with very high clarity.  The chronograph is mostly for appearance since the wire mesh makes reading 10th and minutes extremely difficult. Knobs and button feel is excellent.I am a bit mixed on this watch, as a lot of it is personal opinion.

"This light has a very heavy base that makes it suitable for a location where it might otherwise get knocked over easy, but I wouldn't put it where kids could pull it over as the base could cause serious injury to a small child.  It is meant to be a shop light, so this is not really an issue as the kids should stay out of the shop anyway.Assembly was easy, put two screws through the base, and use the included wrench to tighten them down.  A wrench is also included for adjusting arm tension.Build quality is good, with all metal construction, but I don't like that the light can't swivel, especially given the design, it almost looks like it was designed to swivel, but changed their minds last minute.  The lack of swivel makes positioning the light in the desired spot much more difficult.  Also, the head should swivel to change the downward angle of the light.  A typical magnifying work light has all these adjustments (base swivel, head swivel, and similar arm adjustments), so this is a bit limiting in comparison.The power switch is very annoying to use, it is a touch sensitive switch that you tap with your finger.  The hard part is if you want to change brightness you tap and hold your finger there until it reaches the brightness you want, it first dims, then gets brighter, and cycles until you let your finger off.  As long as you don't change it often it isn't a big deal.Brightness is good for the power consumption, but not compared to one of the fluorescent work lights with a higher power rating.  It is also very cold light with not very high color rendering.  For a shop light this is generally fine.Overall, I like this light, its heavy build quality, and the fact it is sturdy enough to hang something from the end of it, but I knocked off a star for limited adjustability and annoying power switch.

"Nice mid-priced headphones.  I had to switch to the smaller ear cups, but once I did they fit a lot better.  Sound quality wasn't up to the Aurvana headphones I also received to test, but these are also half the price.  The main difference is they lack richness in the vocals.  These are a bit tinny sounding.Since these are basically an ear plug, they do a decent job blocking out noises.  Controls are easy and they work well.  Headphones are a highly personable item.  I think these sound good, but not great. Average for their price class.These headphones come packed in a plastic pack, no pouch or anything for carrying them around, which is unfortunate since the ear cups can be pulled off.  I expect premium earbuds to come with a pouch.Bottom Line:Nice headphone for the money, as with anything HiFi related, you pay 90% more for 10% improvement.

"Having used compact SSD drives that are much smaller and much much faster (like 3x faster reads and writes), it is really hard to use magnetic disk anymore.  I am glad to see Seagate trying to maintain a presence, as for now they are still better value per TB than SSD, but that is all they have going for them.Benchmarking this with Black Magic Speed Test on my MacBook Pro with USB3 I was able to get about 100 to 120 MB/s both read and write.  So performance is on the slow side for spinning disk, but comparable to other bus powered devices.I was hoping for smaller size given that this is the ""The thinnest 750 GB portable drive"", this claim is only because there are no 750 GB external SSD drives. To be fair it is maybe half a mm thinner than the Samsung T1, but is much larger over all.The build quality is nice, but the matte finish is surprisingly annoying.  It is rough and rubs on everything, and collects finger prints and looks bad quickly.So if I took this drive by itself, I would give it a good rating, nicely made and thin.  However, my rating comes from what is on the market today, and the SSD drives are much better choices, offering much smaller sizes, no physical spinning disk to take impact damage (especially important with portable drives), and much higher performance (about 3x, typical).  There might still be a place for spinning disks in servers or when cost/TB is more important than portability and performance.I included a photo with a small SSD drive for comparison.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZS31ZZDWRAGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5X3LTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZS31ZZDWRAGR","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great battery, output of ports lives up to specs with one port outputting over 2 amps continuous (measured with a USB watt-meter) and the other outputting 1 amp, so most high end smart phones and tablets will benefit from using the higher rated port.  Capacity is great, being able to charge my S6 edge multiple times, and it is nice to see a more compact battery using prismatic (pouch) cells instead of the standard Lithium 18650 cell (looks like a giant AA battery).The weather sealing is simply a sealed pouch that the battery is in, no better than using a ziplock for any other battery, so I wouldn't buy it for that reason alone, although it does provide some shock protection for the well built aluminum battery enclosure inside.  You can't use the battery while the pouch is closed.So overall, I recommend this battery, and it lives up to the advertised specs (surprisingly uncommon with inexpensive batteries), however, I find the value of the battery very low at the MSRP.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JN23JWH5FRWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5H57Q8#wasThisHelpful","R2JN23JWH5FRWU","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are pretty nice ear buds, they don't do a great job with noise isolation, but have nice clear sound quality and fit well in my small ear canals.  However, I generally prefer the over the ear studio monitor earphones for added comfort.  If you are on the move and need a nice set of high quality earphones this is a great set.  They come with a nice case that you can slip into your pocket, and a nice quality control for volume.  They are fairly pricey and I can't say I was blown away by the sound quality (used to using high end sennheiser cans), with a notably weak bass response (typical of this style of earphone), but definitely better than a stock set of earphones included with the phone.  Trebles and vocals sound nice and clear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNA9XMH8FYA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0WUI1O#wasThisHelpful","R1JNA9XMH8FYA6","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a neat toy, but both my 3 year old and 1 year old wan't nothing to do with this giant Elmo.  The problem is that it is not approachable or hug-able with its hard and heavy head and being nearly as large as either of them it is a bit scary.As far as function, the toy is great with sensors for all sorts of motion, it can detect when you clap his hands, when you are moving around with him, etc.  So I would give it a 5 as far as toy quality, but it fails where it really counts and that is it will be an expensive shelf decoration.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UABE65NV4JX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLENM5G#wasThisHelpful","R3UABE65NV4JX3","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will keep it short and to the point, I love this phone.  I bought an S4 when it was released, and immediately popped a 16 GB memory card in the back and never took it out after owning it for two years.  I always used the factory battery, and didn't see the need to swap it out (have to turn off the phone anyway to do this).  If you really need those features (and don't just think you do), get an S5, but I expect most don't really need those features.I bought the phone off contract and had to pay full price (disclaimer is I work for SSI and received a discount off the phone, but even if I hadn't I would have been willing to pay full price).  I had the opportunity to handle both the Edge and non Edge phones in the store before buying, and preferred the slightly sharper edges to the Edge phone, they hold better in my hand and don't slip down, so I bought the Edge.  Lets not kid anyone, the edges for show only, the clock function and edge colors are pointless, and stroking the edge to make the clock starts is so finicky that it is faster just to turn on the phone.The phone was easy to setup, very responsive compared to my S4.  The camera starts in no time, the new interface is slick and smooth, and performance of the phone is stunning.  The look and build quality of the phone is at the top level, as good as any competitor, and actually the phone isn't prone to bending like certain other phones (A friend has one of those phones, and it did in fact bend after a short while from light use in a pocket).  To be fair, my S4 had this problem as well.I am blown away by camera image quality, as good as any point and shoot.  I don't play many games on this phone, so didn't really need the processor performance, although this does give real time HDR video as well as 4k video lacking in most competitors.  When I do play the occasional game I am blown away how fast this is.Call quality is good, as with any phone, holding in certain ways can hurt call quality since the antenna is internal to the phone.  I only have a problem with this in rare cases when I hold the phone with my fingers on the back in building with weak signal strength. It isn't a problem, I switch to holding the phone normally if someone can't hear me.Battery life of this phone is excellent.  Some reports complain that it is a tiny fraction smaller than the S5 battery, and that is true, but it is still much larger than the main competitor's battery and has no problem lasting 1 or 2 days of moderate use.  The adaptive quick charger included can charge this phone so fast that battery life is really of no concern for most users.  Literally, 20 minutes on the charger and the phone is half charged again.  I haven't bothered with wireless yet (too slow).I love the pedometer, it seems accurate enough for its purpose, and the heart-rate monitor is much better than the one in my Gear S (which I don't wear much).  The red light does a better job detecting pulse than the green light in the Gear.My only complaint about the design of the phone is that hair can sometimes get trapped between the metal and glass and it will pull when you take the phone away from your head, but this is pretty rare and only if you rub it up through your hair or something (like bored and fidgeting).  Now I hope Samsung is quick to release their Payment option, as I think ability to use it with any mag strip card reader puts it way ahead of the competition.Finally, I found this phone has an IR blaster on it, meaning you can use it as a universal remote for almost all of your TV and other entertainment needs.  The Peel app is pretty decent and has schedules, reminders, favorites, and a huge supply of devices you can program it to work with.  All of my devices worked fine.  It can even do more complicated things like let the volume switch adjust the amplifier, and the channel button works on your TV.  You can also setup multiple rooms for different profiles.  This is way handier than I would have thought, although more flexibility would be nice (like the control for my TV lacks the ""Netflix"" button that is on the real remote).I am not gushing over this phone, as I really like the main competition for it as well, but honestly this phone surprised me, and I am glad to say that a Samsung product easily performs as well in function and in build quality as any of the competitors.  My S4 was always lacking on the build quality department.  I am glad to see Samsung has stepped up their game in a serious way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPP28ZLF88JAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5M09EY#wasThisHelpful","RPP28ZLF88JAK","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are nice microfiber towels, designed for kitchen use, but can be used for anything.  Really, they are just a kitchen style pattern on a regular microfiber towel like you would use for a car polish.My only complaint with these are the washing instructions are specific in that you should wash them in cold water and with no fabric softener.  This makes them perform better.I don't really like the pattern on these, but I am not reviewing the pattern.  If you have dry skin like mine the towel will scratch and stick at your skin (hard to explain), which is a bit annoying, but typical of microfiber towels of this style.Why do I give them 5 stars?  They works well, each towel will hold about 10 oz of water (soak it and wring it into a cup).  They dry streak free and do a good job of drying.  I will probably not use these in the kitchen, and instead use them in my shop, but they are good for intended use in the kitchen (again, if you don't mind how microfiber wants to stick to dry hands like mine).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4B9FW91X2EA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRQ4S2C#wasThisHelpful","R3R4B9FW91X2EA","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Setup:Difficult until I figured out I had to disconnect my Wi-Fi AC1200 dual band range extender to set up everything over wireless.Function:Works great as a media server with my Samsung T1 SSD (once I reformatted it as FAT instead of ExFAT, be aware of 4 GB FAT file size limit, NTFS should work too).WiFi signal strength is excellent in my house and performance is great.Works with all my devices, unlike the AC1900, which refused to work well with my XBOX 360.eSata port is a nice touchReview:Overall, I don't like the user friendliness of the interface (it comes at expense of function).  It is targeted far too much towards average Joe/Jill, but it is an expensive router purchased by enthusiasts.  However, it is a well featured and high quality router which I will keep.  My benchmarking computers don't have AC Wi-Fi, so were only able to hit 13 MB/s writing to the drive attached via USB to the router, which is plenty for my needs, but if you have an AC device it will be much faster.Overall, it is a great high speed router, but decide if you really need this kind of power, cheaper units will work for most people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOS7RBLEPGAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN21DK#wasThisHelpful","RCOS7RBLEPGAJ","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great affordable fitness tracker.  Honestly, all I use my smart watch for is fitness tracking, so this is a more affordable alternative for the same function.  The benefit with this is the battery life is much better, being close to a week, instead of only a day.The unit paired quickly with my S6 Edge, but I had to restart the phone after pairing before the application could sync with the band.  This isn't a problem, but at first I thought the band might be broken.  Since then I haven't had issues synchronizing between the two.The unit is easy to use, just double tap the button to put it into sleep mode before bed, and you can configure it to vibrate in the morning to help wake you up, although I slept right through it so a second alarm might be necessary.  The bad stays secure during activities.My only complaint with it is that it is very wide, it is basically half the size of my Samsung Gear S, but the screen isn't curved so it actually sticks out more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NUS086NSGMT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMPVQDC#wasThisHelpful","R1NUS086NSGMT7","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This projector is a very nice and compact unit, it has a couple minor quirks I would like to mention. The first is it appears to use some sort of sequential sequencing for the colors so you will get a rainbow tearing effect on high-contrast subjects when something moves in front of the image, like your eyelid blinking during an action scene. This is a similar effect to sequential viewfinders in cameras, if you have ever used one of those.Secondly, it doesn't have a great leveling system. It has one center foot to raise the front up, but it sometimes tilts a little to one side and there's no great way to even it out. One method you can use is a tripod with a nice leveling head on the tripod to make sure it is level and the height that you want so you don't have to correct for Keystone. The keystone correction is digital so will lead to resolution loss, fine for presentations, probably not for movies.overall, I really like the projector. The image quality is great, and even though it isn't 1080p, picture looks very good, not that different then my 60"" sharp aquos at a normal viewing distance.  The lens quality is also very good.I like that it controls just like any LG TV, it has a fast and responsive menu system, it has a built in tuner you can receive over-the-air broadcasts, and several different inputs. The volume for the over the air tuner is a little low over the built-in speaker, but it has an audio output (stereo).This is a great portable projector that I recommend, but it has a few caveats.  Nothing that would stop me from buying it, but it is they are worth considering depending on your usage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNY8EI36WMDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URJB9DG#wasThisHelpful","RFNY8EI36WMDB","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The hot water dispenser is much easier to use as well, being able to dispense any amount of hot water (not fixed at 6 oz increments).

"These wipes make applying the dash protectant extremely easy, but depending on the texture of the surface it might leave behind lint so you might need a follow-up wipe with a microfiber if your surface pulls apart the wipe.  Also, if your dash is textured you might need to go over it a couple times to get down in the recesses in order to make it all uniformly shiny.  Any spot you miss is going to look very bad in comparison to protected areas.A few comments about UV protection, the windows in cars are tempered glass, and the front window is multi-layered in all cars, meaning it already has near 100% UV protection.  The side windows are probably only 70% in most vehicles which don't have special glass, so don't expect this to help the dash a lot.  Main function is it looks nice.Has a slight VOC smell like a new car, but isn't overpowering.  If you apply it, give your car an hour or so to air out before driving.  Also, this product is very slippery after applied, do not put this on your steering wheel or anything else that requires a secure grip.One complaint I have had with these products is they evaporate over time and leave a film on the windshield.

"Excellent drive.  It is hard to picture just how small this drive is, especially considering it is 500 GB.  I included a picture so you can see, it is about the same length as a standard smartphone is wide.The packaging is nice and feels like you are opening an iPod or something, nice high quality cardboard box with nice inserts.  It is a bit wasted since the drive build quality itself is inexpensive plastic.

"This Solar powered LED light is okay for a limited purpose of where you want a not too bright motion light where wiring a hardwired light isn't practical.  The initial battery charge lasted many hours, but after draining it completely and letting it charge outside for a day it only recovered maybe 1 hour worth of charge, so don't use this light if you want it to provide light all night, every night as it doesn't charge quickly enough to do that.Brightness is acceptable to illuminate a door so you can find your keys and open the lock, and the motion detector works well enough for that.Quality is very low, poor fit and finish, and ugly blue/white lighting (very low CRI).Overall it is a fine light, and works well enough for what it is, but the places I would really want to put it wouldn't work with Solar.

"Great for kids who want to be like their super hero Captain America, just make sure to keep it out side.  Inside, look forward to destruction and household decoration as the spinning ring flies and knocks everything off the shelf.  The launcher is pretty powerful when pulled aggressively and can really send the rings flying around the house.The only thing I noticed when I opened it was that it was pretty small, but the product pictures on Amazon do a good job of showing scale with the model holding it.  If you see the box in a store it is pretty obvious how small the shield is.Assembly is straight forward, there is a hand grip you have to install on the backside by pushing it in, but be sure it clicks in all the way.  I had to set the shield on a hard surface and push down on it fairly hard to get it to snap into place.It is a fun shield, and even if the ring launcher breaks, the shield is still useful as a shield or halloween costume prop.

"This thing is a machine.  It will crunch through CD after CD (through the top slot, not auto-feeder) and keep on shredding.  It hardly slows at all as you feed it large quantities of materials to shred.  The auto-feeder portion is also nice, but don't know how much time it will really save unless you have reems of 8.5x11 paper to shred that is in nice stacks.  As it is you can feed pretty quickly through the top slot and since the machine doesn't really slow down like some cheap units I have had.Safety is decent.  The bin doesn't latch in though so kids could pull it out and get fingers into shredded CD bits (fairly sharp) and make a mess, so I would keep it away from the little ones.  The cutters are exposed if you open the lid for the auto-shredding tray.  They aren't particularly sharp when not in use, and shouldn't be able to be turned on with the lid open, but again, another reason to keep little kids away from it.This shredder is for someone who generates a lot of paper that needs shredding.  For your average home user it is definitely over-kill, but maybe if you have a small business or something where you need to deal with a lot of invoices or something it could be handy.Overall quality seems acceptable, but I notice with mine that the bin doesn't fit that nicely under the shredder with a gap around the front edge, but all it really needs to do is collect the trash that falls out so it still does the job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JLRUYBFHC39B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW90WU#wasThisHelpful","R1JLRUYBFHC39B","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nice styled wraparound sunglasses, that also serve as protective lenses.  These don't have much more coverage than regular wraparound sunglasses, but would make a great set of shooting glasses, or other safety function where you only need safety from the front and sides. Even riding bikes or motorcycles. The lens sits pretty close to my face, but still has a small gap.Any safety glass which is polycarbonate is going to have near 100% UV protection, so this really isn't a competitive advantage.

"Powerful, quiet, great for small jobs/home owners.This style needs to be held on the right so it doesn't pull up against your leg. A tad heavy, but balanced well enough and is great quality.I also received a Greenworks 80V blower to test at same time, and they are similar noise levels. I like the Dewalt since it starts instantly and has a more sensitive trigger, but Greenworks is a tad more powerful and has three speed settings, which gets around lack of sensitivity issue with variable trigger, and sucks from the back so it is better for lefties.

"This chain saw is the perfect matching for a home owner who uses a chain saw a few times a year, but doesn't want the maintenance associated with a gas 2-stroke saw.  No worrying about mixing fuel and oil, no worrying about old fuel, you pop the battery in and it will start.I have both the 40 V 4 AH saw and this 80 V 2 AH saw, and both are good.  Both have 145 watt-hour battery packs, but the 80 V saw seems to run the blade a little faster and is slightly more powerful, so expect battery life to be slightly less.  Both are good for a consumer who might cut down no more than a few trees a year.I find that these saws make good pairings with GreenWorks' other tools, so you can use the same battery in your lawn mower, so if you buy a couple tools you have some spare batteries to swap around.If you cut too quickly the saw will stop cutting and beep, this is the same as a gas saw would do when it stalls.  Overall power is excellent, and they will stand up to any light duty usage.  It isn't totally mess free since you still need chain oil, but I love how quiet they are compared to gas saws, and no idling either.My only complaint is that the new 80 V saw doesn't include a cloth case like the 40 V had, but it is not really necessary either.  Definitely recommended for a consumer, and for pro if you do light use and have some spare batteries.  If you are cutting all day I would probably stick to gas for now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFEQ21ODUDWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6Z4R42#wasThisHelpful","R1QFEQ21ODUDWH","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love to review electronics gadgets, so jumped at the chance to review the J-Tech Digital vertical mouse in exchange for an honest review.  The mouse is a bit awkward to use, I tend to grab the buttons when I go to move it (at least initially), but with a little time it is easy enough to get used to.  This mouse is best for right handed individuals.The DPI button on top is really great for quickly adjusting the tracking speed from super slow to super fast in 3 steps (total).  So it has Slowest, slow, and normal speeds.  This style of mouse I like to track quickly, so set it at the fastest speed, but the slow speeds can be nice for precision work.Be sure to try it without the base extension, I found the angle with the base extension removed better for my hand, but you might be different.Again, set to fastest speed so small wrist movements can move the mouse across the screen, and if you like your wrist more vertical, I think this is a great comfortable mouse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9YRR2YCPZF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ4ZD28#wasThisHelpful","R2Z9YRR2YCPZF6","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:47 MinsPros:Simple, Well balanced, Rapid ChargingCons:Bulky, 2 second delay after pulling trigger, no leaf vacuum option (blower only)Review:See video.Air speed is not as good as my cheap 120 V wired blower, but at the same time I never like to use that blower because dealing with the power cord is a hassle.  I really like this 80V pro blower and plan on using it for cleaning up my sidewalk after edging, cleaning up around the house, drying my car after washing, etc.  It has a lot of air flow, which makes it great for those uses.  Also, I will get the 80 V lawnmower and snow blower and then have everything on the same system.  This makes dealing with batteries easier.Some Technical rambling:Comments about higher voltage power tools:  80 V doesn't automatically make it more powerful than 40 V, and since power is a product of current times voltage, we really have no idea if an 80 V tool is more powerful than 40 V tool unless it states the current it operates at.  What higher voltage allows is smaller internal wiring, and means you can make more power at the same current flow, so it is often more efficient to run at higher voltage.If you look at the 40 V 4 Ah pack for the older line of tools and the 80 V 2 Ah pack, they actually have the same watt hour rating, or they can both supply the same amount of power.  Internally they both have the same number of cells, but they are wired differently, one to give higher voltage the other to give higher current, but both can deliver the same amount of total power, making the 80 V battery pack a little over-priced in comparison.One thing I notice with the manual is they have some incorrect information on Lithium-ion battery storage.  They say to store fully charged at room temperature, but according to Battery University and other well respected battery sites, Lithium-ion is best stored long term in cool locations at 50% charge or less.  For best longevity (long term), charge your batteries immediately before use and store them charged over winter or when not in use at 25 to 50% state of charge in a cool dry area.  If you drain them completely, don't store them without charging them for a little bit.  Lithium-ion doesn't like to be drained until it is dead.  Battery University indicates that storing fully charged at 77 F for just a year and you would lose 20% of the capacity, permanently.  This means your batteries would only be useful for a few years before dropping to about half their original capacity.  Stored at 40% charge and the same temperature, and the capacity would only drop 4% over the same year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RXC8XCAQKLFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6Z4SEQ#wasThisHelpful","R1RXC8XCAQKLFF","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great product for someone who uses their MacBook as both a desktop and a laptop.  You can hook your external monitor and storage drives up to this, along with ethernet and other USB devices, but have it easy to disconnect the computer.  My only complaints with this is it will not provide power for the computer, so you still need to have the power adapter hooked up to the Mac to keep it running, and it has no status light to indicate it is plugged in and connected.Thunderbolt is basically PCIe run external to the computer, so it is an extremely versatile and high speed bus, so it allows a lot of flexibility in terms of running video, audio, and high speed devices.  I am glad this dock included the Thunderbolt cable, since Apple charges a pretty high price for them.Another thought is if you have a 2012 Thunderbolt mac with no USB 3 ports, this will give you a USB 3 port suitable for performance of high speed SSD drives.  I tested it out on my MacBook Pro (new enough for USB 3) and my high speed memory card had no trouble running at 180 MB/s write and 280 MB/s read on either the dock's or computer's USB 3 port.So overall, this is an excellent dock.  With it you will maintain the same number of Thunderbolt ports (it has 2, but one is required to hook it to the computer), HDMI, 2 USB 3, Ethernet RJ45, and a front mounted USB and audio/mic ports.Definitely worth while if you use your MacBook at a desk frequently, especially if you use additional monitors and storage.

"I received this for free in exchange for an honest review.First thing I did was look at the directions to see if it could filter urine.  I don't see that it is listed and it says it is not suitable for sea water (probably due to sodium) so I would assume this is not suitable for urine.  I tried it with salt water and still get a strong salt taste.  This isn't a deal breaker, but this would be handy to be able to have this ability in an emergency.That aside, it wouldn't be a bad idea to carry one of these filter with you back packing or going into some area where you might not have access to clean water and didn't have a fire or time to boil water.  My only complaint with it is that it takes a long time to drink through the unit, it takes a lot of force to suck the water through the filter mechanism, but this is worth the effort for clean water.Limited purpose, but great to have when you need it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DB3NVB9OKINY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZZZEKS#wasThisHelpful","R1DB3NVB9OKINY","AOEDWQLH2WKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEDWQLH2WKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While it is unrealistic to believe reading this book will eliminate all conflict in all marriages, the information Dr. Hawkins provides is valuable and presented in an easy to read and understand manner.As a therapist myself, I completely agree that seldom is the initially identified irritant the real reason for marital discord, but usually just the jumping off point. However, unless both partners are committed to seeking the truth and experiencing the growing pains associated with personal change, there won't be an end to fighting.Conflict requires at least two participants, and if one refuses to fight, surrenders so to speak, the conflict must end. My experience with couples is that the non-surrendering partner will escalate the behaviors while attempting to elicit the expected response (it's somehow validating) for the now passive partner. If that response doesn't come, then the opportunity for meaningful conversation presents itself.One element that concerns me is the self-humbling advice. I don't think this works in the long run if it's one-sided, if it's unappreciated by the non-humbling partner, if it becomes the end of the conflict and not the resolution. It just becomes a pattern in the process of conflict.The problem inherent with most books of this nature (and therapy itself, for that matter)  is that real people in pain don't always (maybe even rarely) respond as we think they will - in a rational, non-defensive, non-judgmental manner. So we therapists  open our toolboxes and offer our most revered  tips and tricks, only to find they are useless in the face of life-long habits and beliefs.This book - and hundreds of others - is chock full of great advice, but it will not magically dissolve conflicts, particularly those ingrained in a couples interactions with each other. So rather than expect a miracle, expect to learn something new about yourself and your partner and integrate what you learn with a few sessions of therapy. There are many therapists who work on a sliding scale for fees and a few sessions can provide a context for the material in this and similar books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKSGBKE6JFUI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426773854#wasThisHelpful","RKSGBKE6JFUI8","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warning:  I am predisposed to love any story (book, movie, song, etc) about dogs. I am a bonafide  dog lover and I make no excuses for that.To summarize the plot of this short and sweet book: widower George decides to sell everything and travel across the United States, seeing the sites (and sights) he and his wife were never able to see, due in large part to her illness. As he prepares to depart, his adult daughter coaxes him into taking a St. Bernard named Lewis along. Lewis is the well-loved dog of a small boy who has developed a serious allergy to Lewis. The family doesn't want to give Lewis away permanently, just to have someone foster him for a year or so. Reluctantly George agrees and the journey begins.What George soon discovers is the magic of Lewis (and all dogs) - Lewis' ability to be the perfect companion. polite, respectful, and a heck of a good listener. As the miles roll by George tells Lewis all the things he cannot tell anyone else. Lewis is non-judgmental and certainly not critical of anything George tells him. George finds a measure of peace which has previously eluded him.I don't ordinarily care for blatantly religious books as they seem to push an agenda not appreciated by all readers, but this book was different. More 'spiritual' than 'religious' and I can't imagine it would be offensive to anyone.This book will triumphantly take it's place with other dog books on my bookcase shelves, and when I see the cover I will fondly remember Lewis and his healing demeanor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HPMWRFTPVUPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426791607#wasThisHelpful","R2HPMWRFTPVUPJ","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ferals is an engaging fantasy with seriously sinister villains, nefarious plots, and unlikely heroes. For fullest enjoyment you must suspend your disbelief and set aside your preconceptions.Abandoned as a small child by his human parents, teenager Caw has been raised by crows and now he can communicate with them and command them to do his will. He lives in Blackstone, a gothic sounding city where the good is almost outnumbered by the bad, and the battle for the city never ends.Arising after a period of dormancy is The Spinning Man, a harbinger of evil and corruption, who some years ago brought forth a city-wide summer of violence and destruction. Caw and some unlikely friends must join forces to save the city.As I read I kept seeing this as an animated film. The characters are drawn for a screen, to me. The book is dark and slightly disturbing so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 15, probably.

"If you harbor any paranoid delusions this book will boost them to the forefront. Though marketed for young adults, it might be too intense for anyone in their mid teens, and it certainly is engaging for adults.The plot is not new - the government has conducted clandestine operations it wants no one to know, so uses highly unethical science to ""wipe"" the memories from the soldiers who carried out those operations.But of course some of the soldiers begin to remember, to speak to others about that. One such solider calls a newspaper, and so the story begins. The newspaper sends an intern to investigate and she follows clues until a chilling picture begins to be revealed.  Throughout she and her cohorts are in peril from the selfsame government who desperately wants to keep this story under wraps.To say more would spoil the story ------  it's very well written, more than a little menacing and scary for those who never met a conspiracy theory they didn't embrace.

Soon after his arrival another classmate appears and brings the new they were shot by a school gunman - who may also be in Town.Back home, Boo was awkward, geeky, not popular. In Town though he finds a voice and friends. He and his classmate Johnny seek the gunman among the other thirteen year olds.Imaginative, very well written, engaging characters. A coming of age story of sorts with a satisfying ending and a most unusual plot. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRORX1KLQFBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417136X#wasThisHelpful","RXRORX1KLQFBD","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cyndonian Pyramid is the sequel to the Obsidian Blade, and it's almost imperative you read the first book first.To be able to imagine and then create an alternative universe fully populated and operating under vastly different laws of physics is no small feat. Mr. Hautman has done so, brilliantly. The characters are well drawn, interesting, easy to feel for. The plot is complicated and keeps your attention. The writing is good - very good.If you want plot details read the publisher's notes.

"I don't usually read other reviews before I write mine, but this time I did. I was struck by the many reviews often many paragraphs long that so thoroughly discussed the plot, writing style, and characters. Those long reviews will answer every question any potential reader might have about this book.So what will I say? It's a wonderful terrible book. It will wound you with the unfairness and downright meanness of the girls. At the same time you will appreciate the author's insight into how today's social media has become an entity into itself, molding and shaping reality in a bizarre way.This book is amazingly well written in a style unique in my experience.

"If you've used mechanical pencils in the past and been aggravated when the lead broke, or the eraser didn't work well (or fell out mid erase) or wasn't comfortable in your hand - this set of 4 mechanical pencils might change your mind. For one thing the ""lead advancement"" mechanism is smooth and works well. The lead seems just a bit thicker so it doesn't fracture as easily if you press down a bit, but it doesn't leave a broad ""kindergarten"" kind of line.These are probably designed for kids because of the Avengers motif, but adults can love them too!  (the Avengers AND the pencils.)  The triangular shaped barrel is comfortable in the hand and I found my hand didn't get as fatigued as with a round pencil.An excellent mechanical pencil which feels well made and sturdy.

"We have a chubby little Chihuahua with hip problems so I thought this might be a good opportunity to see if changing her diet will help her lose a little bit of weight and maybe make it easier for her to get around.The description suggests 70% of dogs will lose weight over 10 weeks with this food, fed by recommended portions, so I won't really know how effective it is until that time passes, then I will update this review with hopefully positive results.Hill's is a premium food by anyone's standards, and used to be sold only by veterinarians in formulas designed for dogs with medical problems. They've now branched into more widely distributed venues and have ""regular"" dog food (soft and kibble) as well as their specialty products.J-Lo (the Chihuahua) loved the portion I gave her for dinner tonight. I think she would have preferred a larger serving, but if she seems too hungry I will supplement with veggies maybe. She's older and didn't have any trouble eating the food and licking the bowl, so it must have pleased her picky palate.Time will tell if this helps her lose a little weight, and I will report back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNOUD0F9230M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPZENEW#wasThisHelpful","RXNOUD0F9230M","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is quiet while running, and seems to help eliminate odors. After running for a week, I checked the filter and found a fair amount of air-borne particles which had been captured by the unit.

"I didn't use this taco grilling rack exactly as recommended, as I wanted to try it quickly and we hadn't grilled in a few days, so this is what I did.I'm not fond or purchased taco shells, so I took corn tortillas and brushed them with peanut oil on both sides, then draped them across the peaks of this rack.  I stuck it in the oven at 400 degrees for several minutes, until the shells crisped up. Then I placed the shells folded side down into the valleys of the rack, and filled with taco meat, veggies and cheese.This worked very well this way. I can't see any reason it wouldn't work equally well on a grill to make the taco shells. The coating on the rack is non-stick and the baked shells were easy enough to remove without sticking. Having the valley to put the shell in to be filled made it very easy and tidy. Can't wait to try grilled fajitas in the shells!This is a winner for me. Will be having tacos very frequently now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9U5KUE73SKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KA2Y1O4#wasThisHelpful","R3S9U5KUE73SKG","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a reader of the anime or manga comics but I have seen illustrations and thought I had a pretty good idea of what Miss Manga might mean: heavy, thickly applied mascara to form spiky lashes That's really not my style, but as I haven't recently been very happy with mascaras I've tried, I thought this was worth a try.I've always been a L'Oreal product fan, and I'm quite pleased to say this mascara is not what I expected, in a very positive way. It wasn't thick or clumpy, my lashes didn't form into dangerous looking spikes.

"My husband likes insulated tumblers with straws for his iced tea and I have purchased several various brands over the last year. The Copco is his favorite for these reasons:  1.  the screw on lid is threaded well and easy to attach. No mis-threads or moving the lid around to try to get the threads lined up to attach.  2.  when the lid is attached, the side of the lid is flush with the side of the tumbler; there's no lip protruding  3.  the straw is flared on the bottom so it won't pull out of the tumbler  4.  the double wall provides an insulating effect which slows down the melting of the ice  5.  the double wall also eliminates condensation on the exterior of the tumblerI wash these by hand and do not submerge them in the wash water as it is possible for the glue that holds the tumbler walls (on all insulated items) to separate and allow water into the air space between the tumbler walls.These are well constructed and sturdy though unfortunately this order arrived with the outside wall cracked.

"The primary requirement of a hair clipper and blade is that it cut hair easily and accurately. It's important to have that sweet spot between too light and flimsy (which means it will break the first time it slips off a table) and too heavy, which causes fatigue for the hair cutter. Though my experience with hair cutters has been limited to the Oster brand, I'm pleased to say this Wahl has exceeded my expectations.The clipper body is contoured to the hand which reduces hand cramping and increases the user's ability to maneuver the clipper as needed. There is some vibration as is to be expected when you're holding a motor in your hand, but the vibration is not significant (at least with my set of clippers) and didn't cause any discomfort. The clipper housing remains cool for the duration of the hair cut and only begins to warm up after several haircuts. Even this it isn't uncomfortably warm.The kit comes with literally everything you need to complete a haircut without searching for scissors, combs, etc. around your home. The kit proivdes a selection of blade sizes and comb sizes for precise cutting. Though it's too early to know if the blades will remain sharp for a long time, they are certainly sharp and ready to cut out of the box. The combs are heavy plastic with metal attachments and allow the cutter to cut hair to the length desired.The clippers come with a long cord which means you can easily move from front to back and side to side when giving a haircut.  When you're all finished, use the small blade brush to brush out any hair from the blades and store everything in the handy (and very sturdy) storage box.Wahl has done a great job in designing and manufacturing these clippers. They should provide years of service if treated well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B2KTO5F25EDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKVNSLC#wasThisHelpful","R1B2KTO5F25EDJ","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trash bags are not a very glamorous household item or one thought about very often - until you run out or a cheap one breaks and spills garbage all over.  Yes, this has happened to me.Hefty is not just the name for these bags - they are genuinely hefty, made of thick plastic with a little ""give"" so they stretch rather than tear when stuffed full, or a cereal box pushes out the side. The bands that run through the top are strong and easy to pull to tie the bag tightly.  This size, the 30 gallon size, will hold a lot of household trash. It may be large for a regular kitchen trash can, but I just folded the top over the outside of the can.  I was able to compress trash without tearing the bag and I was able to put probably twice as much in one of these as I usually put in two of my previous bags.There are some items where spending just a little bit more money pays off big time in less aggravation, and this is one of those items.

"The Fellowes 49C shredder is a step (or 2) above any shredder I've purchased before. I would consider it close to top of the line for home office use or light business office use.It's relatively quiet and the motor actually sounds powerful.  It easily shreds 8 sheets of 20 lb. paper at once with no bogging down or hesitation. The motorized head sits on a waste bin and it's easy to add a trash bag to catch the shreds so you don't have them floating everywhere when you empty it.There are several safety features such as the feed chute, which is very narrow and I don't think even a small child could get a finger in there - though of course this should not be operated around small children.  It will only operate when firmly seated on the waste bin. It will not function when held up or even placed on any other waste bin (I tried it on a larger waste basket and I wanted to use large trash bags - wouldn't work.)One thing that separates it from a more commercial shredder is that is it is recommended that it only be used continuously for 5 minutes. I didn't read that at first, and used it for more like 8 minutes before the red light came on and it quit working.  I thought the trash bag was full (and it was) but when I changed the bag, it wouldn't come back on. Then I thought perhaps it was jammed, so I tried to pull some of the shreds out of the cutting teeth (not recommended, as they are SHARP). It still didn't run. Just as I was revising my opinion (in my head) my husband read the instruction booklet and told me about the 5 minute use limit. Sure enough a little later the green light  came on  and it's been running great ever since.So if you have lots to shred, break it into 5 minute sessions. I'd been saving shredding for months - I expect in the future I'll shred pages as I scan them and won't have a trash bag of papers to shred.This is an excellent, heavy shredder and one I feel confident in recommending for home of light office use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDW2Y1IN666YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLRLFSU#wasThisHelpful","RDW2Y1IN666YP","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the story of a universal nightmare where everyone you love - your entire family - is destroyed in one tragic moment.There will be many detailed reviews which outline the plot in great detail, so suffice it to say on the eve of a family wedding the bride's mother, June,  is the only survivor of a horrific explosion and fire. It is all too easy to imagine (fear, dread) how one would feel in the aftermath of such tragedy, and how on earth you  find the courage to go on.This book is beautifully written with a cast of intensely drawn characters who at first seem almost peripheral to the story, but through the author's finely nuanced writing share their own stories. It was all to easy to identify with June's emotional paralysis and her struggle to cope with her grief and guilt.It's almost impossible to put this book down, and almost impossible to continue reading.  It is very likely to trigger a strong emotional reaction, one that will take a while to fade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BH7XBL0LH1RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476798176#wasThisHelpful","R1BH7XBL0LH1RO","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not the light-hearted, funny, and ultimately happy ending story I expected.There are essentially two stories which I thought actually weakened both. There's the main character, Plum, who believes as so many women do that happiness will be delivered with a low number on the scale. She's willing to do almost anything to be thin.Then there's a radical group of women who are misandrists and are ""out to get"" men. I believe what was so off putting to me about this group and their agenda is that it was stereotyping men just as other groups have been treated over the years (women, gays, different races, etc.)  Maybe this was the point of the book, in a satirical way, but that's not how it read to me.  Women's studies was one of my minors in college and I wholeheartedly support women's equality, but this isn't anything new. The author seems to have just discovered this, and has chosen a violent (in the book) way to provoke societal change.It wasn't an entertaining book. If you haven't had much exposure to women's issues, this might be an enlightening, if disheartening read. The author does write well, I just didn't like the book all that much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODE0PRVC5B88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054437343X#wasThisHelpful","R2ODE0PRVC5B88","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are a no-kill sanctuary for abandoned, rescued dogs. Fleas are the bane of our existence. It's is a never ending battle, so I was happy to be offered a chance to try a new weapon - this Black Flag Extreme Flea Killer.I was initially disappointed that it is for indoor use only, meaning it probably isn't UV resistant or water resistant outside. I will still need to purchase the insect growth regulator as well as the adulticide for outside., but for the time being we are using this inside the dogs' sleeping/lounging rooms.Though the instructions are sparse, you'll have best results if you clean the area to be treated first, vacuuming up any debris or dust. Spray liberally in all the nooks and crannies.  It's safe to use on pet bedding and carpets. Keep your pets out of the room until the spray has dried- and even then add a couple of hours before you bring the dogs back in.  A flea program is only effective if the dogs/pets are treated at the same time as the environment. A good bath with a flea shampoo and then application of a topical flea repellant/deterrent is the best way to treat the pets.I will update this review as necessary if this product seems to work less well over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQDZJK0MBJCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PVN1ST8#wasThisHelpful","R1BQDZJK0MBJCB","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's unlikely I'll ever meet author Eric Mitchell (though you'd love East Texas, Mr. Mitchell!) but if I were to meet him I don't know if I'd bow, faint, or just stutter my thanks for this cookbook over and over. He is a pit master and leader of the Yabba Dabba Que Barbeque Team. His team has won multiple barbequing events so this man knows his smoking, grilling, and barbequing. This cookbook focuses on using ceramic cookers such as the Big Green Eggs rather than more conventional cookers. However, I believe the recipes could be essentially duplicated on any cooker with some care and forethought.We have the Kamado Joe Ceramic cooker and this book has provided valuable information about setting up the grill, learning to make the fire and raise or lower the temperature of the interior. There are good explanations for why this kind of cooking tends to create such diehard fans: the meat is almost always moist, you have the option of cooking over the fire or by using the cooking stones (included with the Kamado Joe but an accessory with the BGE, I believe)  you can cook/smoke indirectly with lower heat.This author dispels some of the incorrect information about these cookers, too, such as the exterior doesn't get hot (it can), and other misconceptions non-owners might haveI am a died in the wool meat and potatoes kind of gal, and this cookbook is full of the most wonderful recipes imaginable. While there are some recipes (the vegetable ones mostly) that don't appeal to me, Texasman was busy making a list of the ones he wants to try (he loves his veggies - thank goodness opposites attract.)Mr. Mitchell differentiates between the terms grilling, smoking, and barbequing since so many of us use them interchangeably. His recipes include beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and seafood. He has recipes galore for side dishes, appetizers, and even desserts. There are lots of color pictures in the approximately 8"" x 8"" 224 page book. My only complaint, if you will, is that the font used for the recipes is uncomfortably small for my old eyes. There's plenty of blank space below most of the recipes, so a larger font could have been used. Maybe in the next edition. . .He includes a chapter on maintenance of ceramic cookers and how to move/set them up. The index is well organized and there's also a list of resources.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK22NSFLICB67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162414098X#wasThisHelpful","RK22NSFLICB67","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though I have the utmost respect for Cuisinart products, there was just something scary to me about putting this stone on the grill. I know people cook pizzas on the grill all the time (though I never have) but I just feared the intense heat would crack the stone.It didn't.As soon as we had a break in the cold here in East Texas, I made some pizza dough to try out this stone. Dadgum yeast was old (I guess) and wouldn't rise. So threw away the dough and pulled out a frozen pizza, the kind with the rising crust. Heated the gas grill and - and with great trepidation - cooked the frozen pizza on the Cuisinart Alfrescamore stone on the grill.The stone survived unscathed.  The crust was crispy without being tough, it didn't stick to the stone, and the grilled flavor was a little different - in a good way - from oven baked pizzas.Now I am eager to try a homemade crust pizza, and maybe focaccia bread on it, too.  Pretty sure this will get used a lot this summer.Recommended without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AOADE3H9Y2WC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0L5QKK#wasThisHelpful","R1AOADE3H9Y2WC","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was eager to try this freeze-dried or dehydrated dog food not only for the quality ingredients but also the convenience. I have a couple of older rescue dogs (Pekingese and Shih Tzu) who have lost some teeth as they've aged, so crunchy dog food - even the smaller sized kibble - is a little harder to eat. As a result I often make their meals from cooked chicken or beef and add rice and vegetables. But it requires planning to make sure I have their food ready all the time. . .This product couldn't be easier to prepare - just scoop some of the powder into a bowl and add warm water. Stir, let sit a few minutes, and serve. My dogs gobbled it up rapidly and nudged the bowls around as they continued to lick the sides. The texture is similar to cooked oatmeal , sort of a mush if you will. It has a mildly unpleasant odor to me, but obviously not to the dogs.I love the long list of healthy ingredients and will incorporate some of those into my homemade dog food.  If this is the only dog food fed though, I would worry about the ultimate effect on dogs' teeth without the teeth cleaning effect of crunchy food. Maybe that could be achieved with treats and chew bones.The only negative I see is it is very expensive if you are feeding multiple dogs (or large dogs), as we do. I think it's great to have on hand if a dog is ill or if you're traveling with your dog(s).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJV2SDEPBE5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TM9PIWA#wasThisHelpful","R3UJV2SDEPBE5J","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The color is a beautiful dark gray, with embroidered stripes on the hem of the pillowcase. Very subtle and understated. Elegant even.The fitted sheet is deep enough for my pillow top mattress and after 3 nights (one was a restless night) the pockets have not slipped off.After the first night I went to the Amazon website for these sheets to order more - and there are many beautiful colors. That's how impressed I am with these sheets. I didn't order however, because common sense said wash them first and see how they are after that.

"Though I love much about the digital form of storage, there's just something comforting (to me) about picking up a binder and thumbing through the categories until I find what I'm looking for.We do pet rescue/sanctuary for elderly dogs and I've used this set of dividers to set up a binder for the individual dogs' medical and grooming records. I'm still keeping it digitally, but also keeping a paper copy.The divider pages are sturdy, the binder holes are reinforced so they won't tear out of the binder, and it's easy to go to the Avery website and access their templates for printing the labels. The label application is novel as they are all printed in one continuous strip for application to the tags. There are plenty of extra labels in case you want to change them. I haven't tried pulling one off to see how easily it removes. One option would be simply to flip the labels over and use the back, if necessary.My only criticism is that the tabs are very narrow and not very tall, which means the categories (or dog) names have to be very short or abbreviated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNZGXZ76VEZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O48A1SK#wasThisHelpful","R1CNZGXZ76VEZ8","A9O1Q1QUUVZC9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9O1Q1QUUVZC9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How's this for an unconventional use.  I have an electronic signing pad on my desk for documents I and my clients must sign. The pen can be used with or without a ballpoint refill in it, but I've found that I and my clients like to be able to see their signature, so I've used the refill for years. For all those years I've cut up paper I was going to throw away and taped it to the top for signing. Tedious.Then one day I that the idea to ask Texasman to build a stand for the signing platform (probably 6 by 8 or so) with a way to hold this roll of adding machine paper underneath, feed it across the signing area, and under a bar that would keep it stable, and then have a serrated edge off a box of foil to trim the used paper off.  Clear as mud?  Well actually a client build me a prototype and it works great.As far as the paper itself, it's thick paper, probably equal to 20 or 24 lb. typing paper.

Their lives have been so different from one another, but something always seems to bring them back together. It's a very heart warming and feel-good type of book, and the ending was great. I would highly recommend this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IKK81NHGMRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DP8EXC#wasThisHelpful","R14IKK81NHGMRA","A20MYQH9P8AQPZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20MYQH9P8AQPZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With the holidays right around the corner, I've been baking non stop (at least it seems that way!). This is the first year that I'll be having family stay with me, so I've been really trying to ""impress"" them with my baking skills and making things from scratch. This recipe book has been AMAZING and has given me so many new recipes that are not only unique, but delicious as well. There are some classics, such as banana bread and various cookies, and some things I've never even heard of, like the potato and bacon scones (who knew?!). There's a little bit of everything and a little bit for everyone with various baking abilities.

As a recent graduate, this book has been especially helpful not only for increasing my potential in my career but in my overall life as well. If you are unfamiliar with E.Q. Librium, Bethel does a great job at breaking it down in the beginning. She then shows how it correlates with your everyday life and how it can help you become a more well rounded person. There's a lot of connection between E.Q. Librium and the workplace as well which has been the most helpful to me.

"The Time Odyssey has been one of the best children's / YA books that my niece and I have read in a very long time! We both enjoy reading, and she loved this book as well.

"Triangulating Bliss is one of the most enjoyable books that I've read in a long time. I think part of the reason that I love it so much is that it incorporates so many of my favorite genres--romance, paranormal, mystery (among others) and it's such a multidimensional read.

"Beautiful Persuasion is one of the best romance books that I've read in a long time! Told from both Ellie and Julien's perspective, I fell in love with both of these characters.

I felt like I really got to know myself even better after reading this book. Lemense provides great advice and tips to better understand yourself and how to become a more happy, well-rounded person.

"Alcoholism runs in my dad's side of the family and I've witnessed first hand the depths of what it can do to a person. Clara shares her own struggles and battles with her relationship with alcohol. Seeing into someone's mind who has been through this is definitely an eye-opener, since a few family members I have don't like to share what's going on. This helped me see the other side of things and to see how hard of a struggle it really is. This is a great book for anyone who has been affected by alcohol in their lives whether directly or indirectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXN3OW87Y1Z0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014TE4D0A#wasThisHelpful","RXN3OW87Y1Z0F","A20MYQH9P8AQPZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20MYQH9P8AQPZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't sure I'd like this thing, but I have read there is so much advantage to drinking soy milk over cows milk, I wanted to give it a try. I'm amazed how much I like this thing. Making soy milk is super easy (I'm using Bob's Red Mill Soy Beans). I leave them soaking, usually over night, then make a batch in the morning... When you drain the milk through the strainer (once it's completed it's cycle), you're left with a product called Okara, which you can use for baking, fertilizing your garden, bug repellent for your plants, crackers, all kinds of things.. Just do a search for Okara recipes..I've also used it to make coconut milk.. I used a bag of Bobs Red Mill Unsweetened Coconut instead of soy beans and set it on the dry bean recipe. Coconut water came out great.. I used that to make Kefir... I also made Raspberry syrup for ice tea using the hot chocolate setting.. Filled the machine with water to the water line, added a bag of frozen raspberry's and stevia to taste, and it came out great. I used the strainer and then poured the product in a bottle to keep in the fridge.I made a batch of soymilk, which came out the perfect temp for making homemade yogurt, so after straining I poured it into a mason jar and used it for yogurt.. I've only had this for about a month, so I'm sure I'm going to discover a lot of other things I can use it for..

We worry a lot about the quality of our furry childrens foods, but after researching this company, it seems to be one of the safer pet food company's out there...

"I like the way my hair looks after using the Renpure cleansing conditioners, but I wish the product was a little thicker.. This one is actually a bit thicker than the Cleansing Cowash..I wondered what the difference between the Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding and the Coconut Cream Cowash Cleansing Conditioner was, so I purchased both...This one is slightly thicker, but not by much. They clean and condition the same. This one does not smell anything like coconut, though, which really disappoints me, but the Cowash really doesn't either... This one has kind of a spicey kind of scent to it (that I don't really like) and the Cowash has a very mild, clean scent, which I prefer.I've noticed if you shake these products up before pumping them out, they do seem a bit thicker, as most of them are almost as runny as water. It's hard to keep this product in your hand when it's so runny.. Other cleansing conditioners are really thick, making it easy to get from your hand to your head, and they also create a creamy feel when cleansing the hair.. This product doesn't really do that.. It just kind of feels like your rubbing something into your hair, but not that much different than rubbing water into your hair.. and yet, the end results are impressive.. My hair does seem calmer (I have very thick, curly, long hair), and I do see a difference when looking in the mirror..I have now tried four different brands of cleansing conditioners. The cons to this one is the runniness of the product, the smell that isn't anything like coconut and the fact that for whatever reason, the bottles ""leak""..(I have three bottles of Renpure and they all do the same thing).

"I bought these for our screened in porch to use as cutains.. We have furniture on the porch that we don't want to get wet, so I hung these on the windows so they can easily be pulled shut if it's going to rain.. The fabric is really nice.. It's fabirc, but still water repellant. The color is ivory. It's a very pretty ivory, like a very pale yellow.. The grommets at the top seem very secure. I used metal shower curtain rings to hang them. They open and close easily and I have curtain tiebacks to hold them back when they aren't needed.. The fabric is very soft and looks just like curtains when pulled back or released.. they did, indeed, keep our furniture dry during a big thunderstorm, so I would assume they would work great in the bathroom as a shower curtain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9357DRG9TBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HT0OLO#wasThisHelpful","R2I9357DRG9TBA","A2IAHIO9LCK1VO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IAHIO9LCK1VO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only wore these shoes two times, and have to say, they really are incredibly comfortable...They are a bit wide.. I usually buy shoes in wide, but not always, and these were a bit wide for my feet, but they were comfortable and were almost like being barefoot. I was very pleased with them, until I got caught in the rain.. I had to go from our vehicle to a building after it had rained, so the sidewalks were still wet.. They weren't soaked, but the bottoms did get a little wet..The next day I kept noticing something smelling odd in the room these were kept in.. The smell was like male cat urine.. If you have cats, you'll know what I mean.. It's the scent a male cat leaves when marking his territory.. It's a horrible smell.. Our cats don't go in that room as there is a door on our hallway that's kept shut.. (plus our 2 cats are both fixed so they no longer have that marking scent)..The 2nd day, the scent got stronger and I started going through the room trying to figure out where the source was coming from.. By the 3rd day, that entire part of the house had that smell... It was driving me crazy...I started eliminating possibilities (I had just received an order in the mail, thought maybe someone's cat had marked the box)... One by one, I was removing things from the room, but nothing was helping.. Something told me it was these sandles (I hadn't worn them since Sunday when they'd gotten slightly wet and they were now in my closet).. I picked them up and sure enough, they reaked... I put them out on our screened in porch and by this morning, the rooms in that part of the house have no bad odor but the screened in porch reaked... Unbelievable!! AND the sandals smell even worse.I guess if you live in the desert and never allow them to get wet at all, they'll be fine, but oh my, here in Michigan, we do get rain and sidewalks and such will stay wet for a time... I can't believe one pair of shoes can smell this bad.. I'm not sure if it's a chemical they use on the rope used to make them or if a male cat actually sprayed them, but they are being shipped back to Amazon today.. I feel bad for the UPS driver that ends up with them in their truck!I have since read info on the internet about rope sandals and that if they get wet, they will smell like a litter box... Why then, do people want these shoes??? I don't want to have to worry about drying my sandals completely if they get wet from rain.. This seems kind of crazy to me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS1N4NTPJBLCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGWWTGI#wasThisHelpful","RS1N4NTPJBLCU","A2IAHIO9LCK1VO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IAHIO9LCK1VO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I followed the directions perfectly. I completely cleaned the shower floor, made sure all cleaning residue was rinsed clean, I dried the floor with a towel, then let it sit an additional 24 hours to to make sure it was completely dry. I laid the product down according to the directions of removing the back layer exposing the sticky surface, I laid it down, worked out all bubbles, made sure the edges were completely sealed down. It's recommended that you let it sit for at least 4 hours before 1st use, but recommends 24 hours. I went one better and let it sit for 48 hours before using this shower.. In all, I didn't use this shower for 5 days allowing it to be completely cleaned, dried and cured... I've now used that shower 3 times and the edges are lifting and there's bubbles in the center... I doubt it will last even a month before completely lifting. This was a waste of money.

"I purchased this for my husband along with the Cataract Eye Drops with Cineraria 15ml. He was scheduled to have cataract surgery in December, but then ended up with the flu and a couple of days in the hospital, so he opted to put the surgery off because we have hospital bills to pay off and the only cataract doctor in our area does not offer a payment plan. We just can't afford it right now. I did some research and found that other countries treat cataracts with eyedrops, not with surgery. That search brought me to Amazon and this product.. I decided to buy the two products for my husband to see if it might help..After using both for 2 months as directed, he feels that he's seeing an improvement, so much so, he's decided to just continue to use these two products rather than reschedule the surgery.. He's very hopeful, and so am I, that this will help dissolve the cataracts... No matter how safe laser surgery doctors report it to be, there can be complications from laser surgery, and this does seem like such a safer alternative.. It's at least worth a try in an attempt to prevent the need for surgery.It isn't a quick fix and needs to be used as directed on a daily basis..

"My husband was suppose to have cataract surgery in December, then he caught the flu and ended up in the hospital for a few days. We cancelled his surgery not only because he was sick, but also because we now have hospital bills to pay off and can't afford the surgery right now..The cataract doctor doesn't offer a payment plan, so it's all or nothing.  I found this product on Amazon and decided to buy it for him, along with the Homeopathic CATARACT care eye pellets w / Cineraria & Carnosine for treatment and prevention of Cataract.. He has used them both faithfully for 2 months and said he does see some improvement.. I recently asked him if he wants to go ahead with planning the surgery now, and he said he'd rather keep using these products and see how it goes.. He does feel like they are helping. I would say it's a long term use thing that needs to be used as directed to see results...I've done some research on Cataract's and it seems that other countries do not treat them with laser surgery, but rather with eyedrops like these. If he was to have the surgery, he will then have to use eyedrops made specifically for this purpose made by a compound company this cataract doctor uses.. The eyedrops will cost him about $200. I do not know what those eye drops contain, but I have to wonder if it's the same kind of product???? Just wondering out loud, I do not know if it's a similar product or not, however, if he's going to have to use expensive eyedrops after expensive surgery, isn't it worth a try to see if a product like this can prevent the surgery to begin with?I'm glad my husband is willing to give this a try before choosing surgery :o)  I know they say laser surgery is perfectly safe, but gosh, it's your eyes. I know if it was me, I'd try an alternative treatment over surgery any day.I see Amazon is now selling it in a 6 pack at $92.. When I bought this it was $17 for one bottle..

"I've been buying Pet Guard Fish, Chicken and Liver canned food for years. Our senior kitty has health issues and I chose this brand because of their high ratings among organic pet food sites as well as vet recommendation. This is the only cat food my older cat has consistently loved all these years, but suddenly, neither one of my cats want to eat this.. We are throwing out more than what is being eaten... The consistency of the product has changed as well as the smell.. Obviously, the recipe has been changed.. At first I worried something was wrong with our senior cat, but after noticing our younger cat is also no longer interested, I knew it was the cat food.. They used to run to their feeding area with their head in the can before I could even get some scooped into their bowls.. Now they could care less..UPDATE: I was contacted by Pet Guard, who assures me the recipe has not been changed. They did say that if the product was frozen, it will change the consistency and smell of the product and they are wondering if that is the problem. They are sending me replacement cans and said they would like a few of the cans I have back to try and figure out what is going on.. I'm not sure if the product maybe froze at an Amazon facility or the vendors facility, or UPS facility, but I know it didn't freeze at our home as we brought it in immediately after delivery. We did have a bitter cold winter this year on this side of the country, so maybe that is the problem with these last 2 cases of food.. I'm hoping it is because my cats truly did love this stuff up to this point! I will update my feedback once I receive the replacements and see how our boys act about it...UPDATED UPDATE: PetGuard shipped us a can in every flavor so we could see how the cats like them.. I opened the Fish, Chicken and Liver first. The cats were in the livingroom and came running into the kitchen from the smell of the catfood.. They both gobbled it down.. I think it's pretty obvious that the last 2 cases I received from Amazon had most likely been frozen somewhere along the way, changing the texture and smell so our boys weren't interested in it..I give PetGuard 10 stars for customer service but I'm afraid Amazon only gets 1 star..

It includes a large one for the tub/shower and a smaller one for the sink, which is all I needed.. They are working great, no rust, no coming apart.. I have thick curly hair which clogs up my shower drain, but with this, it catches the hair and all i have to do is pick it up and dumb it in the waste basket.. Very easy to deal with (much easier than cleaning a clogged drain)..The plunger system in my sink is not working right and the plug continually gets sucked down and then I have to use a screw driver to wedge it up.. It's a newer sink, so not very happy about that.. I finally just pulled the plug out but wanted to keep the drain covered so there was no chance of rings, bobby pins, barrets, etc falling in the drain.. This is serving that purpose great..I've also seen a set of these at Walmart for around $3.00..

I had nothing to worry about.. This thing works fantastic.. My husband loves it... It's very sturdy and easy to manuver, and no dust escapes the thing.. The body of it is metal and the hoses are very sturdy and flexible.He never uses it when the ash is still hot, so I can't say how it would work as far as that goes, but we haven't had a bit of trouble with it.. It also sucks all the build up off the glass window in no time at all. Before he was having to spend quite a bit of time getting that clean..

"We now have 4 of these. One is in our travel trailer, 2 are in our bathrooms and 1 is a spare. We love these little heaters.. We purchased a pellet stove this past year, which heats our home really well, but the bathrooms do feel chilly.. On chilly days, these heaters do a great job of keeping the bathrooms very comfortable.. They also came in very helpful this past winter when we had record lows here in Northern Michigan. For the first time ever, the water line to our dishwasher froze up. We put one of these under the kitchen sink and it thawed it out quickly (we had lows of 20 - 39 below night after night).. From then on, we placed one of these under the sink on nights  forecasted for frigid cold weather. It kept it from freezing again... We had shower pipes freeze in one of the bathrooms, and setting one of these on a stand in front of the shower and another pointed at the wall in the connecting room unthawed it.. I use the spare one in my sewing room  when it's really cold pointed towards my feet.. It keeps me feeling warm.. The one in our travel trailer keeps it toasty warm in there in the fall when temps get chilly during the night... They're small, inexpensive, easy to move from one spot to another, don't take up a lot of space and don't use a lot of electricity.. They won't heat a large room, of course, but they will work very well in small spaces as well as warm you in work spaces.. I'm sure they'd work great in an office cubical.. Can't say enough good things about these heaters.. I have felt the plugs after they've been running quite some time to make sure it isn't over heating and I haven't felt any of the plugs ever feeling hot, let alone warm..

It's a great idea, but not one of the best toys, for our cats anyways.. They have to really bat the ball hard to get it to light up. We ended up buying two kits and hooking them together, thinking bigger was better, but it really just takes up a lot of space.

"We have a dimplex fireplace insert in our fireplace that's about 10 years old. It turns on and off by remote control. The remote stopped working, so I called Dimplex to get a replacement, but was told they no longer make that style and do not have any in stock. They suggested we just plug it in to use it and unplug it when not in use. The nearest plug is behind a piece of furniture, so that really wouldn't work for us. The insert still works great and puts out a nice amount of heat, so we don't want to have to replace it.This outlet turned out to be a great solution. We can use it for other items as well as the fireplace insert, and just turn off the plug to the insert when not in use.. I've never seen a power strip outlet with individual controls for each plug, so when I saw this on Amazon, I was very hopeful it'd be a solution to our problem, and it has been... We really don't use that insert very often, but this past February had record cold temps here in Northern Michigan, and we were sure glad we had this extra heat source on some of those very cold mornings.. The plug has worked great and well worth the purchase price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8QOVP06DZEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K9607TY#wasThisHelpful","RY8QOVP06DZEG","A2IAHIO9LCK1VO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IAHIO9LCK1VO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had purchased these in the next size down before Christmas and needed bags just a little bit bigger for some of my items, so I ordered this size. They are just as great as the smaller ones.. I sell doll clothes so the pink bags are perfect. They do smell a bit when you receive them, but once you open the clear bag encasing them, the smell quickly goes away. The green bags are an added plus and I'll probably end up using them next year at Christmas time. Very pleased with these bags.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AV11T0S1745/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXADUAA#wasThisHelpful","R10AV11T0S1745","A2IAHIO9LCK1VO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IAHIO9LCK1VO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the design of this sink saver and it seems to be of good quality. My problem is the color. I ordered it in red, but it's that tomato red color, more orange than red... I have a lot of red accents in my kitchen, I love red, but this sticks out like a sore thumb. Next to all my beautiful red items, it looks bright orange... It does lay flat in the sink and stays put when water is in the sink. It's just the color I don't like..

"This is stiff, doesn't bend, so you need to make sure it will fit your sink. Also, your drain will need to be in the center of your sink or it won't line up. We have a double sink with one larger sink, with the garbage disposal in the smaller one.. This is too small for the larger sink, and too big for the smaller sink, plus there's the problem of the hole not lining up with the drain.

"I've had this for a couple of months now.. I wanted to wait to write a review until I saw how it holds up. So far, it is very nice. I've washed it and have not noticed any threads coming loose, no snags, no seam binding ripping loose..It was soft to begin with, and actually got even softer after washing.. We have an odd sized bed and it's really hard to find blankets and quilts large enough for it.. My husband and I have different mattress needs, so we have a full size bed and a twin size pushed together to make one huge, bigger than king size bed.. I purchased this in the king size and it doesn't fit like the picture (to the floor), but I didn't expect that... it is big enough that it hangs down about 10"" on both sides..I have my doubts this would fit a regular king size bed as pictured (to the floor). Maybe a king sized quilt on a queen size bed would fit that way?? It's very pretty, a very pale sage/rose color. The pillow shams are very large. They would easily hold king sized pillows. We have regular pillows in them but really need to replace them with larger pillows. All in all, I'm very pleased with this quilt. It really is a very soft fabric, warm and not heavy like some quilts are..","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LDGRXXK3TPXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OB1SKP6#wasThisHelpful","R1LDGRXXK3TPXP","A2IAHIO9LCK1VO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IAHIO9LCK1VO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have neighbors who just finished building a sun room off the back of their house. They are decorating it in a sea theme. I ran across thes coasters on Amazon and thought they would be perfect for the tables they have set up in their sun room - plus the fact that these definitely fit a sea themed room.There are 4 coasters in this set. Each coaster has a different sea creature. The coasters are made from some kind of stone and are plenty solid and heavy so they should hold up very well. The sea creatures are painted on the top of each coaster and the artists name is also written in very small writing under each creature. The bottom of each coaster is covered with cork, so they will not slide around on the table.I cannot come up with any cons for these coasters. They are perfect for my neighbors sun room. I feel I purchased the right coasters for what they wanted and I am very happy with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TRDX0N1527EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RMICCL8#wasThisHelpful","R2TRDX0N1527EN","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, this is a great backpack. The only reason I gave it 4-stars instead of 5 is an issue with a couple of the zippers. Note that I was given this backpack in exchange for an honest review.We took this to Disney World with us last week and used it every day. This backpack has a lot of pluses going for it...Pros:- Very light. It folds into a very small package that is easy to stow in your luggage.- The shoulder straps are wide and do not dig into your shoulders. They are adjustable for different sized people. My wife is 5'-1"" tall and I am 6'-2"" tall. The shoulder straps were easily adjusted so this backpack fit us both very well. This was very comfortable no matter what we had stowed int he backpack.- It has an amazing number of pockets including pockets with zippers inside pockets. There are all sizes of compartments so you will find spots for cell phones, purses, billfolds, lip balm, and even room to stow your jacket. While we were at Disney World and walking around the parks, we were purchasing t-shirts, socks, and other items of Disney ""junk"" and they fit easily into the backpack. We were pretty amazed how much stuff we could get in.- There are two mesh pockets, one on each side that will hold a water bottle. They are easy to get at when you need a drink.- This backpack is very well made. The stitching is high quality. You can see some stitches in the photo I have included showing the zipper problem I describe below. It held up very well during the 8 days we were at Disney World and stuffing all kinds of items to unload later in our room.Cons:The only con we had is a design problem. There are two zippered compartments at the top of the backpack have a flap that folds over the zipper to keep the rain out. This is a good thought, but we found that the flap got in the way when you were trying to zip up the compartment. Depending on what you had in the backpack, the opening distorts enough that the flap gets in the way and can catch in the zipper. So, we had to be careful to hold the flap out of the way when zipping that compartment. The picture below illustrates this problem and is the only reason I am giving this 4-stars instead of 5. The zippers themselves are good quality zippers and should hold up well.Other than the zipper issue, the wife and I really like this backpack. It is the most comfortable backpack we have ever taken on a trip. It holds a lot of stuff and I am very happy to own it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X5QFNBK6HOMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0157N2HKU#wasThisHelpful","R2X5QFNBK6HOMC","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an older guy  (69) but active. I wear a pedometer and my goal each day is a minimum of 10,000. I average about 13,000 unless we are down at Disney World where that jumps to around 25,000 steps per day. You don't see me sitting around a whole lot.I have had problems in the past with a torn meniscus in my right knee. I had surgery on it, but it still tweaks me on occasion - especially when I am bowling which a do twice a week in a league setting. Also, I have a big yard and garden and spend a lot of time outside working my green thumb around my property. Sometimes my left knee bothers me too, but usually not both knees at the same time. The only knee brace I have is a clunky heavy thing with metal straps in the side and Velcro fasteners to keep my knee stabilized when I bowl. I don't think I really need all that support any more, but that is all I had until I was contacted by this seller to try a complementary sleeve in return for an honest review. This looked like the perfect solution for my situation, so I thought I would give it a try.I am 6'-2"" tall and weigh about 210. I measured my leg circumference 4-inches above the knee as the product page instructed. It turned out to be 17-inches. My problem is that 17-inches is right on the high end of the Large size sleeve which handles legs 15""-17"" and the low end of the X-large size sleeve which handles 17""-19"" legs. I contacted the seller who advised to go with the XL size as the Large would probably be way too snug for a leg that was 17-inches in diameter at the high end of Large. So, that is what I ordered. It turned out to be the correct choice as the sleeve fits nicely but is not too tight. It slips fairly easily over my leg and is very comfortable. I have bowled with it and it works great - gives me enough support that my knee does not tweak me when bowling. I have not had a problem with it sliding down my leg - it sits where I want it. I have worked out in the yard wearing it and forget it is even there. It seems to be made of high quality material and it feels like it should last a long time. I have had no problems with it stretching out of shape and losing its compression ability.Tomorrow, we are heading to Disney World and I am taking it with me just in case I need it. It will be my safety net. Because it is small and flexible, like a sock, it will be easy to pack.Bottom line: This is a great sleeve and I am very happy to have it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIUSAERY0API/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC6PAYK#wasThisHelpful","R2EIUSAERY0API","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, the idea of putting your fitbit zip on your wrist is a good one. I have had my fitbit zip for 3 years and it always goes in the pocket of whatever pants I am wearing. I even wear it to bed in my pajama bottoms. I have gone through several of the standard clip cases that come with the fitbit - they just wear out. I was given the opportunity to try out this set of wristbands for free in exchange for an honest review, so I jumped at the chance to try out a new way to wear my fitbit as I did not know a product like this existed.The product itself is of high quality and comfortable. Unfortunately, I discovered some problems with wearing the fitbit zip on the wrist. So, here are my observations.- The wristbands come in many different cool colors- The multi-packs are nice. I got one, my wife got one, and I was going to give one to our daughter who has a fitbit zip.- The quality and comfort are great - 5-stars. I like the snap clasp. These are light and comfortable such that you do not hardly feel that you are wearing anything. I even wore mine to bed a few nights, forgetting to take it off.- With a little effort, the fitbit zip snaps into the band and feels like it is anchored solidly.- The band effectively gives you a wristwatch since the fitbit zip has a clock you can get to by tapping the band until it shows up.Cons:- The idea of wearing your fitbit zip on your wrist is a nice thought. However, I found the accuracy of counting steps goes South when you wear it on your wrist. This is the only con I have with the bands.So, I borrowed my wife's fitbit zip without the band, and put it in my pocket and wore my fitbit on one of the wristbands. After 8 hours of everyday activity, which included mowing the yard, running to the store for groceries, cleaning up the flower and veggie garden for Winter, and just putzing around the house, the fitbit in my pocket measured 15,325 steps and the fitbit on my wrist measured13,117 steps. So, that is a difference of  2,208 steps, a significant difference.My wife tested hers out by putzing around the house. She noticed that when she walked with her arms swinging, the wrist-mounted fitbit recorded her steps accurately. But when she was holding a bunch of clothes from the hamper and taking them to the washing machine in the other room, no steps were recorded since her arms were still, holding the clothes. She found that whenever she was carrying things around the house and not moving her arms, the fitbit would not register steps. So, that got me to thinking. Suppose I am at the kitchen counter making supper - which I was doing at the time - and I am just standing there in one spot but moving my hands and arms around cutting onions and potatoes, scraping them from the cutting board to bowls, and just putting together a meal to cook. Looking at the fitbit on my wrist, it was counting steps as I was moving my arms around preparing food. So, it is counting steps when I am not moving my legs.So, I guess it comes down to how you live during the day. If you are always on your feet walking, or if you take your fitbit on a jog, the wristband is a great way to wear your fitbit. If you are a house person and carrying things around the house or doing things that keep your hands and arms still, you won't be getting accurate step counts. At the same time, you could be standing still and doing something involving you hands and arms that give you step counts that aren't happening.My conclusion is that wearing your fitbit zip on your wrist does not give accurate step counts depending on what you are doing. They work great for walkers and joggers in terms of accuracy of counting steps, but not so accurate if you are doing things that keep your arms from moving while you are walking, or conversely count steps when you are not walking but doing something that keeps your arms and hands moving around.The bands are a great fashion statement and are good quality. Your step accuracy will depend on how you live and what you are doing while wearing them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GYPVEPKADPXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016O9NEOO#wasThisHelpful","R3GYPVEPKADPXT","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a Keurig user for many years. I have always had the standard k-cup brewers and have given the brewers to friends and family as gifts, so they are permeating our family society. I recently upgraded to a Keurig 2.0 series K-450 brewer and like it a lot. However, Keurig has ""fixed"" their brewers so that you have to use their branded coffee pods and their pods are quite expensive. The new brewers have some kind of ""reader"" that looks for the Keurig logo on the top of the pod. If you put a pod in that doesn't have the logo, then the brewer gives you an error message and in essence calls you a cheap old fart for trying to bypass their system. This is supposed to save you from having an unsafe (cheaper than theirs) pods ruin your coffee maker.I will have to admit that I have had a few pods explode in my makers over the years. But the pods that exploded were purchased from Keurig, so I don't necessarily believe that bad pods are only outside of Keurig's branding. Anyway, you can find Keurig branded pods in bulk at places like Sams Club that will get you close to about 50-cents/cup and if you are a Keurig frequent buyer, they send out deals all the time that reduce your cost if you order from them. However, you have just the brands they sell and if you would like to use your own coffee, you can't do it. With the old k-cup brewers, you could use a refillable generic pod and put your own grind into it and get good coffee at a lot less cost than 50-cents per cup. But the new 2.0 brewers want you to use the Keurig branded pods and the bigger carafe pods are just a bigger expense for you to fork out more dough for coffee that is mostly okay but not that great for the cost.So, I was recently offered the opportunity to try one of these new devices that somehow bypass the Keurig security scan in exchange for an honest review. ""Heck Yes!"" I said. So, I have had a few days to play around with this thing and here are my observations.- First, you get 2 of these in a package. So, that is great as you always have a clean one ready to use.- The lid clips on and off so the filter is easy to clean. The plastic body of the filter is pretty sturdy and feels like it will last a long time.- The screen mesh is very fine. However, when you grind your coffee beans, you will have to experiment with how fine you make the grind. Too fine and you will have a lot of powdery coffee at the bottom of your cup. So, you will have to play around with the amount of grinding to get the flavor and strength you like without leaving grounds in your cup.- The filter pod fits perfectly in the 2.0 series 450 brewer that I have. As soon as you close the lid, the brewer screen pops up that lets you choose how many cups you want to make and it thinks you have one of their mighty pods sitting there for use with the Keurig Carafe. So, A+ for fooling the machine and letting me use my own coffee. I picked up some Kona coffee and tried it out with the new filter and it worked great and made the wife and I two cups of tasty coffee to go with breakfast.- The filter pod can only be inserted one way into the brewer. The end with the hinge for the lid faces down. It slides right in and the lid of the brewer closes easily like there was a Carafe pod sitting there.One interesting addition to my box of filters was a plastic bag with a little plastic doo-dad that had me scratching my head. A small paper in with the device called it a  ""Clever Clip"" and the diagram showed where you could install it in the upper lid of the Keurig brewer to allow you to use a generic standard k-cup to make single cups of coffee. When I did a search on Amazon for a ""clever Clip"" there was no hit, but what did show up was the Fador ""Freedom Clip"" which looked exactly the same as my clever clip. I popped the clever clip in my brewer and closed the lid and it thought there was a k-cup pod in the brewer. So, this device does fool the brewer into thinking a k-cup is sitting there and you can pick the cup size you want and go to town. I didn't have a pod in there because I don't have any generics around the house. But I am thinking that you could use a generic single cup refillable pod with this device clipped in the lid of the K-450 brewer.My clever clip is a different color than the freedom clip that is sold on Amazon, but it looks exactly the same. Mine is rather flimsy and does not fit tight on the brewer. It wanted to fall off it's spot a few times and if it gets loose, the brewer lid won't close or gives you resistance. I see the Freedom Clip sells for over $8.00 and I am hoping it is more substantial than the Clever Clip that I had in my filter box for free. The clever clip I got in the filter box looks to be worth about 50-cents and it does not look like it will hold up very well as it is pretty thin and flexible enough not to clip solidly in place where it is supposed to sit. Since I don't have a Freedom Clip to compare to my Clever Clip, I can't say they are the same quality device. I would be disappointed to pay $8 for one of these things if it was exactly the same as the Freedom Clip. However, it was a freebee in the box, so I can't complain and I will use it.The filter is a great device, works as advertised, and opens my world of coffee making to using better grades of coffee that I can buy anywhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RT1AQATWAVKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01666ZTNE#wasThisHelpful","R3RT1AQATWAVKJ","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like spicy food. I am a Tabasco fan, but I am always looking for something new to spice up my food. One of my friends asked me if I had ever tried Harissa, and I had to admit I never had. It sounded interesting so I looked around the always amazing Amazon store and ran across this paste. Seeing it had pretty good reviews, I decided to give it a try and purchased a tube.Here is the list of ingredients: Re-hydrated chili (52%), water, modified corn starch, salt, garlic, coriander, caraway, citric acid.The taste is great. There is good heat but it doesn't overpower the food you put it in. You still get the taste of the food with an extra zing. I like hot, so I can take hot more than some people. I can put some of this on my finger and stick it in my mouth and get a nice flavorful tingle and my wussy wife will holler that it is too hot. I think it adds a great peppery flavor without overpowering the food. I squeeze it into soup and add it to my tacos. I add it to some ketchup for a dip for french fries or to put on hamburgers. A little goes a long ways, but it really adds flavor to whatever you are eating. This is great stuff and I will be a regular customer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ORY0PQ28UPYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002L0IRQG#wasThisHelpful","R3ORY0PQ28UPYX","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a problem with plantar fasciitis. It has been killing me for a while. I am also retired, so I don't have to wear dress shoes. I pretty much live in tennis shoes, wear a pedometer, and average 14,000 steps per day as an active senior. So, this plantar fasciitis thing is cramping my lifestyle. My feet also have high arches and none of my tennis shoes have high enough support to help me out with this malady when I am walking.I looked around for inserts that were more solid than just a piece of foam. I wanted something that was solid to support my arches. So, after looking through all the different versions and brands out there, I picked this one to try. I wear a size 11.5 D (US) shoe. So, here are my observations:- This product fits my size 11-1/2 Nike Dual Fusion Lite tennis shoes perfectly.The fit is tight and no trimming was required.- This insert is flexible up by the toes so when you are walking, it bends with your toes and the shoe and you don't know it is there.- The heel and arch part of this insert is rigid and does not bend. It provides perfect support for my heel and arches.- This insert is very comfortable for my size foot. I am able to walk without hobbling as long as the insert is in my shoe.- I bowl a couple nights a week. When I get to the bowling alley, I remove the inserts from my tennis shoes and slip them into my bowling shoes. They also fit my size 11-1/2 bowling shoes perfectly - nice and tight so they don't slip around.Cons: I don't have any cons.I can't say how comfortable they would be if you had flat feet, but for someone like me with high arches, they are a perfect marriage between my feet and my shoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R112SZ5JAHOCYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005AFHJY0#wasThisHelpful","R112SZ5JAHOCYV","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years I had problems with gerd, acid reflux, and heartburn. Some nights I would wake up choking on acid reflux and I would be hoarse for days. I do not like taking antacids and the like because I know that these kind of things are masking the real problem and cause more problems of their own. After a lot of research, I determined that I had the wrong kind of gut bacteria or what the scientific community calls microflora - the kind that are not good. I learned that replacing the bad bacteria with the good bacteria might help my problems. And it turned out to be true. I started taking probiotics and my stomach problems lessened quite a bit. I tried several different brands and they all worked to some extent, but I would still have occasional bouts with heartburn. At least the acid reflux was almost contained and I can deal with a little heartburn now and then.I was offered the opportunity to try this brand of probiotics in return for an honest review. Since I haven't found the perfect probiotic, I decided to give this a try. and see how it worked. One problem I have found when trying to compare different brands is that most brands have what they call proprietary formulations of all these different kinds of bacteria that you can't spell or even pronounce.And the numbers are mind-numbing and hard to understand for the average person like me. For instance, our gut microflora contains tens of trillions of microorganisms, including at least 1000 different species of known bacteria with more than 3 million genes.  One third of our gut microflora is common to most people, while two thirds are specific to each one of us. In other words, the microflora in your intestine is like an individual identity card. That might explain why some brands of probiotics work fine for some people and not others. Each one of us has a different body makeup and what works for me might not work for you. This usually means hunting around for the one that works with your particular body composition.The bottle says to take 1-2 capsules a day. Personally, I like to go with the minimum when it comes to dosages and if that doesn't work, I will add more as required. The results after taking this probiotic for about 30 days at the 1 tablet a day level? Great! I have had not a single issue of heartburn, acid reflux or gerd. This particular formula appears to be just right for my gut which is sending me happy signals. So, at least for my body makeup, this formulation appears to be the perfect formulation to keep my gut pumping out happy vibes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLOXMER4Y8CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAWLVGU#wasThisHelpful","R3SLOXMER4Y8CJ","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am big on probiotics for gut health. I take a probiotic every day to make sure my gut is populated with lots of good bacteria. Probiotics have saved me from past issues of acid reflux, gerd, and heartburn. There are so many different kinds of bacteria that is living in your body - some good and some bad. If you have enough of the good ones, the bad ones are crowded out and you will have better health.I have never seen a product that is formulated for your immune system. While my issues with Gerd, acid reflux, and heartburn have been largely solved by the gut friendly probiotic I take, I have still had issues with getting a yearly sinus infection when fall rolls around. Usually it starts with a stopped up nose and then I get fluid behind my ears which causes me to have problems hearing and makes my head feel like a balloon. I usually go see the doc and he gives me an a pill (I think it was Cipro) and I just wait it out - usually a month or so. One year, he lanced my eardrum to let it drain. Yuck! I don't want to go through that again.So now that Fall is here again, I started to get that familiar stuffed nose/sinus feeling. At the same time, I got an offer to try this new probiotic for the immune system in exchange for an honest review. What a deal and coming at the right time of the year. I do not want to have to go back to the doc and be lanced again or take Cipro, so this looked like a positive thing to try. So, here are my observations.- Besides the ""Proprietary Probiotic Blend"" that is in the tablets, it has vitamin c, zinc, and echinasea which are all good supporters of your immune system- My ears started plugging up in their usual manner about a day before I received this ""colds suck"" product. So, it already had me and it looked like I was too late to save myself from grief. I started taking 2 tablets as soon as the bottle arrived. After about 5 days, I noticed that the pressure behind my eardrums was a lot less and I could hear again. I could feel the liquid rolling around in there, but it seemed to be going away. After a couple more days, my hearing was back to normal - Great! No trip to the doctor required this time. This formula seemed to zap my normal sinus infection, so I am a fan.- About a week after I started taking this, my wife started coughing a lot. Seems like she picked up a bug of some kind. She complained of a scratchy throat and the coughing was terrible. It kept me awake at night so that I would slip up to the spare bedroom in order to sleep. It occurred to me that this formula might help her, so I gave her a couple of my colds suck tablets and tried to get her to take them every morning when she got up. Well after 2 days, her cough was almost gone and after 3 days, it was gone. And her scratchy throat disappeared. It seems like 3 days is kind of a short time to get results like this, but I am not complaining.So, the bottom line is that it appears that this probiotic formula indeed does what is advertised, at least in our household. I am keeping a bottle on my vitamin shelf from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IUTTSK7HN1PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012LI64FI#wasThisHelpful","R1IUTTSK7HN1PW","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a problem with plantar faciitis. My doctor said to get a plastic soda bottle, fill it with water, and put it in the freezer and then roll it with my foot. This sounded kind of messy to me so I looked for something else that would be similar and not so much trouble. So, I ran across this device and thought I would give it a try. Here are my observations.Pros:This thing is pretty heavy - 1.1 pounds. It appears to be high quality construction.The bottom is made of rubber. The combination of rubber bottom and heavier weight means this massager does not move around when you are running your foot over the top.The steel balls are almost an inch in diameter, so they feel substantial when you are running your feet over the top. They rotate in their sockets.My issue with plantar fasciitis is mainly in my heel. That is where I have the most pain. This massager is perfect for working on my heel pain. I start with a light rub and then press more deeply as my foot gets used to the pressure. I keep it under my computer table and am actually using it as I write this review.As a massager, it feels good on my arches and up under my toes. I found sore spots up there I didn't realize I had.You can put this in the freezer and get those steel balls really cold. They stay cold for a good 20 minutes of use. I would suggest you wear socks if using it after coming out of the freezer. Or be a he-man/gal and plop your bare footsie right on top of those icy metal balls and grit your teeth for a bit.This is easy to throw in your luggage and take on a trip somewhere. No mess or fuss and can be used whenever you are sitting - on a plane, bus, library, restaurant, etc.Cons:I really can't come up with any cons. This is a great item to help you work on your plantar fasciitis issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTMVEKJRP9XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSSV978#wasThisHelpful","R1FTMVEKJRP9XN","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wife and I are retired and travel quite a bit. We each have various ways we pack things in our luggage. I was offered the opportunity to try out these luggage organizers in return for an honest review and it looked like just the thing I needed. After using these for a couple trips, here are my observations.Pros:These organizers look bigger in the Amazon seller page than they really are. They are, in fact, the perfect size for your luggage. They are all about 3"" deep when packed with ""stuff"" but when empty, they are pretty flat for easy storage - less than half an inch. The large one is only 14 x 11 x 3, the medium is 12.2 x 8.7 x 3, the small is 11 x 6.3 x 3. In the picture below, I am showing the 3 organizers with common items - socks, toothpaste, deodorant - so you can see the scale of these organizers which will fit easily in even a small piece of luggage.These are made of nylon and feel like they should hold up pretty well. The stitching is good and the zippers seem to be good. They have traveled well so far for me.There is a nice mesh window on the top, so you can see what is inside each bag.The large bag will keep 4-5 days of socks and underwear separate from your other clothes. The others are good for toiletries and other small items to keep them from getting lost in the rest of what you have in your luggage. The middle size I have used to carry books that I take along on trips. It is more than adequate for several paperbacks and small hardback books and helps to keep them from getting scrunched in your luggage while traveling.Cons:I really don't have any cons to speak of.The cleaning instructions say to wipe with a damp cloth. Do not put in the washer or dryer. Do not iron and do not bleach. They do clean up easily with a damp paper towel.Bottom Line: I like these bags a lot and we are getting good use in our travels. They make good organizers for a lot of different things you would put in your luggage and they are just the right size for even a carry-on bag at the airport.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NQ0Z5547176/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DD1EXW#wasThisHelpful","R18NQ0Z5547176","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an issue with plantar faciitis and was looking for some support like this. This one seemed to have the best reviews, so I bought one. You only get one in the package, not one for each foot. I am only giving it 3 stars for the following reasons.....Pros: It is comfortable as it stretches a lot.Cons: The size chart. I am 6'-2"" tall, weigh 210 pounds and wear a size 11.5 D shoe. I am not a small person. So, I ordered the large. The large is too loose to provide the support I need. It slips on fine because it stretches a lot. But it's stretchiness means that there is not a lot of support under my arch like I would have liked. I think the medium would have worked better for me. It is not worth the trouble to send it back, so I am living with my mistake. I don't know how much smaller the medium would be, but as much as this thing stretches, it would probably fit my size 11.5 D foot fine and provide better support.The sleeve has ""BracePal"" across the top in white letters. When I took the sleeve out of the package, several of the letters were peeling off. I pulled them right off. The appear to be rubberized letters with some stickum on the back. The letters will come off the first time you wash them. This doesn't say much for product quality.The Amazon page says this is for men and women and only gives 3 size choices - Small, medium, large. I would say that the large size would definitely not fit a woman who wears large in women's sizes, since their sizing is different than men's. The large size is even too big for me, so take that into consideration if you purchase this sleeve.I would not buy this again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ABRGH1U73HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBH2XPS#wasThisHelpful","R15ABRGH1U73HB","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I was offered this handbag in exchange for an honest review.And second, My wife loves this handbag!This handbag comes in several colors and my wife picked the purple version. She is 5'-1"" tall, kind of short for my 6'-2"" frame, but I guess it works since we have been married for 46 years - ha..ha.. So, she has carried it around for a few days and these are her observations....Pros:- She loves the purple colored version- The stitching is first rate. Some of the purses she has have crappy stitching and they come apart after a little use.- The zipper is metal and looks/feels like it will last for a while. Many purses out there use plastic zippers that break easily. This one uses a substantial metal zipper that should hold up well.- Inside are pockets that hold her sunglasses and her rather large smartphone with ease. I know for a fact how important the ease of access is for her smartphone. Many times when I am in the passenger seat of our car and she is driving, I will hear her phone ringing in her purse. Her old purse was packed with ""crap"" and her phone was always in the middle of it. So, I would unzip her purse and poke around the junk trying to find the phone. Most of the time, it would quit ringing by the time I found it and she would have to deal with voice mail. But with this purse, the pocket the phone sits in is readily accessible, and I can zip open the the purse and see the phone sitting there for easy access. She can pack all her junk around it and the phone still sits out in the open so I/she can find it quickly. Same for the sunglasses which can drop right in the other pocket and are ready for quick access.- The strap is adjustable and she can size it for her small frame. It rests comfortably on her shoulder.- The purse is not large, but still holds a lot of stuff. It has an inside zippered compartment that is easy to get to where she puts her checkbook and pen. This pocket also holds a lot of ""stuff.""- It has drawn attention while out in public. Several people have commented on the purse. Our married daughter saw it the other day when we met her for lunch. It was the first thing she saw when we got to her door to pick her up. She said she loved it and wanted to know where we got it. So, it looks like I will be ordering one of these for a Christmas present.- The purse is well made and sturdy. The nylon material is thick and feels substantial. It gives you the feeling that it will last a long time.Cons:My wife has had this purse for about 5 days. She can find nothing to complain about.Bottom Line: Happy wife - happy life! Of all my wife's purses, this one has risen to the top and is the one she carries around most of the time, now. The price is very reasonable for the quality you get. My wife loves this purse and so does my daughter. I will be ordering one for a Christmas present for my daughter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA8NVKM51V0AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011HKUTD4#wasThisHelpful","RA8NVKM51V0AX","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I don't like to really talk about my feet because they are not pretty, but I have to make an exception in regards to this particular product. I have one foot that has a toenail fungus problem. I have had it for years and have tried many remedies and they just don't work. A couple of my toenails with the fungus under them are raised and rounded and almost impossible to cut with regular clippers. The problem I have with clippers is that they do not open wide enough to enable the sharp clipper part to get over my ugly nails to cut them. I have tried several different brands and sizes and not one has worked for me. I end up whacking away at the corners of my toenails and getting parts of them done, but the end results are jagged and unsatisfactory.When I was given the opportunity to try out these particular clippers for free in exchange for an honest review, I jumped at the chance when I looked at the pictures. It seemed to be different enough that it just might work for me.As soon as I opened the box, I knew these would work on my toes. The space between the 2 cutting edges was about twice as wide as any clipper I have ever owned. I couldn't wait to get my shoes and socks off, get out on the deck, and start clipping.Pros:- These are heavy duty stainless steel and feel substantial while you are using them.- The two cutting pieces are 1/8 inch apart. This is a bigger gap than any clippers I own and make it very easy to cut my misshaped toenails due to a fungus under a few of my toenails.- The holes in the handles make them easier to grip so they don't flip out of your hand while you are cutting tough nails like I have. Other clippers I have owned, if you get them onto tough toenails, the handle parts tend to slip sideways when they are squeezed and make the clippers flip out of my hand. These clippers are rock solid and don't move on you.- Also, the clipper handles are a lot further apart than the typical clippers, so if you have big hands like mine, this also adds to the stability and gives you better leverage to cut really tough nails.- The cutting head actually rotates on the frame so if you don't like straight-on cutting, you can cut sideways. This is not important to me, but may be for someone else. This makes it a versatile tool. I have actually used it in a pinch to cut small wires in a home electronic project I was working on. It was able to get into a tighter spot than my normal wire cutters could get. It didn't seem to affect the cutting edge but it is not something I would do on a regular basis and risk dulling the blade for its intended purpose down the road. But it did work great on a task it was not intended to be used for.- The clippers come with a nice heavy duty storage bag with a drawstring. This makes it easier to store in a drawer and be able to find it when you want to use it or to take it on a trip, it won't get lost in your suitcase.Cons:- I can find no fault with these clippers.Bottom Line:For years I have suffered with the task of cutting my toenails because a fungus under the nails has made my toenails thick and misshapen. These clippers have solved a big problem for me making it very easy to cut my toenails. They work better than any clippers I ever had.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SIVYSTIGVJ9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013G2YS9C#wasThisHelpful","R3SIVYSTIGVJ9J","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compared to the price of cases you can purchase for this phone at the Verizon store, this is a bargain. My Droid Ballistic Nylon Turbo works great with the case on. The holes all line up, the on/off and volume controls work just fine, and it works great on my wireless charging station - the standard charging station that you can pick up at the Verizon store. When I got my Turbo at the Verison store, I got a case from their display and paid a whole lot more. It is a fine case, but it has a sdesign on the back that makes the phone hard to get into my pants pocket.It is a larger than normal phone and hard enough as it is to get in and out of a pocket. I saw this particular case on Amazon and liked the idea that it was smooth and the price was right, so I got this as a backup. I can go back and forth if I want. However, after putting this case on my turbo, it might just stay there.The case is slick and slides easily in and out of my pocket. Because it is slick, if you set your phone on a table and try to use it, you might have issues with it sliding around. I do not use my phone like this, preferring to hold it when I am using. Some of the lines on the case stand out and may feel sharp to some when you are holding the phone, but they are definitely not sharp enough to cut you and I like the feel of the lines as they give me a more secure feeling when I am holding the phone. The white plastic piece on the back clips onto the case itself. I guess it is there for decoration and to make the case slippery. It does that for sure. Before you put the case on the phone, you should attach the white piece and then put the case on the phone. The white piece clips on easily before the case slips on the phone, but after the case is on the phone, the white piece is harder to get on. I guess that is good as it will not fall off after the case is attached to the phone.This case fits my Droid Turbo perfectly. I have no complaints of the finish. The holes for earphones, usb plug, camera line up exactly. The on/off switch and the volume controls work fine through the case. It feels good in my hands. Even though it is slick, it is perfect for the way I use my phone. The white may scuff during everyday use. I have not had mine long enough to determine how rugged the case is. But right now, I really have no issues with this case. It is perfect for the way I use my phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76YIRVYT2AHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R26XF0W#wasThisHelpful","R76YIRVYT2AHW","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased a Sony HX50V camera. This was my first exploration away from those inexpensive cameras with digital zoom. This Sony has a real optical lens and takes great pictures. But it came with one battery and no charger. I have to charge it by connecting it to my computer with a USB cable or using a USB wall charger that came with my smartphone and connect that to the camera with a USB cable. While it is charging, I cannot use my camera since the battery has to stay in the camera while charging.Then, I was offered the opportunity to receive a charger and battery that was compatible with my HX50V camera in return for an honest review. When I looked at the specs for this package, there is a long list of Sony cameras this combo is compatible with. My HX50V camera was included in the list, so I thought it would be great to have this with my camera.When the package arrived, I compared the battery in the package with my Sony camera battery - Exactly the same size and configuration. Same specs printed on the battery. Looks exactly the same with just a different label. I have supplied a picture of the batteries side-by-side. You can see they look pretty much the same.The charger itself is pretty basic. It weighs practically nothing and made from thin plastic. Not sure how well it will hold up if it gets banged around a lot. But the battery fits securely in the slot in the charger and it does the job charging the battery. The charger has an LED light next to the OAproda brand name on the charger case that shows red while the battery is charging. The light changes color when the battery is charged.I have used my camera off and on for a week and the battery still shows fully charged on my camera screen. So, it appears that this battery holds a charge as well as the original Sony battery that came with my camera. I checked the Sony website for the Sony NP-BX1 battery and their list price is $49.99. So here is a replacement battery that costs 1/5 the OEM version and includes an external charger so you can be charging one battery while using the other in the camera. This is a great buy!Bottom line - This appears to be a great direct replacement for the Sony NP-BX1 battery. It is working great in my Sony camera and appears to have similar life as the Sony battery which costs a lot more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PU6V20RZAFDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P20T7F2#wasThisHelpful","R1PU6V20RZAFDC","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know when you go to some hotels and they have those big shower-heads and they feel so luxurious? Well, looking at this kind of shower-head makes you think of a luxurious hotel. I was given the opportunity to try out one of these in exchange for an honest review and these are my thoughts.Pros:1) This is a well made shower head. It feels substantial and it has a LOT of nozzles - 200 of them!2) It installed easily on my existing water pipe extending from the wall. It comes with a small roll of plumbers tape to help make a tight fit on the water pipe you attach it to.Cons:1) You better have good water pressure because 200 nozzles is a lot to push water through. I like a stimulating shower but the water that finally exits all these holes was more gentle than I like. The wife liked it better so that ups the rating.2) This shower head is better suited for  a water line coming out the ceiling so that the shower head aims straight down. This gives even distribution from all the jets in the head. From the picture I am submitting, my pipe comes out the side wall, so the water that comes out of the far end of the shower head is weaker than what comes out of the side closest to the water line.Bottom line - If you like a gentle gush of water on your head, you will like this. If you like a more stimulating shower where the water hitting you has some force, you will probably not like this shower head. It is kind of up to your own taste. This shower head is better suited to a water line coming out of the ceiling so you get even distribution of water out all the jets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDHOYI355A9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDDFHH6#wasThisHelpful","R1GDHOYI355A9E","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have seen nightlights with all different kinds of shapes, but this nightlight is really different. Most nightlights broadcast their light outwards in a 360 degree path but don't direct the light up and down. This nightlight, when plugged into a standard outlet, directs the light up to the ceiling and down to the floor. This shows up the floor better so you can see where you are stepping.The light output is similar to other LED lights, it is just directed in a different direction. The other thing I like about this light is that it has a flat footprint which makes it easier to pack away for trips. The product pictures on the Amazon product page do not clearly show that this light looks the same on both sides. It has a lens on the front and back and directs light out both ends which turn out to be up and down when you plug it in.I like this light and we took it on a trip recently and it was perfect for the bathroom of our guest's house. The light output is not bright, but good enough to see your way around the bathroom and not bright enough to keep you awake from its glow in the bathroom. I have one in our bathroom and one at the top of my stairs that lead to 2 bedrooms in my house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L7SX15OO0CCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012RYFZII#wasThisHelpful","R2L7SX15OO0CCG","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live out in the boonies on a lake. Because we have a nice lake and good fishing, we have a lot of guests that come up and stay overnight. Our guest bedrooms have doors that open to a loft area where I have my computer desk. As a night owl, I am on my computer until 2am-3am so I obviously need a light up there. The problems I have with lighting up there are many:1) I don't like having the overhead light on because it is too bright and makes me feel like I am on display at night2) Table lamps are too bright and take up a lot of space on my desk.3) When guests are here, I don't like having a lot of light on in the loft for fear of keeping guests awake. Even with the bedroom doors shut, there is a space under the door that lets light leak into the rooms.I have tried small lamps of various configurations and they all have their faults. When I was given the opportunity to try out this particular light in exchange for an honest review, I jumped at the chance because this looked like the perfect solution for my problem. And I was not disappointed.Pros:1) First of all, this light is very elegant looking. It looks very nice sitting on a desk.2) The lighted part folds down out of the way giving it a fairly small footprint.3) The base is solid and even when the LED light part is extended completely horizontal, it does not want to tip over.4) The light can be positioned at many different angles so it shines completely horizontally and then down to it's closed position.5) The light can be plugged into a USB port of your computer to power it up and recharge its battery. It will run for hours on its battery.6) The light has several degrees of brightness so it can be adjusted to the level you need. I have mine sitting right next to my computer and shining down on my keyboard which sits on a slide-out panel under the computer monitor.7) This arrangement puts light right on my keyboard where I need it and the rest of the room stays dark, so guests are not disturbed and I do not feel I am on display.I really like this light. The only negative, if you could call it that, is that if you don't have a spare USB port on your computer to charge the lamp, you will need a USB charging module, similar to what you get with your cell phone. I use the one that came with my android cell phone and it works just fine. The lamp comes with a USB cable that you can plug into a USB port on your computer or plug it into a 110v to USB power module like your cell phone charger module. The lamp does not come with the charging module - you have to supply that if you need it. The light lasts a long time with just the battery, but eventually, you will have to recharge it.This would also make a good reading light on a nightstand in the bedroom. With it's different light levels and adjustable head, you could set it so as not to bother your bed partner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTVFG57C0S7PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012RYFC36#wasThisHelpful","RTVFG57C0S7PG","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live out in the boonies. There are no streetlights or power poles. It gets really dark at night. In my back yard, I have a 16' x 12' shed where I store my riding mower, snow blower, tiller, power tools, garden tools, etc. Many times I find myself needing something from the shed after dark. So, I have to hunt up a flashlight - usually the batteries are weak and I have to live with it or stop to change the batteries if I can find fresh ones - and then head out in the dark to find the shed, unlock the door, and get what I need. It can be a hassle sometimes.Then, I was offered the opportunity to try out this great looking light in exchange for an honest review. This looked like the perfect solution for my situation. As the picture I have included shows, I installed this light above the right side of my shed door. It was easy to do as the light comes with a couple of screws and anchors if you need them. There is also a tool to enable the light to turn on after shipping. You stick a thin wire (included) into a small hole in the light housing, and that takes the battery out of standby and enables it to do its job. I used a cordless drill to make a hole for the mounting screw directly into the header above the door. Solid connection and the light was ready to do its job when it got dark. The photo I have included shows where the light is located and the light working after dark. It provides plenty of light to see the key hole in the door knob making it easy to lock and unlock the door.There are several things I really like about this light:1) It is solar powered - no batteries to replace. They charge in the daytime and last all night.2) It has a low output mode so that it glows all night but has low battery drain. The glow is bright enough that I can see the shed in the dark yard and head right to it.3) It has a motion sensor and goes to full brightness when you get within 10 feet or so. The low light mode lets me see where the shed is and head to it and then it bumps up several magnitudes when I get close, making it easy to see the knob on the door and find the key hole.4) I haven't timed it, but after you leave the range of the motion sensor - more than 10 feet, after about 30-45 seconds, it goes back into the low light mode. I am a night owl and don't go to bed until 3am or so. I have checked the light at 3am and it is still glowing at about the same brightness as when it first got dark.5) I have installed the light under the eve of the shed above the door. The solar panels do not get direct sunlight. But they still charge with the ambient light around the shed during the day and they last all night. So, these do a good job of charging when not in direct sunlight.6) Living in the boonies, going out in the dark is kinda creepy because there are all sorts of critters out there. I have seen fox running through the yard. Some neighbors have seen a bobcat and coyotes. There is something calming about having a beacon out in the dark showing you where to go and keeping the critters staying in the dark.This is a quality made product. I feel it will last a long time. I love it and am very happy to have it out on my shed to make my life easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHPIUOVVAWQYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8T076A#wasThisHelpful","RHPIUOVVAWQYP","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have a lot of devices in the family that are charged via USB chargers. The wife and I each have android smartphones and a kindle fire tablet. When the kids come up, their phones also seem to always be plugged in wherever they can find an outlet in the house. Then, we have teenage grandkids who bring their devices up and they seem to always be running low on juice. Many times they forget their cords and have to borrow one of ours and sometimes we never see it again. So, it is handy to have extra cords around.I picked up a charging hub on Amazon that has 5 USB ports on it. Until I ran across this offering with 10, cool looking cords, we used whatever cords were available in the house - usually long cords that got tangled easily. What I like about these cords is that they are only 7-inches long. I can plug my charging hub into an outlet in the kitchen out of the way and connect  5 of these cords to the 5 ports on my charging hub and just leave it available all the time. When someone needs a charge, they just pick a spare cord and plug in their phone/device. Because they are short, the don't get tangled with each other. Also, being flat instead of round, makes them less likely to get tangled.I have not found any of the 10 cords that don't work. I love all the colors. They look cool snaking out of my charging hub. Plus, this is an excellent price for 10 cords.I was given a set of these in return for an honest review. However, I would have easily bought this set if I had know they existed. I may buy a couple more and give them as gifts to members of the family who seem to be losing theirs all the time. Or, each member of the family can be assigned a color specific to them and that is the one they use when they come to visit. As long as the cord stays connected to the hub, they can't get lost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P8CSB6BCZ4ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5GZJR6#wasThisHelpful","R1P8CSB6BCZ4ND","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a new Scag Liberty Z, Zero turn mower. The Engine on my mower is a Kohler 24 HP KT-735. After the first 10 hours of use, I am supposed to change the oil and filter. So, I hit my first 10 hours and looked for the same filter on Amazon that came with my Scag - it was a kohler 12 050 01 filter. I could not find that particular filter, but ran across this one with the same number but with a ""S"" at the end of the part number. I could not find anything that explained what the ""S: meant, but otherwise the part number was the same. So, I gave it a chance.So, it looks like the ""S"" at the end of the part number stands for ""Short."" This filter is shorter than the one that came on my mower, but it fit just fine and seems to work fine. So, I am happy with this filter and would order it again. I do not like to use aftermarket filters and prefer to use genuine manufacturer parts for things I paid a lot of money for - like this mower.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3U7RIFX5APN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O3LNMW#wasThisHelpful","R3E3U7RIFX5APN","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a 25 year old garden cart that has been sitting in the shed for years. The tires had dry rot so they wouldn't keep air. When I recently picked up a new zero turn mower for mowing my 1 acre of land, I decided to add a hitch to my mower and put the cart to use. I couldn't find new tires locally that were this size, so I looked on amazon. I was actually looking for just the tires and not the wheel itself, but it turned out that the tires already mounted on the wheel were less expensive than just buying the tire - so I went with these. The wheel has a 3/4-inch shaft which is what I needed for my cart. Most of the tires of this size out there have a 5/8"" shaft, so you have to watch what you are ordering.These tires turned out to be an exact replacement for my old ones - down to the color and look of the wheel base. They fit over the axle on my wagon and were a perfect fit. So, now I have my cart back and can haul things around my acreage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQ2HMAYHH72A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WQL38U#wasThisHelpful","RNQ2HMAYHH72A","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never heard of this Ragi Atta, but I do know what millet flour is. I was offered the opportunity to try this product for an honest review and being an adventurous cook, I decided to try it.I am always in the kitchen and make most of the meals in our house. My specialties in the breakfast area keep my wife guessing about what ""concoction"" I might come up with to surprise her. So, when I received this bag of millet flour, I started adding it to some of my normal recipes to see how it worked out.The first thing I made for breakfast is one of my wife's favorites - baked oatmeal. When I make baked oatmeal, it has chopped apples, cinnamon, pecans, buttermilk, maple syrup, and of course old fashioned oats. Everything is mixed together and baked in the oven. Then you spoon it into a bowl and add milk. I like to spoon some vanilla ice cream on top and let it melt into the warm oatmeal. So, it is almost like a dessert for breakfast - ha..ha.. In this instance, Instead of the 2 cups of oats, I used 1 2/3 cups oats and 1/3 cup of Ragi Atta. The millet flour gave it kind of a nutty flavor, so it turned out great. Plus I liked the tecture of the baked oatmeal a little better. So, the first experiment worked great.One thing I discovered is that this flour has a rather strong smell/taste of millet. So, if you use too much, the flavor takes over the dish and that is all you can taste. I discovered that when I made sour dough pancakes for breakfast using my own sour dough starter. I used too much of this flour and ended up with a lot denser pancake than normal and the millet taste was dominant. So, for making pancakes, you don't need more than a couple tablespoons in your batter.I made banana nut muffins one morning and used about 1/3 cup of this flour along with 1 1/2 cup of spelt flour and a packet of an organic instant oatmeal to give it texture. This one turned out great in texture and flavor. The millet flavor goes well with mashed bananas and chopped pecans.So, I like this new flour and am adding it to my pantry. It adds protein and an interesting flavor profile to baked goods. I am sure that everyone has different taste buds, and I found that in some cases I added too much millet flour in some recipes so that the flour took over from the other flavor ingredients that I like. So, you will have to experiment to get the right amounts for your own tastes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1763OPSGK4KH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJFBJQE#wasThisHelpful","R1763OPSGK4KH0","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been reading about the health benefits of drinking alkaline water. The water out here where we live is pretty acidic and this ionizer is supposed to raise the PH to around 10 which is very alkaline. Plus, my water has a lot of minerals. We use a Keurig coffee machine and the water reservoir always seemed to be collecting a scale inside where the water sits. Plus the nozzle got clogged up now and then with scale so I had to clean it often. I had a carbon filter device attached to my cold water tap in the kitchen but that didn't stop the scale build-up in the water reservoir. So, I went looking on Amazon for a better filter and that lead me to discovering the health benefits of alkalized water. So, I picked this particular device to give it a try.We keep this pitcher on the kitchen counter, always with water in it. We drink it instead of the tap water and we use it in the Keurig coffee machine.First of all, this filtered water tastes a lot better than the tap water. It has more flavor. So, it is easy to remember to pour a glass of water from the pitcher when you are thirsty. Also, I no longer see little floaty things in the water reservoir of my Keurig machine. Plus, the Keurig water reservoir seems to be keeping perfectly clean. I see no mineral build-up inside the reservoir. And - the coffee tastes great!So, for me, this was a great purchase and I am very happy with this particular product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WLAHM36M1HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYE8MK0#wasThisHelpful","R18WLAHM36M1HE","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live in a gated lake community and are retired. We have lots of get togethers with other retired friends here at the lake, playing cards or just getting together for conversation and wine. Yes, wine is a big thing with us and our friends. When we play cards and are hosting the group at our house, I like to have a bottle of red and a bottle of white sitting out on the counter so drinkers can refresh their glasses during the evening. The whites always start cold, but by later in the evening the whites are warmer than I would like and lose flavor.When I was offered the opportunity to try out this ingenious device in return for an honest review, I jumped at the chance, since it fulfills a need I have all the time.So, this device has 3 components, the stainless steel rod which you put in the freezer, the aerator that is made of acrylic with some holes in it that screws onto the stainless steel rod and fits in the top of the wine bottle, and a stopper that goes into the top of the aerator. The stainless steel rod is solid - no wine goes through it. You put the rod in the freezer for at least 4 hours to get really cold. The aerator then screws onto the top of the cold rod and you insert it into the wine bottle. The aerator has a graduated soft middle part that allows it to fit into different size bottle tops and has a pour spout on the top. The pour spout is an interesting design that they say eliminates drips. I found this to be true. The stopper just fits into the pour spout to seal the wine until you want to drink more.So, how does it work? Just great!I tried this on 2 different kinds of bottles, screw top and corked bottles and the pour spout fits in both types. It provides a secure fit so there are no leaks around the spout where it fits in the wine bottle.I tried a bottle of red wine that had sat at room temperature (68 degrees in our house). Inserted the cold rod for about 20 minutes and then poured myself a glass of wine. It was the perfect drinking temperature. You could feel the temperature change just holding the bottle which felt much cooler after the 20 minutes. So, it works fine cooling a red wine down to the right temp.For a white wine that was cold to start with, it kept the wine cold enough to enjoy for about an hour and a half and by then, the wine was gone. I didn't test it for hours and hours, but it is good for at least an hour and half.The aerator/pour spout also works as advertised. The spout does not leak wine down the side of the bottle, so you get clean pours. Also, I tasted the wine before going through the aerator and after going through the aerator and the aerator definitely makes a difference depending on what kind of wine you are drinking. I have found in the past - using a much more expensive dedicated aerator device, that drier red and white wines can be improved greatly by aerating before drinking. But with sweeter wines, most people can't tell the difference. This aerator definitely smooths out the taste of a drier wine. I like it.So, the stainless steel rod is supposed to be filled with a gel that keeps it cold when you remove it from the freezer. Therefore, it does not have any holes in it that the wine goes through before exiting the bottle. It is a solid rod. The holes for the wine to exit the bottle are up on the pour spout itself. So, the design of the aerator holes that the wine goes through makes the wine stream a little weaker than normal. Therefore, the wine comes out of the pour spout a little slower than you are used to. It takes a little longer to pour yourself a glass of wine. But that is not a big deal with me. It just means it is harder to splash the stuff outside the glass if you are usually a messy pourer.Bottom line - this is a great wine tool with a reasonable price. It makes a great pour spout, it cools reds down and keeps whites cold as advertised, plus it makes dry, red and white wines taste smoother. The wine stopper fits tightly and does its job well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQH6VMWY9C4F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOXHIAO#wasThisHelpful","RQH6VMWY9C4F8","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several years ago, I tore the meniscus in my left knee. I had surgery to repair it, but it still ""tweaks"" me to let me know it is not happy when I do some things - like bowling. So, for protection, and to make it happy, I wear a brace when I bowl in my 3 leagues. The braces I have used in the past have metal bars on both sides of the knee and they are cumbersome and large and very hot. They also tend to slide a little and I have to readjust them after I start sweating during a game. After a night of bowling, I am sweating so bad underneath, my skin is wrinkled. Also, there are places on my old braces that rub my skin raw. I dislike wearing them, but I don't like the alternative.Then I received the opportunity to try out this new brace in return for an honest review. It looked a lot better than the ones I have been using, so I jumped at the chance to get it and see how it worked.First of all, it comes in a nice carrying bag, making it easy to stow away in my bowling bag or in the glove box of my car. The carrying bag is nylon-looking, light, and with a netting that lets the brace breath which may help over the long run with sweat odors or drying out when I don't have the brace on and it is stowed somewhere.The brace itself looks of high quality. The seller's price is very reasonable for the quality of this brace. There is padding everywhere on the underside which means no rubbing raw of skin or blisters on your skin. The underside is a very nice blue color and there are some soft, wavy-looking silicon strips on the upper and lower parts of the brace so it doesn't slip when you have it on. The neoprene that is used in this brace is soft and comfy and has holes in it to allow circulation of air. I couldn't believe how comfortable it is when I put it on.The box comes with no instructions for putting it on, so I had to play with it a little to figure out what was best for me. The best way I found was to straighten my leg out in the front of me (not bend it), position the knee hole over the top of of my kneecap, and then start with the lower strap to Velcro it in a comfy position - go to the middle strap, and then end with the top strap to position and fasten it. I tried going the opposite direction, but the lower part of the brace would bunch a little making it harder to fasten the way I wanted. Starting at the bottom solved the bunching problem as the top part doesn't do that.Once it is on, I couldn't believe how much support it gave my knee- plus it is really comfortable. I ran up to the bowling alley which is only a mile from my house and tried it out on several games. Perfect fit and perfect support for my sliding leg. This brace is following me to the bowling alley from now on! It is so much better than what I have put up with in the past. Also, I have a big yard and garden. Sometimes when I am outside working in the yard, I am up and down pulling weeds, picking veggies, trimming things, and my knee starts tweaking me. I can wear this brace around the yard doing my gardening tasks and that seems to make my knee happy. The soft stabilizers on each side of the brace do a great job keeping my knee from twisting too much when I am out and about and I almost forget it is on.Bottom line for me is that this is the best brace I have ever run across for my favorite sport, bowling. Plus it is comfortable enough to wear around the yard when I am out put-zing. The only problem with the put-zing use is that I get it dirty quite often so it has to be cleaned more often than I like. Cleaning is via hand washing- not machine washing, so it takes a little more effort to keep it clean depending on what activities you do when you are using the brace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11YV51BU2VY28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTBNBJU#wasThisHelpful","R11YV51BU2VY28","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live out in the boonies. We get huge lightning storms, tornadoes, and bad thunderstorms out here in the Summer. It is not unusual to lose power out here at night, and I keep flashlights around the house so when the power goes out, I can find a flashlight - after stumbling around a little - and not kill myself until the power comes back on.My last flashlight bit the dust and I was going to go buy another one when I was offered this particular device to try out in exchange for an honest review. Good timing! This motion sensor light is perfect for our household and the way we live.First of all, it appears to be very well built - plus it looks cool. It has some heft, so it feels solid. I weighed the entire device at 6.8 oz. on my kitchen scale. It is about 5-1/8"" tall and 2-3/8"" wide. It has a charging base that plugs into a standard 110 vac wall outlet. The sensor itself fits onto the base unit via a built in magnet plus there is a small lip on the bottom of the charging unit to help secure it so it charges properly. It came fully charged from what I could see after I opened the box.On the front of the motion sensor is an ""eye"" of sorts that detects movement near the sensor and turns on a light that covers the whole face of the sensor. I have found mine to work when I am anywhere up to 10 feet away from the sensor. The light is actually located behind the sensor eye, but its brilliance is distributed across the whole front face of the sensor giving out a soft glow that is bright enough to allow you to see where you are going, but not blinding like an overhead light when you turn on the light switch. At the top of the sensor are 2-very bright LEDs which you can use as a flashlight by pressing a switch on the side of the sensor. The switch turns off the face light and turns on the flashlight or turns off all the lights.So, the operation is pretty easy. You plug the base unit into a wall outlet and then put the remote sensor onto the base unit. Because it is magnetized, the remote unit sits securely on the base. The whole thing is dark until you get within 10 feet of the sensor and then the face glows for about 25 seconds. If the power goes out, the face of the sensor glows like a beacon for up to 1.5 hours making it very easy to find in the dark. When you press the switch on the side, it turns into a flashlight that will get you by in an emergency or until the power comes back on. It makes a good flashlight for everyday use too, although the beam of the LEDs is not real focused. Even though it is not focused like a regular flashlight, it gives off plenty of light to get you by.So, the wife and I really like this as a nightlight. I have it set up in the bedroom on a wall outlet just inside the bedroom door. We have a king-sized bed, and I sleep on the side farthest from the bathroom. Before having this sensor, I would frequently stub my toes on the bed frame when I got up in the night to use the toilet. I would have to feel my way to the bathroom and sometimes would bump into the wife's dresser or a corner of the wall until I could see the nightlight that is in the bathroom. My path takes me within 10 feet of this device and now that I have it, it ""sees me coming"" and lights my way to the bathroom with no problem. It's glow does not wake the wife. It turns off after 25 seconds. On the way back to bed, it sees me again and glows my path back to the bed. By the time I climb in and cover up, it turns off. So, the off timing is perfect for the way we live.Bottom line is, we really like this light because it fulfills a lot of our needs in one device - a nightlight, a flashlight, and an emergency light when the power goes out. It stays charged as long as you keep it in the base when not in use. All this at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8KCX3RTKOI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XDOVE7S#wasThisHelpful","RY8KCX3RTKOI0","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wife and I are retired and while our health is good, we like to travel. Last year we did some traveling in England, Scotland, and wales. When we returned, and I retrieved my luggage from baggage claim at Ohare, I noticed - again - that the TSA had inspected my luggage and the lock was gone. I have lost 3 locks while travelingin the last 5 years. Perhaps the TSA is not locking them properly after inspection, or just the crappy locks I buy fall off. I don't know.When I was offered this lock in exchange for an honest review, well I couldn't say no, could I? I had to buy a new one anyway and perhaps this one would not lose itself and end up where all lost TSA locks go.So, my impressions when I received this lock - solid construction. This thing weighs more than my previous locks. So, it seems to be more sturdy. The instructions to set it up with your own code are pretty much the same as all the TSA locks I have purchased. It worked fine and I set the code. I locked it and unlocked it - there is a noticeable ""click when you lock it and unlock it. Again, that makes it seem more substantial. I like the 3-digit code rather than the locks with 4 digits because the code is easier to remember. I know having 4 digits is more secure, but I figure that if someone wants to get into my suitcase at the airport, if they can't get it open in a minute or so, they will just go to the next easier target. 3 digits is enough to take someone a while to go through all the combinations and it just isn't worth it for most thieves.I used it on a recent trip to Disney World - worked great and it didn't disappear. So, I am happy. Next time I need a TSA lock, I will pick up another one of these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAM58O778II9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUFLBJ8#wasThisHelpful","R1IAM58O778II9","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This light definitely makes a statement in your garden.Pros:- Looks expensive from a distance.- Looks great in my garden.- Larger than most solar garden/path lights- 24 LEDs under the silver dome provide excellent light output- Light output is higher than most solar garden/path lights- High capacity NiMH batteries make the light last a long time.Cons:- Not sure how long this light would last in the elements. It is made from light plastic. The silver dome looks metallic, but is actually plastic painted with silver.- The stainless steel tube that the light sits on is very thin and comes in 2 pieces. The two pieces are joined by a plastic plug/connector. I had trouble pushing the 2 tube pieces onto the connect to join them into one tube. The stainless steel is very thin and I was worried about putting a dent in the tube or collapsing it because it was not easy to slide either tube onto the connector. You have to use some muscle as the fit is very tight. Same for fitting the light itself onto the tube. I never did get it all the way seated, but close enough to do the job.- The light is made in china.This light sits about 25 inches off the ground, so it casts a wide arc of light around your garden.  I have to say that this light really looks good in my garden and lasts a lot longer than the other solar LED lights that I have scattered around on my deck and into my Rock garden. I am writing this at almost 1am and my other solar lights are dead while this one looks just as bright as it did at sundown. So, performance-wise, this is a 5-star product. I knocked it down a notch because I am not sure how long it will last sitting out in the weather up here in Northern Illinois. It does not feel as substantial as it looks. Only time will tell.  I like the way the light works and illuminates my garden. The picture I submitted shows the light output at 1am in my garden. It has been on for about 5 hours. I hope it lasts for a while as it adds class to my night garden.Note that I received a complimentary light in return for an honest review.Update: Well, I am really liking this light. It has been out in my garden for about a week now and has withstood some nasty rain and wind storms. It stays lit all night, doing it's silent vigil with it's steady illumination - still going when the sun rises. All my other solar lights along my brick walkway are long dead while this light is still showing up strong when the sun comes up. I have had visitors comment on how nice it looks out there at night. This light is definitely a keeper!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SEILWYJ70ADR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SY48CU4#wasThisHelpful","R3SEILWYJ70ADR","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Function-wise, this tray has a lot of uses that aren't described by the name. It does look like it might be made of rubber, but it is plastic, instead. Because it is lighter plastic, without anything sitting in the tray, it tends to not sit flat on a flat surface and a corner may pop off the ground. That is why I gave it 4-stars instead of 5. But when you start putting things into the tray, it lays flat just fine.In my case, I am using it in my garden. I grow onions and potatoes here in Northern Illinois. When potatoes are ready to dig, I usually dig them up, throw them in a bucket, and take them to where I have a hose to wash the dirt off them to prepare for storage. After washing each off individually, I throw them in the grass beside me and grab the next one. In the end, the wet potatoes have picked up grass and dirt from the yard and I have to wipe each one off again and set it somewhere else to dry. If I put them back in the bucket, they are stacked upon each other and never dry out. This tray is perfect to throw the washed potatoes in, spread them out, and let them easily dry before storage.When the onions are ready to pick, I used to pull them out, clean off the dirt, and let them sit on the deck for a couple days to dry out. The problem with that is they tend to roll around on the deck and get in the way of us using the deck. With this tray, I can set them in the tray out of the way and the sides of the tray keep them from rolling around.When not holding potatoes or onions, you can set the tray anywhere in a sunny spot and fill up with potted plants. When you water your plants, the water stays in the tray and does not run all over your deck or wherever you have it. You can group your plants in the tray for colorful arrangements.Another use my wife has is for holding craft items - like skeins of yarn, rolls of wrapping paper, quilting blocks, and things like that in her craft room. The tray is large enough to accommodate a lot of different items and the sides keep them situated in one place instead of scattered around in different hidey holes where they can get lost. When she is working on a project, she can keep those items she is using handy in the tray sitting next to her work table and sometimes on it off to the side.So, these are some of the uses I have found around our household. You can spread a tray's usefulness for all year with different projects that happen at different times of the year. If it had been made of rubber, I might have tried sitting my gas and oil cans in the tray to keep my garage floor clean. But I do not know if the plastic in this tray could hold up under spilled gas, so I didn't try it.Note that I received a complimentary tray in return for an honest review. I discovered a lot more uses than I would have thought.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLTDW53YT6LY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2XWWRM#wasThisHelpful","RLTDW53YT6LY5","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just purchased a SCAG Liberty Z, Zero Turn mower for keeping my acre of land mowed. It is orange with black trim. I have a cart that I wanted to pull with my Scag, but it didn't have a trailer hitch. This hitched looked like the perfect fit. What I liked about this hitch is the slots on the back side which would allow it to accommodate different bolt hole configurations. My scag had a couple of bolts that were 3.5 inches apart and this hitch allowed me to bolt it to the backside of my Scag. It fits perfectly and the black color matches the trim on my mower.This hitch is plenty heavy-duty for my cart which will hold about 800 pounds of dirt, mulch, bricks, and other ""stuff"" that I haul around my property.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYLGB4FJBVK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJNPDIS#wasThisHelpful","R3LYLGB4FJBVK1","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never seen a product like this. When I was offered the opportunity to try it at a discounted price, I took the offer. I am always interested in alternative products that provide healthy benefits compared to similar products that are made with junk ingredients. Toothpaste is an example of a product with junk ingredients. Although regular toothpaste is good for freshening your breath and cleaning your teeth, it contains some nasty ingredients that give me the willies every time I brush.I did some googling on the term ""Miswak"" and discovered it has been used for centuries for brushing the teeth. so, there is some history. Reviews all around the web are pretty positive. So, I thought - What the heck - I will give it a try.The packaging is very interesting. It is in a nice box that has pulls on the sides so the inside of the box slides out the side revealing another box with the separately wrapped Miswak sticks resting inside. The sticks are in a plastic holder, like a pen casing. So you take the cap off and the stick slides out. Storage is easy as you just pop it back in the pen-shaped case and pop the cap back on. One thing that might drive you crazy is the plastic coating that you have to remove to get to anything. First the box itself has a plastic/cellophane covering that you have to get off before getting into the box. Then each ""pen"" with a Miswak stick inside is wrapped in a kind of bubble wrap that is difficult to get off. I had to get a sharp knife out and remove the wrap. It was not easy and somewhat time consuming. The 2 pens are individually wrapped, so you have to go through the same procedure for each. But finally, you can get to the actual product.The seller e-mailed me a 1-page instruction to show how it works. There is nothing on the box. Each stick has some kind of coating - it reminds me of wax - that you have to scrape off to get to the actual Miswak root underneath. So, you take a sharp knife and shave off about a half inch of the waxy substance to get to the hard root. Then you bite around the root part a few times and it turns into a bristle of sorts - a wet bristle since it has your spit on it. From here you can rub it up and down on each tooth and the bristles get between your teeth and actually do a pretty good job of cleaning. It is a lot harder to get to the back side of your teeth, so you kind of have to work at it a little more.After using it a little, some of the bristles start to fall off in small pieces, so it is good for one use and then you have to cut off the used part, shave some more of the waxy substance off, and start a new set of bristles for the next brushing. You can pop the stick back into the pen holder for storage between brushings.So, here are my observations.Pros:- The Miswak brush does do a pretty good job of cleaning your teeth. After a day of eating/drinking, I sometimes have a little scum between my teeth and gums and this cleans that off really well. After using it, my teeth feel very clean. The bristles also do a pretty good job of cleaning food out between your teeth,too.- This would be great for camping because you don't need water. Just a pocket knife for shaving the waxy coating and the rest you can do with your mouth.- The pen holder thing makes it convenient to carry around as it has a pocket clip so you can slide it into your pocket just like it was a pen.After a few days of use, my teeth do seem to be slightly whiter. I would have to use it for a while to see if there is any significant kind of whitening. I am an old guy with lots of years of coffee drinking. I always thought my teeth were stained beyond help. If this thing can at least keep them from getting darker, then it is worth it to use them. I cannot see these sticks giving you the white movie star smile that is probably expensive veneers.Cons:- The stick has a funky smell to it. However, to my taster, it didn't taste like it smelled. I couldn't actually detect any taste.- Since it has no taste, it didn't really freshen my breath like a minty kind of toothpaste would do. so, if you are used to brushing your teeth with a minty toothpaste and have a pleasant minty breath afterwards, you won't get that with this stick. It doesn't give you bad breath, it is just kind of neutral. Your mouth may be different, but that is how it works with mine.- Brushing the back side of your teeth is not so easy because of the length of the stick. When you get down to a nub after many uses, you can fit it back there more easily. Front of your teeth is very easy.- When using the Miswak stick, it takes a lot longer to brush your teeth. First there is the issue of shaving off the outer covering, then chewing on the end a little bit. Then you have to work on each tooth in your mouth individually, both front and back. It will take you twice a long to clean your teeth versus a toothbrush. But if you are out camping or traveling, this is much more convenient than getting out a toothbrush, finding water, brushing your teeth, and washing your mouth out.So, I like these and will continue using them on occasion. Depending on how much work you are willing to do to clean your teeth, you might like them or not. It was worth trying for me and I am glad I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXULIPNB8R89E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYJYSTM#wasThisHelpful","RXULIPNB8R89E","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife is the secretary of our Sunday Night mixed bowling league. For our end of season banquet, she was looking for something cool to give to all the bowlers that bowled in our league. My idea was to make a refrigerator magnet for each person showing their final average, high game, and high series of the season. So, I created a template that got 10 magnets on a page. Each is about 3.5-inches wide and 2-inches high. There were 40 bowlers so 4 sheets was enough to cover the league. I created a graphic for the ladies and a different graphic for the men. I have an HP 5650 color inkjet printer and I fed each sheet through the printer separately to make sure no sheets stuck together because of the magnetism. The printing quality on these sheets was excellent. I cut out each magnet using my wife's craft cutting wheel and board and a ruler to keep the lines straight.The magnetism in each individual's stats magnet was just right to stick well on the fridge. These were a big hit at the banquet. These worked great for this application and I will probably do it again next year as my wife was elected secretary again for next years league.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q6WYEZOFLGYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U2S0H0#wasThisHelpful","R2Q6WYEZOFLGYE","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay - Our 41 year old daughter was up here to the lake to visit, so we decided to check out the movies on the Fire TV Stick. We saw Big Hero 6 was available and decided to watch it. The audience was our 41 year old daughter, my wife at 67 years old, and me at 68 years old. So, a little range in ages watching. We all thought the movie was great. The previews would make you believe this might be suitable for only younger kids, but we were entertained throughout the movie as you got into the story. 5-stars from this household.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H0PAGTMINJA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYB8YP4#wasThisHelpful","R1H0PAGTMINJA5","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have one of these for our household and I bought one for my daughter's household. We both have 46-inch LED HDTV sets and fast wireless routers in our houses.The Fire TV stick is very easy to set up when you first plug it into your HDMI port on your TV. It walks you through the setup. You don't really need the manual. It was also easy to set up streaming on our wi-fi router. We were up and running in no time. Amazon has a great lineup of programming, It is actually mind-boggling what you can get via the Fire TV stick. There is so much content to watch, that I cannot even begin to list things we discovered. It is fun just going through the program guide, which kind of reminds you of Windows 8, and discovering interesting channels. Some channels (or apps if you will), like Netflix, will cost you  to watch. But there is a ton of free stuff if you are an Amazon Prime member. You get a trial subscription to Amazon Prime when you buy one of these, but I am an Amazon junkie, so I already have Prime Membership. Prime is well worth the $99/year when you see the large amount of programming that is available to you. I buy a LOT of stuff on Amazon because I live in the boonies and it is easier to get stuff on line than drive for miles and waste gas. So I use my Prime membership mostly to get free 2-day shipping. Free programming content via the Fire TV stick is just a bonus for me.We have not had any issues with program lags because of slow Internet connections. The Fire TV stick does some kind of magic buffering in the background so that you can watch shows without any program freezes on the screen. This is a great buy and may wean you from cable or satellite TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZNB6FE23SHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","R1PZNB6FE23SHV","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We play Hand & Foot and Sevens from Heck in a card group here at the lake. Our cards are always wearing out. These are a good buy for replacement decks as they wear out. They have held up well and I like to keep several decks in the cupboard when we need them. You can go to the dollar store and get decks of cards, but they are thin and don't hold up. These are better quality and last a lot longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEJE8YDRRFDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0021JL0ZM#wasThisHelpful","R2GEJE8YDRRFDE","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great hat! I have had a lot of fun wearing it around and having people ask me if it is my real hair. Since I am a gray haired old guy, it matches my sideburns pretty well, so most of the time it just looks like I have a wild and crazy hairdo.I have paid a lot more for hats that were a lot lower quality. This hat is well worth the $20 charged. It is high quality and adjustable for any size head. I have a large head and it is hard to find hats that fit, but the adjustable band on the back will make it so that it fits even a lard-head like mine. I now have 2 of these hats - the other one is green/gray chex. I also bought a USA hat for my grandson who doesn't have gray hair, but he likes the shocked looks he gets from his friends - ha..ha..This is a great hat and you can have a lot of fun with it. It will also keep your head warm on cold days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8I6163UHNPGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CT8GI5C#wasThisHelpful","R8I6163UHNPGT","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our household is not an Apple household. In fact, I dislike Apple business practices that always makes it feel like there is a hand on your wallet/purse. So, we have all android and Windows devices in the house. The wife has a Droid RAZR smartphone and so do I. We also have a Kindle Fire. The kids and grandkids, when they visit us, have android devices and they are always losing their charging modules/cables causing their devices to always be low on juice. Seems like we are always looking for the chargers for these things to keep them charged. I have a drawer full of charging modules for devices we have had over the years. You have to stop and think, ""which device is this particular module for?"" when you want to charge something. We could throw most of them away if we weren't paranoid about throwing away one we might really need later.So, when I saw this product that had 5 USB ports on it, I jumped at the chance to evaluate this unit in exchange for an honest review. First impressions, when it arrived, was that this is a solid piece of gear. It has substantial weight and a solid feel. It looks and feels like a quality piece of gear. The power cord that comes with it is heavy duty, too. The specs say that it weighs 5-ounces, but it feels more substantial than that. Other specs that are quoted include:-Superfast technology: Detects your device to deliver its fastest possible charge speed up to 2.4 amps per port or 8 amps overall.- 40W power output among 5 charging ports, Simultaneously charge any five of your USB compatible devices at full speedAlso, the product description would lead you to believe that it's ""Mart Detect Power IQ"" Detects only certain devices to deliver the fastest charge.  Those devices are I-Phones, Samsung phones, Galaxy, HTC One, and Nexus phones, and the I-Pad. When I queried the seller about this, they replied that my Motorola Droid phones and my Kindle Fire would be detected and charged accordingly. So, I took a chance.This charger is substantial enough that you can set it on a table on its side with the USB charging ports aligned vertically. This saves a lot of space on the desktop and this is how I have it set up. Plug the AC cord into the unit and into the wall and you are ready to go. The ac input is 100-240 volts, 50-60 hertz, so it will work internationally too. It does not come with plug adapters, so if you use this overseas, you need a plug adapter at the ac end to match up with whatever country you are in.I plugged my RAZR and my wife's RAZR phones into 2 of the USB ports and then plugged my wife's Kindle Fire into a 3rd. They all showed they were charging. A small complaint I might have is that there is no light on the unit itself to show that it is live and working. You will know it is good when you plug in your device and your device shows that it is charging.This thing does charge a lot faster. My RAZR's stock charger module says that it is 0.6 amps max. It takes hours for my RAZR phone to charge. Plugged into this charger, my RAZR went from 50% to 100% in less than an hour. That usually takes at least 2 hours using the factory charger. The Kindle Fire is also normally slow in charging, but it took about 45 minutes to charge the Kindle from about 40% battery. So, this charger is really a lot faster than the stock ones that come with our devices. The grandkids stopped off today and we had 5 devices plugged into this charger and they were all charged before they left.So, first impressions are very positive. My wife had to make a trip out of state to see her mother in Iowa who is having some health problems. Our 40 year old daughter went with her. She has a Galaxy S3 phone and my mother-in-law has a Galaxy S4. My wife ""borrowed"" the charger from my computer desk and took it with her. She texted me that it works great with the 2 galaxy's and her RAZR plugged in. Very convenient to have one charger that handles it all. While here at home, I just leave the cords plugged into the charger and route them behind the charger itself when not in use. When somebody needs a charge, the just grab a cable that is already plugged in, bring it to the front, plug it into their phone, and the charging begins. In no time at all, our devices are ready to go on their own. I really like this charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJCT5K4X44O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3IZKU2#wasThisHelpful","R3IJCT5K4X44O7","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our household has a couple of Droid RAZR smartphones. My wife has the RAZR MAXX while I have just the RAZR, which means my battery is about half the capacity of hers so mine is always running down. I have several backup batteries that I use to charge it while out and about and off the grid, but they are similar to the size of my smartphone and flat like my smartphone. So, it is like carrying around two smartphones.I was offered the opportunity to try a complimentary charger/flashlight in return for an honest review. It is interesting the clever ways manufacturers improve a product to make it easier or more functional than the competition. There are zillions of device chargers out there, but here is one that is also a flashlight and that makes it stand out. I liked the form/function of this charger, so I was happy to get one and try it. It is something that I would buy myself if I knew it worked as advertised.So, here is the rundown.I have a postage scale that weighs in tenths of an ounce accuracy. This charger/flashlight weighs 2.8 ounces. My cell phone weighs 5.4 ounces, so this device is pretty light in comparison to my cell phone.Dimensions are 4.25"" long and about 7/8 inches in diameter. So, it looks like a mini-flashlight. It has both metal and plastic construction. It feels solid. You can actually unscrew the bottom and get to the guts of the flashlight including the battery which is soldered to the circuit board that has the USB plugs and electronics to run the functions of the charger/flashlight. So, a handy person with a soldering iron could change the battery if it ever failed.The top screws off to get to the bulb, but it appears to be a special module with the bulb built in, so you could not go to the hardware store and just get a replacement bulb if that ever failed.As a flashlight, this thing is very bright. There is a small button on the bottom of the unit  that turns it on near 2 USB connectors. Push once and you get a very bright solid light. Press again and you get a dimmer solid light. Press a 3rd time and you get an emergency flasher. Press yet again and everything is turned off. The light is very bright, so if you carried this around with you in the dark, you could use it to feel safe and too see quite a bit in front of you. If you are stranded on the road, it definitely gives you a very bright warning flash to attract attention for help.As a charger, the unit comes with a short USB charging cable with a mini-USB connector on one end along with an adapter that converts the mini-USB to another version of a mini-USB that can be found on other devices besides a smartphone. So, you get the option to pick from 2 different styles of mini-USB depending on your device. The other end is a standard 1/2-inch USB connector which will plug into your PC or your cell phone wall charger.The bottom of the unit has two USB connectors, a standard USB connector that you use for charging other devices and a mini-USB connector that is used for charging this device. So, depending on whether you are using it as a charging device or charging it from another source, you just turn the cable that comes with it around and plug it into the appropriate connector depending on what you are doing with this charger/flashlight. The other end then goes into the device you are charging or a PC/AC charging module. This device does not come with an AC charging module. You use a PC or the charging module that comes with your smartphone if it has a standard USB connector on it.Performance - When I received this charger/flashlight, I plugged it into my cell phone AC charging module and let it charge fully. It has a light on the bottom that shows reddish/orange to show it is charging. When it is done, the light goes out. My Droid RAZR was showing 50% battery, so I plugged it into this charger and a blue light comes on the bottom of the charger showing it is charging something. This charger charged my RAZR to 100% in about 50 minutes. It usually takes my RAZR's AC charge about an hour to charge my phone from 50%, so this actually performs better than my cell phones regular charger. When recharging the device, it took a lot longer - several hours. But that could be because of my AC wall module that came with my cell phone. It is rated at 750 ma max for charging.It would be nice if there was some way to gauge the state of discharge of this device. I have no clue how much juice is left after charging my cell phone for 50 minutes. The flashlight still was plenty bright and so was the strobe, so it looked like there was plenty of juice left to charge another phone or device.This is a great charger and flashlight. The strobe part doesn't bother me like some other reviewers have noted it bothers them. I like having something like this in my car for emergency purposes, but it is small enough that I can throw it in my pants pocket and carry around with me or the wife can carry it in her ""packed fulla' junk"" purse and it will fit in there without much problem. It's dual function is great. I am glad to have this and might buy a few for Christmas gifts for family members.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D1VAZHBAQVWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV5Q0WM#wasThisHelpful","R1D1VAZHBAQVWI","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wife and I love to cook so we have a big kitchen and lots of different kinds of knives. The knives we use most are our cutco knives and though they are quality knives, our frequent use means they get dull. I have several kinds of sharpeners that all work to a degree. What I liked about this sharpener is that it has a nice handle that works for either right or left-handed people and it also has a rubber bottom that makes it grip the counter top very well. I feel very safe using this sharpener as my hands are away from the blades so if there is a slip of some kind - like the blade flips out of the slot - my hand is far enough away to stay out of danger. Plus, there is a protective lip on the holder between your hand and the sharpening slots to give added protection.It also has a 2-stage sharpening system as compared to most sharpeners who just have one place you run your knives through.The first stage uses courser Tungsten carbide blades for when your knife is really dull and it gets the sharpening going quickly. You don't want to push real hard - just a few easy strokes through the slot will take a lot of dullness out.The second stage is for the final sharpening stage. It uses ceramic rods to hone the knife for final use. If your knives are already fairly sharp but just need to be touched up, you can skip the first stage and just run them through the second stage ceramic rods.We have run most of our kitchen knives through the sharpener and are very pleased with the results. It does work great. When you run your thumb across the sharpened blade, you can feel like you will slice your thumb open if you gave any pressure at all. So, they are very sharp. The unit is very easy to clean. There are no hidden places that might collect metal filings or grime.Bottom line - I love this sharpener. It performs as advertised and does a fantastic job of sharpening my knives. Just remember not to press down too hard when sharpening - use a light touch and you will like the results.One note - The Amazon product page for this sharpener says that one of the benefits of this sharpener is that it can be used on serrated knives. I have tried it on a serrated bread knife and it works great. However, the box that the sharpener comes in says in big letters. ""Warning - This product cannot be used on serrated Knives and scissors."" I contacted the seller and they were very responsive. They told me that the box is inaccurate and they are redesigning the box to correct that statement. The sharpener cannot be used on scissors, but it works fine on serrated knives. Since I have used my sharpener on a serrated knife, I know that this is a true statement. So, for now, you can't pay attention to the warning on the box if you get one of these in the old design box.Another note - I received a complimentary sharpener from the seller in exchange for an honest review. I brought the mis-worded warning on the box to their attention and they have told me the box is being redesigned to correct that warning statement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JAYRS7D57OU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPASBK8#wasThisHelpful","R27JAYRS7D57OU","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wife and I are retired and one of our vices is Mickey Mouse. Yes, we are Mickey Heads. We belong to the Disney Vacation club so we are ""forced"" to travel the 1,100 miles South to Orlando at least twice a year to get our money's worth out of our annual park passes and to use our vacation club points. That is really not a problem since we like to take family and friends with us sometimes and sometimes we just go down by ourselves.One of the activities we have become really involved in is pin trading with the cast members and with the park goers. My sister is also a big Disney Head and likes to trade pins. She mounts hers on the wall in big picture frames that her husband makes. We like to keep our pins in albums. The albums are pretty expensive when you buy them at the Disney parks. They sell the albums with the inserts but we have not been able to find the inserts by themselves. I hate to buy more albums just to get the inserts, so when I ran across these on Amazon, I grabbed them to see if they were the same inserts as what comes with the whole album - and they are!The package gives you 5 Felt Covered Pin Pages and 5 Pin Dividers that match the ones in the album. So, we are able to add pages as we get more pins and don't have to spring for more albums, yet.For our purposes, this was a great find. At $23, it is expensive, but the album is $40 so at least you are saving some money by being able to continue to use your existing albums for a while longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T559RW9N9F0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTKMVR8#wasThisHelpful","R1T559RW9N9F0P","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several years ago, I tore my right knee meniscus. My right leg swelled up something fierce clear down to my ankle and foot. Surgery fixed it for a while, but while i was helping my mother-in-law with some tree trimming duties, I had to climb ne of her trees and apparently tweaked it again. While the knee does not hurt, my right leg below the knee has been swelling up and down and bothering me. I read that compression socks could help reduce the swelling so I thought I would give it a try and ordered these socks to see if they worked.I am 6-2"" tall and weigh about 200 pounds. The circumference of my ankle is about 10 1/2 inches around. My calf, at it fattest part, is about 15 1/2 inches around. I ordered the LARGE size sock and it turned out to be perfect for my leg. It does come ll the way up to my knee and provides a snug fit to keep my leg from swelling. It is hard to get on and off because of it;s length, so you have to work to get it to slide up your leg and pull tight up to your toes. But once on, it is comfy and I hardly notice it is on. I have other regular socks that are the same color, so I use one compression sock on the bad leg and a regular sock on the other leg. That way, when the one compression sock gets dirty, I have the other one to wear while the first one is washed.Note that these socks packaging says they must be washed by hand and air dried - not in a dryer. So, they are highr maintenance than a regular sock. I don't know how long they will hold up, but for the first few wears, they are working great and are doing the job to keep my right leg from swelling up like a balloon. I suppose I need to go back to the doctor, but I dislike going to the doc and I don't want more surgery which puts a cramp on my lifestyle for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZMM89N45ESZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQC2LCY#wasThisHelpful","R1OZMM89N45ESZ","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My computer desk is a mass of wires. I have a laptop that acts like a desktop so it sits on my desk all the time. I don't move it around. I have two printers, a network cable that goes to my router, an external hard drive, a cord that connects my computer to a stereo speaker system, a usb cable that I use to connect my smartphone to download pictures I take on my smartphone and an external keyboard that I hook up to my laptop and use instead of my laptop's keyboard. This leaves a mass of cables all around my computer.The colorful clamps in this organizer package is perfect for my use. Each of the stick-on rubberized clamp/holder will hold at least 2 cables - one in each slot. If you have smaller wires, like a stereo cord for your speakers and a usb keyboard cord, you can get 2 wires into one slot. A larger cable, like a network cable takes up most of the room in a slot.These clamps have a peel off backing that exposes the stickup that lets a clamp stick to a surface on your desk. I have them stuck on my destop and also on a side wall of my desk behind the laptop. They appear to stick really well. I have not had any problem with a clamp un-sticking or falling off any surface they are attached to in my configuration.The package comes with 6 clamps. 3 clamps took care of my configuration leaving me 3 more which I used at my mother-in-law's house. She is 90 years old but is a big computer user. She has an old house with really old wiring. Her spare room, where her desktop is located, does not have any wiring for cable. When mediacom installed her Internet service, they put the cable box in her bedroom where she originally had her computer. Later on, she wanted her computer moved out of the bedroom and into the spare room. I had to leave the router in her bedroom on top of a dresser and route a network cable back under her florr, through her basement, and up through a furnace grate in the bedroom. This means routing the cable around a door frame in the spare room to get it to the computer desk where her desktop now resides. I used these clamps to route the cable around the door frame. They stuck fine on her wall. I didn't have quite enough and had to go to home depot to get some generic cable holders - like what you would use for a telephone wire, and I had trouble getting them to stick on the wall. Any weight from the network cable would pull them off. But these cable organizer clamps help fine. We will see how they perform long term, but right now, I am very happy with their performance.Plus they are cool colors. They are made of some kind of rubberized material which makes it easy to pop a cable into a slot and pull it out again without dislodging the clamp from the surface it is attached to. The price is reasonable.Note that I received a complimentary package of clamps to try out and provide an honest review of how they worked for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QHK8X9GJ6T5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR8CDZA#wasThisHelpful","R1QHK8X9GJ6T5S","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All I can say is - This is an amazing device!What you get in the box:- Spiral vegetable slicer- Cleaning Brush- 3-In-1 Rotating Magic Slicer- Ceramic PeelerThe spiral vegetable slicer is the magic tool in the box. The cleaning brush is handy because the blades in the spiral slicer are very sharp and you want to get the brush down in there instead of a soft finger to clean out any residue after using. The ceramic peeler is also a useful tool to have around the kitchen. However, the Rotating 3-in-1 Magic Slicer could be dangerous. Basically, it is a round plastic cover over 3 different kinds of very sharp blades that give you different slicing effects. These blades are very sharp and you could easily cut yourself while cleaning this tool. Getting the thing to rotate through the different blades is also a head scratcher as there are no instructions in the box in how to use it. There is a white disk in the middle that you have to press down on one side to make the disk flip out so you have a handle you can grab with your fingers to rotate the blades that are inside the plastic disk. I am on the fence with this tool. The ceramic peeler that also comes in the box has the same function as one of the blades on the rotating peeler and I feel that the ceramic peeler is safer to clean than this rotating thing. Personally, the main tool in the box, the veggie spiral slicer is the the tool you will use and the other devices are things you might just throw in your kitchen drawer and forget about.So, on to the spiral slicer. It has comfortable metal hand grips on either side of the slicer which has two chambers. Each chamber has a different sized blade so you can get really slim veggie noodles, or thicker ones that are more like spaghetti depending on which chamber you use. I have never seen a tool like this before and was somewhat skeptical when I first looked at it. It works best with zucchini or similar kinds of squash that are somewhat firm, long, and round. So, you cut the ends off your zucchini, stick one end into the slicer and turn the zucchini with your hand. Out the side of the slicer comes nice long stings of zucchini - just like noodles. It works great. Just collect the sliced zucchini in a bowl for the next step of preparation.When you get down to where there is about 2-inches of zucchini left, there isn't enough finger room left to keep turning it with your hand. So, the slicer is provided with a cap that has short rods on the underside that you stick into the top of the zucchini to hold it tight and then you turn the cap to get as much of what zucchini is left through the slicer. You will still have a very short piece of zucchini left that you just can't get through the slicer, so I just cut the rest into small strips with a knife and throw it in with the rest of the ""noodles."" You will also end up with a small core which is the middle of the zucchini that pops out the bottom of the slicer. This will be the seedy middle. You can throw that away or slice it up and throw it in with the rest of the zucchini that you just noodled.The whole thing is very slick. Two medium zucchini will give you  a pretty good sized bowl of zucchini noodles. The way I used them, I added Mrs. Dash onion-herb seasoning and black pepper and mixed it well with the zucchini in the bowl. Get out a big skillet and pour in a couple tablespoons of EV olive oil or a couple tabs of butter. When hot, put the seasoned zucchini in the skillet and saute it for about 8-10 minutes or until it is crisp-tender. Then add some spaghetti or pasta sauce and let it cook a few more minutes to heat up the sauce. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and eat up. We like to add organic chicken sausage sometimes along with the zucchini and let it cook with the zucchini noodles before adding the sauce later. What you end up with tastes a lot like real spaghetti but with none of the carbs.I believe, this slicer with change the way we eat pasta dishes. Zucchini noodles taste just as good, if not better than real pasta and they are a lot healthier. So, this will be a regular dish at our house for the foreseeable future.When you buy the slicer, you also get a link to an on-line recipe book which is in pdf format. It has pretty yummy looking recipes, most of which use zucchini for the noodles. Zucchini and yellow squash are the perfect size and shape to run through the spiralizer. There is some mention of using sweet potatoes in the spiralizer, but if you were to do that, you need to make sure your sweet potato is fairly long and skinny or it won't fit into the spiralizer opening. If you have to trim the sweet potato to fit, you will be losing some sweet potato or you will have to use a knife to cut the leftover waste into strips. Carrots are too small around to run through the spiralizer effectively. Basically, you should think zucchini and yellow squash for the main veggies to use with this tool. But the recipe book has some great ideas. My suggestion would be for the maker of this device to include the recipe book in the box instead of having you go to a website to download the recipes.All in all, this is a great tool. I am going to buy some for Christmas presents for several family members who are gluten intolerant and can't eat regular noodles. I received the unit I am reviewing for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TSYHA8LFE4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK1C9QG#wasThisHelpful","R35TSYHA8LFE4V","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wife and I have 3 devices we take with us on trips. We both have Motorola Droid RAZR phones and we have a kindle fire. This plug will handle all 3 at once, although the console area gets a little busy with so many devices plugged in.My wife's car is a chevy traverse and the lone cigarette lighter plug in the front seat is located in the center floor console under the car radio and to the right of the transmission stick shifter. There are plenty of cubby holes here - like a couple of cup holders, that will hold the phones while charging. Just be sure to use the USB individual cable that goes with the device you are charging. For the Motorola Droid RAZR, using a generic USB cable may make the phone charge a lot slower or not at all.The plug is compact, but fits our cigarette lighter just fine. Nice and tight and it doesn't stick out to get in the way of anything else. It has a couple small orange LED lights that glow when you plug it in to show that the device is working and doing its job. The ports are not marked, so you don't really know which one is the higher capacity port. It charges our RAZR phones just fine in all the ports. My wife has a RAZR Max which has a bigger battery that takes longer to charge than the standard battery in my RAZR, so it is hard to compare charging time. In my case, I don't really care about length of time to charge our phones. We live out in the boonies, so a trip anywhere takes some time. We have found that this plug works just fine for keeping our phones going when we are out and about. It took about 45 minutes to charge my phone from about 50% in what I think was the top connector which has more charging power than the other two.I like having the multiple connectors so we can charge are phones together. You can buy car chargers for our phones from Verizon, but at a premium price. The price for this plug is very reasonable in comparison, so it is a no-brainer to go this route for charging our phones.This plug appears to be well built, it works great, and compared to the expensive chargers at the Verizon storefront, this charger is a bargain. We like it a lot and use it a lot and have not had any problems.Note - I received an evaluation unit from Bolse in return for an honest review of the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXJDJ1WL4VUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLIBGW6#wasThisHelpful","RTXJDJ1WL4VUP","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only recently learned about home pulse oximeter devices when I was asked if I wanted to evaluate such a device. I am a retired older gent (age 67) who tries to live a healthy lifestyle and the idea of being able to check my own blood oxygen levels was very intriguing. Like most guys, I don't like to go to the doctor and try to do my own self evaluations for health conditions. My wife says I am going to die on her someday because I don't see the doc when I should. But it is hard to change.I wear a pedometer and my goal is 10,000 steps per day, even if I am sick. I actually average 14,000 steps per day, so that is pretty good, I think. With all that walking, you would think that my body should be good at moving oxygen around to where it is needed in all my nooks and crannies. So, I was very interested in seeing what this device would measure.I recently had knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus and also had some sinus work done and both required general anesthesia at the hospital. When you are in the operating room, they clamp an oximeter to your finger and the stats display on a roll around screen so the anesthesiologist can monitor your breathing and pulse while you are under. So, I have seen these in action at the hospital and know what my readings were while I was there. I did not know you could get a model for home use until I saw this device on Amazon.For those who don't know about oxygen saturation in the human body, oxygen saturation is a term referring to the concentration of oxygen in the blood. The human body requires and regulates a very precise and specific balance of oxygen in the blood. Normal blood oxygen levels in humans are considered 95-100 percent. If the level is below 90 percent, it is considered low, resulting in hypoxemia. Blood oxygen levels below 80 percent may compromise organ function, such as the brain and heart, and should be promptly addressed. Continued low oxygen levels may lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest.So, that is a quick rundown. I received my oximeter and was surprised at how small it is. It fits over your finger just like the one at the hospital. This particular oximeter comes in a nice nylon carrying case and also has a lanyard that you can attach so you could carry it with you around your neck. Perhaps, as an athlete, you might want to keep it with you for when you are working out and want to check your heart-rate and how your body is delivering oxygen to your brain. I am not an athlete, so checking every now and then is good enough for me.So, how do one of these gadgets work? The big fold-up sheet 2-sided manual that comes with this oximeter has a huge amount of technical gobble-de-gook with equations and charts that will make no sense to a non-scientist. To me, the majority of the manual is worthless. A small section that tells you how to work it and what the display means is all you need. With all the data in the manual, you would think it would give you the range of oxygen levels you want to see - like what is a normal range for humans. But it doesn't. So, I have to knock this device for not providing adequate information about the use of the device and what the readings mean. I had to google for the info. So, basically, normal blood oxygen levels in humans are considered 95-100 percent. You can be 90-94% and not be in any trouble, but lower than 90% means you should see the doc.So, how does this unit work? I think it is great! I give the unit itself 5-stars for the following reasons:1) It is small, 2-1/4"" x 1-1/2"" x 3/4""2) Nice nylon carrying/storage case3) It has a rubber cover to protect the device4) It comes with 2, aaa batteries5) The digital display is easy to read and you can adjust the display for different viewing angles and how the numbers display - like upside down, wide left and right, and narrow top to bottom plus make the numbers bigger. The different views are done by pressing the power/options button repeatedly to change the display.6) It appears to be pretty fast and picking up your pulse and reading the oxygen levels in your blood.7) The readings agree with what I saw at the hospital when I was in the OR for my procedures. So, I believe it is accurate.8) The device is very simple to use. It only has one button that takes care of everything. You can figure it out without trying to wade through the manual. I just wish the manual would tell you what your results mean.9) The gadget powers down after about 13 seconds after you take your finger out. The power button does not turn it off but it does turn it on when you want to use it.Cons:The manual that comes with this device has a huge amount of technical jargon and warnings and blah..blah.. that will make you want to take a snooze. You can keep it around if you are a scientist and want to read all the science behind oxygen levels and how this thing works, but I would guess that 99% of the population would be glassy-eyed in a minute or so. There should be a small slip of paper with the very easy instructions to operate the device and a chart showing what normal oxygen levels are. You shouldn't have to google for the info you need.Bottom Line - This is a great tool. My oxygen levels are 98% and my pulse rate hangs around 60 bpm which agrees with what the hospital measured when I was in the OR. I give the tool 5-stars for a great piece of technology but the manual gets only 3 stars. The average is 4-stars. With a different manual/operating guide, it would be a 5-star product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CSTYAX36H3LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5P190E#wasThisHelpful","R1CSTYAX36H3LY","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wife and I are retired and travel quite a bit.  I have a laptop I like to take with me to handle e-mail, browse the web, upload pictures to facebook, etc. I have a large computer carrying briefcase kind of thing with wheels and an extendable handle. It has its own pockets for things. I like to use it as a carry-on to airplanes, so I have lots of other stuff in it for a trip - snacks, change of clothes and a toothbrush in case my luggage is lost. My laptop goes in there too and all my cords, mouse, USB jump drives, power cords, smartphone charger, etc. are stuck in various pockets. I have so many pockets in this thing that I actually thought I had lost my power cord to my laptop on one trip and so after my battery ran down, I was dead for most of the trip. I found it later tucked into a hidden pocket of my briefcase.So, I looked for something that would hold all my laptop/techie accessories in one place where it was all accessible at once. This item does a great job. It even holds my laptop's power supply and cord. It has all kinds of pockets, some zippered, to hold things of various sizes. It will hold everything I have that is associated with my laptop and smartphones. It folds up nicely but can get bulky for folding when you have a power supply module, AC cords, and a mouse in the pockets. But it has a strap that wraps around the organizer with a clip on each end that is adjustable. So, you can wrap the cord around and clip it so the organizer is ""roundish/lumpy"" but the cord keeps the organizer from falling open and nothing will fall out. Throw it in your briefcase or suitcase, and everything you need to be tech boy/girl is at your fingertips whenever you need it. The organizer appears to be well built and sturdy, so I do not anticipate any problems over time when using it. For my purposes, this is a great travel companion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFX8D48L6UNW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KEQHLHA#wasThisHelpful","RFX8D48L6UNW0","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, this is the smallest device battery pack I have seen on the market. The usual external charging battery devices out there are similar in size and weight to a smartphone. This battery pack is much smaller with dimensions of 3.5"" x 1.1"" x 0.78"" and the one that I obtained is a cool blue. I have a small scale that measures in ounces, and this unit came in at 2.2 ounces. So, this is small enough to throw in a handbag or drop in your pocket and you hardly know you have it.I noticed some reviewers said that the USB cord that came with their battery pack was a flat cord, but mine came with a round cord that is 13.5 inches long from the end of the standard USB connector at one end to the end of the mini-USB connector at the other end.This battery pack is very easy to use. First you have to charge it. To do that, you plug the mini-USB connector of the accompanying cable to the battery pack and the other end to a computer or to an AC, USB charging module that comes with most smartphones. This battery pack does NOT come with an AC-DC module for charging it. I have a motorola Droid RAZR and the AC charging module that I use to charge my RAZR was used to charge this battery pack. Just unplug your normal charging cable for your phone and use the cable that comes with this battery pack instead. One end of the battery pack has a couple LED lights which glow red while it is charging and when the charge is done, they turn blue. My battery pack took about an hour and a half to charge out of the box.When it is charged, you can use it to charge your smartphone or any device that has a mini-USB connector. So, to use as a charger, you turn around the USB cable that comes with the battery pack and plug the standard USB connector end into the battery pack and plug the mini-USB end of the cable into your cell phone or similar device. No lights will show on the battery pack, but your device will show that it is charging. This battery pack has labels under each USB connector (very small to read) that show which is the input (for charging the battery pack) and which is the output (for the battery pack charging other devices).To test it, I took my Droid RAZR phone, whose battery was at 50%, and plugged the battery pack into it and set it down to charge. I did not use my RAZR during the charging period. It took about an hour and a half to recharge my smartphone to 100%.I like to wear cargo shorts during the Summer. My smartphone goes with me everywhere and I drop it in one of my pockets. My Droid RAZR does not have the best battery around and it likes to run down before the day is over. Many times I am not where I can plug it into an AC outlet since I am out running around, so having a battery pack like this in my pocket to keep it going is pretty nice. The cord and battery do not add much weight when plugged into my phone and everything fits fine in my cargo pants pocket.So, this battery pack has a lot going for it.- It is small in size (3.5"" x 1.1"" x 0.78"")- It is light weight (2.2 oz.) so it is easy to throw in your bag or pocket and not weigh you down.- It charged my droid RAZR (down to 50% battery) in about an hour and a half. That's about the same time as it takes to charge my phone with the AC adapter that came with my phone. So, it is comparable.- It is cool looking. The cord color matches the color of the unit itself. My cord was round, not flat like some others have stated they received. I like round, so it is fine with me.I like this battery pack a lot. It goes with me everywhere my smartphone goes.I received a complimentary battery pack in exchange for testing it and giving it a review - positive or negative. This turned out to be one of those great products out there that I can really use and that work great. I really like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HK9HJEEAU3PK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDLL3YS#wasThisHelpful","R1HK9HJEEAU3PK","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not have a giant grill. We like to BBQ, but my grill is pretty basic with 2 burners.We are retired with just the wife and I around the house most of the time, so I don't really need a big, fancy grill. When we have guests, my BBQ grill is fine for cooking hotdogs and hamburgers. I don't like steak, so we rarely cook steaks. My BBQ utensils are also basic and were given to us by family over the years. So, there is nothing fancy there.When I was offered the opportunity to test out these tongs, I jumped at the chance as the ones I have are kind of ""crappy"" to say the least. Thin construction and anything of size is hard to pick up and turn over with my old ones.Pros:- These tongs are made of stainless steel. They have no hinges to catch your hand in when using. They are made from one continuous piece of stainless steel and offer just enough resistance when picking up.turning items, that is it not difficult to use, but still they spring back to their original form.- I would call these heavier duty - at least compared to what I had.- I love the teeth at the end which help to pick up items on the grill so they don't fall off when you are turning them.- The handles are aluminum but are insulated so that they don't get hot when you are using them. They look nice and are very functional.- These are easy to clean. No hidden areas to collect grease/crap and you could just throw them in the dishwasher.- I can throw these in the kitchen utensil drawer when not in use.Cons:If there was a con, some might think that these are maybe 2 inches too short. In my case, my basic grill is just the right size at 26"" x 14"". I don't have an issue with heat getting to my hands when I am outside cooking. A bigger grill might present a problem to some. But at 13.5 inches long, these tongs are fine for my use. I do not use these in the house - just with my grill outside on the deck. So, if you have a giant grill, you might not like the length of these tongs.Bottom line - I gave my old tongs to a neighbor who didn't have any. These tongs are now my only tongs for grilling.

As a guy, I hate adding oils and hydrating products to my skin like my wife does. I don't like the feeling of that garp on my skin. So, I live with dry skin. I hate the normal soaps on the market because they just dry out my skin more, plus their scents drive me crazy. When I was offered the opportunity to try this soap in return for an honest review, I jumped at the chance because our household already uses coconut oil for cooking and I really like it for its health benefits.So, for me, this looks like an ideal bath soap. After using it a few times, here are my observations...Pros:- This soap lathers quite well. When showering, you get a good load of suds which makes you feel clean in the end.- The slight coconut scent is great. Nothing overpowering here. It is just a slight, clean, coconut fragrance which is very pleasant. There is nothing here to make my eyes water.- After just a couple showers, I can see the skin on my legs and arms are already not so dry looking. So, this soap seems to be somewhat hydrating.- This list of ingredients hit my hot buttons for ""not-crap"" and the soap is certified organic ingredients.Cons:I do not think this soap will last long. The way its suds and with my wife using it too - I can see it not lasting a long time. Oh, the pain - I will have to order another bar sooner than later - ha..ha..Bottom Line - This is on my list for reordering and using on a regular basis. I love this soap!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31U81UWPO016C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAOUJ4E#wasThisHelpful","R31U81UWPO016C","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of vitamin C. I know you can get it from drinking fruit juices, but juices are just too high in sugars for me. Even the 100% juices are too high in sugars. So, I like to take a supplement to make sure I get an adequate amount of C. When I ran across this brand of C, I saw their ads that say this brand is non-gmo. It is non-gmo because, the brand uses non GMO corn from Scotland as a source for the product. So, there is a plus. The other thing that I like about these capsules are the citrus bioflavonoids and rose hips which are added to enhance the bioavailability of vitamin C. These components help the body to absorb the C better.I also like the price which is reasonable for what you are getting. I have had a recent problem with a Viva Labs product (not C) I purchased, and I gave the product a bad rating because the oil-based tablets came melted/stuck together and could not be removed from the bottle. Viva Labs reached out and sent me a new bottle which was just fine. So, they stepped up to make a customer happy. I am a fan of Viva Labs products because they use non-GMO ingredients and have good prices. And they listen to customer complaints and try to fix things.Both the wife and I take this Vitamin C and believe it has helped us to stay sick-free for 2014.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F9BZCCW5KA9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6C3GCY#wasThisHelpful","R1F9BZCCW5KA9H","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay - my use of this bag is a little different that its intended use.I live out in the boonies and I have fruit trees and berry bushes that produce lots of great tasting fruits that also make great flavored liqueurs. I like to turn ripe fruit into liqueurs that I then use for mixing interesting cocktails for friends and family who come to visit.Typically, you pick your fruit and put it into a jar and then cover with your booze of choice - like vodka or brandy - let is sit for some time, and then strain the fruity muck through cheesecloth or coffee filters to get a clear end product. I have problems with coffee filters in that it takes forever to filter the fruit from the booze as the pulpy fruit blocks passage of the booze into the end result bottle. Cheesecloth works a little better but passes smaller particles of fruit to the booze so it is thicker and not clear.When I saw the nut bags on Amazon, I got to thinking that this product may solve my problem for good.So, here is my setup.- I have a gallon glass tea container with a spigot at the bottom.- I pour a 1 liter bottle of vodka into the jar.- Pick a gob of ripe blackberries from my patch and fill the nut bag about 3/4 full.- Drop the filled nut bag into the top of the jar, spread the open top of the nut bag over the jar top and screw the lid over the top of the jar/nutbag top so that the nutbag is suspended in the vodka.- Shake and set the jar in a cool dark place - like the basement.- Every couple of days, shake the jar.- After a week or two, take the lid off the jar, pull the nutbag our and squeeze the bag back into the jar to get any juices left in the bag into the liquid gold in the jar.What you have left in the nut bag are the seeds and garp you don't want in your liqueur. Add sugar to the jar and taste via a shot glass under the spigot. When you get your desired sweetness, use the spigot on the jar to fill empty bottles to store in your bar.This turned out to be a very sturdy strainer. I squeezed as hard as I could with my hands (messy but kinda fun) and the bag held up just fine.  When done, I just turned the bag inside out to dump the fruit garp into the garbage. It does leave a dark stain on the bag which fades quite a bit when you just wash it under cold water. I tried putting some bleach in the sink with cold water and letting the nutbag sit for a while and then helped lighten the stain, but not get rid of it completely. I just look at it as battle scars and a reminder of the tasty contents the bag held when fulfilling its purpose of producing liquid gold for my liqueur cabinet.It also worked fine for fresh peaches and making a peach liqueur. So, you can add this capability as another use for this terrific product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTRRL3OMLSOYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KY4Z1I8#wasThisHelpful","RTRRL3OMLSOYY","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this fitbit zip for my daughter so she could be my and her mother's friend on the fitbit tracker website. So, now we can help urge each other on to get max steps per day. My wife and I have had our fitbits for a while now and what we like about these is that:1) they are small and easily fit in your pocket, on a belt loop, on my wife's bra strap, etc. They come with a jacket that has the clip on it. You can take the fitbit out of the jacket to replace the battery which is a flat type watch battery that is readily available everywhere.2) The fitbit zip comes with a USB dongle that plugs into a PC USB port. You just leave it there and any time your fitbit is close to your PC while it is on, it will automatically upload your step data and chart it for you on the fitbit dashboard you have on the fitbit webite. You just log into the fitbit website and all your stats are there - daily, weekly, monthly, yearly - in graphs and charts. It is easy to keep track of your progress over time.3) Fitbit will give you medals for reaching certain milestones - like 100 miles, 250 miles, 1000 miles, etc. So, this is an incentive to keep you going. I am currently at my 3,000 mile mark. That is a nice medal to have.4) You can add buddies to your fitbit friends list. We have our daughter added to our list. Every week we get a fitbit e-mail showing how each of us ranks in steps for the last 7 days. Usually our daughter is around 135,000 steps, I am at 90,000 (god for an old retired guy like me), and my wife is usually around 70,000. So, the fitbit makes us look at each day tomake sure we get at least our 10,000 steps per day.5) Fitbit comes in all kind of colors so you can get one to match your personality.6) The zip battery lasts about 6-months. Not bad. I have found replacement batteries on Amazon for only a few dollars, so they are easy to find. Most grocery stores sell the flat battery required in their battery section.The fitbit team cares about their customers. My wife recently had a problem with her fitbit jacket and I e-mailed fitbit and they sent her a new one. I had mistakenly told them she had a fitbit one unit which is a different size so they sent the wrong jacket. I thanked them for their support and told them they didn't have to send me another one of the correct size, since it was my mistake and I didn't feel right asking them to send another. I said I would just live with the problem. But they turned right around and are sending me the correct one anyway at no charge. I am giving the incorrect jacket to a local school who has students that use the fitbit.So, this is outstanding customer support. We love our fitbits, they work great and keep us motivated to not be couch potatoes, and customer service is superb. You can bet that other family members will find fitbits in their Christmas stockings this Christmas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFT1BUXN7L1GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095PZHZE#wasThisHelpful","RFT1BUXN7L1GJ","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a health minded individual, so I am pretty up to date with the issues involving weight loss and diets. I am not one to think there are magic bullets out there that allow one to just pop a pill and get amazing results. I grow a lot of my own veggies organically, and I always try to buy organic at the store. I stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners, coloring, flavors, etc and always look at labels when I buy anything. I am pretty savvy when it comes to nutrition.I also wear a pedometer and average 14,000 steps per day, so I try to stay active. I am older (67) so my metabolism is not what it used to be. Fat likes to collect around my middle and love handles are very hard for me to get rid of. I was skinny as a rail in high school weighing 150 pounds at 6'-2"" tall, and I still had love handles. So, some parts of your body are just not fixable and you are stuck with the genes you have.I am a gourmet cook and we have lots of guests visit us because we live in a lake community and there is lots to do up here. So, I am cooking more fattening, though healthy, meals to please guests. When I got to 220 pounds, I decided I needed to cut back, so I consciously cut back on the cocktails (which I am famous for), and cut back on carbs in general. I got down to 200 pounds slowly in a 6-month period and hit a wall. My goal was 190 for my 6'-2"" frame. People say I look skinny, but it is my middle-stomach area that I don't like. I decided to try some supplements to see if they could get me the last 10 pounds I wanted and get me over the wall I had hit.I have tried Garcinia Cambogia and Raspberry Ketones with no results. So, I am now trying the Forskolin before going to a completely low carb diet, which I know works for me, but which is not the pleasantest way to eat. Once I get to 190, I will just continue to stay away from low fiber, high fat foods, drink water instead of cocktails most of the time but enjoy my cocktail creations only a day or two a week, and eat mostly complex carbs. My guests will still get their fix, but I will just stay away from the kinds of things I am serving them or keep servings to a lot smaller amounts.I have dropped to 193 using the forskolin, so this is working for me. I am about half way through my second bottle. It took most of the first bottle to get a crack in ""The Wall"" but after that, I could really feel the difference in my pants and the way they fit. It got me past my wall, which is what I wanted. I imagine that when this bottle is done, I will be where I want and I can just quit the supplement and watch what I eat/drink a lot closer. My pedometer keeps me active as I compete with my 41 year old daughter who creams me most of the time when it comes to steps/day, but I stay ahead of my wife of 45 years so there is some incentive there to not let her beat me too - ha..ha..So, for me, this product is a short term fix which got me over my wall for my weight loss goal. I will stick with more fresh veggies, fruits, healthy fats, like olive and coconut oils, and stay away from most grains (I have to eat my organic oats now and then). GMO foods have been banned from our house for some time. We rely on organic foods from my own garden and local farmer friends who we know do not spray or use GMO seeds and we can our own salsas, green beans, tomato sauce, etc. so we have access to them during the Winter. Overall, this product got me over my hump when other products did nothing. So, for my body, this has been a great buy. Your body may be different and react differently, but it worked for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQICK2LEF4U08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1H4I0Y#wasThisHelpful","RQICK2LEF4U08","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of Viva Labs products and have several different kinds of their supplements. I have rated them highly in the past. I ordered their Astaxanthin for the first time and was very disappointed. The tabs were all stuck together in the bottle in a big glob. I couldn't get them out of the bottle as the bottle narrows at the lid and the whole thing was just a globby mess. I ended up cutting the top of the bottle off with a bandsaw so I could get the glob out so I could try to separate the tabs. No deal - some were leaking and got red stuff all over my hands. I got a few unstuck, but it was making such a mess on the counter, I gave up.I sent an e-mail to the company but never got a response back. So, this glob went in the trash. I ruined the bottle trying to get them out, so I don't feel right going back to Amazon for a refund. Money wasted. I will not buy another Viva Labs product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6WTW6X202LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW505V6#wasThisHelpful","R3H6WTW6X202LE","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay - So, here is the scoop. I am not using this wrist wrap for weight lifting. It actually makes a really good support for bowling.I am not a weight lifter, but when I saw the form of this wrap, and looked at what you get for your money, I had to give it a try. Bowlers have a lot of different hand/wrist aids, some that cover the whole hand and half the arm, down to just a wrap that goes around the wrist to help support the weight of a bowling ball. Their costs range from about $12-$90 depending on what form you like and how much you are willing to spend. They all have their pluses and minuses. I happen to be a minimalist and I have tried the basic bowling support that just wraps around the wrist and I didn't like it because it tends to slide down my wrist while in use unless I wrap it so tight that it cuts off my circulation. They are also typically about 2-inches wide. I like a little more support than that on my wrist.What I like about this wrist support is that it it has a nylon loop attached to one end that you can slide over your thumb before you wrap it around your wrist This keeps the support in place so you don't have to wrap it so tight, making it a lot more comfortable. The strap is 3-inches wide and 12-inches long plus about 4-inches for a velcro strip on one end that secures the wrap when you get it comfortably wrapped on your wrist. With 12-inches of wrap, I can get it around my wrist almost twice, so that makes it easy to adjust where you put it and also gives you a chance to get a wider support base where it overlaps. The wrap is padded very well and that adds to the comfort.The support is very comfy and easy to adjust as you bowl - looser or tighter in a flash. What you get in the bag are 2 supports - one for the right hand and one for the left. I am right handed but I have found that by wrapping the support in the opposite direction around my wrist, I can use the left handed support on my right wrist. The only real difference is how the thumb loop is attached and that is why you have to wrap it in the opposite direction. The thumb loop is comfy and does not get in the way of holding the ball. You forget it is even there and the support stays solid where you want it on your wrist. So, really, you are getting 2 wrist supports for the price of one. The price is already reasonable - even less expensive than the typical single bowling wrist support that is similar in form - plus you get 2. What is not to like?With bowling season coming up, this support will be in my bag for the entire season for the 3 leagues that I bowl in. I am glad I ran across this product and decided to try it as a bowling aid. It works great for me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVMUJIRUCWPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K9T3XSI#wasThisHelpful","R3OVMUJIRUCWPG","AUYT2H281GPNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUYT2H281GPNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a variety pack of hot cocoa. My order included an assortment of Charleston Chew, Tootsie Roll, Junior Mints and Sugar Babies. Personally I feel you are better off buying cocoa and using hot water or milk and adding boiling water over using a Keurig. You will get a richer flavor and pay less. One of my big disappointments with these was the lack of nutritional information. I did not see a list of ingredients. So I don't know what they contained in terms of artificial sugar or how many calories they had. I looked up one of them on a nutrition app, the Tootsie Roll flavored cocoa, and it had 70 calories.

A check of other merchants found one offering it for the same price here but including a wireless hard drive (a $159 value) with purchase.I work online and run a lot of programs, so for me the memory of 4GB is not sufficient but it can be upgraded to a max of 16GB.The computer comes with a keyboard and an optical mouse but lacks a monitor.

"I bought my first Zumba workout back in the day when it was on VHS. There were little flowers floating around the screen as the dancers danced. Over the years I have purchased the Exhilarate set, Total Body Transformation and the workouts for Wii. All of the sets are nice quality and offer a good variety. The Zumba Fitness Incredible Results System is no exception. The set includes well thought out dance sets, dancers who are having a blast and a nutrition booklet.The step that comes with the set takes the place of a traditional step. It's nubby for traction yet gentle enough you could go barefoot (though that is not recommended). One complaint is of all the discs in the set only one uses the step. Why not have at least two workouts with the step instead of just one. However, you can use the step for extra exercise in general. I plan to use it to dance to my favorite music.Overall, if you like Zumba, I think you will really enjoy this set.

"The Belly Burn Plan is a comprehensive weight loss plan. It is obvious the author put a lot of work into it. There are in depth sections on the science behind the plan, recipes, day by day menu plans, exercise and more.And naturally this diet is not a diet but according to the author it is a lifestyle plan that you go on for life.The author categorizes everyone by one of four body shape and you are to eat according to your shape. She lists cravings for the types, menu plans and foods to avoid. To me this seemed gimmicky. Let's face it, no matter what shape you are if you eat less you will lose weight unless there is a medical issue. She also uses ""Jenny"" as an example of someone who can't lose weight but does thru this plan throughout the book. This gets old and boring. Bring on the real people and show the before and afters please.Note - She also suggests using agave nectar instead of sugar...recent studies I've read have shown agave nectar is much worse than sugar.I do think the diet can work but I did not find it that much different than other eat clean diets with exercise.So why the three stars? I personally think the eating and exercise plan would be very hard for most people to stick to. And to make it even more difficult it begins with a 3 day cleanse.Anyone that can stick to this is probably in decent shape to begin with. But that is just my opinion on it. If you want to jump directly into a restrictive step by step eating plan with high intensity exercise included this could be right for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R218Y2QR5Z49K4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037389323X#wasThisHelpful","R218Y2QR5Z49K4","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice quality vacuum. I was impressed by the overall feel of this appliance. It has great suction and is lightweight. I love that it is bagless and has a see thru canister so not only do you save money on bags but you can see the dirt as it is sucked up. It also features automatic cord retraction for quick and handy cord winding.That said I prefer to vacuum with an upright and use a smaller separate canister for upholstry etc. This definitely can do the job, I just find it was a bit awkward to use vs a smaller canister.Unlike other reviewers I did not find it any nosier than other machines and I also felt the construction was sturdy.If you are looking for an all in one canister this certainly fits the job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIH87RUQH7J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQJLGWG#wasThisHelpful","R3EIH87RUQH7J3","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this handy little scrubber. The handle is easy to grip and the pad does a nice job of removing grit. I have to give it 4 stars though because replacement pads are not readily available. I could not find them on Amazon.

"This is my 3rd George Foreman grill. The plates on my last one lasted a number of years but finally became very tired, so it was time for a new one. So I was super excited to see this as a selection in Vine.The grill arrived securely packaged. A strong box, and then the actual appliance box within another box. I pulled it out and was impressed with the sleek design and the quality of the ceramic plates.After washing the plates and clicking them in place, I decided to fix a gooey, cheesy sandwich. My other George Foreman had knobs to adjust the temperature, this has an easy touch panel. After clicking power on the grill it began to heat to the temperature I had selected. Within minutes I had a melt in your mouth cheese, turkey and pita sandwich. Mouth watering, fast and oh so good. According to the instruction booklet you should not use spray on the trays so I figured I would have a gooey mess to clean. But to my surprise once I lifted off the food the ceramic looked barely touched.The appliance adjusts so you can drip fat off of greasy food or use it flat for sandwiches and veggies. It's a nice size but does not have a super large foot print. It comes with waffle plates, two ceramic plates, a drip tray and a non scratch utensil to use on it. It also comes with instructions. The instructions include directions on how to care for and heat the grill. Directions on how long to cook different meats are also included. Alas there were only 3 skimpy recipes in the booklet. But oh well.On a side note, I noticed the website for the product had specialty plates for the grill as does Amazon including muffin, bake dish, griddle and others. And if you Google George Foreman grill weight loss, you can find weight loss recipes, success stories and a weight loss challenge for the grill.Overall, a super nice quality appliance that can help you ""knock out the fat"" and simplify kitchen cooking and clean up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T69YI902W9O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK18O#wasThisHelpful","R3T69YI902W9O2","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an epilator I purchased some years ago and it hurts. I was hoping that time would result in a no pain epilation tool but alas when you yank hair out from the root - it hurts! This tool tries to minimize the pain with a variety of head attachments including one for sensitive areas and an exfoliation brush to help prepare the area. All very nice but it still hurts.It's well made, feels good in the hand and can be used wet or dry. It also has LED light to make it easier to see what you are working on. This is a nice quality tool for epilation.One big drawback is it does not feature a shaver head. It's nice to have that additional feature so you have another hair removal option and keeping it in one tool saves space and money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q2KUCP1U8RVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS6XWII#wasThisHelpful","R3Q2KUCP1U8RVO","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Keurig coffee maker and as much as I love the convenience, the cost of buying k-cups daily is expensive and the coffee is not always as strong as in a coffee maker. So I was super happy to try this product.I love the stainless steel carafe. Stainless steel keeps the coffee hotter, makes the coffee taste better and is less worrisome than having an easy to break glass pot. The big advantage of a glass pot is seeing how much coffee you have left, Mr. Coffee solves this problem with this stainless steel carafe by including what they call ""light bar technology"" so you can tell how much they have left. This carafe holds about 12 cups of coffee.The coffee maker also boasts a method of saturating the grounds so the coffee tastes better but I did not notice a big difference in taste. The features are easy to use and the machine is sleek and attractive. Looks great on the counter!Overall its a nice machine for a delicious cuppa!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G9A0XXZN8WOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P20D05A#wasThisHelpful","R2G9A0XXZN8WOG","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed Marie Kondo's book, ""The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up."" I have read a number of books on clearing your clutter and Marie takes a different approach. Instead of going room by room as most books advise she suggests you organize by categories. She even gives you the order to go in to make it easier.But as much as I enjoyed the book I can't overlook her wastefulness. She constantly advises on to throw out what you don't need with only the occasional or donate it. She goes so far as to say she rips pages out of books so she can keep certain sections. Defacing an entire book for a few words when someone else could enjoy it, just doesn't feel right.She talks about how she cleaned her room and hauled out bags of trash and from how she writes I get the impression she is young. Her tips focus more on books and clothes over household items etc.Overall I really like the book, but I cringe when I read her recommendation to throw it out. I do believe this book can help get you organized top to bottom so I recommend it highly but I wish Marie would touch more on repurposing, gifting, donating, and even selling what you can't use to buy something you need instead of throwing it out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KP7ZCVZEITK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK0PICK#wasThisHelpful","R2KP7ZCVZEITK6","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had an expensive bread making machine a few years ago and despite my efforts the bread did not come out well most of the time and the clean up was a pain. Recently, I decided to try eating more natural foods i.e. foods without preservatives etc. And if you read the bread label, it is hard to find a healthy loaf. I decided to try the Oster based on the reviews and price point.The machine comes with very detailed directions on how to make bread and a number of recipes. And it is ultra easy to use. I made a country white, basic white, banana bread and pizza dough. All of them came out perfectly. I was stunned at how high the pizza dough rose and how delicious it tasted. Banana bread was super simple and tasty and the white loaves were delicious.Clean up is a breeze. The loaves slipped out of the machine easily and the pan washed up with little effort.One drawback to the machine is the height. It is fairly tall and I could not store it in my kitchen cabinets. But it is easy to lift as opposed to some of the machines that are longer. It makes a horizontal loaf and you can choose from a number of settings.Overall I rate this 5 stars for ease and yumminess!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1PT0TWRJY4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GXM0EM#wasThisHelpful","R1B1PT0TWRJY4G","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This embroidery machine is amazing. I love the way it makes intricate designs with ease. It's a great way to personalize items. It can be used for towels, tablecloths, baby bibs, sweaters, etc. Personalized items add a nice touch to your home and are perfect to give as gifts. It comes with 55 designs built in including borders and letters. You can download more from your computer and even make your own. Designs include flowers, animals, sports, transportation and much more.Despite all that it does, it is compact and the handle makes it easy to carry. It comes with accessories including two hoops so you can match the size to the design like using the small one for baby onesies. It also comes with instructions, and I also found it very helpful to watch the video on the Singer sewing machine site. It has a number of nice features include a backlit touch screen and a language option for different languages.Despite my limited sewing skill, I was able to whip up things that looked like they took hours of time.

"I have dry skin but have never liked applying lotion after a shower. I have to wait for it to absorb before getting dressed, it seems to take a long time, and never seems to last anyway. As a result, I don't do it and my skin is dry.When I saw the Nivea Body in Shower Lotion, I was curious if it could work. But it does. It leaves a light layer on your body of skin smoothing ingredients, so your skin feels soft and supple after use. It should be combined with a body wash as it does not wash the skin it moisturizes it.It glides on the skin easily and is so easy to use in the shower instead of after.One drawback is it does contain scents. The scent is not heavy, but I would prefer a product fragrance free. Hopefully, they will come out with this next.Overall fab product for smooth, touchable skin!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQISK0W3QIGMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV9KLXS#wasThisHelpful","RQISK0W3QIGMG","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""A year from now, you will wish you started today.""  With those words Mimi Spencer kicks off ""The Fast Beach Diet"" inviting you to super charge your intermittent fasting program.  In this new book Mimi shares a 6 week plan to get you ready for the beach, a wedding, class reunion or just to super charge your weight loss efforts. Intermittent fasting has been life changing for many. I am on a number of forums where members share their stories and the results are incredible. Many say it is the easiest method they have ever used to lose weight. I personally have lost weight, lowered my blood pressure and improved my blood work results with a combination of intermittent fasting and calorie counting.The book starts out by revisiting ""the FastDiet"" book by Dr. Michael Mosley and Mimi Spencer. It condenses ""the FastDiet"" to give a core view of the program and its benefits. In a nutshell to lose weight on the plan, women eat 500 calories per day and men 600 per day two days a week. On the days off eat normally. The Fast Beach Diet then proceeds to scale the basic program for accelerated fat and weight loss.To super charge weight loss, the book gives tips on what foods to eat, what to buy at the grocery store, how to get in the right mindset and more. You can pick and choose from this section on what you feel will be doable for your lifestyle. Though many of the tips have been shared before, I like the fresh way Mimi presents them. For example, most of us know to select as many natural foods as possible. Mimi shares this by saying, to look for food products that have as little packaging as possible. The less wrappers, boxes, cellophane etc. the fresher it probably is. I hadn't thought of it that way. So she gives new ways of looking at old tips.This section also includes how to tweak the fasting. Here she gives an overview of alternate day fasting, 24 hour fasts etc. Many people find that with intermittent fasting they can eat what they want on non fast days and lose weight. However, others (like me) have found that combining it with calorie counting can result in even greater success. And counting calories along with fasting is one technique Mimi shares can help you accelerate your results. The key take away from this section is little things add up. Choose what works for you and make the adjustments for long term, big results. And if you are aiming for super fast results try to really tighten up everything you are doing i.e. cut alcohol etc. for at least the 6 week duration.The latest research on exercise is covered in the book. Mimi shares a summary of Dr. Mosley's book ""FastExercise: The Simple Secret of High-Intensity Training"" which indicates that high intensity training (HIT) for just a few minutes can be far more effective than hours of steady state cardio. Sample plans for running, swimming and other activities are included. Just to note there are some awesome free apps that will walk you thru short HIT programs. I personally use a countdown timer app and combine it with a free interval walking program I found on the net.The book includes a list of snacks for fast days, a shopping list and easy grab and go menus. It also includes recipes including Oat Berry Smoothie, Italian Seafood Salad and more. I felt some of the recipes were pretty simplistic i.e. there is one for scrambled eggs and another for boiled eggs. It is not a book I would buy for the recipes but what was included was nice.The back of the book includes a step by step 6 week plan on what to eat on fast days if you are having breakfast and dinner or dinner only. This can be adjusted if you are having lunch. You can opt to follow the program menu or use your own menus. And since this is the FastBeach diet, Mimi even included tips on the type of swimwear to buy to look your best!And of course my very favorite section is the inspirational stories at the back of the book where those who have done the FastDiet and lost share their success. I love this section, I just wish photos were included.If you are debating between buying this book or ""the FastDiet"" book, I would suggest this one if you want a step by step plan and tons of tips and the original book if you are looking for the science behind it. If you already own ""the FastDiet"" this is a nice supplement with ideas to accelerate your progress.On a side note - I purchased the Kindle version and the formatting is very good. The back of the book includes charts you can fill in. These are available for free download on the author's website. In addition, there are free apps available to help you with your goals. There is a free Fast Beach Diet app you can download (information on the FastBeach website) And if you want to combine it with calorie counting there a number of free online sites and apps. I personally use MyFitnessPal to track.Overall, this is a great way to kick start the intermittent fasting plan or accelerate your efforts. My biggest tip for others would be to join Facebook groups and visit the author's Fast Diet site for tips, support and inspiration. There is nothing like seeing someone's before and after photos!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q60P8J7YA1OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHIDNSW#wasThisHelpful","R2Q60P8J7YA1OV","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CeraVe products were recommended to me by a dermatologist years ago. The companies products are known for being effective using ingredients that do not cause skin problems.The CeraVe Baby Lotion has a silky feel that goes on smooth. Unlike other popular baby lotions, it does not have a strong ""baby"" scent. According to the website the product contains vitamins and 3 essential ceramides that helps ""protect a baby's delicate skin barrier"".  CeraVe Baby Lotion is paraben and phthalate free.One of the things I love about CeraVe is the products are non-comedogenic and non-irritating.I compared the CeraVe Baby Lotion to a bottle of the regular CeraVe Lotion I had at home.

"Mmmmm the smell of Hills Bros Coffee as you open the package is delicious. A scent you enjoy because the pods are packaged in mesh Kcup style instead of plastic kcups. My guess is this is to save money and not use the patent Keurig has on the plastic style Kcup. Regardless of the reason, the aroma is enjoyable and I found the pods work just as well as the plastic kind.The taste is good. It is a medium quality roast with a mild flavor. Not the tastiest cup I have had but certainly a good cup of coffee.At the price point, I would probably jump up to a different premium brand at a buck or so more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVJNAI8JMDQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZJMTAO#wasThisHelpful","R3OVJNAI8JMDQD","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether the Smart Weigh GEM20 is right for you depends on what you are weighing. Yes it can weigh small coins and jewelry BUT the bowl is limited in what it can hold. It makes more sense to get a scale with a flat, larger platform if you are weighing gems etc. The bowl on the GEM20 is to small for large coins and larger jewelry pieces.If you are weighing powder supplements or very small items such as diamonds than it may suit your needs.I love the appearance of the scale. It is palm sized with a plastic cover. Two tiny weights fit on it for easy storage (one in the bowl and one on top of the scale). A pair of fine pointed tweezers and 2AAA batteries are included.I compared the weight of this scale to another jewelry scale I own and they were right in sync with one another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZF9EBTCET7B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESHDGOI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZF9EBTCET7B8","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was given the cleanser, peel and moisturizer by this company to review and ooh la...I was delighted how soft and smooth my skin felt after the first treatment using the products.After washing my face with the cleanser and patting dry, I carefully applied the peel. I have tried other peels in the past and my skin felt nothing, but years ago I used a peel that wrecked havoc on my skin so I always use caution. I felt an initial tingling with this peel and I kept an eye on my skin for any changes. After the time was up (the company recommends 1-3 minutes depending on your skin) I rinsed it off.

"I recently was provided with several products to review by this company and over all I really like them especially the fruit acid peel. This product was no exception. It cleanses nicely and gently. However, I marked it down for two reasons. I found it a bit thick to come out of the bottle. And I feel at 4 ounces at the current price of $18.00 it is pricey. There are other cleansers that claim to balance the PH of your skin that are much pricier, but there are also quality products like Eucerin and Cetaphil that are gentle on the skin and could be used to prepare the skin for a peel that give you more ounces for your dollars.Overall, this is a nice indulgence and works well with the fruit acid peel and moisturizer made by the same company but you could also use another quality cleanser instead as your prep for the peel and moisturizer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XO0XYCQFCKIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IG8ZS1E#wasThisHelpful","R2XO0XYCQFCKIB","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's always nice to have an edge when you are playing golf and the GolfBuddy GB-WT3 can do that. The GolfBuddy GB-WT3 is loaded with data to help you get a feel for a course so you can track distances, estimate shots, know where the hazards are and much more.The watch comes pre-loaded with 36,000 courses and you can track your game with the digital scorecard noting your strong and weak points.So yes this golf watch offers a lot of features. However, it is not super intuitive to use with a myriad of choices. It's complicated and will take some getting used to. It is also very large, this is good in that it makes it easy to read but it can feel bulky on the wrist when swinging.

"I recently decided to try the Vitamin C Serum from Day By Day Beauty. It comes in a 1oz bottle which seems small but a little goes a long way. The bottle is tightly capped and a pump dispenser is included to switch too after opening. I liked this as it makes it more hygenic.The serum has a nice ""slip"" to it. It does not feel greasy at all. It absorbs quickly into the skin. After first use my skin felt softer.A few years ago I used a scrubbing tool on my neck. Though the tool was designed for the skin, it roughed up my skin and it has never been the same. I tried a variety of lotions and creams on it including alpha hydroxy acids but nothing worked. To my surprise this has smoothed the area down more than anything else. It is not gone but it is much better.I have not noticed a reduction in wrinkles, but I have only used it a short time, perhaps that will come in the future. I think this would be an excellent product to use after a skin procedure also when the skin can absorb it fully.It is also clear from the Q&A on this product that the owners care about what they are selling and servicing it. Really nice to see that.Overall, a super nice product at a good price point. I look forward to seeing more results as I use it longer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFJLH894YT42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GCQMSVA#wasThisHelpful","R2NFJLH894YT42","A1P4F6HIXU6WYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4F6HIXU6WYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've recently had to do multiple TV wall mounts, and this one would have been great had it not been missing one detail.  Usually these mounts come with four side arms that stick out from the plate, so that you can connect a television regardless of where the TV's mounting holes are located.  In fact, the mounting plate on this one has holes that appear ready to connect such arms, but there were none in the box (and the box didn't have room for any).If your TV can use the center plate as-is, the parts are sturdy and the installation instructions make sense.  It comes with mounting hardware for a standard wall (you want to use a stud) or concrete (you get sinkers to help the wall bolts stay in).  It's just a shame it won't connect to a VESA TV like my Toshiba Regza 40"" LCD (40XV648U).","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJARYAXK5L8J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ1AAUE#wasThisHelpful","RJARYAXK5L8J1","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this specific bottle because I had one of these and my daughter liked it so much she ran off with mine.  She uses hers every day, lugging it with her to school to stay hydrated.  For me, I bought this because it fits perfectly in the bottle cage on my bike, but I also found myself taking it with me every day to the gym.It seems silly focusing on a water bottle, but this one is different in ways that I like:- the tapered bottom makes it fit in any cup holder- the slim profile fits perfectly in the cage on my bike- the black ring above the lid is perfect for grabbing, carrying, or (in my daughter's case) clipping it to a backpack- the sip straw doesn't easily pop out from where it folds down, and it does keep a good seal- the straw also has a tab sticking out at the base to make it easy to flip open with a fingertip- the ""Super Durable Tritan Material"" (plastic) appears pretty strong:  it's been dropped on concrete, at speed one time, and hasn't cracked or leakedIf you need a durable bottle that keeps a good seal and is easy to use, I think this is probably one of the better ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSYT11TR2LYVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI4N99A#wasThisHelpful","RSYT11TR2LYVE","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The short summary:  I had the earlier iteration of Netgear's USB AC WiFi adapter and the frustrating sticking-point for me was that at the time they only made it in USB 2.0.  Both this model and the earlier one were good about connecting at high speeds and staying stable, but the USB 3.0 doesn't have the bottleneck of USB 2.0's slower bus.The full review:This is the high-speed USB wireless adapter we need:  it's USB 3.0, for starters.  The USB plug swivels to allow plugging into a laptop at an odd angle.  It comes with a USB cable and base to make it easier to put in a different position from the device you're plugging it into--a feature desktop users will probably appreciate because it means you don't have this thing sticking out from your PC.  As an added bonus, the top part of the adapter is a high gain antenna that you can swivel out to improve the signal if you need to.If you're in a place that uses WPS, the button to toggle a WPS connection is easy to see on the side.  Last, the unit has a light that flickers to show you connection status, just like an Ethernet cable would.The software that comes with the Netgear AC1200 is the Netgear Genie.  I didn't care for Netgear's Genie in the early days, but it's gotten a lot better:  not only is the installation very simple, but the Genie software lets you do all sorts of work with your network, from tracking who's connected and how to pulling down updates for your adapter or logging into your router to work with it (I think this last feature *might* require you to own a Netgear router).I used this device on both a Windows 8.1 Professional 64-bit laptop and a Windows 7 Professional desktop.  In both cases, I installed the software before connecting the device.  I have Netgear ac wireless equipment and I get good connection speeds from the adapter.If you want a high-gain WiFi adapter, this one is your best bet.  It offers a lot of small extras.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D97KM6G0MP6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJY1G#wasThisHelpful","R3D97KM6G0MP6E","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This GearIt 10-pack of Ethernet cables was more than I needed but a great deal as a bundle.  The cables are Cat6 and they work fine for me and appear to be built well.  My only complaint--and I've seen other brands do this too--is the boot that sits atop the plastic release tab on the connector:  its ridiculously tough to push down on.  When unplugging a cable already means that you're probably trying to slip your fingers into a tight spot, it becomes impossible to release the connector without damaging something.  I've resorted to slipping a flathead screwdriver in and using that instead.Apart from that, these cables work just fine and the price and the fact that I can choose colors were a nice bonus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4PQFR3GPIOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EE55PE#wasThisHelpful","RU4PQFR3GPIOU","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tripp-Lite ULTRABLOK is a chunk--it sticks out from the wall by quite a bit.  The hardware inside is designed to protect your equipment, and although I have electrical storms where I live, I haven't taken a hard enough hit to tell you how well it works.  What I can tell you is that you have a light to indicate stable power, one for if there's a problem, and one to indicate the unit is protecting your equipment.  Thus far, it seems to work just fine.A minor detail that will work if you have the right kind of outlets is that the ULTRABLOK has a metal ""L"" bracket to secure it to the wall.  This can be important because if you plan on plugging and unplugging things from this a lot, it's going to be tedious--you'll have to hold the entire thing with one hand to keep it from coming right out of the wall.  The bracket slides into rails on the top and a single screw can be used to secure it to the wall.

"I bought this Whole Room Air Circulator for my workplace--I sit near a window, I work out in the company gym, and there are going to be times I just need cool air to help me cope.  It works very well:  you can easily tilt the fan and it makes a clicking sound as you adjust it.  The switch is on the top back of the unit and has three speeds.  The shape of the switch makes it very easy to tell which position it is in when you reach for it.Most importantly though, this fan brings the airflow.  It's bigger than I'd expected, but I can't complain because the blades really push a decent amount of pressure, even at low speeds.  The higher speeds are a bit noisier than I'd like, but the lowest does the job without annoying my co-workers.I wouldn't call this a ""Whole Room"" fan as the name implies, but if you need a desk fan or other way to circulate air close to you, the Honeywell Whole Room Air Circulator delivers.

"This is far from the best mouse I've ever owned, but that's not the point of it.  The beauty of this mouse lies in its simplicity and its portability.  I bought this to tote with my Surface Pro 2 because my Orochi, lovely though it was, was too big of a wart in the tiny slipcase I carry the Surface Pro 2 in.  The Arc Touch Bluetooth mouse works just fine for general computing but you wouldn't find it comfortable for long periods of time, especially if you're gaming or doing fine-coordinated graphics work.The way the Arc Touch works is:  when it's flat, it's turned off.  Gently bend the body, and it clicks into the arc position you see in the picture and turns itself on--a very clever design.  Click it flat again, and it turns off until the next time you need it.  The top half where the buttons are is a bit thicker because that's where you have to install the two AAA batteries that power it.Because the Arc Touch is Bluetooth, there's no USB dongle to install--perfect for tablet users.  I had to add the device in the Control Panel like any other Bluetooth device, but once I did, it was ready to go and works fine for basic mousing.The ""Touch"" part of the name is more about the way the middle buttons work: instead of a scroll wheel, you just slide your finger up and down along the middle strip to scroll.  It makes a faint clicking sound which you can also feel under your fingertip.  I don't care for the clicking sensation of the scrolling but otherwise that feature works fine.If you need a compact, portable mouse for Windows, the Arc Touch does a very good job.  The design is clever and the functionality is very good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24NI5PXEHVL34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MN284T2#wasThisHelpful","R24NI5PXEHVL34","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Cosmos Black household patch board/AC adapter box because I'm doing up a new home office and I want to be neat about it.  I have a number of obnoxious little AC adapters with big heads on them--the kind you see for a charger or a USB hub or a cable TV box.I already have a large number of power strips of various sizes that I've accumulated over the years.  This box fit none of them.  It's too tiny.  It has a great idea in that there are slots on either end for cords to stick out, but the clunky adapters that are the reason you buy this won't really fit well.  I ended up having to stick some older multi-port AC cords in the box, carefully lay each power block in like Tetris-pieces, then force the lid to close.I have really nice hardwood floors.  This is hard plastic with no rubber feet.  I had to add some felt ones to keep from scratching things up.If this were bigger, or even came with a small power strip of some sort, and had even cheap feet on it, it would be a good idea.

"I recently read ""Rock Candy"", Scott Robinson's trivia book on The Beatles.  It was an enjoyable way to absorb information about one of the greatest bands in music history, and it's the kind of book you take in small pieces.  This book, ""The Quotable Beatles"", is similar in that it is made up of small snippets, but it's organized into more detailed categories--think of this as more of a reference, and a carefully researched one from the looks of it.  Where Rock Candy will wander into in-depth analysis of the music, ""The Quotable Beatles"" is more about the band and their experiences as they changed the world--and all of it straight from the horse's mouth.  It also includes some great quotes from other people too--not just those close to the band, but also people like Gene Simmons (Kiss), Mickey Dolenz (The Monkees), and even Ziggy Marley.The Beatles wrote some wonderful music, but they were also four very charming, witty, and smart people.  The Quotable Beatles reminds you how much their positive energy really contributed to the whole.

"Writing a trivia book is pretty easy to do; writing one that is also an enjoyable read is a different matter altogether.  While many trivia books take a ""Just the facts, ma'am"" approach to compiling information, Scott Robinson has assembled the information in a way that logically flows and delightfully entertains.  He does a great job moving between simple factoids and deep dives--there are entries that deconstruct the music, talk about the way albums were composed, and can get deeply technical about the artistry behind one of the greatest bands in the world.I really enjoyed the way Robinson tells the longer stories.  For example, my favorite is ""What happens in Manila, Stays in Manila"", his recounting of the disastrous and terrifying trip the Beatles took to The Philippines:  it's broken up into ""The Snub"", ""The Escape"", and ""The Result.""  We get a simple chart of the Beatles' number one hits...and then a walkthrough of each and its history.If you're a fan of The Beatles, ""Rock Candy"" is the book for you.  It is well written and painstakingly researched.  As the author advises, take it in small bites and enjoy each piece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UVAARB4KGNF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061559686X#wasThisHelpful","R1UVAARB4KGNF0","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Microsoft Docking Station for Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 completely wins in the sense that it is the easiest fit.  Designed specifically to slide into place around your Surface Pro or Pro 2, it is also very sturdy, propping your device at an angle that makes it easy to read, touch, and swipe.  It is also really the only custom option for a Surface Pro or Pro 2:  everything else is generic and the Pro 3 docking station isn't backwards compatible.However, the Docking Station also has a few oddities that keep it from being perfect.  Probably the worst is that the physical network port is only a 10/100...with as long as gigabit Ethernet has been around, that's quite an unusual downgrade.  The power plug isn't the same as the one that comes with a Surface Pro, it's a custom plug--you'd think they'd use the same system to connect the power as the Surface Pro so the adapter wouldn't be unique.  There is no need to 'install' anything, though the package does warn you to make sure your Windows is up to date before connecting the device...and for me, I had to reboot to get the audio to work properly.Once you get these minor annoyances out of the way, the Docking Station makes great sense for when you're not on the go.  It can charge the unit, you get a USB 3.0 port and three USB 2.0 ports, plus headphone and microphone jacks for plugging in a headset, and last, if you want to make your very own workstation, the DisplayPort will be the perfect way to hook up a monitor.So what about the Touch or Type keyboards?  It's hard to tell from the pictures, but YES, you can keep the keyboard connected and use it if you'd like:  there's just enough clearance at the bottom of the dock for your favorite keyboard to stay connected.I'm living in an apartment right now, so the Docking Station is a great way to save space but quickly switch to a working mode:  I dock on the coffee table in front of the couch, hook up to the TV, and with my Bluetooth mouse I'm ready to do anything.  When I move back into a house, this is probably going to make my home office setup lean & mean:  just dock & go.If you have a Surface Pro or Pro 2 and are considering a docking station for it, now might be the time to take the plunge:  I've seen the price go up on these and I found my local retailer was charging nearly double the retail price for the ones they had in stock.  The Surface Pro 3 dock is out and I couldn't even get the Microsoft Store to acknowledge this item still exists.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBYAB9HSX48O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GAUFLTO#wasThisHelpful","RBYAB9HSX48O","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like the 4-port Monster power strip better than this one for when I'm lugging equipment with me:  for example, needing to plug in a laptop and a powered USB hard drive or two.This Outlets to Go 3-outlet power strip with USB is a great solution for a slightly simpler need:  when I'm mobile and need to top off a USB-charge unit it's just fine.The Outlets To Go power strips are a bit heavy because they have a sturdy design to the outlets, the cable and the plug.  The plastic plate on the front of the plug has an unfortunate tendency to fall off or even break, but that doesn't affect the function--I have one of mine stuck back on with double-sided tape on the back.However, the other drawback is that the USB charging port is a slow trickle that's better suited for either topping off a device when it's a bit low or leaving a device overnight for a long charge.  For example, it works fine to put my Kindle on when I go to bed, but I wouldn't expect it to save my phone when it's nearly dead and I need it in an hour.I recently bought two of these for a perfect home use though:  I have two of those ""charging valets"", small boxes that let you thread a lot of charging cables out of sight and poke the connectors out through the lid.  One is for my room and one I bought for my daughter.  A standard-size power strip would be awkward and huge--if not impossible--to tuck into so small of a box, so I use the smaller Outlets To Go to plug in all the chargers, and the USB goes for my Kindle, which doesn't mind a slow overnight charge.If you lower your expectations a bit, the quality of the Outlets to Go is pretty consistent with its price.  The USB charger could use a bit more power, but the outlets and the way the cord folds up are both very convenient.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E2S33Y1AACLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018MEBNG#wasThisHelpful","R3E2S33Y1AACLD","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought this to replace the Energizer charger, which worked great for a while but developed a weird quirk where it refused to charge some controllers.  The Energizer charger that I had also couldn't do a Move controller, and leaving one more device out (the special charger for the Move controller) when the Move is almost barely used was a bit of a nuisance.So far, this one has worked very well for an incredibly low price.  I don't like to leave the PS3 turned on for hours just to charge a single controller, so this makes things easier for me.  I will say there are two things that might have been better off if they'd done it a bit differently:1) the neon-blue glow doesn't just light up when something is connected, it's glowing all the time.  I found this distracting so close to my TV, so I put the charger in an entertainment center's cabinet.2) the USB ports are a nice plus, but being on the back of the unit is a little inconvenient for plugging in a device to charge.  On the sides or front would have been a bit more helpful.These are minor quibbles though:  overall this charger is a helpful addition to your PS3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SYKR40XM14AP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041RY3W4#wasThisHelpful","R3SYKR40XM14AP","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The short summary:  the M570 works well for a good price, but might be inconvenient for people with large hands or long fingers.  If you're considering the M570 for portability, its small size makes a great choice to drop into a laptop bag:  no need for counter-space in your favorite café because the trackball doesn't need to move around on a tabletop to work.  I have no complaints with the hardware, but the software was a bit of a problem.the full review:I used to love using trackballs, but they were all much bigger than the M570.  They were also heavier:  the M570 is very lightweight and almost feels hollow.  It closely resembles the Microsoft Trackball that leaves all the mouse movements to your thumb, and I found I preferred that to the kind of trackball that uses your fingertips.  The M570 has an excellent design in that the single AA battery easily fits in the underside and the shape of the trackball is very comfortable for small to medium sized hands.  I find it a bit too small for my medium-to-largish hands (I'm 5'11"" tall, with a ring size of 10) but for general computing it gets the job done.  If you're considering the M570 for portability, its small size makes a great choice to drop into a laptop bag:  no need for counter-space in your favorite café because the trackball doesn't need to move around on a tabletop in order to work.The trackball is a responsive piece of equipment, and from a gaming perspective I always loved that slight edge I could get from being able to spin so quickly.  However, I'm not sure a pro who's used to their own customized gaming mouse would want to give that up for the M570:  we're still working at wireless speeds.Which brings me to the wireless.  This isn't Bluetooth, which is a shame, but it is the Logitech Unifying Device system, and that can be a pretty nice system indeed.  I've had some really weird problems with Bluetooth mice and keyboards in Windows 7 (that I blame the OS for) but Plug & Play for the Unifying Device was a breeze.  The signal is emitted from a tiny USB connector that barely pokes out of the port you plug it into.  Windows 7 had the drivers for it automatically installed in under a minute and the trackball was immediately ready to go.Unfortunately, I couldn't get any of the Logitech software to work.  The website for the M570 confusingly asks if you want the latest Unifying Device or SetPoint software, but I couldn't get either to properly function--instead, I just left it in Plug & Play's hands.  If you want to use SetPoint you might want to keep this in mind.  My problem was that the software would install, but could never actually pair with the trackball, so after several tries I just gave up and the track ball works fine.If you remember how enjoyable a trackball was, or you want to try the idea, the M570 makes a great choice.  I enjoy using it, and though I was a bit disappointed in flaky software I'm perfectly happy with the Plug & Play solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7N2WF0D7NX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043T7FXE#wasThisHelpful","RZ7N2WF0D7NX0","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The short version: I've used and worked on a lot of wireless products over the years. I bought this to go with my Netgear R6300 and it's almost been too good. The external antennas that improve signal quality, coupled with the fact that the device has 5 Gigabit Ethernet Ports *and* a USB connection (for a READYSHARE storage device or a printer) make it a perfect fit for a tech-heavy home where you want a strong high-speed signal for a lot of devices.The full review:Right now I live in an apartment complex that has problems at the edges of my unit, most likely because I'm surrounded by so many other wireless networks. When I move back in to a house, this is going to make a perfect addition for another reason: the place your Internet Provider can bring your connection into the house isn't always the place you put your entertainment center. I plan on running physical cables into this extender for my HTPC, television, consoles and Yamaha Receiver, so again this will do quite nicely.The AC1200 (EX6200) looks very similar in shape and size to my R6300 router, though it is deliberately colored with red trim pieces to make it visually different. It can be wall-mounted or the included stand can be used to set it upright on a table--for now, mine is on top of a cabinet. Setup is extremely simple if you have WPS:- Turn on the extender- Push the WPS button on the extender- Push the WPS button on the router- wait- Power down and back on if the connectivity light is flickering or you have 5GHz on the router and the extender's 5GHz light isn't litOne note about this last step: I'm not sure the 5GHz light will be lit if no devices are trying to access a 5GHz connection. I say this because the 5GHz light isn't always on, but if I log into the Extender it indicates the 5GHz band is connected and running. Unless you're having throughput issues, this slight difference in how the light behaves might not mean anything to you. It's easy to test your speeds using various wireless speed testing apps, and you can explicitly connect to the Extender only for this test because it will appear by name as ""[your network name]_2GEXT"" for 2.4 GHz and ""[your network name]_5GEXT"" for 5GHz.If you don't have WPS, all is not lost; you can log directly into the unit and manually point it to your network and it will act as an extension of that network. The physical documentation included in the package is minimal, but the online docs and the interface are all fairly easy to use for those familiar with technology. I logged into the unit and found that the interface was very similar to the one for my router, but was tailored specifically to this device's role as an Extender: in other words, this wasn't just a router that had been colored differently and tweaked, it really is dedicated hardware and software.  As an added bonus, the back has a slide-out card with all the information you might need at a glance:  model, serial number, MAC Addresses and PIN.NOTE: There are some customers here that have problems with specific MAC address filtering, and from what I've seen Netgear's response is that this is the nature of Extender technology. If you have MAC filtering enabled, I suggest you stop by Netgear's site and read the manual before purchasing an extender.This product is compatible with the Netgear speed measuring tool offered through the Google Play store and it easily fits in with the Netgear Genie.I've been very happy with the quality of Netgear products, and the AC 1200 (EX6200) is no exception - it's as feature-rich as the R6200/6300 routers but also as easy to use as their other products have been for me.

"I love the way this book lays out the entirety of Team Foundation Server 2012, but it should be noted that the focus is more towards those first steps of getting it going.  There are lots of very useful sections about what TFS is, how you should configure the environment based on the size of your organization, and how to configure TFS for your organization.  But then we get into some really good deep-dive material that's aimed at helping you make decisions:  the authors describe the options and what they mean, and then they also provide suggestions as to when to choose which one.  I'm thinking in particular of the sections on Version Control and Project Management.One thing I like in particular is they address some very real-world scenarios, such as using TFS with Eclipse, or migrating from Visual Source Safe or Eclipse.  Third-party tools and some of the options you have in integrating with them are very worthwhile reading if your shop uses them.Team Foundation Server can be a massive undertaking.  If you're new to it, you should take it one step at a time.  Professional Team Foundation Server 2012 does a good job of walking you through those steps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MR4OWZD0L27C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118314093#wasThisHelpful","R3MR4OWZD0L27C","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second foray into this series of books (and I'm about to delve into the 2013 edition), and I can't recommend them enough.  Whether you're using Visual Studio on its own or with Team Foundation Server (which I highly recommend), this is the book that speaks to the nuts & bolts of the business.  It gives you a lot of information about how the SDLC components in Visual Studio work and it is written in a way that lets you make specific decisions about how you want to implement Visual Studio / TFS in your business.  It also serves as a good reference to learn the individual components of Visual Studio if all you want to do is model diagrams, or mockups, or just Bugs & User Stories.My organization used this book extensively for our Project Managers and Business Analysts.  We had testers but the materials on Testing are probably enough to make an entire book unto itself, so you won't get a lot of specifics on that here.  However, the way Work Items are used, the Architecture Explorer, and the way you can model your application's work and/or do mockups is covered very well.  Visual Studio 2012 changed the way things work quite a bit, but the changes have ultimately been for the better.  I'm very pleased with how much this book extends the also-excellent 2010 version.  The language is good for a non-technical person to understand and the level of detail is just about right for beginner to intermediate level use of Visual Studio / TFS.If you want to talk about the technical side of implementing Team Foundation Server, such as how to install, configure, or transition your team, I also recommend the book ""Professional Team Foundation Server"" - think of that book as your 'Initiation Phase' guide and this book as your 'Planning & Implementing Phase' book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMPCGQCS0T4Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118314085#wasThisHelpful","RMPCGQCS0T4Z1","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these goggles:  I can't think of a single thing that doesn't work as I'd hoped it to or better.  For example, I'd expected the band to be no big deal and instead I get an easy-to-use plastic clasp and the adjustment system lets you pull the straps from either side.  It easily clicks more or fewer notches for tightness.  I've just used them a couple of times now, but the lenses themselves are really clear and on a bright day that mirror tinting helps.  They fit comfortably around my eye sockets and don't have to create too much pressure to keep the water out.  The gaskets around the eyepieces are probably what solves this problem because they're thick and curved in a way that will probably fit most faces.There have been a couple of times that the lenses have fogged up briefly:  both were after swimming in a cold pool and then standing in very hot summer air for a bit--taking them off for half a minute solved the problem.I also like the fact that we have a hard case to protect the googles from scratches:  it locks closed with a twist of the plastic knob on the end.My wife and I both have a pair and will be ordering a third for our daughter:  for the price, you really get a lot of great details and a good clear view.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J67AMPELIHVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7G4JIG#wasThisHelpful","R1J67AMPELIHVW","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's really easy to make Nazis the bad guys in a game--but after all the Call of Dutys and Medal of Honors, what's hard is making a game that centers around Nazis and can still make the bad guys seem original and new.  I'm someone who's played every incarnation of the ""Castle Wolfenstein"" games, even a very strange kiosk that you could pay-to-play the older 486 PC version using a joystick and a VR headset.  Having recently re-played the ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein"", it was a real experience to pick up this newest entry in the series.""Wolfenstein: the New Order"" is a great update to this classic series.  First-Person Shooters have changed a lot in the many years this series has been around, and the updates here really give a classic concept the feel of the latest & greatest that FPS games have to offer.  There is a good storyline, complete with top-drawer voice talent and the return of our hero B. J. Blascowicz.  We have weapon choices that include dual-wield, fast action with many a melee opportunity, and the same feel of collecting medkits and armor and occasionally overcharging your health for an upcoming rampage that made all of The New Order's predecessors so much fun.  Probably the best nod to the more recent games is the fact that there's more than one way to complete a level:  this isn't just a matter of being able to navigate the map through different paths, it's also that you can make choices that let you vary between stealth and run-and-gun.  FPS games don't often have the ability to view the map these days, so that makes for a nice bonus that is carried over from the earliest days of the Wolfenstein series.What makes the story fresh is that we are playing to an alternate history:  after an opening mission in 1946, our hero is out of commission until 1960, and it's a world where the Nazis won the war, all has been lost, and now B.J. is left to try to pick up the pieces entirely on his own.  Each level is a movie-quality step towards saving the world, and each level has a purpose that advances the main story.  The alternate 1960 is a mix of technologies that has a fairly believable look and feel, and some of the 'newer' technology mirrors the strangeness we saw in the depths of 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein' and the occult-driven more recent entry that was just called 'Wolfenstein'.As much fun as the game is, there are a few drawbacks.  I've had times where climbing a ladder is still the bane of Our Hero's existence and I spend time bobbling around looking for the grip point.  Switching weapons isn't a fast way to keep the firepower flowing when the bullets are low--sometimes it's just a trip to a quick death.  Changing ammo with the radial wheel can be clumsy.  I have a real problem with grenades:  sometimes I bump the shoulder button to throw (hold down means you want to select weapons) and nothing happens.  I won't spoil the story for you, but there is one particular mission that sounds like a great squad-based opportunity but by the time you reach the end you find yourself wondering what the point was.Still, ""Wolfenstein:  the New Order"" is a great title, and I think with time I'll come to love it as much as its predecessors, some of which I still play today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EX911OE0TYDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHF39L2#wasThisHelpful","R2EX911OE0TYDG","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Gillette Mach 3 for years, and even though I've tried others from time to time, I keep coming back to their three-blade system.  These cartridges have been a great replacement, but I think there's something important you should consider when buying them.  There are negative reviews here where customers say they got fake or knock-off replacements.  I added this to cart by picking a Prime eligible product that says ""Shipped from and sold by Amazon"", and the package that arrived is the real deal.If you're new to the Mach 3, it's a great razor for a lot of things.  I have a friend who swears by it for shaving his head, but says you have to be slow and careful.  For me, it does a great job on my face and neck.  The three hyper-sharp blades in the Mach 3's head really do a nice job of paring down the daily stubble without cutting me up or roughing up my face.  That said, there are some basics to shaving that also make a difference, regardless of what you use:- drag slowly- drag in the direction the hair grows (and learn the parts of your face where it changes direction)- don't press down- do repeat strokes for problem areas- expect to feel some stubble no matter what--the goal is to minimize it, but it'll never go away unless you pluck the hairs out (ouch!)- when you towel off, pat your skin, don't scrub- if you're going to put something on your skin afterwards, avoid anything with alcohol in it: alcohol burns your skin while lotions moisturizeI use these in a standard Mach 3 handle and in one that vibrates using a AAA battery.  The latter is a bit easier to use, but not necessary:  either will work for you just fine.  There is a more expensive version of these blades for sensitive skin that is supposed to have better lubricating strips, but I don't find that to be worth the extra money...if anything the strips on the 'Sensitive' just wear out quicker than these do.If you're new to the Mach 3, it's a great razor.

I have the normal Mach 3 handle and the one that vibrates using a AAA battery--which I have to admit does seem to work a little bit easier.The idea behind this ""Sensitive"" version of the Mach 3 blades is that there's an more soothing kind of whatever goo Gillette feels will soothe the burn of dragging three hyper-sharp blades of steel across your face.I love the Gillette Mach 3 razor, don't get me wrong...but I see little additional benefit in the Sensitive versus the regular, and I don't care for how quickly it wears out.

"The Final Rip-Off was a labor of love on the part of the Pythons:  released in the late '80s, this collection was not only a fun sampling of some of their best comedy skits, it was also very lovingly remastered.  Some of the original versions of these skits didn't have the musical flourish that they have here.  There are pieces lifted from the movie ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" and others that come straight from the record albums, such as from ""Monty Python's Instant Record Collection"".  While some fans don't care for particular recordings of this or that skit (in particular, some of the live versions are a point of contention), I really enjoy it all.There is an important thing to know about the CD though, and it's what kept me from replacing my factory cassette version of The Final Rip-Off for years.  The first printings had some problems:  a friend of mine bought the discs and they rotted after a few months.  She managed to convince the store to swap out for her, and the replacements rotted too...I'm pleased to say that the CDs I purchased only this year (2014) have been of excellent quality and worked well.If you enjoyed Monty Python's comedy, The Final Rip-Off is a very nice collection of some of their funniest bits.  Some jokes are better seen than heard, but still the recordings hold up well.  Extra effort was put into this release, though that was some time ago, and today it's still loads of fun to listen to.  A completist might want to go back and find all the individual albums, and gain more material, but for me this is a nice distillation of some of Monty Python's best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTX1P21GSVFOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000WG8#wasThisHelpful","RTX1P21GSVFOW","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tuner was fairly easy to install, though it did require a little bit of help from Kenwood to get my DDX-500 to recognize the unit.  Kenwood's phone support was friendly and helpful, and after a couple of adjustments to the settings, we were off and running.  Installation is simple, and because it has a pass-through to your car's antenna, it doesn't matter where this tuner box goes--you can stick it under the dash or behind some stuff and your car's antenna is what picks up the HD Radio signal.If you've got a Kenwood head unit that is compatible with this tuner box, and it says ""HD Ready"" or ""HD Capable"", then hooking this up will not change your AM/FM radio availability--instead it will expand it so that any signals broadcast in HD Radio will automatically come through clear as a bell.  I didn't get the HD quality sound until I moved to a different area, but I did notice that when HD Radio comes through, it works well.  Some stations will even include metadata that pops up on your screen, like artist, album and title (and some head units can even show a thumbnail image of the station or album art).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286YVP1OFZKKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q9ERCG#wasThisHelpful","R286YVP1OFZKKI","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Futurama is an animated comedy from Matt Groening, the creator of 'The Simpsons'.  The Simpsons often cracked us up with social satire, but Futurama turned the Simpsons' reality-based sandbox into a completely free and open playground of the future for the writers' minds to run free.Set in the year 3000, the main character Fry is a dimwit with heart.  He is from our time, and when an accident gets him cryogenically frozen for 1,000 years, we get to see Groening's bizarre future through his eyes.  He voices our 20th-century opinions, and he sets up some of the best jokes in the series.  Fry meets a lot of unusual people, and the core stable of characters that are introduced to us will have you and your friends regularly debating the merits of your favorites.When Futurama first aired on Fox, it got a weird mix of 'show it to everybody' airings of each week's episode across multiple time slots...and also got Fox's 'try to kill it' treatment of randomly moving the new episodes.  Somehow, it managed to survive, and if you watch this first season, you can see why Futurama wasn't just ""Simpsons in Space"", but was instead a huge green field for these clever writers to play upon.  Drawing on the entire history of science fiction, Futurama satirizes our modern-day society with ease.  We have an opening episode featuring suicide booths, an alcoholic robot with a criminal mind, an everyday New New York City (yes, I typed that correctly) whose definition of 'normal' boggles the 20th-century mind, and hilarious series of laugh after laugh.I own this particular box set, and I really enjoy the fact that I get director's commentary--but if you're contemplating buying the entire series, you might want to look into the collected versions:  they don't appear to leave anything out and they might have even a bit more to offer than this collection.  Either way, Futurama is one of my favorite shows of all time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJ0ES7AY12EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008412UKA#wasThisHelpful","R3KJ0ES7AY12EQ","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just about every song on this album was a hit when the movie came out.  Years later, I got an itch to finally replace my cassette so I could hear all these great songs again, and the only way to do it was to buy a real CD--no MP3 album?  How quaint!  How far we've come from the days when a CD was the most amazing way to hear music.Which brings us to the music.  We have Patti LaBelle's ""New Attitude"" kicking off the music nicely.  She comes back later with the energetic '""Stir It Up"", and in between, the Pointer Sisters' ""Neutron Dance"" was the song that seemed to run all summer long back when this album came out.  ""Gratitude"" by Danny Elfman was my first exposure to that delightfully quirky voice (and who knew back then what a great composer he would become?)--it led me to Oingo Boingo's excellent album ""Dead Man's Party.""  Glenn Frey is also solo from The Eagles, doing ""The Heat Is On"", complete with classic '80s keyboards and sax, and that song also got tons of play back in the day.  Probably very few people remember Shalamar, but their song here, ""Don't Get Stopped in Beverly Hills"", couldn't compare to their hit ""Dancing in the Sheets"".  ""Rock n' Roll Me Again"" has classic '80s guitar notes, but like ""Emergency"" by Rockie Robbins, just fails to stand out.So here's some trivia for you:  this isn't the first release of the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack!  I bought my cassette the week it was released and that release was recalled.  There was a Rick James track named ""BHC (I Can't Stop)"" that was pulled and replaced with ""Emergency"".  Sad, but I'm also sorry to say that even if you're a Rick James fan you probably wouldn't be blown away by his original song either.If you loved Beverly Hills Cop or just want to grab one of the most memorable '80s pop movie soundtracks, this soundtrack makes a great pick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WI3M2FZBKCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002O1V#wasThisHelpful","R20WI3M2FZBKCD","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lazy Winner is a great all-purpose book for a working professional to balance their life.  As a parent who also has to work the hard, random hours of IT, I found it to be part philosophical guide, part psychological self-help.  Continuing on the success of his excellent book ""The Lazy Project Manager"", Peter Taylor describes to you how to organize your thoughts and your day to put you on the path to success.  I found The Lazy Project Manager at a time in my career when I had to take on a lot more challenges than I ever had before--it helped me figure out how to be a hero without a Superman complex.  The Lazy Winner reminded me that at some point my life could probably use a little of that Project Management methodology in my home life too.  IT can all too easily lure you with the Siren Song of 80-hour weeks bringing success...use The Lazy Winner to remind you that if you plan your life a little better, you won't let yourself be run into the ground.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XXRO01G50GV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LNEDXG#wasThisHelpful","R2XXRO01G50GV0","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pair of 6-foot HDMI cables is the latest spec and appears to be well built.  The cables are thick with a sturdy outer layer and the sleeves at each end don't look cheap:  they are molded on well enough to hold together.  The right-angle adapter makes this an even better deal though:  when your TV is close to the wall or you're plugging up in a tight space, this is what will save your cable because the neck of your cable won't need to be bent and/or crushed against anything.  Two adapters might have been nice, but chances are most people wouldn't need more than one--so given the price, I can't complain a bit.  As an added bonus, my box even contained a tiny keychain flashlight, perfect for trying to peek behind my Dad's TV when I was trying to set up his cabling.The cable ties are simple Velcro strips, but the useful part is that they're labeled with Twisted Veins' name:  if you use these to tie and bundle a set of cables, you'll be able to tell at a glance which bundle you're reaching for.  If you've ever had to go back behind your A/V equipment and redo things, you'll appreciate this little extra touch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LN73L2ZQ8RTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEWF4R2#wasThisHelpful","R1LN73L2ZQ8RTT","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used several of Samsung's SSD products in the 830 and 840 series, but in the past, price had kept me from going for the EVO.  This time around, I had the luck (and money) to do so, and I don't regret it.  If you really get deep down in the technical jargon and start looking at things like MLC/TLC, IOPS and Random/Sequential reads, for most people the numbers aren't substantially different...but the EVO line's prices have started to come down, and that makes things very different indeed.I bought the 1TB version and it's dedicated to gaming:  my OS is on a smaller Samsung 840 EVO mSATA drive, and although there are slight differences in the mSATA spec, performance for my system is really even across the board.  If you have the money and you don't have SSD yet, this is about as good as it gets.  You'll be amazed at the huge increase in speed coming from an older hard drive.  If you're already using SSDs, the 840 EVO series is a great bet for performance-heavy work like gaming, animation, video production, etc.The only drawback you should be aware of is the Samsung tools that come with the drive.  They can be hit or miss.  When they work, it's a beautiful thing, and you can migrate your entire computer from the old drive to the new, then slip the new drive in and you're ready to go.  When they don't work....they just *won't* work.  I had one Samsung Magician migration that told me because it couldn't defragment the empty SSD drive, it wouldn't copy my machine's hard drive to it (can't we just defrag it AFTER loading files on?  SSDs don't really ""defrag"" the same way anyway--fragmentation shouldn't be an issue).  Samsung's support was decent, but they told me to give up and use Macrium Reflect.  Macrium Reflect works great, but this was annoying.  On another occasion though, the migration worked perfectly.  The same is true of the optimization tools:  sometimes they won't detect my drive, and I'd have to manually tweak performance; and other times (like with this volume), all was well and I could very easily choose whether I wanted speed, storage, or long life.If you're in the market for an SSD, I highly recommend Samsung's 840 series.  If you have the extra bit of cash to go for the EVO line, if you're looking for performance you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NYYGUF74IZ04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3W16OU#wasThisHelpful","R1NYYGUF74IZ04","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sandman story is a very long saga that helped break the mold of comic book writing.  Among a handful of other titles at the time it ushered in the term 'graphic novel', surprised people by being labeled 'not for sale to minors', and garnered author Neil Gaiman the distinction of being the first comic book author to be recognized (and rewarded) by the Science Fiction Writers of America (thank you, Harlan Ellison).  The story is at times fantasy, horror, or everyday people whose lives become surreal, and it rubs shoulders with a wide variety of already-established characters--both superhero and non--in the DC Comics universe.  Our protagonist is literally the personification of Dream:  Morpheus, the Lord of the Dream Realm, and his godlike nature makes it easy to move our story to limitless times and places.This Omnibus edition is a massive slab of a book.  It is huge and heavy.  The binding appears to be sewn to keep it together (it is over 1,000 pages), and the print quality, from paper to coloring, is excellent.  This 'Omnibus Vol.1' represents approximately half of the story arc of The Sandman and I'm delighted to have it in my collection now.  If you're pondering this book, chances are you're already familiar with and a fan of the story, and in my case I am proud to say I purchased this in order to be able to share the world of The Sandman with my daughter.  Compared to the price of tracking down all the individual trade paperbacks, the high price is actually a very good deal, particularly given the quality of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5I3OYGEUYFGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401241883#wasThisHelpful","R5I3OYGEUYFGX","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine (the film that came before this one) had some disappointing moments, particularly to the hardcore fans.  I really enjoyed ""The Wolverine"" though, and if there's one real flaw to this movie, it's just that there wasn't a particular need to make it.  This is a great one-off story about The Wolverine.  It takes place after the events of the third X-Men movie (""X-Men III:  The Last Stand"") and in some ways this story attempts to address some of the issues with that movie, filling in bits that legitimize some of the unpleasant tragedies that for some fans really marred that film.The Wolverine has some really great moments.  It starts with an interesting backstory set during World War II and as it brings the story forward to modern day, Logan has a chance to explore his own needs.  He questions what it means to go on living, and he examines the things that have happened in the past.  I'm reluctant to spoil this story too much for you, so I'll focus on some of the basics:- it has some fantastic martial arts sequences- it has one of the best 'top of a train' fight scenes I've ever seen--a sequence that reminds me of the excitement of the highway battle in the second Matrix movie because it gives a couple of nods to that scene.- our hero has the proverbial rug pulled out from under him:  he isn't as strong as he usually is, there is a lot more real danger for him, and because the movie takes place almost entirely in Japan, he's in unfamiliar territory- Hugh Jackman pulled out all the stops in trying to give Logan emotional depth while still keeping his character the warrior that he is--we get some great acting in this film, particularly at the very beginning and very end.This review is for the 3D Blu-Ray though, so I have to take a moment to say that this is a pretty full package.  I like the fact that we get both the original and Extended editions.  The 3D aspect is a lot more mature:  the movie doesn't use 3D to see how many things it can throw at your eyes.  Instead it tries to paint a three-dimensional world.  I watched this on my Vizio 47"" 3D HDTV in 1080p and loved the feel of it:  the 3D look made my TV more like a window with the action inside of it.If you haven't seen this movie yet because one of the previous films disappointed you, I think you'll be pleased with the improvement here.  If I had to compare ""The Wolverine"" to ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", I'd say I'm much happier to have this movie than that one, and glad I paid a bit extra for the Extended Edition.  It doesn't have any critical story tie-ins to the new movie ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", so consider this an entertaining side story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13XP46Y41B0R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4W40C4#wasThisHelpful","R13XP46Y41B0R5","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Vita version of the Final Fantasy X/X2 HD remaster is a small-screen version of the PS3 release.  However, there is one thing you should be aware of about this edition:  the PS3's Blu-Ray holds both games, but the Vita's game card can't--you'll need to download X2 on your own and this package contains the download code for you.That said, since this is an HD remaster of a PS2 classic, the new look is great on the Vita.  The gameplay isn't going to do anything different in the remaster, it's just an upgraded port.  But the game still plays well today, and looking at both versions I don't see a visual difference between either the PS3 or the Vita system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2VESO9ZF8RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HD4R5RW#wasThisHelpful","RN2VESO9ZF8RY","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Windows 7 was one of those rare occasions where I pre-ordered the OS, and since its release in 2009 I haven't been disappointed.  I bought this one specifically for a friend of mine who's building a machine from scratch and lives in a country where it's hard to get the English version of the OS--but I've used the 64-bit OEM myself many a time.If you've been spending the last 8 years in Windows Vista, you're way overdue for a Windows 7 system.  You'll find a much friendlier interface, fewer UI nags about security and permissions, a more stable OS, and a lot more driver compatibility.  Although this is a 'System Builder' DVD, it will let you install over the top of an existing Vista install and will even attempt to keep your old files.  Technically you're expected to use an upgrade for that job though (and it's cheaper).If you're weighing Windows 7 against Windows 8 (and this week we're getting our first sneak peeks at Windows 9!), then the biggest reason to pick up an OEM Windows 7 right now is compatibility.  Windows 8 doesn't have higher system requirements than 7, but it does have a harder time catering to older apps than Windows 7 does, and there have been issues with some older programs (and some people REALLY don't like the Windows 8 interface).Probably the biggest difference in compatibility is that Windows 7 offers a feature called Windows XP Mode, which isn't the same as ""XP Compatibility Mode""--we still have that too--but Windows XP Mode is in fact a real Windows XP Virtual Machine that you can download, install, and add yourself under the covers in Windows 7.  The Virtual Machine will run to let you specifically launch picky XP-only programs in the background and maintain much closer compatibility.I have a great desktop computer that I upgraded from Windows 7 to 8.  Unfortunately, there were just too many minor issues in Windows 8 that my machine couldn't cope with, and back to my OEM 7 disc I went.  Windows 7 is still a great OS today, so if like me you have a downgrade situation, this might be just the thing for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16R5SQKTDT1YB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H09BOXQ#wasThisHelpful","R16R5SQKTDT1YB","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The authors of the Brady guide went to great lengths to try to document the gameplay of Final Fantasy X/X2, and while the new HD remaster isn't extremely different from the original, it does look like they reviewed the material and updated the guide to read like it's for the remaster.Final Fantasy is a game series that usually requires you to do some digging online or have a book like this because the games can be very rich and complicated:  Final Fantasy X is very much like this, with parts of the game being ""If you don't get it the first time, you won't have another chance without starting over!""  It's times like these that having a strategy guide is incredibly handy.The only real drawback here is in the details.  The section on Final Fantasy X is somewhat short.  There were times I wanted to get some advice on the best way to equip my party, and the advice was inline with the walkthrough.  I'd like to see this sort of thing laid out in a separate table.  There were a few occasions that I would have appreciated a bit more information.  For example, there's a quicktime-styled event that they're good enough to warn you will only take place one time and you want to save before trying it so you can reload until you get it (if you're a completist), but then I didn't really have good advice on how to succeed--I had to rely on a lot of trial and error.I think as strategy guides go, this is still the most useful (printed) guide that you'll find.  I think the Piggyback guides to Final Fantasy XIII spoiled me though--I'd like a little bit of those extras here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CVC6XK1DTSYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074401543X#wasThisHelpful","R3CVC6XK1DTSYW","A1MRPX3RM48T2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MRPX3RM48T2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a variety of Samsung (and other) SSDs, and while I don't always reach for the EVO line, in this case, the EVO was just about my only option.

"I use this two-bay drive carrier mostly for shuffling files around between external disks stored at different locations.  I find it very handy to be able to use a single carrier and only one USB 3 port when making file copies.  I like that each drive gets its own link and activity LED so you know that the drive is connected to the computer and when it is active.Because the drive carrier is a single USB device, you cannot eject individual drives from Windows.  Instead, it will only let you “eject” the Mediasonic device which means both installed drives will disappear at the same time.  This isn’t a problem for me but it is something to be aware of.The clone feature works well for making an exact copy of a drive.  Everything from the partition table and master boot record (MBR) with drive signature is cloned.  Using two OCZ SSD drives, I got 300MB/s when cloning: impressive!  During cloning the four LEDs for link and activity change function and become a progress indicator (25/50/75/100%).  Pretty handy way to know how far along a clone is.Best of all on the cloning, you don’t need the carrier connected to a USB port to clone drives; it is completely self contained.  So if you decide to upgrade the main drive on your laptop, you simply physically remove it from the laptop, clone it in the carrier, then put the new drive back into your laptop and you’re done.  That’s a lot easier than using some drive cloning software.I mention that even the MBR and drive signature are cloned.  This can cause you problems with Windows if you later try to mount two cloned drives at the same time.  Because they have the same drive signature, Windows will consider this an error and will silently decide not to show you one of the drives.  Fortunately, you can go into the disk manager and bring it online manually by right-clicking on the drive and choosing “online”.So far I’m very happy with the Mediasonic drive docking station.  I use it a lot and it has worked great so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U45J4WX4B4E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0115NB41E#wasThisHelpful","R1U45J4WX4B4E8","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is hands down the best body trimmer I've used.  Other trimmers I've used suffer from one or more of these problems such as terrible battery life, difficulty in cutting, or just plain nicking and cutting my skin!  This Panasonic doesn't have those problems.  With the body hair attachment installed, this trimmer glides over even the most sensitive skin and does not cut you.  Most of your hair is trimmed down in just one pass.The battery life is quite good and I love that it has an LED indicator to tell you how much power is left.  I also love that you can use this while plugged in just in case you do have a dead battery.  Small complaint, but I wish this had a lithium-ion battery for those times when it sits unused for a few weeks.  The batteries in this will slowly deplete, even when sitting unused.The trimmer can work in water and that makes it very easy to rinse and clean.  It also includes lubricating drops to keep the blade system in tip-top shape.  Overall this product seems built to last a lifetime.  Everything is very finely machined and sturdy.  I expect it to last a very long time.Wish list:I wish that when trimming body hair, the length was adjustable.  Instead it seems to shoot for skin close.  I don't want that everywhere on my body.  What I do to fix this is I don't snap the hair guide all the way onto the trimmer head.  That leaves a little length and doesn't cut skin tight.  As long as I don't push too hard, it keeps that length and works great.  It does come with an adjustable trimmer attachment for long hair, but that hair guide has huge openings and you could easily get your skin stuck in there (and cut yourself) if you trimmed any sensitive body parts.  I don't recommend using the longer hair guide except for trimming your head!Note:If you are trimming body hair, you need to follow the instructions and only trim hair that is already about 1/2 or shorter.  If you go longer than that, it will get jammed up and result in some painful hair yanking.  So long as you maintain regularly, you won't have a problem.  I made this mistake once and it was painful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SKTW5Z1IJFS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO54PAI#wasThisHelpful","R3SKTW5Z1IJFS3","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 5-drawer chest was not my first foray into self-assembled furniture but it is definitely the nicest looking of those that I’ve owned.  The final product looks right off a showroom floor.This box is almost 100 pounds and is pretty difficult to move by yourself.  I ended up sliding it inside the front door and then opening the box and pulling out the pieces in groups and carrying them to my assembly area.The box was fairly dented on the corner but thankfully this is packaged well and large foam buffers inside the carton absorbed all of the damage and the product was in perfect condition.Assembly took me nearly 3.5 hours of uninterrupted work.  There are so many pieces and so much to study.  I budgeted about 90 minutes for this so I was quite surprised at how long it was taking.  Everything is very well documented though you might need a magnifying glass for the instructions if you’re over 40.  The assembly was tedious but straightforward.  The only part I struggled with was the drawers: they are a pain and took a lot of manhandling to get some of the holes to line up properly.  I found that using groove joint pliers (plumbers pliers) with a protective rag was the easiest way to snap in the main plastic guide pieces used for the drawer rails.  Hammering them in (as the instructions stipulated) didn’t work that well as the pieces bounced around a bit.Also, the instructions clearly state that you shouldn’t use power tools but I used a cordless screwdriver and it easily saved me 20-30 minutes of tedious screwing.  Just make sure not to strip things out.The unit comes with a system for mounting it to your wall to avoid tip overs: this is good because it is not very deep and thus is a bit tipsy.  I could easily see this thing falling forward if you had heavy stuff in the top drawer and opened it.  Definitely use the wall security mount if you have small kids around.As I said, the finished product has a high-end look.  The only time you can tell you’re dealing with something relatively inexpensive is when you look at the fit and finish of the drawers (they don’t line up perfectly and sometimes they won’t stay closed) and when you open the drawers (the drawer insides are not finished and look very cheap).  Still, for the price, this is a great value.  The slight misalignment of the drawers disappears because of the black color and even though I’m very picky, I only notice it when I look for it.Based on my experience so far, I would buy more of these in a heartbeat: just make sure to budget a few hours for the assembly!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YEDGHK6TVB6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H24EMFQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YEDGHK6TVB6F","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good value for a remote control car but be prepared to shell out big bucks for batteries (or buy rechargeables).This car does great on perfectly flat surfaces.  I’ve used it on carpet, wood, and tile flooring and it works perfectly.  It only has one speed (full!) so it is a bit of a challenge to drive in small spaces.  The high speed and hard, pointy front bumper make me limit this to outdoor use only because I don’t want my wood baseboards beaten up.Outdoors on concrete the car performs well.  You can easily drive this over a block before losing control of it.  In fact, you’ll probably have a hard time seeing it before it loses control from the remote control.The working headlights and reverse lights make this car fun to drive at night.  The lights are very bright and make this very easy to steer on even dimly lit streets.Because of the low profile and small wheels, this car will only work on a perfectly flat surface.The car is pretty fast and the steering is very twitchy.  Much like the throttle, there is no such thing as partial steering: it’s all or nothing.  This leads to a lot of over compensating followed by more overcompensating in the opposite direction.  The best technique is to point it where you want it to go and let it do what it’s good at: go straight!  So far, the car tracks straight as an arrow so that works pretty well.The remote uses three AAA batteries and those haven’t worn out yet.  Unfortunately, the car uses 6 AA batteries and those wear out if you forget to turn the car off.  This was surprising because the car has an “auto-off” feature that turns it off after a short period of inactivity.  But apparently this auto-off feature still drains the batteries because I went to use the car the next day and the batteries were dead.  You pretty much have to invest in one (possibly two) sets of 6 rechargeable AA batteries unless you own stock in a battery company.  I’m not shocked that this thing eats batteries, but it was surprising that they oven bothered to add an auto-off feature when it clearly does nothing (except give you a false sense of security).Overall this car is a hit and the price is excellent.  So long as you’re setup with a steady supply of batteries, your kids will get a lot of fun out of this.  It seems durable and I’m expecting it to last a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33LBEV9MU8JS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCAMNHO#wasThisHelpful","R33LBEV9MU8JS7","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good cleaner for granite and travertine.  I'm always worried about using solutions such as Windex and 409 because they have color additives that I fear will leach into the natural stone.  With this product, the really isn't any color so I don't have to worry about that.When I use this on my granite countertop, it ends up clean and very smooth.  The towel glides across the granite as if on ice.I use this on travertine as well and find it equally effective.  I use a semi-matte sealant on my travertine and this does not disturb the sealant or make things too shiny.  It just adds a ""clean"" look.  I would not use this on travertine floors because this makes them very slippery.  I tried it on a couple of tiles and later that day I almost fell over walking on them.  My mistake!I like that this is not heavily scented as I don't really like it when I clean something and then have to smell the product for hours to come.My only reservation about giving this 5 stars is that it takes a lot of product to do the cleaning.  Because you're not diluting with water, you go through the bottle faster than you might using other cleaning products.  Still, this works well and I will keep using it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSN5Q7ZSNA8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L7L1370#wasThisHelpful","R1TSN5Q7ZSNA8P","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch is much nicer than it's pricetag would suggest.  The band is beautiful and quite heavy: it feels like a luxury watch should feel.  The face is also beautiful and is larger like a modern watch without being too large or gaudy.  All of the metal is brilliantly polished and shines like highly polished silver.The band is adjustable by removing links.  I was able to remove a number of links to get this to fit perfectly on my wife's small wrist.  She's quite happy with the fit.  The removable links allow for about 1 inch of adjustability.If you're giving this as a gift, the external packaging is quite nice and will give a great first impression.  One caution is that before you wrap this, you should open the box and remove the protective plastic that adorns the watch and the band.  Because of the intricate metal pattern on the band, the packaging plastic took me over 5 minutes to peel off.  Fortunately this is only a one-time thing but it is something you will want to do to maximize the first impression when giving this to a loved one!So far I'm very happy with this watch and highly recommend it.

"This chin strap works well for keeping my mouth shut while I'm sleeping.  The material is comfortable against my skin and breathes well.  I usually wash these in hot water after about 4 uses.  They seem to last me more than a year.My lone complaint for the first month or so these have a horrible chemical smell.  Repeated washing diminishes the smell but it still lasts for quite awhile.  The smell is so strong that even after showering I can still smell it on my face.

"The TrendNet cloud camera is an excellent hardware solution that is limited by the mediocre software.  The camera hardware is well built and provides an excellent high definition image under all lighting conditions.  It has a very good dynamic range and can see well even when part of the room is well lit and other parts are dim.  The high definition is detailed and crisp and looks better than any image I’ve seen from a wireless camera.The automatic nightvision is also impressive.  It easily shines 30-40 feet and illuminates a wide area.  Nightvision mode is fully automatic and will engage and disengage as lighting conditions dictate.Where this camera falls short is the usability experience provided by the TrendNet software.  First, it is fairly clunky to setup.  The instructions are adequate but there appear to be a number of unwritten rules.  For example, I initially hard wired the camera to my Ethernet network.  During this time I was constantly prompted to install a firmware update.  No matter which client I used (phone, PC, etc…), the firmware update would fail.  Later I enabled wifi and suddenly firmware update worked perfectly.  Nowhere was this limitation covered in the documentation.  There are many things like this.Using the iPhone app, I can pan and tilt the camera view but even over a fast wifi connection, the camera lags behind my clicks by about 10-20 seconds.  This makes it very time consuming to position the camera to a new view.  I also notice that when I change the camera resolution to 720p high def, suddenly it loses a lot of frames.  Again, this is over a fast wifi network.  At 480p, the camera does better.I find it deceitful that they say this camera has two-way audio.  It does not really...what it does have is a headphone jack so you can add your own speaker.  Indeed, if you use your own speaker, this camera is able to relay two-way audio and the audio quality is very good.Another pseudo-deceit is that they’ve called this a PTZ camera.  “PTZ” is a widely used acronym that means a camera can pan (left/right), tilt (up/down), and zoom (in/out).  This camera does pan and tilt, but it does not zoom.When a remote client is viewing the camera, a green LED on the front blinks.  This gives you an easy way to know when you’re being watched.Overall, I’m not happy with the usability of this camera.  It’s so slow to manipulate that I think I almost have to treat it as a non-moving camera.  And while the high def video is crisp, the fact that it doesn’t deliver more than one frame every 2-3 seconds makes it useless.  This makes me go down to 480p which isn’t all that crisp.  A good firmware update could probably fix what ails this camera, but until that comes out (if ever), I can’t recommend this.  I’ve used the D-Link cloud cameras and they are far easier to use for about the same amount of money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMTFOPGM3PZC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPR7UEK#wasThisHelpful","RMTFOPGM3PZC6","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most important thing I can tell you about these gloves is that the size is one size too small.  So buy a size larger than you normally buy and you'll be very happy.  I wear a size ""Large"" in every other glove product I've ever used but size large of this product is painfully tight and the fingers are too short.  My wife typically wears size ""Medium"" and these fit her perfectly.These are very strong gloves that are difficult to tear.

"This foot cream does a good job of keeping your feet smooth and free of skin cracks but the scent is overwhelming and prevents me from using it.This is a very thick cream and a dime size application is enough to do my entire foot.  It seems to absorb pretty easily and does not leave a greasy residue on my hands or feet.  Unfortunately, the strong floral scent is pleasant but way too strong.  Once you use this, you'll have to wash your hands for a long time to erase the smell.  And then you'll still be able to smell your feet.  The strong scent has driven me back to using Cetaphil cream.  It works about as well but doesn't have the pungent scent.

"This cabana provides light shelter from the elements and is comfortable for two adults in folding chairs.  It’s an easy way to bring some shade along with you.This travels as a 2’ duffle bag (included) with a shoulder strap.  It only weighs a tad over 5 pounds so you probably won’t even notice that you’re carrying it.I can assemble this by myself in under 10 minutes.  You lay the entire structure flat and then thread the three included flexible poles into the fabric.  From there, you just kind of “lift” up from the center and jab each of the ends of the poles into the ground.  It’s definitely easier with two people but one works in a pinch.  Once assembled, you can jam the included metal spikes into the ground for some extra stability.The front of the structure is designed to be pretty flexible: there is an extra flap of material that can either be lifted up to form a fourth wall or can be laid down to provide a small “driveway” in front of the cabana.  Or you can roll it up and get it out of the way.  You can even put it up as a half-height fourth wall so you get some wind blocking but can still see out.  Very neat design and very useful.  When you do use it as a fourth wall.The material blocks all sunlight and stops wind and water.  Strangely, even though the interior is shaded, the temperature is exactly the same as it is out in the sun.  I measured this with an infrared thermometer and found no difference in the temperature inside or outside the cabana.The material is water proof but the structure itself is not.  Even if you close up the front and both windows, copious amounts of rain water will enter the structure through the sides of these openings and there is no way for it to drain out so you’ll be swimming in the water.The cabana has two windows, but they’re too small to let much air circulate through the structure.  This makes positioning very important.  You’ll be a lot more comfortable if you can position the open end of the structure so that wind comes in through the front.  This way you get nice circulation while sitting completely shaded.  In fact, on a sunny day with not much wind, I found it more comfortable sitting outside of the cabana just because I got some air circulation versus the complete stillness in the cabana.  So definitely make sure to position things just right to catch whatever wind you can.I’m happy with this cabana as a way to get out of the sun with minimal hassle.  So far I haven’t found anything that I don’t like about it.  Just make sure to get it pointed towards the wind and this is a very comfortable way to spend an afternoon.MISCELLANEOUSI love the mesh pockets as they give you a place to get important items up and off the ground.  You can throw your cell phone, and wallet in these and they will be off the ground and in a fixed location.I’ve only used this in light winds of 5 to 10 miles per hour but it holds up fine to these gusts.The floor is not made of a heavy duty material.  I’m not sure how long it will last with my metal chair legs rubbing on it.  So far it’s holding up but I’ve got my eye on it.When wet, it drys out really fast.  The material doesn’t absorb any water so as soon as you can shake off any rain and give it a short amount of time to dry, it will be completely dry and ready for storage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QI2Q0BEY3POJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCG8JC#wasThisHelpful","R2QI2Q0BEY3POJ","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Poo-Pourri works as advertised and is a great way to avoid an embarrassing aftermath for nature's necessities.  The Deja-Poo sent has a strong citrus note.  Because you have to use this product before you take care of business, I feared that the scent would be overpowering to me.  In fact, while you can smell the citrus smell, it is not overpowering at all and it does prevent any unpleasant odors.  This is unlike using lysol or another ""cover-up"" spray because those fill the air with a flowery or ""clean"" smell whereas this product leaves very little smell.  I wouldn't go back to aerosols after using this.I also tried Vanilla Mint and Royal Flush scents.  Both are very effective, just as Deja-poo is.  Vanilla mint is my absolute favorite as it doesn't have a floral scent.  It smells like mint-chip ice cream.I'm putting this in every bathroom in my house and my wife took the 2oz version to work with her. The 2oz size is great for travel but I would't carry it on your person unless it's in a ziplock bag.

"I like this portable alarm clock.  The projection ability is something that I have at home and always miss when I go on the road.  To have a small/compact alarm clock like this that comes with a projector is pretty impressive.I like that they silk-screened the instructions onto the flip-out base for this clock.  No more racking your brain to remember how to change the daylight savings time setting.I love that it has a USB port built into the side so you can charge your phone.  I don't love that they did not include a power adapter for the very short power cord.  Instead, they give you a USB cord and you have to supply your own power converter.  I guess this is somewhat offset by the ability to charge your phone through the clock, but still, I'd prefer that they include a power plug with it.The clock has three brightness settings (no backlight, dim backlight, bright backlight) so no matter what you prefer, it will work for you.  It uses two AAA batteries but does not project to the ceiling when running only on battery power.The projection onto a 8-9 foot ceiling is large and easy for me to read, even without glasses.  I guess this part depends on how good your vision is.  But it is just as good as my other non-portable projection alarm clocks.Aside from the lack of a power cord, my other complaint is that the viewing angle of the LCD screen has a sharp cut-off if the clock is positioned above you.  So if your night stand is higher than your bed, you will not be able to read the time on this clock as the entire screen looks blank.  This may be partially due to how thin the clock is, or possibly just due to the manufacturer cheaping out a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UGYBEEFSMW1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UC39VZK#wasThisHelpful","R1UGYBEEFSMW1H","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Petcube is a refreshingly well done product that gives you a two-way connection to your pets when you’re away from home.  I say “refreshingly well done” because the Petcube has worked flawlessly since the moment I took it out of the box. There hasn’t been an endless parade of firmware updates or steady improvement to the functionality: because it didn’t need any.Setup was very easy.  They have you install an app on your phone and then connect to a wifi network being temporarily broadcast by your Petcube.  Once done, the app will configure your Petcube and help join it to your local wifi network.  From there, you’re done and you can launch the app and access the audio/video from the Petcube.Video quality is decent but not stellar.  The camera has a very wide viewing angle so you can see a large area of the room.  The frame rate is decent so motion video is fairly smooth.  You can definitely get a good view of what your pets are up to when you’re not around.  So far everything has worked well when I’m away from home using cellular networks.Audio quality seems comparable to using a Bluetooth headset.  My wife and I were able to talk to each other using the audio capability and we could hear each other just fine (save for the echo, more on that later).  No matter what I did, I could not get my dogs to acknowledge the audio from the Petcube.  It’s like they don’t even hear it.  Cats might be different.The laser pointer feature works quite well.  Out of the box, you do have to go through a very simple and fast “calibration” exercise within the Petcube app.  After that, you can move the pointer around fairly accurately.  My dogs go bonkers over the pointer and I can keep them playing for quite a long time just by moving the dot around and watching the scramble to chase it.  I love being able to get them active when I’m not home…the only problem is getting them to notice the laser dot when you first turn it on.  But once they see it, the fun begins.The app has worked flawlessly for me.  I really commend this company for producing a product that works as-advertised right out of the box.  This is increasingly rare.The product is very nice looking and seems to be made out of real aluminum.  Compared to the shiny plastic in competing products, the Petcube is something I don’t mind having visible in my house.  It is quite small and kind of disappears into the background once you get it positioned.  The camera is pointed somewhat downward from the Petcube so it is designed to be placed at counter height or higher in your house.  The bottom has a standard “tripod” mount screw so there are a ton of mounting options that you can separately purchase for mounting on a wall or other surface.The Petcube has a couple of annoyances/limitations.  First, there is no night-vision.  This means that in a dark room, all you’ll see is a black screen.  Secondly, the Petcube has an obnoxiously bright LED on it that I ended up covering with black electrical tape.  Ironically, the LED was not bright enough to allow the Petcube to see in a dark room.  But it was bright enough to wake me up at night.  Lastly, when you use the audio feature, anything that you say is echoed back through your phone about 2 seconds later.  This is distracting and also makes the audio feature kind of noisy to use if you’re at work or in a public place because everything you say is blaring back at you.Overall I’m very happy with the Petcube and I’m getting a lot of use out of it.  My dogs are enjoying the extra “play time” when I’m gone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TS8ZP2FHQ9XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWN8O8#wasThisHelpful","R3TS8ZP2FHQ9XR","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Several years ago I suffered ruptured disks in my lower back.  At that time I learned that my ""core strength"" was not enough to hold my spin in place and that I would continue to have back problems unless I made some changes.  One change I made was to stand while at work.  But when I want to sit, I love using a balance ball like this.  The balls let you take a load off your feet while still keeping your core muscles engaged holding your spine in place.Once you start sitting on it, you'll get used to it right away and won't even realize that your muscles are working constantly to keep you up just like when you're standing up, you don't notice all of your muscles working to keep you from falling over.They claim this chair will work for people up to 5'11, but I am 5'11 and I find it just a hair too small.  My wife is 5'7 and it is perfect for her.The wheels are on the cheap side.  They include a locking mechanism so you can hold this chair in place, but because the wheels are hard plastic, you might still slide around a bit.

The squeaking is pretty hard to activate and probably only a dog 80+ pounds can even get their mouth around it to squeeze it.  So far I've never heard my dogs squeak it, but they do like chasing it around.It seems to be of very high quality construction and so far my dogs haven't been able to do any damage to it..  There is a mild ""rubber"" smell.  It doesn't seem to be deterring my dogs from playing with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLB8BJ40771K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUV6UGI#wasThisHelpful","R1WLB8BJ40771K","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This glass does everything it claims.  It has excellent insulation and your drink stays colder for far longer than if you pour it into a traditional mug, even a frozen mug.The glass does not sweat at all.I love that it has a firm rubber bottom so that I know it won't mark or scratch my counters or tables.  The built-in bottle operner works great.I don't drink from plastic cups because I can always taste the plastic so I like that this is stainless steel on the inside.My only complaint is that the blue band around the outside is kind of loosey-goosey and easily falls. off.  I guess it's meant to help you identify which glass is yours out of a group.  I ended up getting annoyed by it and taking it off.Overall, this is great and lets you enjoy your cold beverage without cold/wet fingers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BOGGNBJ7NHNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT3BHXU#wasThisHelpful","R3BOGGNBJ7NHNZ","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This soundbar speaker provides an excellent upgrade to the speakers in my 50"" Samsung TV without adding rumbling bass that will disturb people in other rooms.  With the speaker installed, I can crank up the volume while using loud fans and exercise equipment and all dialog is crystal clear, even at very high volumes.Installation was very easy.I attached this speaker to my Samsung TV using the included optical cable.  I then went into the settings on my Samsung and disabled the internal speaker so that the only sound would come from this soundbar.I have a DirecTV HR24 DVR in the room so I went into the remote control settings menu and configured ""AV1"" to control a VIZIO SOUNDBAR.  I then went into the ""remote lock"" setting of the DirecTV menu and told it that I wanted all sound controls to be routed to the AV1 device.  In doing so, the remote control of my DirecTV DVR now is able to adjust the volume and mute the soundbar without any extra fiddling!  Perfection!  At this time, the speaker works as seamlessly as if it was built into my TV.I made two adjustments to the configuration of the speaker.  Firstly, I cranked down the bass all the way.  If you live in close quarters, this is going to help prevent your neighbors from hearing things because bass travels through the walls more easily than treble.  Secondly, I disabled the ""eco"" feature so that the speaker would stay on 24x7.  That way I don't have to power it on each time I want to use it.  Both of these adjustments were very easy and were covered in the well-written printed documentation that came with the soundbar.From my experience, I think the 38"" is the right answer if you have a big TV (42"" or larger).  The built in speakers of a 42"" or larger TV are probably powerful enough that the 29"" version of this soundbar won't make enough of a difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEL5FO7N8218/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMBG8NC#wasThisHelpful","R2VEL5FO7N8218","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These scrubbing sponges live up to the promise of not gunking up when you use them to clean stuff like cheese, eggs, and caramel.  The scrubber side works as you'd expect, but stays free of entrenched goo.  What little bit of cheese adhered to the sponge pushed off easily with my finger when run under tap water.I'm a big fan of Scotch Brite sponges, I usually use the blue ones in my kitchen.  But they do get clogged up with grime and I'm going to switch to these going forward.My only complaint would be that these are not individually wrapped.  That means once you open the package, the remaining sponges dry out and become like pieces of styrofoam.  They still work fine though.

"This fan makes a lot of noise but manages to move a lot of air.PROs---------------------+ powerful+ fairly thin+ very easy to move & maneuver+ easy to adjust tilt angleCONs---------------------- makes a lot of noise- short cordUsing outdoors, you can easily feel the breeze from this fan 10 to 15 feet away.  That may not sound like much, but try it with an ordinary fan and you'll see that it is powerful.Indoors, the fan is able to circulate air throughout a large garage without problems.  Because the air is trapped indoors, the effects of the fan are much more pronounced.The design makes it really easy to move around.  First, it has two large grab handles on the top that make it a cinch to pick up and carry.  Secondly, it has wheels along one side that make it easy to roll around on a hard surface.On the negative side, the fan is loud.  It isn't just the whirring of the blades but also the racket of metal as the cage of the fan shakes against itself.  Also, the cord is about 6' but seems short since it starts at the middle of the fan, thus leaving only about 4' of usable cord, or even less depending on how you position the fan relative to your power outlet.  You'll definitely want a heavy duty extension cord to go with this.Overall, I’m very happy and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this for dry outdoor or shop/large garage use.  I usually expect a lot of noise from a fan of this size so that doesn't bother me.  And the short cord is kind of a universal problem these days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z3WZ696QHW64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8Q30RS#wasThisHelpful","R1Z3WZ696QHW64","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This balance pad is made of a very durable material and it appears that it will last.  The surface has enough resistance that you can easily plant your foot on it doing step exercises and it won't slide around.  The thickness is quite good and if you're doing balance exercises, you'll easily get the instability that you need to force your muscles to work harder.I had back surgery and part of my recovery therapy involved various exercises on this type of balance pad.  It's amazing how just standing planted on this with your eyes closed for 3-4 minutes per day can improve your balance and help you avoid stumbling when walking on uneven terrain.The size of this is good but not great for a large man.  I can stand on it comfortably but I have little room for error.  I'd prefer a slightly larger one for my size frame but for most people this is a very good size.BTW, if you're using this for balance, I highly recommend you invest in a Bosu Ball as well.  They are fantastic for a number of easy to difficult balance exercises!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E76TXT6K32A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY9L3Q6#wasThisHelpful","R1E76TXT6K32A9","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used these fertilizer spikes for years and have had great results.  When I moved into my house in 2003, I began using these as-directed around a couple of oak trees I my front yard. My neighbor's oak trees were the same type, size, and age.  After 10 years, my oak trees are about double the size of his and have a lush, full canopy.  I can't think of any other reason why my trees are so much bigger.Despite a plastic cap to cover the tops, these spikes tend to fracture into pieces when I hammer them into the tough Texas clay. My technique is to hammer a pilot hole into the ground using a crowbar.  Then I pull the crowbar outp and hammer in the fertilizer spike. This makes the process much easier and less frustrating and let's me get the spike deep into the ground.One major problem I've had with these is that when I use them in parts of my yard that don't drain well, my grass is ruined in the late summer by an ugly fungus that makes brown rings (called ""brown spot"" or ""brown patch"" in Texas).  To avoid this, you need to make sure your yard drains evenly and doesn't have areas where water can build up and allow a fungus to take over.  I've since leveled my yard and the fungus isn't a problem anymore.If you need to jump start some young trees, I highly recommend this product. The results are quite tangible after a few growing seasons!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UAU8A6NJYUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA5OYKM#wasThisHelpful","R21UAU8A6NJYUH","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm happy that I haven't had any reactions to the metal.  Sometimes inexpensive jewelry gives me a rash or leaves black marks on my skin but this has been perfect so far.One negative is that the packaging is extremely cheap looking.  Mine was even somewhat crushed.  If you give this as a gift, that won't be a good first impression.

"So far the DD45E is doing a very good job of helping keep our indoor humidity levels lower.  It seems to have no problem managing humidity in a 1500 square foot space.  Having the DD45E programmed for 40% humidity, it can drop the humidity of that space from 50% to 46% in about 8 hours.  During that time it pulls about two liters of water from the air.  I can already notice an increase in the comfort of our home in the first week of usage.The programmable display is extremely easy to use as there are only a few options.  You can specify what your target humidity value is (from 30 - 80%) or it can run the condenser continuously.  You can also set the fan speed between two settings.  The timer function lets you run it for a set amount of time before it turns off.The DD45E is quite powerful and moves a lot of air to get the job done.  As a result, it's fairly loud.  If you've ever used a window air conditioner, it's about that loud.  Fortunately, the sound is extremely uniform and hasn't bothered me or kept me awake.  When the condenser cycles off, things get a bit quieter because the fan automatically slows down.When running with the condenser on, I measured the DD45E using 400 Watts of electricity.  At that rate, figure a cost of less than $1.50/day to operate.  Whenever it runs fan-only, the power usage drops to about 75 Watts.  Even when you hit your target humidity level, the fan keeps running.  I don't love this but it makes sense: the unit needs to circulate the air in order to detect if humidity is building up.If you can't make use of the drain hose to outlet water to a floor drain or sump, the built-in tank has a floater so it won't over-fill during usage.  Basically it will just turn off to prevent water flooding everywhere.The machine's humidity sensor reading seems to be accurate as it is within about 1% of the reading that my thermostat reports.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QIWT2Y3JPYG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOZVVM4#wasThisHelpful","R1QIWT2Y3JPYG4","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this keyboard, your iPad is effectively converted into an extremely lightweight laptop.  The 11"" MacBook Air weighs in at 2.4lbs and an iPad Air 2 + this case weighs only 1.9lbs!  Both have 128GB of storage but my iPad also has cellular networking which gives it a leg up on the MBA.  I'm typing this review using the QODE.Besides serving as a fairly rugged hardcase for my iPad Air 2, the QODE also gives you a pint-sized keyboard.  To Belkin's credit, the letter keys are full sized and spaced identically to a normal laptop keyboard.  Belkin shaved two inches off of the width of the keyboard by shrinking the keys along the side: think ""shift"", ""return"", ""apostrophe"".  The upside of this is that I can type very swiftly on the QODE; far faster than I can type on Apple's virtual keyboard. The downside is that I end up hitting ""return"" about 50% of the time when I'm trying to hit ""apostrophe"".  Oh well, I'm getting better at it!The case has it's own battery.  I was bummed that it uses a USB cable.  Now I have to drag around two cables to charge my iPad + case.  I wish they would have used a lightning cable to let me get by with one cord.  Fortunately, the battery seems to last a really long time under normal use.  I'd say you can go at least two days of moderate use before you need to charge it.If I could change one thing, it would be to make the key-repeat rate adjustable.  Sometimes I hold down an arrow key or the backspace key and want it to move a bit faster than the default setting.As far as serving as a case and stand, the QODE is perfectly competent.  It makes use of magnets to hold itself closed and to let you choose from three different pivots for adjusting the viewing angle of your iPad.  I love this because at the most severe viewing angle, I'm able have my iPad on a counter while I stand and read from it; the angle is just right.  The other viewing angles work great when you're seated at a table.A few miscellaneous notes....- The keys are fairly quiet.  If you're in a classroom taking notes I don't think you'll get any dirty looks from classmates or professors.- You can wake up your iPad just by tapping one of the keys.- I tried typing while holding it on my lap but it doesn't have enough surface area to lay flat on my two legs so this didn't work.- Their are dedicated keys for your iPad ""home"" button and to launch Siri.- Via FN keys, you can play/pause music, change apps, or even launch the iPad virtual keyboard in case you need it for something.So far the only problem I've had is that one time the keyboard quit working.  I was typing but no keypresses were showing up.  I finally disabled bluetooth on the iPad and then re-enabled it and the keyboard synced back up and has worked fine since.  If this becomes a recurring thing I'll update my review.I love that I have the best of both worlds now.  I have an awesome tablet but when I need it, the function of a laptop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J2SR9OMHQ1OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTDTT5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1J2SR9OMHQ1OH","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These shredding claws beat the pants off of using a fork to shred large quantities of meat. They are comfortable in my hands and do a great job of shredding.  So far I've used with smoked turkey, smoked brisket, and chicken.  In all cases, they work great.A couple of comments:- leave yourself a large amount of room for the shredding process. If you try to do this in a cramped counter space, you won't have as easy of a time- use one claw to hold the meat in place and use the other claw to tear away from the holding claw. Repeat this motion in quick succession and you'll be done in a hurryThe rubberized grip does get a bit slippery when your hands are covered in grease.

"I originally rated this as a 5-star product, but during my initial time playing with it I blew one of the speakers.  After that, it couldn't play music without continuous popping or crackling.  I'll take partial blame for this; I had turned up the volume fairly loud.  I blame the speaker maker too for not putting a hardware limit on the volume and keeping it within the limits of the speaker.After blowing the speaker, I felt the desire to test the product claim that this product can survive drops.  I did 10 repeated drops from 3-4 feet in the air onto a concrete surface and I was impressed with how rugged this product is.  It did not suffer anything other than minor scratches during this abuse.  Very cool.I'm still bummed that I blew the speaker and won't be able to use this anymore.----------------- Original review --------------------This wireless speaker is the size of a small purse but has good sound and enough power to run pretty much all day.Setup was very simple.  It arrived with a fully charged battery and when I turned it on, it immediately gave a verbal cue that it was ready to pair.  I went to my phone's Bluetooth settings, found the speaker, and added it.  The entire process took about 10 seconds.  Since then it's working great and always connects to my phone right away when I turn it on.Sound quality is quite nice.  There isn't much bass, but it blows away what you'll get straight out of your phone's speaker or out of some of the portable speakers I've used in the past.  If you turn it all the way up, I found it to get garbled some.  In my usage, going to about 80% of maximum volume is the most you can do without getting distortion.  You can control the volume on your phone or on the speaker, but they are both separate volume controls.  You can also fast forward/rewind from either the speaker or your phone.The Bluetooth works well for about 10 feet.  It reaches well beyond 10 feet but I noticed some periodic glitches in the sound when I had the speaker 15 feet away from my phone.I ran it for 4 hours at full volume and didn't even consume half of the battery.The solar panel has a durable matte finish and does a good job at pulling in available light.  Even indirect sunlight is enough to start charging things.  The unit has a ""charging"" indicator that gets brighter or dimmer depending on how much solar power it is actively pushing into the battery.  This helps you know whether you're picking up enough light or not.  With the battery half depleted, it took about 6 hours of bright sunlight to recharge it back to full.  Even if the sun isn't shining directly on it, it will capture enough solar power to do some charging.  I really like that you can plug your phone into the speaker and charge it from the internal battery & solar panel.  On a sunny day, you're good for a full day of fun.I tested the IPX4 splash rating by sprinkling water on all sides of it, similar to what would happen if you had this out by the pool and someone jumped in and splashed you.  The speaker lived up to the claim and had no problems with the exposure to water.  All of the openings for USB and AUX have little rubber flaps that snap into them to keep the water and sand out.So far this has proven to be a great outdoor speaker.  It has good sound and volume, a little water or sand won't hurt it, the sun won't make it overheat but will keep it charged.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29PG5DMQS338S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IN2WDDE#wasThisHelpful","R29PG5DMQS338S","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This digital steamer has quickly become my go to choice for steaming vegetables.In the past I would alternate between stovetop steaming (when I had time and wanted great results) and microwave steaming (when I was in a hurry).  Steaming on the stovetop yields great results but it takes awhile to get the water boiling on my gas stovetop and then you can plan on a healthy amount of time for the steam process.  The microwave is a lot easier and more than twice as fast but the results are sketchy at best.  Vegetables steamed in my microwave often get an unattractive wilt due to the combination of steam and microwave energy.The hamilton beach digital steamer is the best of both worlds.  It heats up quickly (steam billows out in about 3 minutes) and the timer and delay function make it a breeze to coordinate the results to match other parts of your meal so you can serve everything at one.  The actual resulting food is  every bit as good as the results I can get over the stovetop.  Overall, expect this steamer to take about twice as long as a microwave steaming at 50% power.Cleanup is easy.  There are several plastic pieces that can be quickly wiped down.  The sides of the steamer remain cool during operation so after you use it, you can pick it up and dump out any extra water into the sink.The unit stores in a relatively small space because a lot of the components collapse and fold into each other.  The size of the unit is about the size as a 2.5qt slow cooker.The cooking compartment is made of several removable pieces so you can configure it a number of ways.  If you need to do something large, you can make it tall or if you need to do a lot of something you can turn it into a double-decker.So far I'm very happy with this.  I really love that it doesn't get hot to the touch as that makes it a lot safer to use.  The results are perfect and the timer and delay start feature makes it so easy to coordinate finish times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C4RA5VYXKNXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA34AB0#wasThisHelpful","R2C4RA5VYXKNXY","A2OS3TIVAKUAHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OS3TIVAKUAHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave these to my son to try out, as he's a type 1 diabetic. I also gave them a try myself before I handed them over. While I'm not bought into the restorative properties of copper, these *are* good socks that tend to collect less odor than other stocks of the same style.I found them extremely comfortable to wear, both with and without shoes. I work from home, so I tend to go without shoes for most of the day. They fit well, and didn't slide around on my foot as some short socks can tend to do. The bottom part seemed to have a thicker padding than the rest of the sock, which was perfect for comfort. When I wore them with my shoes, they don't bunch up and create folds (which I hate).One thing that these socks have which is nice is a lip on the back portion of the ankle. This lines up well with where you normally have the higher portion of the running shoes, and it cuts down on excessive wear on the Achilles tendon (where I tend to get blisters).Both my son and I have noticed that they have far less odor after daily wear. Based on the sales pitch for copper, that might be the bacteria getting killed off. Again, I don't know if that's indeed the case, but it seems to have that effect.I'd be happy to have a drawer full of these to replace my regular cotton socks.Disclosure:Obtained From: Copper ClicksPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15A4L146USMQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144CYW8K#wasThisHelpful","R15A4L146USMQG","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know why I do this to myself... I read a Robin Cook novel, thinking I'll like the story (I enjoy medical thrillers). But as I get deeper into it, I find myself disliking the book as it's nothing more than a skeleton to push some medical injustice or soapbox that Cook has picked out. I swear I won't read another one... until the ""another one"" comes out and I try again...... and I end up with Host.The storyline isn't bad. Actually, it's the only thing that kept me reading. Healthy younger guy goes into the hospital for a relatively minor surgery (knee repair). Something goes horribly wrong, and he ends up in a coma. Two medical students (one of which is his lover) decide that they need to dig into his case to see how something could go so wrong. What they uncover is a conspiracy that links the hospital and a pharmaceutical firm in a scheme that is unthinkable (and of course, highly illegal).There's some soapboxing here about the evils of drug companies, the amounts they charge, and the way they spend their money. I'm used to that, and I'll forgive a bit of it. What really turned me off was the characters and dialogue. The two students, best friends, are extremely smart and top of their class. They are fourth year med students, so I'd expect them to know a lot. But it seems like basic medical conditions and terms seem to be beyond them (causing lots of late-night research). I got *very* annoyed with the dialogue, as it was stereotyped and completely unrealistic. Michael is a large black guy, and his ""hip and cool"" phrasing goes completely overboard. Even if they are friends, I can't imagine people talking like that. Lynn isn't much better, though. She's attacked later in the story, and she's telling Michael what happened. Saying things like ""We've stumbled onto a hornets' nest, and my tete-a-tete with the goon got worse."" Really? You've just escaped getting raped, and you're saying stuff like that? Couple the dialogue with a large number of situations where you have to suspend belief beyond what is normal, and it was just too much.I might be a bit more forgiving with a first-time author trying to get it right and find their style. Cook should do far better at this point. I think I'll likely stay away from future Cook novels... just like I've said in the past.Disclosure:Obtained From: LibraryPayment: Borrowed","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2QJGC60N43C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399172149#wasThisHelpful","R2H2QJGC60N43C","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful gown by Ekouaer that looks great on my wife. I was unsure as how the quality would be given the low price, but this is as good (if not better) than what you'd get from name brands like Victoria's Secret.I was pleased that the sizing chart was accurate, so what I ordered for my wife fit exactly as expected. The fabric has some stretch to it, so it's forgiving for various curves that are not model-esque. It draped well for a fit that looks attractive from both the front and rear.My wife appreciated the adjustable straps, as she was able to get a fit that was perfect for her. The lace trim is just as soft as the main fabric, and she can wear this both as sleepwear, or as a black slip underneath a dress.If you're looking for a shorter nightgown or something racy, this is an excellent option.

"I've been recovering from a surgical procedure on my right arm, but my left side neck and deltoid has been giving me fits (mismatched balance after wearing a brace on my right arm after the operation). I've been using ice packs to relieve the irritation, but it's hard to get them to stay in one place for a decent period of time. This therapy belt has been working VERY well for me.The bag allows me to fill it up with ice cubes to where it's about 5 to 6 inches deep. I screw on the top and slip the lip of the bag into the hole of the neoprene sleeve. Velcro holds it in place, and it's good for an hour or two before I need to re-freeze or refill the bag.I've been using it on my upper arm to hit my medial deltoid. While it's easier to put on and secure if you have a helper, you can get it in place on your own with a little practice.

"I don't do a lot of home repair or DYI stuff, but I do have occasion when I need a shim to hold something in place while I adjust something else. It's a safe bet that I don't have wedges or spare wood to do that, so I'm usually stuck trying to use my foot (or something else) to hold things in place (with the associated results that you'd expect). I was intrigued when I was contacted about the Anybest Air Wedge Inflatable Shim. After trying it out, I'm impressed.At its core, it's an inflatable pouch that is designed to lift up to 200+ lbs as high as 2 inches. With no weigh on it, it will actually go as high as 2.5 inches, but of course it will compress a bit depending on how much weight it's carrying. The air bulb works pretty much like a blood pressure cuff... you squeeze the bulb to push air into the pouch, and then you push the valve button to release the air when when you want it to deflate. It's a very simple design that works remarkably well.I didn't have any immediate tasks that needed a shim, but I tried putting it under a few heavier objects to see how the inflating worked. When placed under one of the legs of a twin bed, it definitely lifted the leg by the advertised 2 inches. Because of the rounded nature of the pouch, it rolled off (the bed post had roller legs), but if it had been a normal post or something flat like a door or window, it would have stayed put.I'm impressed at how well this works, and how easy it is to operate. This is going into my toolbox immediately for the next time I need something to raise a door or other item by an inch or two. It'll work FAR better than trying to fold cardboard to get the right height.Disclosure:Obtained From: AnybestPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QHJ43DMWIYJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119E0AIC#wasThisHelpful","R1QHJ43DMWIYJ3","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This body slimming tank top is one of most comfortable slimming clothing items I've worn. I've been using regular t-shirt style slimming items. but this style has a lot more going for it, both in terms of style and comfort.One of the downsides of the compression shirts is the struggle to put it on. The tank top style makes it a lot easier to put on, and the struggle is much less. I'm struggling with a shoulder issue after some arm surgery, and I like how this style allows for an ice pack to be held in one place.I like how this has a good level of back support in addition to abdominal support. It's not constraining, but it provides that mix of support and comfort that is hard to find.This isn't going to turn you from a slob into a supermodel, but it definitely helps hold everything in place, as well as adding some support if you're in need of it.

"Bottom line is that I *love* copper mugs. A friend of mine introduced me to Moscow Mules done properly in copper mugs, and I haven't been the same since. These hammered copper mugs are not only well made, but the hammered effect make them look really classy.The mug holds 16 oz of liquid, so no problems with capaciity for your favorite cocktail. It's nickle-lined, and it takes on a nice patina after regular use and washing. It's possible to polish that out, but I like it as it makes each one even more unique. The handles are securely soldered onto the side, and I don't think that's ever coming loose. Like I mentioned at the start, I really like the hammered effect as opposed to the smooth finish. It looks great and has a nice tactile feel.I know that copper mugs do *not* keep drinks colder in reality, but it sure feels and tastes that way when I'm drinking out of one.

"Based on a friend's recommendation, I started the Graham's Resolution series by A. R. Shaw with the first volume titled The China Pandemic. It's a post-apocalyptic story of a group of people trying to survive a pandemic that has wiped out 98% of the world's population. I was thinking this would be interesting, but I didn't expect to get sucked in as much as I did by the characters and their interactions. I ended up caring for every one of the characters.The virus started as a mutated bird flu virus that got out of control in China. It rapidly spread worldwide with no vaccine or way to stop it. Only two percent of the population showed immunity to the virus, but even then they still became carriers for anyone who hadn't been exposed yet.The main character, Graham, has lost his entire family to the disease. As he's burying his father, a Korean lady who is near death brings her son to him, making him promise to take care of him. Graham has NO idea of how to raise a five year old that he doesn't know, but he doesn't see that he has much of a moral choice. His plan is to head up to his father's cabin as a refuge against predators and killers. Along the way, he picks up two teenage girls, an elderly man, and a woman around his age. This strange assortment of people have to figure out how to survive in a world that's completely foreign to them, as well as how to get along as a default family.There are a few parts of the story where things are just a little too convenient in terms of finding what's needed, or how certain conflicts arise. Still, the characters and interactions were very real and likeable. I fought off sleep for the last couple of nights as I was trying to read ""just one more chapter"", and I decided to buy volumes 2 and 3 from Amazon since my library didn't have them.

The advantage here is that the iNOVA will take SD memory cards to add an extra 32 GB. That makes the device flexible enough to load up books or videos for trips if needed. The pre-installed apps (like Google, FB, Twitter, etc) are on the light side, so you don't end up with all your memory gobbled up before you do anything.The wifi connectivity was excellent on my home network. I had no problems streaming videos over Plex without buffering. The fact that the device does not have bluetooth is a drawback, as it makes it hard to use things like external keyboards. That is probably the one thing I miss the most, as it means I also can't use external bluetooth headphones either.The iNOVA comes with a front and rear facing camera, but it's nothing to write home about.

"It's a weird sensation the first time you use it, but I like how the AccuMed AP109 Portable Electronic TENS Pulse Massager works in relieving muscle pain and discomfort. It did wonders on my stiff neck, and it's also helping a strain in my bicep area.When I think of TENS units, I think of large cases and lots of dials. This is really not much bigger than a TV remote (and just about as easy to operate). There are two electrode lines that plug into the top of the handheld unit. Each line has a Y-split for two electrode pads. The pads themselves have a sticky adhesive that holds the 1"" x 1"" electrode on the skin. Once you have the lines attached to the unit and the pads on the targeted muscle, it's time to rock and roll.There are five ""routines"" that are pre-defined for the waist, shoulder, joint, hand-leg, and sole of the foot. My preference was to use the manual controls to get the results I wanted. Each wire has a separate intensity control from Off to 10 (start low... really!), and you can speed up or slow down the pulses. You can also go with a massage, beat, or knead mode that controls how the pulses fire. Those range from a quick hit of electricity to your muscle, or a slow build and release.So how does it work? It's a bit strange when you first turn it on. Having your muscle clench involuntarily (regardless of what you do) takes a bit of getting used to. But the continued application of current to provoke muscle stimulation does a good job in getting it to loosen up and control pain. I'm not a doctor, so I can't spell out the exact reasons as to how/why it works. I only know that it does, and this unit delivers on what it says.Disclosure:Obtained From: VendorPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RUGT55JYXJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIM47PO#wasThisHelpful","R39RUGT55JYXJU","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These scrubbing cloths work much better than I expected. I normally use the plastic scrubbers, but they get scungy pretty quickly. There's not a lot of room for water flow to keep them clean. The cloths have a much wider weave, so they clean up easier after scrubbing dirty dishes.The fabric has a nice level of ""coarseness"" that cuts through messes on plates and pots, but not so rough that it will scratch glasses or china. I found that they worked well for anything I pre-scrubbed before putting things in the dishwasher.I appreciated the way these clean up in the laundry, too.

"I hate garden hoses. The ones I buy tend to dry out, kink up, and generally they're a pain to use. I got the chance to try out the Ohuhu 75' expandable garden hose, hoping for a different experience. I'm happy to say that I've been very happy with the results.The hose is exceptionally light, which made it easy to carry around (another thing I hate about regular garden hoses). I hooked it up to our faucet in the back yard, and I had no leakage from the connection between that and the hose (a rarity in my case). I liked the connector for the other end that allowed for turning the flow on and off. That made it a *lot* easier to use with a screw-on bottle of weed and feed. The hose has remained durable over multiple uses, and I ditched the other hoses we had that were too much of a hassle to roll up and store after each use.The spray nozzle that comes with the hose is also very nice, with a number of patterns ranging from a gentle mist to a full-on blast. It's funny, but it almost gets lost attention-wise since I was so focused on the value of the hose. But having the nozzle and hose combined into a single package is an excellent value.I may well end up getting another set for the front yard so that I don't have to move the hose around.Disclosure:Obtained From: VendorPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW5MBN2MRP8A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUNFR2W#wasThisHelpful","RW5MBN2MRP8A8","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK... you want to send someone a great food-based gift box? The Dulcets Gourmet Muffin Sampler Gift Basket is a really good choice. I received the box today, and we (as in the family) has enjoyed the ""fruits of my reviewing"", so to speak...The variety box is perfect in terms of an assortment of flavors. I personally went for the chocolate chip muffin, while my two sons scarfed down the banana and cranberry flavors. All of the muffins were fresh, just as if they had come out of the oven earlier in the day. The size of the muffins were a surprise, as they had some substance. Granted, they're not Costco-sized, but they're more than what you'd end up with in a regular muffin tin. Given the taste, I have no problems believing that Dulcets uses quality ingredients for their baking.Presentation was exceptional... The outer box is decorative *and* protective, so nothing was crushed or damaged. It came wrapped with ribbon, it had decorative tissue inside, and the muffins are sealed in plastic to make sure they are as fresh as possible. Again, these were very moist and fresh... and delicious!They are definitely priced at a gift-box level, and the packaging is targeted for that purpose.

"The Digital Treasures TurtleCell Retractable Headphone Case for iPhone 5/5s was something that my son got highly excited about when he saw it. He is continually trying to take my latest set of headphones because he's lost the last set I gave him. It'd be nice to have a set that remains with the phone no matter what he does.Overall, this combination works well. The two piece case installs easily on the phone, and it adds very little weight and bulk to the phone. The case is sturdy, and it provides plenty of protection to the body of the phone.The earbuds extend and retract from the top of the case. Using the side button will retract the cords when you're done using them... think of it like the retract button on a tape measure. I'd suggest holding and guiding the cords back in to prevent excessive force on the cord if you let it retract on its own.Sound-wise, these earphones are OK. I've had other earbuds and headphones that have higher quality (mostly on the bass side), but there's always the issue of remembering to carry them around. Given that these are always available because of the built-in nature, I'm willing to give up a bit of sound quality for the convenience factor. Besides, my ears aren't that great to notice much of a different for regular listening.This is a unique design that works better than I thought it would.

"This iCooker camera lens thermos travel mug is pretty cool, especially for a camera enthusiast. Aside from looking *exactly* like a coffee mug, it does a good job in keeping your hot drinks hot.The mug holds about 10 ounces of liquid, so it's a bit smaller than some of the other travel mugs I have. I do like the way it tapers, however. It does a good job in fitting solidly into cup holders in cars. The lid is a typical screw-on top with a sliding cap where the fluid comes out.The mug does a good job in retaining heat. I found that my contents were still hot after four hours, which is about the longest I would go before consuming whatever I was drinking. I found no leaking problems at all, even when I tilted the mug at a steep angle.The big draw of this mug is, of course, the fact it looks like a camera lens. On that score, it's *excellent*. Even up close, it looks like it's ready to screw into your camera. It has all the ridged rings and switches that you'd see on a normal lens. In case you're wondering, nothing moves on the outside of the cup. All the features are ornamental and fixed in place, so the person using it will not be able to play with the switches and rings. :)If all you want is a travel mug, you probably would like one that's bigger and holds more liquid.

"When I got the C3 Alize vacuum cleaner, I'll admit I was somewhat sceptical. I know that it's a highly rated machine, but using a canister vacuum instead of an upright seemed to be a step backwards. My scepticism has been removed... this works very well, and I now get the value of a canister vacuum.This works best on short carpets or wood floors (which means it also works well on ceilings). I found the suction was superior than any other vacuum I've owned, and I loved how it auto-adjusts to the surface being cleaned. I've never had a vacuum that adjusts the airflow based on what it's going over, and that's a great feature. It also was much quieter than other vacuums. The cats still don't trust it, but it wasn't quite as traumatic for them.What I liked most is the wand vs. a normal upright where you detach a hose for non-floor work. Having the longer length of the wand made it easy to go from floors to under furniture to cobwebs in the corner without having to reconfigure everything. It led to a much faster vacuuming task than what I'm used to.It's a small thing, but the retractable cord beats trying to wrap the cord around the posts on my upright. As far as bags vs. bagless... that's about the only thing I don't like about the Alize. I understand why they use bags (much cleaner), but it does add more cost over time. However, given the overall quality of the job it does, I'm OK with spending the extra money.The Alize is not a cheap vacuum, but it's one that is built to last and do an excellent job.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C7TRMMVCJ4A7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGLTA#wasThisHelpful","R3C7TRMMVCJ4A7","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nicely designed headlamp that works for a number of purposes. In fact, there's a good chance it's going to end up on my nightstand for bedtime reading.The lamp portion runs off of three AAA batteries that come included. Side note: one of the batteries has a small cardboard circle between it and the contact so that the batteries don't drain before you start to use the headlamp. Just remove the cardboard before you think that the headlight doesn't work. :) The lamp weighs very little, and I had no discomfort wearing it for longer periods of time. The adjustable elastic band (1"" wide) is also comfortable, and it's easy to make it as loose or snug as needed.In terms of light, it performs well. By pressing the orange button on the top, you cycle through a high beam, a low beam, two red beams, and a flashing red beam. The red lights sit on either side of the main white LED, and they work well as a way for people to see you if you're walking or riding in the dark.One other feature that I like about this is the ability to adjust the angle of the headlamp. It's hinged at the base and can tilt forward 45 degrees. So, if I'm lying in bed reading, I can tip the light forward so it hits the pages of the book.

"Headphones are great when you find a pair you really like. Unfortunately, the wires will end up getting tangled up on a regular basis, or there's a chance you'll pinch the wire and damage them. I was given a chance to try out a cool product called Cordskinz, and they solve both problems. I really like these...Cordskinz act like a jacket for your headphone cords. They are basically a small rubber tube with a slit the length of the tube. Using a unique splitter device included in the package, you slide the tubing over your headphone cord, trimming off any extra length that you don't need. The tubing gives the cord some structure, and it prevents the cord from wrapping around itself. It also provides a nice layer of protection, and there's much less chance of snagging (and damaging) the wire.I also found that it does a good job on charging cords, too. I like the extra layer of protection that it provides, and I'm finding that I have less damage on the plastic cord casing (due to inadvertent pinching or closing it in a drawer). The USB cable is a bit thicker than a headphone cable, but it still covers enough of the cord for protection.Cordskinz are worth the cost for your favorite set of headphones.

"I don't mind using my stationary bike for exercise, but it can be painful on the bum. I gave the Adalid Gear cycling shorts a try, and I'm very happy with the result. These are high-quality cycling shorts that keep body parts from going numb.These shorts have very nice construction. The seams lie flat, and they don't cause any irritation against my skin. The fit is perfect, in that they stay put and don't ride up or down during use. The polyester/lycra blend allows enough stretch to be comfortable but still maintain support at the same time. The most important thing (to me, at least) is the padding. These feel great, and I don't feel any pain or discomfort after putting in time on the exercise bike.I would definitely recommend these for people who spend time on the pedals, and want as much comfort as possible.Disclosure:Obtained From: VendorPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11AJH252DDMQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMUE33M#wasThisHelpful","R11AJH252DDMQU","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now that I have an iPhone 6 Plus, I need battery packs that put out more than 2800mAh if I want any useful charging options. The Brio LUX 6000mAh battery does a nice job in getting me more than just a partial recharge. This is a battery I'd keep in my travel bag.It's only 4"" long, 2"" wide, and not quite 1"" thick. The micro-USB slot for recharging the battery is located on one side, with the on/off switch on the other. It comes equipped with two charging ports located on the top of the unit, so you can charge more than one item at a time. The front of the charger has four blue LED bars to give you an idea of how much power remains in the battery. Finally, it comes with a carrying bag and a short micro-USB cable. If your device uses something different (like an Apple cord), you have to provide that yourself. I *do* like that the carrying bag is pretty large, and it would fit two cords with no problem.I charged the battery after I opened the box. It took around three hours to get all the bars lit up for a full charge. I then had two charging sessions on my iPhone 6 Plus. I went from 23% to 95% in two hours (three bars still showing lit), and then later I went from 59% to 90% in an hour (two bars still lit). Extrapolating that out, I was able to get one full charge and still have 25 - 50% of the battery remaining. I think it's a safe bet that I could get 1.5 charges out of this unit before I'd need to recharge it.This fits into my ""good daily battery"" category, in that it will stretch my iPhone to a full day of heavy use. It's light and easy to carry around... hard to beat, especially for the price.Disclosure:Obtained From: VendorPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQUPNKLM6DQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTW9SB0#wasThisHelpful","R1UQUPNKLM6DQI","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been trying out the Slicoo dual-layer cover for my iPhone 6 Plus, and it's pretty good. It has a nice tactile feel, and it provides good protection for the body of the iPhone (but not necessarily for the screen).The case actually has two parts. The hard plastic shell snaps onto the phone easily. All the openings and notches line up well. The bottom portion of the case is a little deep, and it might block cables or headphones with a thicker connector at the base of the plug.The second part of the case snaps onto the plastic portion, and that part has the rubberized feel. That gives a bit more grip than hard plastic, so it's easier to hold with a single hand.While this case gives good protection for the iPhone body, it doesn't give any protection to the glass face. The edges of the case are almost flush with the glass, so if you drop your phone on its face, the case won't be able to absorb any of the impact.Overall, this is a good general purpose case with some nice styling and a very thin profile.

"I'm pretty sure you can never have too many charging cables, and the Zeskit Lightning to USB cable just recently arrived. This is a well-made cable with the great advantage of being able to reach just about anywhere you need it to go.The cable portion feels much more solid than thinner/cheaper cables. I think this would survive the wear and tear (and occasional chair wheel rollover) better than most of the cables I use. The connectors are sturdy and blend well into the wire itself. Obviously the main advantage of this particular cable is the 10' length. I can have my device plugged into the charger and have a bit of roaming ability. If I'm in a hotel room, this length means I could easily plug it into a wall outlet and still be able to use my iPad or iPhone in bed.If you're looking for a Lightning cord connector that doesn't act like a leash to your charging unit, this is the way to go.Disclosure:Obtained From: VendorPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI7055XGQNO0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PPFD6RO#wasThisHelpful","RI7055XGQNO0X","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These non-slip/skid socks are excellent in so many ways... I almost wish all my anklet socks were these.The bottom of the socks have approximately 250 rubber dots (and a rubber infinity symbol) on the sole to help with traction. They cover the area (at least on my foot) from the base of my toes to about 2/3's of my heel. The ankle of the sock isn't just a flat cut. It's higher in the back and front, and lower on the sides, and that gives it a nice fit regardless of whether you're wearing them with shoes or by themselves.The main selling point on these are traction, and they have that covered. It doesn't matter what surface I'm on... these socks don't slip. They feel more padded than my normal socks, so they're much more comfortable.While yoga is one of the primary targets for these socks, they're good for quite a bit more. I would highly recommend them for people who have balance issues, such as elderly individuals.

" 0:28 Mins Walking/running/biking at night means you should have some way to be seen in the dark. These LED safety lights are a great way to be seen, and I love the flexibility they offer in terms of placement and use.These are very simple in design. The back consists of a clip with ridges on the inside. It opens up about an inch so you can put it on belts, straps, collars, or whatever else suits your needs. They also come with a short (4.5"") velcro strap so you can loop it inside the clip and wrap it around an object (like the seat post of a bike).The light has two modes. It can either show a steady or flashing red light that cycles through on the button pushes. It runs off two CR-2032 disk batteries which are easy enough to purchase. To change the batteries, you remove four small screws on the back with a small screwdriver (like you'd use to fix your glasses). The back pops off, you change the batteries, and you screw the back into place. It only takes a couple of minutes, so I don't see that as a negative.The thing I like most about these lights is that I can use them in a number of situations. Since they clip on, they can go from a jacket to a backpack to a dog collar in seconds. It beats having use-specific lights that are stuck fulfilling only one role.This is a perfect item to keep yourself or someone else safe at night.Disclosure:Obtained From: VendorPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MB5CZHJT6BXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSQGKVG#wasThisHelpful","R2MB5CZHJT6BXU","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like scents in my work area, and this Calily Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser works wonderfully. It's quiet, has multiple settings, and fills my office with great essential oil scents.The diffuser is 6"" tall, and fits nicely on the corner of my desk. The plastic outer cover twists off the locking base, revealing the inner workings. You add a cup of water (comes with a measuring cup that properly fills the reservoir), add a few drops of whatever oil you want, and then lock the outer cover back onto the base. Plug it in, and you're ready to go.Holding the mist button down for two seconds starts a low level mist that carries the scent. You can then click through levels 2, 3, and 4 to vary the amount of mist that comes out. I ran it at level 1 and got more than four hours of operation before it automatically shut off for low water level.In addition to the mist, it also has a few lighting options. Holding the light button down for two seconds starts the first setting, which is a slow fade and blend of one color to another, across the spectrum of available colors. Clicking the button after that offers solid color settings of red, blue, green, purple, teal, yellow, and light blue. This can be either a nice addition to the scents, or a stand-alone night light... either one works well.This is a great diffuser, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to get into aromatherapy... or just likes the fresh scent of citrus as they work.Disclosure:Obtained From: VendorPayment: Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZH7NCI69K3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEB07W2#wasThisHelpful","R6ZH7NCI69K3B","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently finished Johnny McCarthy: A Coal Miner's Son by Dwight Norris, and it's a good story set in a very depressing time and place, one that America has largely ignored and forgotten. The book was hard to put down, as it was a compelling drama with the main character trying to decide between doing what was necessary to survive and doing what was right for the greater good.Johnny McCarthy is a coal miner, one who comes from a long line of miners in his family. He lives in a coal mining town in West Virginia with his wife and son, and their existence is very much hand-to-mouth. Miners are treated as slave laborers by the mining companies, and if they're injured or unable to work, they're tossed aside so that another healthy body can come in and keep up the production.Much of the turmoil in the story relates to the beginning of unionization of the coal minors in the 1920's. McCarthy lives by his father's motto, which is not to bite the hand that feeds you. But he has a hard time reconciling the human abuse and minimal wages against the profits of the mining companies. All he really wants is to provide a living for his family and do his job. However, everyone in his life seems to have an agenda that's less than honorable, and each agenda comes with major risks if wrong choices are made.I know the life of a coal miner is hard, and it was horrific in the early days of American history. Norris has researched his topic well, and creates a set of realistic characters that quickly immerse you in the life that they live.

"My wife tried out the Ekouaer women's shapewear high waist boyshorts shaper brief, and she was impressed by the fit and wearability. It has boning to control the shaping, and she was expecting more of a ""corset"" style feel. But in actuality, it was comfortable to wear, and provided a great deal of support.

"Another six months have passed, so it's time for a new In Death novel by J. D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts). This time it's Obsession in Death, and Eve Dallas has to match wits with someone who is obsessed (hence the title) with her, and wants to be her friend who can dispense justice when and where Eve cannot. As you can imagine, that's really not who Eve is and how she works.As with most of the In Death novels, Obsession starts out with Dallas and Peabody catching a homicide shortly before New Years Eve. This wouldn't be an unusual occurrence except for the fact that it was a high-powered defense attorney (that Dallas had gone head-to-head with in the past), and the killer left Eve a personal message on the wall at the scene. The killer tells Eve that they want to be her personal friend, and that they will make sure that those who disrespect her will pay for it in blood.Dallas has to walk a fine line, because the mind of the killer can turn in an instant. If Eve won't be their friend, then perhaps she needs to be taught a lesson in loyalty and respect. Unfortunately, that makes all of Eve's close friends potential targets, and the possibility that they could be in harm's way is making her desperate to catch the killer in any way possible.For some reason I can't quite determine, Obsession started out a bit slow for me. I was wondering if this was going to be a rare case of me not completely enjoying an In Death novel. But once the mind games started between Eve and the killer, I was... obsessed (sorry, had to go there). As usual, I hated when it was over... but I know that six months from now, I'll get my next fix. :)Disclosure:Obtained From: LibraryPayment: Borrowed","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DGDPDRRBKS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170871#wasThisHelpful","R25DGDPDRRBKS5","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After all the Tim Dorsey books I've read, I still have yet to come up with a good way to summarize or explain a Serge Storms novel. I love them, but I can't explain them... at least in any way that would make sense to someone who hasn't read one. Shark Skin Suite follows that same pattern. I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I shook my head, I wondered what Dorsey must be like in real life. :)As with all Storms novels, this takes place in Southern Florida, where the weird and bizarre is just normal life. Serge's latest obsession is to become a lawyer, and the lack of a law degree makes no difference. He figures he can work most effectively as a ""fixer"", doing the dirty work that skirts the boundaries of the law. No, actually... his form of ""fixing"" is WAY on the other side of the law. He and his sidekick Coleman (perpetually drunk and/or stoned) get involved in a class action mortgage fraud suit, digging out evidence (or making it up if needed), and tracking down all the movie trivia related to legal movies filmed in Florida. And as per normal with Storms, a few bad guys end up dying in very unique and creative ways.Dorsey takes the normal lunacy that is stereotypical Florida and amps it up by a factor of 10. As his lead character is throwing out trivia left and right (which is part of the appeal of these novels), he manages to drop in real-life ""can you believe"" incidents that makes you wonder just how far-fetched this might be in reality. I love the fact that you can *never* tell where the story is going next, because anything (really!) is possible. For example, what was the last book you read where a life-or-death showdown was interrupted when it started to rain fish? Waterspouts and Key West... it works.This was a fun read with a lot of entertainment per page. I can't wait for the next one.Disclosure:Obtained From: LibraryPayment: Borrowed","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GY4GEZ7HVIT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062240013#wasThisHelpful","R1GY4GEZ7HVIT8","A3R19YKNL641X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R19YKNL641X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for a great price. I already have a Vizio M Series 4K TV - so was able to directly compare the two. First off - the most important aspect - picture quality - the Sharp - at least the one I got - is way behind the Vizio. I ran them side by side and after adjustments of every type - the picture on the Vizio was always better. Especially in upscaling - the Sharp upscaling is mediocre to non existent. On 4K content from Netflix and Amazon - the Visio had a noticeably better amount of tiny detail. Sound is about equal on both. The ""smart"" interface on this Sharp is pretty pitiful. No Amazon at all - but most other popular stuff like Netflix is there. But unlike the Vizio - you cannot make any adjustments to picture or sound in the apps without exiting them - no fooling. Want to up the brightness - well you have to exit Netflix to do so. The interface on the Vizio is XLNT - on the Sharp it is maddening. Others have mentioned this JOKE of a remote with the Sharp, and it is, by far, the worst remote I have ever used.

"So many leather products look great in pictures - then you open the box and say ""What is this crappy thing?"" Well, this beautiful piece lives up to the pictures and more. This is one quality piece, from the supple leather to the stitching and the reinforcing belts on the side. I have a few Piel leather bags and this is even nicer. It is not a backpack in size at all and I usually use the shoulder strap. But it is a stunner - you WILL get compliments - and the back pack straps are sure handy when you need to carry it a long way. With all the gizmos and crap we carry these days - I find this bag perfect and use it daily. I know quality leather and this is a rarity in stuff. I am an elder who has been buying leather all my life. I have stuff in  my closet from Wilson's House of Leather that is 30 years old. The quality of those jackets is way beyond what you find in Wilson's these days.

"WOW! This phone is sweet - and I have owned an LG G3. Feels great in my large hand, the screen is wonderful. It is actually more colorful than the LG G3 screen. It's not as accurate but more saturated - more like a Samsung screen. Battery life is unreal because the cool running processor combined with the huge battery (3200) means I am at 90% power half way through the day! But sadly I am returning it. This phone is a victim of a stupid design decision. LG made this in only an 8GB version, and it will cause you misery in a short time of ownership because of that. This is crazy to ruin such a great phone - really. By the time Verizon loads all their apps, and the operating system and apps update, your are almost out of memory.  I set mine up with only a few necessary apps - I don't do games - and there is only a puny 1.25 GB remaining. Worse, that was after I removed all the apps Verizon would allow and moving every possible app to the 64 GB memory card I installed. It still runs fine today - but that 1.25 gig will get chewed up a bit more every day with app updates and OS updates and soon - it will run like a slug as it loses more working memory. LG I hope you are reading because with 16 GB this would have been the PERFECT large screen phone for anyone but a gamer. I find the slower processor to be an advantage in many ways, the phone never gets hot and the battery lasts 2 days. But sadly, the 8 GB sticks you in a bad situation that will only get worse. Makes me sad, really.

"I own many waist packs (Mr. Unstylish) and love them. I have severe neck and shoulder pain and tend to carry a lot of things, so I have standardized on waist packs. This is my favorite, as far as looks and style. It is very beautiful leather - but it is not fully lined - some sides are bare leather (see my photos.) - UPDATE - ordered a second one and it IS fully lined - but there is no leather between the front and middle compartment like in my pic - so they make these 2 ways - I prefer the leather divider.  I put up a side view so you can see how it tapers at the bottom - it is nice and deep - but the main pocket gets narrow and the back and main pocket share the same space. I ordered the ""saddle"" color and must mention that it is both darker and redder than the pics. It is still beautiful - but if you are expecting that exact shade - or hate reddish - you won't like it. The strap in the pic is adjusted to my 42 inch waist - so this should fit almost anyone.

"I bought the Sunhike version of this pack which is identical and wish someone jhad pointed this out to me. Roomy but very top-heavy - I own many waist packs (Mr. Unstylish here) and I love them. Hate having stuff on my shoulder as I have had extreme neck and shoulder pain for 30 years now. I really liked the looks of this and it is well built, especially considering the price. Not an Eagle Creek in quality, but not priced like one either. My disappointment came when I used it. Most waist packs locate the belt as high as possible towards the top. This is necessary to everything ""hangs"" from the belt. Look at this pack and you will notice the belt is halfway down. Poor design choice. This means everything inside that is located equal to or higher then the belt will hang down and outward, making for a very unsightly appearance compared to all others I own.

"I have everything from expensive hard anodized Caphalon to super expensive try ply stainless cookware. Guess what I use 90% of the time? Lodge cast iron. Once you get used to cooking with the the even heat coming not only from the pan bottom - but the sides (and handle - ouch) - it is hard to go back to the so called ""superior"" modern cookware. Tri Ply ties to do what cast iron does - but doesn't have the heft to duplicate. As far as seasoning - just don't use soaps - let it cool completely before wiping down and re oiling - and NEVER put food in a cold cast iron pan. Always pre heat.

"Loved the Macro function - but hated the slow and loud focusing and the soft images at over 200 mm. It really isn't that sharp of a telephoto in my opinion, even tripod mounted. I may buy a used one on eBay some day just for the macro function, which is excellent. So I purchased the Nikon 55-300 f/4.5-5.6G ED VR AFS and LOVE it. The Nikon is more expensive but you can see the difference. It is very sharp through the entire zoom range and has fast, near silent focusing.

"In general I have had poor luck with digital ballasts that I bought several years ago when they were new on the market. Back then it seemed like if you looked at them wrong, they broke. So I went back to reliable magnetic ballasts. But the increased PAR light (10 - 20%) and better efficiency reported in tests after test of magnetic versus digital led me back. Boy it seems the technology has improved tremendously. These run VERY cool compared to magnetic and the bulbs start (and restart) almost instantly. As far as longevity, if one breaks I will update the review but they seem rock solid. The manufacturer has a good reputation for backing up their product, I checked them out before buying. And after looking at over 10 different brands of digital ballasts - it sure looks like the ones $100 more in price come from the same factory.

"This movie is scary almost beyond comprehension. There are many reasons it works so well on every level. From mood of dread created by the insane hitchhiker they pick up in the first scenes who explains how ""head cheese"" is made to the various ""animal rooms"" that are discovered in the house. I believe one thing that makes this movie work so well is that it almost plays as an analogy. We see how animals are dispatched for food. In this movie, the audience is put in the same position an animal is put into prior to slaughter. This ancient movie is proof positive that digital special effects do not a scary movie make. Carefully directed excruciating tension is what is scary - and this great movie has it in spades.

"Unbelievable at the price point. I owned a Blendtec - and like this even better. Just as strong - smoothies just as smooth. Folks describe this as loud - not compared to a Blendtec it isn't. Blendtec is so LOUD I would have to leave the room. The other reviews cover most all the good points so I will add a few. The unit comes with a card - follow the link on that card and register and they double the warranty to 2 years! Even better - at the site replacement pitchers are only $30! After paying $100 for a Blendtec replacement - that is a huge change. I am gonna buy an extra for soups with onions and garlic etc - keep one for green drinks and smoothies. This pitcher is built like a tank - I am blown away by the heavy duty gears and bearing on the bottom. BTW: Many complain about the plastic containers on all these high end units. They MUST be plastic for safety reasons. When you are pushing 30,000 RPM - glass would be dangerous and that is why they ALL use plastic. Example from my real life. This morning I made a green drink with all raw vegies from my garden. For dinner I am eating some delicious steaming hot potato and cashew soup.

"I bought this based on so many great reviews and my Sable was listed as fully compatible. It arrived without instructions but they were easy to find online. Problem #1 is that on the Sable you cannot attach the bottom straps in the preferred location as there is nothing down there to attach them to. So they offer ""alternative #2"" in the instructions which is to double the lower straps over the top rack and then attach them to the bottom trunk lip. It worked but did not inspire confidence. I rechecked and had done it exactly like the instructions said, but added 2 bungees to keep the bike more stable.  I only put one 38 pound bike on the rack (no way could I see it holding 3 without damaging a car) and drove a total of 20 miles with my eye nervously on the rear view mirror the whole way. It shook and wiggled and rocked and rolled the whole way so I kept my speed under 55. Once I reached my destination I put this flimsy thing away. Put my bike in the trunk on the way back as the entire trip in I had no confidence the bike would stay in place....","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG1UP5PB0XJ33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ELQNYM#wasThisHelpful","RG1UP5PB0XJ33","A1IXJK1NYTSMJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IXJK1NYTSMJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maybe mine is defective but from reading reviews it seems not. Many reviews mention having to soak the pan afterwards to get off the burnt rice. This is the worst rice cooker I have ever encountered. Burnt rice sticks to the pan on every batch and I have tried many different water to rice ratios, as well as spraying the pan with oil. I can cook rice 100% better on the stovetop with no stuck rice on the bottom. HERE IS WHY THIS FAILS AT RICE COOKING... This thing cooks like if you set your burner on high setting through the whole rice cooking process. If you were crazy enough to try and cook rice that way, you would splatter stuff everywhere (this does) and have a big layer of burnt rice stuck to the bottom (this does that as well)  It cooks on extreme high heat the entire cycle and boils the water off like crazy, sticky rice water can end up all over your counter. You should not have to soak a rice cooker for an hour to be able to clean it - and with this you do.

I am familiar with using both Blendtec and Vita-Mix and while this isn't ""quite"" as good at green drinks, it is 90% there at 10% of the cost. And SO much quieter than my Blendtec, which sounds like hell's own noise when it is on.. Personally I prefer glass containers to the plastic Blendtec and Vita-Mix containers and this one is very nice, thick glass. I use the Frozen Drinks button all the time as the reversing of the gears and spin will almost always pull the frozen fruits down for a smooth drink.

"This is my 5th Invicta and I have been well aware of their quality control issues but never had any problems with their less expensive watches. So I fall in love with this design and Amazon offers it at an unbeatable price so I bite. It arrives today in a major nice presentation box and completely wrapped in plastic. (See pictures) So I admire it through the plastic for a while and pull out my trusty magnifier. Looking at the face my eyes pop out of my head!  OMG - what is THAT!!!! One of the small windows that covers one of the chronograph windows was loose in the watch! It was jammed under one of the tiny chronograph dial hands. A complete disaster. Take a look at the pics I posted - you will not believe your eyes. I thought at a $2000 list price it would be impeccable - no way.

But she is a real beauty. Fit and finish are XLNT and face is stunning. The band is very thick as well, but not quite as long as the bands on my other Invictas.

"I bought this on a ""Lighting Deal"" for a about half the normal price and really was impressed. If I had paid over $100 I would not have been. Armitron is known for cheap watches and this is near their very top of the line. It shows. It is very impressive, especially the stopwatch function. Face is beautiful, but not really easy to read - it could use more contrast in the hour and minute hands. It reminds me of a Victorionox ""Swiss Army""watch in look and feel. Nice heft and feels very solid - not like a ""show"" divers watch but one that you could actually take diving. I have taken $20 Armitrons swimming many times and never had one leak. Armitron has an excellent service record - no complaints filed with the BBB in 3 years last I checked. Compared to hundreds of complaints filed against some watch companies. One disappointment is that the bezel does not rotate, which in this price range is unusual. I would have kept it but unlike most watches that come with metal bands - it was too short for my large wrist. My wrist measures 8.5 inches. Most metal band watches fit me fine. Some I have to remove links from. Without extra links it would have been impossible for me to wear this Armitron and they supplied none.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OMP54OJ67BKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PKXFIE#wasThisHelpful","R1OMP54OJ67BKU","A1IXJK1NYTSMJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IXJK1NYTSMJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This remote seems to be getting a lot of hate and after pairing it with my PS4 and getting some time to setup and operate the remote it gets a middle-of-the-road score from me. A lot of complaints surrounding this remote are totally valid but I still found the remote to be fairly decent and it does have some redeeming qualities.►The Bad:(-) Overall I don't particularly like the form factor of the remote. It's much smaller than the PS3 BT remote control that came before it and as a result many of the buttons are tiny. In particular the PS4 face buttons are tiny and poorly positioned making them difficult to use.(-) For a remote with such small keys you'd think there would be a backlighting feature. But no such luck. Finding extra small keys in a darkened room while watching a movie sucks.(-) The remote is missing buttons you'd expect to have. None of the shoulder buttons (L1, R1, etc) get a button.(-) Much like the PS3 BT remote if PS4 is the selected device on this remote any button acts like a power button and turns on the PS4.(-) Batteries (2x AAA) are not included.►The Good:(+) I do like the button click when a button is pressed. It's much more tactile than on the PS3 BT remote.(+) Volume Punch-through is very easy to setup and controls the volume on the TV (a Panasonic plasma in my case) even when another device is selected (e.g. PS4).(+) Setting up the universal control features was pretty easy - either by manually inputting remote codes or using the learning feature (covered in the included instructions).--------------------UPDATE 11/17/2015:--------------------I've had the chance to use the PS4 Universal Remote more and more with my PS4, mainly using Netflix and Amazon VOD, and now I'm understanding the hate this remote gets. So two major issues have cropped up and unless there's a dramatic turnaround I'm probably going to scrap this remote altogether. Also, changing my review from 3 to 1-star.Issue #1: BT Connectivity -After initially working without issues my remote now seemingly cannot stay paired. The remote seems to enter rest-mode but has trouble waking. I end up having to push random buttons in the hopes of finally getting the remote to wake and work.Issue #2: Battery Drain -I'm on my second pair of brand new AAA batteries. The last pair of fresh batteries was put in the remote and less than 24-hrs later the remote (through the PS4) reported that it was low on battery power.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3525TELRGSEUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJRHSZO#wasThisHelpful","R3525TELRGSEUG","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 2.5 year old son is in the midst of an infatuation with toy cars, trucks and airplanes and loves to take any opportunity to play with his ""cool cars"" just about anywhere. Lately we've taken to making big road systems out of large thick construction paper that my wife and I draw roads, bridges, railroad tracks and other landscapes for him to zip his cars along. This Melissa & Doug Round the City Rug is perfect for my little guy!►Description:The rug is about 4' x 4' x 40"" so big enough to fit a lot of cars (mostly Hot Wheels) but not so big that rolling it up and transporting it is a huge hassle. The rug is colorful and features some cool city center type scenery including a firehouse, hospital, parking lot and a large roundabout. The rug surprised both my wife and I and seems very well built considering the price.The back of the rug features a non-slip pad although I'm not sure of the material. We tested the rug on our hardwood floors and confirmed it stays put. The edging material is woven into the rug to prevent fraying - nice touch!Also included with the rug are four wooden, painted toys - firetruck, police car, ambulance, and helicopter. Each has it's corresponding place to fit on the rug.Overall I'm extremely pleased with this rug. My son loves it and used it immediately out of the box and insisted on parking his cars on it before bedtime. Most definitely recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIWR59O7MJ46X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012508I0Q#wasThisHelpful","RIWR59O7MJ46X","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I've refrained from using car smartphone mounts because I've always thought they were too bulky (clamp style mounts) or looked hideous (suction cup style mounts). This little magnetic smartphone holder works wonderfully and best of all once your phone is mounted it disappears entirely!There are two simple components - the vent mount that features strong plastic grips that slide over your car's AC vents. This component also contains strong magnets that form a strong bond with the metal plat that goes in the back of your smartphone's case or the back of the smartphone itself. Get in your car and simply stick your smartphone near the magnet and that's it!I tested this mount with my Samsung Galaxy S4 using the larger rectangular mount directly on the inside back of my phone's back cover. Unfortunately my phone case is a bit too thick and doesn't allow the magnets to form a strong enough bond to prevent the phone from falling under its own weight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NRP2RTS8LHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU3W43G#wasThisHelpful","R30NRP2RTS8LHK","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those items that I received from Vine that looked so cool on the product page and description but then really failed to impress in person. For the current list price I expected a decently well made clock and mini-weather station setup. I got that in a way but this product just doesn't live up to its price. And to be honest I expected a bit more from the name Frigidaire.If the novelty of having an atomic-clock set desktop clock with some limited weather information appeals to you and getting the time and weather from your phone just isn't cutting it then you may consider this product. But you should be aware that this is an all plastic device. Even the little wireless outdoor sensor is all plastic and flimsy and isn't in any way ruggedized against water as far as I can tell. It might survive just fine if you can find an outdoor spot that doesn't get much exposure to the elements. But even then condensation is going to wreck the sensor sooner than later.The main display is just okay. It definitely photographs really well and looks awesome (even for cheap plastic) until you peel the protective sticker off the screen and discover that the screen is a massive fingerprint magnet.But there is one bit of good news - the atomic clock (WWVB) pairing works! So there's that.►The Bad:(-) Cheap, cheap, cheap. Don't let the name on the device fool you; this is a cheap plastic device. The little kickstand nub that holds the clock upright really had me laughing at the overall lack of any type of quality.(-) No batteries included. For the list price have the decency to throw in a pair of AAA batteries (outdoor sensor) and a CR2032 (battery backup for the desktop clock). Ridiculous.(-) Fingerprints galore. The cool mirrored chrome finish looks good right up until you remove the plastic wrap.(-) Weather information is limited to very simplistic information thanks to the fact that it's conveyed via static LCD icons. Is it cloudy or partly cloudy? Well I guess I'll find out when I step outside! Why is the sun backlit at 9:26 PM in early November?►The Good:Not much here but I did get the atomic clock pairing to work. So I know what time it is. I could've just looked at any of the dozen or so other devices that also display the time in my home but atomic clock.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YMNK5D3ARCN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016S6J794#wasThisHelpful","R1YMNK5D3ARCN7","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I'm a pretty hairy guy but the main user of Panasonic's ES-ED50-N Multi-Function Epilator/Shaver in my household is my wife. I did take a crack passing the epilator over a small portion of my leg and confirmed that pulling multiple hairs out by the roots at one time does in fact hurt as much as is sounds.--------------------PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:--------------------I'll make the assumption that anyone reading reviews on this product knows what they're shopping for. My wife is a frequent visitor to a local esthetician and chooses of her own free will to wax her legs and... uh, down there. When I asked if she'd be interested in testing this epilator she immediately said yes (and so did I imagining all the money we'd save).This particular epilator uses a surprisingly and somewhat disconcertingly fast rotating head of 48-tweezers to pluck hairs by roots. The head pivots to move more easily over contours of the body plucking hairs faster than you can flinch. The great thing about this epilator (so I'm told) is that you can use it in conjunction with shower gel/foam to lessen the pain. Trust me dry epilation is not for the weak willed. The head is fully submersible for fast and easy cleaning.Charging the epilator takes about 1-hour and results in about 30-40 minutes of use.--------------------WIFE'S IMPRESSIONS:--------------------My wife is infinitely more pain resilient than I am and that proved to be the case with this epilator. While I flinched and wanted to stop immediately she's used this little device for almost an entire month and loves it. She does continue to use her esthetician for certain areas but her legs are now the territory of the Panasonic epilator.Also she highly recommends reading the instruction manual which does go into a lot of detail about what areas of the body are best suited for epilation, shaving, etc. And which areas you'll risk injury if you use the wrong attachment/head.--------------------IN THE BOX:--------------------1) ES-ED50-N Epilator/Shaver2) Epilation head (legs & arms)3) Gentle Cap4) Shaver Head5) Bikini Comb6) AC-adapter/Charger7) White cloth storage bag8) Instructions","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29B5MEWPU7V0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTD2CNG#wasThisHelpful","R29B5MEWPU7V0P","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.My wife has been the primary user of this bottle although we do often share use of this bottle on walks with our kids. All told we're both extremely happy with this infuser-type water bottle.

Best of all you can refill the water and use the same cucumber for an entire day for an all-day long refreshing way to hydrate.The bottle itself is a glass outer and the infuser is made from clear plastic.

"I'm going to approach this review a little different than the standard one-time rating and update this review as I get more experience with the Pivotal Living Band. So this first entry is based on my initial unboxing, setup and use of the Band. More reviews and potential updates to my rating to follow. Also the primary user of this device is my wife although I was present for each step described below.--------------------FIRST IMPRESSION:--------------------So not knowing too much about this device I initially categorized it as a more affordable Fitbit and I think that's pretty much a fair assessment of what Pivotal Living is trying to accomplish - with mixed results. The initial setup process is a bumpy road and I'll state right off the bat that this product (and the accompanying app) could use some more time in the incubator to iron out the kinks.'Setup Issues:You definitely want to very closely follow the instructions on the flap of the box. I looked over the instructions but glazed over the part where the instructions cover Bluetooth pairing. I approached this device like any other BT device and tried to pair it through my phone's (Android) BT menu. Wrong move that lead to unneeded frustration. You need to pair the Band through the Pivotal Living App that can be downloaded via the Play and iTunes stores. I can't hold the device at fault for my inability to follow instructions.'App Issues:The Pivotal Living App is really the central hub of the Band. It allows you to sync your Band and move data from the Band's memory (up to 3 days of data) to your smartphone/device and see a graphical representation of your activity and any goals you may setup (e.g. weight loss goals). You'll have to create an account in the app first. The account creation is pretty straightforward but the app has issues. On my wife's S4 she completed the account creation process and then launched the app. She was prompted for her (newly created) password and when she hit 'Login' nothing happened. This occurred repeatedly and she even reset her password to no avail. Ultimately rebooting her phone and trying the app again proved to fix the issue. This isn't a huge issue but something I'd classify as general lack of polish to the end-user experience.' More App Issues:The next problem my wife encountered was simply entering her physiological data - height and weight. On the app these inputs are sliders; drag the slider right or left to increase and decrease the value. The sliders are extremely inaccurate and frustrating to use. I really have to wonder if anyone at Pivotal has tried using the sliders as and end-user...? Nightmare. On the initial setup the height slider jumps from 4'6"" to 5'7"". My wife at 5""4"" settled on 5'7"". I was able to later go into the app and adjust the height more accurately via the 'edit profile' menu. Inexplicably the sliders work better in the edit menu than on the initial setup. But getting the value just right is unnecessarily frustrating. Just allow people to enter values and avoid the sliders altogether. Again, just a general lack of polish.--------------------WHAT IT DOES:--------------------For the uninitiated the Pivotal Band essentially is a little computer that tracks physical activity levels and paired with the app the user can set daily activity goals and be reminded via the Band. The band tracks: steps, total distance covered, calories, % of target goal, sleep, and has a stopwatch feature.Some of the features are a bit hokey. For example to track sleep you have to physically (by interacting with the Band via a button) tell the device that you're going to sleep and then remember to wake the device in the morning. There's no miracle of science and technology here. But having a small portable computer that tracks certain metrics and then represents that onscreen is pretty cool and a valuable tool.'Missing Features:I really expected this device to have a heart rate monitor and think that Pivotal missed a huge opportunity not including that feature. I realize that the price point is considerably lower than devices that include the feature but it is sorely missed.--------------------WHAT'S IN THE BOX:--------------------1) Pivotal Band2) Charger (USB based) must be paired with a USB AC adapter you already own (e.g. smartphone)3) Instructions--------------------CLOSING 10/27/2015:--------------------My initial impression of the Pivotal is a mixed bag. The price point is nice but I definitely feel like I'm using a poor man's Fitbit. The app in particular lacks polish and refinement and leads to a frustrating experience and a terrible first impression. Going with a middle-of-the-road 3-star rating for now. More to come.--------------------UPDATE 11/5/2015:--------------------I changed my rating from 3-stars to 2-stars, here's why.After a bit over a week wearing the Pivotal Band my wife has officially told me to stuff it and that the device isn't worth the trouble. This is after I essentially acted as her 24/7 tech support (which I am anyway) and encouraged her to keep using the band even with her frustration with it.The main issue here is really just a continuation of my initial complaints. Entering basic data (e.g. water intake) into the app sucks. Even when she did enter data into the app directly syncing the band to her smartphone continued to be problematic. The most common error reported through the app was something along the lines of ""no compatible band can be found."" The syncing issue would essentially mean my wife would either have to remember data or write down her metrics to input into the app later with hopefully better results.Again, Pivotal is coming in at the bargain basement price compared to the major players in the activity tracker segment. I strongly believe that this product isn't quite ready and needs further development.At this point I cannot recommend the Pivotal Living Band.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7PNGM5WQWEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015121DP2#wasThisHelpful","R1T7PNGM5WQWEZ","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.Probably like most people I've never heard of the ""iLuv"" brand but after trying out the ""Collision"" Portable BT Speaker I'm sold! So I've had this little speaker for about a month and have ported it from my backyard patio, to my garage, and it's been playing my favorite Spotify playlists wonderfully on just about every home improvement project I have worked on in that month.►Sound Quality:Probably the most important aspect of any speaker; the Collision doesn't disappoint. I mean I'm no audiophile and I don't expect super high-fidelity sound form such a small and battery operated speaker but the sound pumping from the Collision is impressive. This little speaker delivers better sound than I expected and better sound than many other BT speakers I own that are more than double the price.►Build:The entire speaker is ruggedized with a thick coat of black silicone. This serves to protect the speaker from the elements and also inadvertent spills. I really like how this speaker was built and even the silicone-coated buttons are well thought out and offer a satisfying tactile ""click"" when pressed. Another thick silicone flap seals inputs like the 3.5mm auxiliary port and mini-USB charging port.►Battery:Battery life is pretty good. I don't think I'm getting a solid 8-hour playback time on a single charge but it's pretty close - maybe 5hrs of continuous use.►Setup:Getting your music to the Collision is easy; either through an auxiliary cable (3.5mm jack) or Bluetooth. If you've set up a BT device before you know the routine. Press and hold the power button until a blue LED on the Collision starts flashing; search for BT devices on your smartphone/tablet/device and finish the pairing process.►The Good:(+) Sound quality.(+) Overall rugged build.(+) Battery►The Bad:(-) The rugged outer shell, which I think is made from silicone, tends to attract dust and hair.

"I've been using Logitech's K380 in my home for about two weeks and in that time I've really grown to like this keyboard. In a nutshell this is a portable keyboard made to work with a huge range of devices in your home. Ideally you'd be able to cut the cord (USB that is) and use the K380 to replace several different older, wired keyboards.►Compatibility:Compatible devices/OS' include Windows (tested on Win 7 & 10), Mac, Chrome OS, Android, & iOS. I tested the K380 on everything except a Mac and can report that the keyboard is super easy to pair and includes an incredibly easy way to pair multiple devices and switch from one to the other  just about instantly.My main reason for using this keyboard is pure, unadulterated laziness which for me means being able to switch from typing on my PlayStation 4 to my Asus Chromebook. With the K380 that's as simple as pressing button. On the K380 the first three function keys store and serve as the mechanism for switching between paired devices quickly.►Keys & General Usage Notes:The tactility of the keys isn't great but I didn't really expect too much from such a compact and lightweight keyboard. I'm also on the fence about the rounded keys; I make more mistakes typing with this keyboard than any other keyboard I own and I think a fair blame lies with the keys rounded shape. The key shape is really the only gripe I have about this keyboard.That said once you do get more accustomed to the layout and rounded keys using the K380 is a cinch and the ability to switch quickly between devices shouldn't be understated.►In the Box:- K380 keyboard- (2) AAA batteries- Instruction manual","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTUJ67BEOKFJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148NPH9I#wasThisHelpful","RTUJ67BEOKFJA","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.Simply put this is one of the easiest and best thought out wine bottle openers I've ever used. If you want to look like a pro opening a bottle of wine in front of friends or family or just want an easier way to open your bottles of wine this is the corkscrew to purchase!First time using this opener my wife tested it out and she loved it! You simply use the included foil cutter to cut and remove the foil; position the corkscrew over the neck of the bottle with the arm extended all the way forward (away from the operator) and then gently and smoothly pull the handle back toward you. The corkscrew handles the rest and twists the screw into the cork without any additional operation from the user. You then simply remove the entire corkscrew and cork together and enjoy your wine!Build quality seems really good although I've only had the chance to use this corkscrew on two bottles of wine so far. The corkscrew is heavy if that's any consideration and rather large. So probably not something appropriate for all situations.Very pleased.

"I'm not the quintessential ""watch-guy"" but have put together a nice little collection of pieces that I like over the years. There's something distinctly appealing to me about wearing a watch even in the age of the smartphone and connected devices. That said my most expensive watch is distinctly not that pricey - a Citizen Skyhawk AT but I love the piece and all of its quirky features.So my review of this Lucien Piccard piece started with some digging for background information on the company. From what I can find the parent company behind Lucien Piccard is the same company that owns Invicta and Stuhrling/Akribos - SWI Group. If you're a watch person or have previous dealings with this company you likely have strong feelings one way or the other. I've met folks in both camps - some that love Invicta, Stuhrling, Akribos watches and folks that think they're garbage. I've never owned a watch made by SWI aside from this Piccard piece.►Aesthetics:On looks alone this is an attractive piece. The 46mm case diameter means you're getting a large watch face - not massive like some other almost ridiculously sized Invicta watches I've seen - but large enough to be noticed. The tanned black leather strap looks great and feels like the genuine article. The leather is stamped to resemble crocodile skin.On the watch face you're getting a ""skeletonized"" window at the 9:00 position which simply means the mechanical components of the watch are exposed. One the reverse the a large skeletonized window exposes more of the the watch mechanics.►Materials:Overall I'm pretty happy with the materials used on this watch. Genuine leather calfskin for the band, 316L stainless steel for the bezel and case, and synthetic sapphire crystal for the case window (the face of the watch). The synthetic sapphire is particularly important as it should resist scratches more than other materials like mineral crystal.I'm also a big fan of the quick-release or ""deployant-buckle"" clasp on this watch. It allows you to set the size of the band once and then simply release a clasp to extend the band to slip it on and off. This ends up saving wear and tear on the leather strap and makes the watch easier to take on and off.►Movement:This is the big ""a-ha"" for a lot of folks. The movement is Chinese and advertised as such. I really do appreciate that this is clearly advertised on the product page, if not on the watch itself. This is my first Chinese movement watch and only time will really tell if it can measure up to the likes of Swiss of Japanese movement.The watch itself is mechanical hand-wind which means that the watch must be wound by the owner periodically to keep time. Setting the watch time and date is incredibly easy (especially compared to my Skyhawk AT).►Closing:I do plan on updating this review as my time with the watch grows. For now this is my daily M-F watch so I should have some good idea of the lasting quality as the months wear on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33958215SRAI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QYCJUA#wasThisHelpful","R33958215SRAI3","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Stanley Classic Growler is the post-apocalyptic solution to your beverage needs... meaning this thing is built tough! This growler is large, relatively heavy for its size, and uncompromising. But despite those characteristics it excels at keeping hot beverages hot and cold beverages cold!I haven't had the chance to test this growler in extremes but did get the chance to test this out at a local municipal park that was sponsoring an overnight camp for kids. So my son and I pitched up camp and enjoyed hot cocoa on our camping adventure well into the night. The next morning as we were preparing for breakfast the cocoa was still warm! Pretty impressive even if the overnight temps only got into the mid-60s.This November I have a hunting trip in Wyoming that will definitely feature some extreme low temperatures and I plan on having this Stanley Growler right there with me with hot coffee to warm me weary bones.High marks to this growler for doing exactly what it's supposed to do. I did deduct a star because the cumbersome size and fixed position handle mean this growler takes up a lot of room in a pack.

"It's been a few years since I purchased my last HDTV, a Panasonic plasma at that, so I was really curious to test this set out for a couple reasons. First, Polaroid and televisions... who knew (certainly not me)? Second, the price for HDTVs has absolutely bottomed out and I was really curious how this stacked up against my 46"" Sharp Aquos set that I bought back in 2008 (for many multiple thousands of dollars).--------------------PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:--------------------The 40GSR3000FM is Polaroid's ""Full-HD"" (FHD) aka 1080p LED-LCD television. The set is on the cheaper side compared to better known models out there including Sony and Samsung. Right off the bat I'll state that if you're first concern is maximum picture quality you're looking at the wrong television. This set strives to offer a ""good"" picture quality (at 1080p) but isn't going to light the world on fire with cutting edge display technology. You're getting an entry level set.►Setup:This HDTV comes with a glass stand base that has to be assembled. This consists of mounting a plastic component that bolts the glass base to the television using three different sized screws. There are extra screws in the box (1 each). Assembly isn't terrible just not terribly efficient. I've never seen a company piecemeal together such a trivial part of a television before... but again the theme here is budget HDTV so maybe that's why.After you've got the base assembled or TV mounted if you're going with a mount the next step is setting up your sources. Suffice to say that this is as easy as it gets. Polaroid's onscreen menus are easy to navigate and getting the TV setup with cable, HDTV antenna, or whatever your inputs are is a breeze.►First Impressions:Unboxing this set the first thing I noticed is the weight... this TV is just so light! The advertised weight is 21lbs and it felt lighter than that setting up the TV. This isn't necessarily a bad thing just an observation.Once setup with my HDTV antenna and PS3 I tested both over-the-air and Blu-Ray movies with the set. The picture quality is ""good"" and I don't mean that in a bad way... it's just good enough. No one buying this set is concerned how this picture stacks up to a (former) Panasonic's plasma black level or a Sony XBR for contrast. It's not reasonable to make that comparison so I won't. The picture for everyday performance is fine. One thing I would recommend is turning off the dynamic lighting adjustment; which adjusts the set's LED backlighting depending on the onscreen content. I think it tends to wash the picture out and also can be disorienting/noticeable as the TV is constantly adjusting brightness.►White/Blue Line on the Bottom:I'll note since several other reviewers noted in their reviews a blue or white line along the bottom of their sets that no such line is visible on mine. I tested various channels and sources and have not noticed this or any other type of issue with my set.►Inputs:Definitely the highlight of this TV is the sheer amount and variety of inputs Polaroid has thrown in. The complete list:1) 3x HDMI2) 1x Component Video (Y Pb Pr)3) 1x Composite4) 1x VGA5) 1x RF (75 ohm antenna)6) 1x USB7) 1x Headphone jack8) 1x PC audio jack--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS HDTV:--------------------(+) Price Point. This is an entry level set that lacks the sheer picture quality and refinement of more expensive HDTVs but still delivers a good picture at 1080p.(+) Inputs Galore. Use this HDTV as a television or extra computer monitor... chances are there's an input on this set for what you need.(+) Lightweight. At just 21lbs this set is easy for even one person to handle and set it up on the included stand or even wall mounting!(+) Matte Finish. A low glare matte finish to the screen helps cut out glare.--------------------WHAT COULD BE BETTER:--------------------(-) Speakers. The included speakers are pretty bad and sound muffled.(-) Remote. This is a pretty terrible remote across the board. It feels cheap, looks cheap and is cheap... but at least it gets the job done. Just without any refinement or backlighting.--------------------CLOSING:--------------------I wasn't sure what to expect from a Polaroid HDTV but I'm walking away relatively satisfied given the price point of this set. Sure this isn't a set that'll blow anyone's socks off with astounding picture quality but it does display a nice HD picture on a budget. This set would be perfect for a business, child's room, or for a myriad of other uses where budget trumps performance. For the HDTV shopper on a budget I'd consider this set. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FA2YCGNP53W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEX1Y1S#wasThisHelpful","R3FA2YCGNP53W7","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't travel extensively but enough that I purchased some high quality Victorinox luggage that I've been using for several years mostly when I travel for work. My wife and I do have an older set of luggage for trips we take together that's more than well worn and needed replacement. This Travel Gear Signature 4-piece set is comparable to our old set (purchased from a department store 10+ years ago).So right off the bat I've never heard of the Travel Gear brand or really know anything about it. A quick search on the internet reveals that this luggage set is sold under at least one other name. So ""Travel Gear"" appears to me to just be one of the many brands for the same manufacturer based in China. The MSRP (and Amazon list price) on this luggage set is a whopping eleven-hundred dollars... right. No one in their right state of mind is going to confuse this luggage set for a $1000+ dollar set of travel bags.All that said I do think this is a nice set of luggage for a decent price (the Amazon price; not MSRP). Each bag is large but still fit within airline bag size regulations. The material (woven jacquard) seems thick and durable. Zippers are large and appear to be heavy-duty and also include loops for luggage locks. The three large rolling bags features ""spinner"" wheels and can glide almost effortlessly across surfaces and turn on a dime. Aesthetically the bags get a ""meh"" from me. I'm not a huge fan of the ""TG"" logo that's across the entire surface of the bags.►Included in this 4-piece Set:1) 28"" Spinner: Exterior dimensions: 29 inches high x 18 inches wide x 12 inches deep, 2 inch expansion; Interior dimensions: 28 inches high x 17 inches wide x 11 inches deep, 2 inch expansion2) 25"" Spinner: Exterior dimensions: 25.5 inches high x 16 inches wide x 11 inches deep, 2 inch expansion; Interior dimensions: 24.5 inches high x 15 inches wide x 10 inches deep, 2 inch expansion3) 21"" Spinner: Exterior dimensions: 22.5 inches high x 14 inches wide x 9.5 inches deep, 1 inch expansion; Interior dimensions: 21.5 inches high x 13 inches wide x 8.5 inches deep, 1 inch expansion4) Tote: Exterior dimensions: 13 inches high x 15.5 inches wide x 6.5 inches deep; Interior dimensions:12 inches high x 14.5 inches wide x 5.5 inches deep►Impressions:Overall the luggage set seems well built and I'm confident that it can hold up to the rigours of travel. The bags are large and heavy so if you're looking for a minimalist approach to luggage this isn't it. I also was a bit disappointed that there's not a scrap of leather to be found anywhere on this luggage. Even the tote handles which appear to be leather in pictures (or maybe I just expected that) are made from cloth. Again, the list price is just bonkers.I have not yet spent enough time using this luggage extensively to judge how it performs long-term. I do plan on updating this review as I accumulate more mileage on this set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4RIE5V1LBOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5OZTFU#wasThisHelpful","R1M4RIE5V1LBOB","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 2.5 year old loves VTech toys; his mother and I are somewhat less enthusiastic about all the bells, lights, songs.... you get the idea. But we agree that the toys are fun and interactive for our son so we do our best to put up with the annoyance factor the toys inevitably bring. This 2-in-1 Learn and Zoom Motorbike is no exception. You're getting a human powered scooter bike with two wheel configurations, tricycle and two-wheel scooter, and the steering wheel holds the usual VTech light-up buttons and speaker.►Assembly:Putting this little scooter together was super-easy. In fact no tools are required (minus a Phillips screwdriver for accessing the battery compartment) and the steering wheel and back wheels just snap into place. The back wheels can be configured into two different riding modes depending on the child's ability by simply snapping the wheels in a different configuration. Two spring-loaded release tabs hold the wheels in place and when pushed back release the wheels so that they can be reconfigured.Additionally you'll get a sticker sheet for some of the decals (four total).►Use:My 2.5 year old loved the toy right away and after using it on both our living room floor and driveway/sidewalk I think the toy is probably best suited for very smooth surfaces. Our neighborhood streets can be a bit less than smooth so probably best to avoid those with the plastic wheels. I'll also note that the steering wheel actually does turn the front wheels.Durability of this toy seems just okay. My son is on the larger side and probably approaching the limit of what this toy was designed for. The materials here are pretty thin plastics. They're colorful and fun but not as rugged as some of his other scooters.Overall he's satisfied and this is a toy his little brother will definitely be getting some mileage out of.

"I've been using similar Nitrile gloves in my garage for years for messy tasks like changing oil on my car or lawn mowers, mixing oil and gasoline for my 2-cycle weedwacker, and also for tasks like staining furniture. Nitrile is great and doesn't leave my hands smelly or feeling like they're covered in fine powder like latex.

"Turtle Beach's Ear Force PX24 is the ""universal"" (PS4, Xbone, PC, and mobile) headset solution for anyone looking for an entry to mid-level headset that offers really good quality sound and features but don't want to spend a bundle. I own a myriad of gaming headsets, including TB, and the PX24 most closely resembles the Z22 headset that I own for my PC.--------------------PRODUCT FEATURES:--------------------This headset features stereo sound and a ""virtual surround"" mode. I think at this price-point most headsets on the market aren't true surround sound enabled and though the real thing is very impressive the PX24 does a great job with audio. Overall audio quality is very good and what I've come to expect from Turtle Beach. Audio is crisp, clear but still features plenty of bass ""oomph"".This headset is wired to the console/PC/device in what TB calls ""tethered"". So if you're bent on a true wireless experience you'll have to look elsewhere. I own a few different wireless headsets including the TB Elite 800 and Sony Gold Wireless Headset (GWH) and the freedom of wireless and not having to deal with cords is very nice. I do think TB has done a good job with the ""tether"" including the in-line amplifier with controls that somewhat offset the hassle of being tethered to the controller.'Inline Amplifier Features & Changes:The inline amplifier has received a nice facelift compared to my Z22. The inline amplifier on the PX24 features an easier to use interface to start with. A large central button toggles between Master Volume, Virtual Surround, Mic Monitor, Variable Bass Boost. A small blue LED under each setting lights up indicating the user selection and a side-mounted turn-dial is used to adjust each of the settings. This definitely beats my Z22 which featured independent dials for each and overall makes the inline amp a bit more efficient to use. Rounding out the feature set is a side-mounted toggle selector for the system you're using (again PS4, Xbone, ...). Independent Superhuman Hearing and Mic Mute buttons are also present on the amp for quick access. The status of each is given by very nice LED backlighting; Superhuman Hearing gets a blue LED and Mic Mute a red LED.One key difference with the PX24 is that the inline amp is not USB powered. So there is a built in rechargeable battery. This is really the make it or break it feature with this headset. One of the key features (at least for me) with wired headsets was that I needn't worry about battery life and plugging it in after use. That's now out the window with the PX24. Something to be aware about.--------------------PRODUCT USE:--------------------Setting up the PX24 is extremely easy and you'll be up and running out-of-the-box in less than a minute. Simply plug the headset to the inline amplifier and then the amp to the controller.Again audio quality is very good. Not audiophile level and certainly not as good as my Elite 800 headset. But I do really enjoy just pure stereo sound and I tested the PX24 on my PS4 and PC and love the stereo audio. Playing my favorite tracks on Spotify or in-game wandering the halls of a chalice dungeon in Bloodborne; the PX24 delivers the goods.'PX24 Compared to Z22:Except for a palette swap and minor changes to the the stitching on the headband the headsets are almost identical. The refresh or major change here is to the inline amplifier. In my humble opinion I do think that the inline amp on the PX24 is far superior. Just having one rotating dial instead of five makes me like the PX24 better. Also I'm a sucker for LED backlit keys and yeah the PX24 gets the nod again. The fact that the PX24 needs to be recharged (amp) is a bummer but something I'll adjust to with usage.--------------------THE GOOD:--------------------(+) Audio. Excellent in-game or music sound without breaking the bank. If you're looking for an economical headset that's not bottom-of-the-barrel then the PX24 is a good starting point.(+) Compatibility. Use the PX24 with your PS4, PC, Xbone, or mobile device. It's great for someone looking for an all-in-one solution.(+) Inline Amplifier. The facelift and changes to the ubiquitous TB inline amplifier is for the best. I love the simple toggle and consolidation down to just one radial dial for adjustments. The addition of LED backlit keys is a nice touch.(+) Build Quality. The PX24 is comfortable, easily adjustable and fits even large noggins (I can attest to that); it seems to be a progression of the Z22 which I've owned for years and still looks new so I take it as a good thing.--------------------SOMEWHAT LESS THAN GOOD:--------------------(~) Tethered Mode. This is a cross between fully wired to the console/PC and wireless. You're wired to the console controller or in the case of mobile and PC to the device itself. Less convenient than full wireless and you do have to deal with wires. But then again you also get the excellent inline amplifier for immediate adjustments. It's a bit of a trade off.(~) Battery. Having to plug in the inline amplifier to charge the headset is a bit of a pain and just one more thing to plug in.--------------------CLOSING:--------------------Overall I'm very pleased with this headset. Turtle Beach has taken one of my favorite, go-to headsets (Z22) and improved upon it with changes to the inline amplifier while retaining excellent build quality and sound and expanded compatibility. Recommended!**Note: In-game chat only tested on the PS4. Chat performed perfectly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CRIIS9WBXKO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5V3U#wasThisHelpful","R2CRIIS9WBXKO3","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm going to echo many of the comments made in other reviews; the Tiger Stainless Steel Travel Mug does a stupendous job at keeping you hot drinks hot but the lid has a major drawback in that it's tough to clean.►Hot Coffee Test:My morning ritual always involves brewing up a hot cup of coffee and enjoying it on my way to work. Most mornings I'm still sipping on my coffee after I get to work. Most of my travel mugs do an okay job at keeping my coffee warm but the Tiger mug is on another level. I tested this mug over the course of several days and even after 3-hours my coffee was hot enough to that I had to carefully sip from the mug.►Design & Appearance:On just sheer looks this is one attractive mug. The white finish looks terrific and feels good too while not getting dirty easily; unlike some of my other mugs that show fingerprints easily the Tiger mug does not. The built-in rubber grip is pretty great too. High marks all around.►The Lid:This is where things start falling apart for this mug. While I have no issue with the centrally located button (depressed with a lime-green ring to show the spout is open) I do have issue with how hard the lid is to clean. First, simply washing the lid is quite hard because water leaks into the inner components. You can literally hear water sloshing around inside the lid. You have to shake the water out while forcefully holding the lid and the bottom of the cap (inner gasket) open. Even then there's water that will certainly still be trapped inside.My wife suggested soaking the lid in the sink overnight in detergent. That technique does work and gets the lid clean and I can simply shake dry the lid and use it immediately rather than having water sit in the lid and it getting skunky. However, the amount of attention this lid needs just makes the whole mug a hassle.►Closing:Above all if you're looking for a travel mug to keep your drinks nuclear-hot then you've found it. The drawback here is the lid is a PITA to clean.

The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.Lightweight, easy to pair, and good sounding headphones is how I'd describe the Ausdom S03 Bluetooth Headphones. But I'd also add that these headphones are not the most comfortable out there.►Product Description:The Ausdom S03 features a behind the neck/head design where the speaker wire acts as an integral part of the earpiece. Soft silicone earbuds and in-ear pieces hold the S03 securely on the ear. The right earpiece features all three buttons on the S03 including volume and power/call answering/pairing. The volume buttons also serve to skip or restart tracks when held down for 1-second.►In The Box:1) S03 headphones2) Mini-USB to USB cable3) Instruction guide►Product Notes:The manufacturer makes these claims (which I've not verified): 7hrs of talk or 5hrs of music listening on a single charge» Bluetooth profiles: A2DP, AVRCP, HSP, HFP►Product Use:After unboxing this set of headphones I was really skeptical they'd fit my (large) head but surprisingly these headphones not only fit but they stayed in place for 3hrs while I was doing yardwork! I have not had a chance to take the S03 on a jog yet but I'm confident that after standing up to 3hrs in the yard with me it wouldn't be an issue.Pairing the headphones is straightforward - just press the power button and hold it down until you hear a series of chimes, search for Bluetooth devices on your media player or smartphone and complete the pairing process.My only real complaint with the S03 is that after 3hrs these headphones were really starting to get uncomfortable; especially around the top of my ears where the wire wraps over the top.►The Good:(+) Sound. The sound quality is really nice especially for headphones of this weight.(+) Lightweight. The headphones only weigh 17-grams!(+) Fitment. Despite my initial reservations with the S03 they fit my large head surprisingly well!►The Bad:(-) Comfort. My ears were really aching by the end of my initial use with the S03. This is the main issue with this product.(-) Accessories. I've tested a bunch of Bluetooth headphones and the S03 is definitely in the minority that don't come with an assortment of earbuds and earpiece types for different sized ears.►Closing:The Ausdom S03 is a nice pair of lightweight and good sounding headphones and worth checking out. Unfortunately fitment issues and the lack of swappable components means you may end up returning the product. Recommended with caveats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJ9002D5J1RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126YOAX0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJ9002D5J1RJ","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I'm having a hard time accurately scoring this product. While I really like many of the features of the  Glasstic 16oz Water Bottle there are certain characteristics of this water bottle that I definitively don't like.'Product Description:The ""bottle"" is really a combination of materials and pieces that fit together to give the end-user the advantages of several different water bottle types. The inner tube of this bottle is made from heavy duty glass. An outer plastic shell (with the Glasstic logo) fits over the glass insert tube. Then plastic caps fit over both the top and bottom of both finishing out the water bottle.The top cap screws on the bottle and a rubber gasket prevents water from leaking. The cap also features a lock preventing the flip-top cap from opening inadvertently. Finishing out the feature list is a nice, large oval plastic handle.'Product Use:I threw this bottle in my backpack on most days and ported it to work and back. After about a week of use it does seem sturdy enough. The cap held tight an absolutely no water leaked out. But there are a few things I didn't care for either; namely this is a bit on the small side for a water bottle at least for me. The other is that condensation can form between the glass inner bottle and the plastic tube. This isn't a major issue but I was sure to wash the bottle and completely let it air dry each night between uses.Also, While having two layers comprise the bottle you're not really gaining much in the way of insulation. Ice added to my chilled water did last a bit long but only a bit.'The Good:(+) Affordable. Some of the prices of water bottles is absurd especially at retail. I really like that this water bottle is priced on the lower-end.(+) Build quality. The components of the bottle seem extremely well made. The glass inner bottle is especially heavy duty.(+) Locking lid. This is a great feature if you plan on throwing the Glasstic bottle in a bag. No leaks either!'The Bad:(-) Ounces. You're only getting 16oz of water per fill up with this bottle. Which may be totally okay for some.(-) Condensation. A bit of condensation between the glass and plastic bottles means you should wash this bottle frequently.'Closing:Buy this bottle if you've limited your search down to glass water bottles and want to avoid plastic and metal varieties. The affordable price means you can try it out without spending a bundle.

"I guess the first place to start my review is by saying that I do know about the controversy surrounding the G27 and as an owner of the Logitech DFGT, which I used for many years with GT5 & 6 and various other awesome PS3 racing games, I feel the twinge of anger. I do not and will not speculate about the ""security chip"" claim that Logitech has and continues to make. I am reviewing this wheel, to the best of my ability, as a standalone product.--------------------PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:--------------------Years ago when I wrote my original review for my DFGT I was beaming with happiness; GT5 Prologue had been released (the taste of car-crack that I had grown up with on PS1 and PS2) and my decision to buy the DFGT was validated the very first lap. I felt a lot of that same happiness when I fired up Driveclub (yes, Driveclub) and the G29. This is a beautiful, well-made piece of gaming goodness.Since I do not own (but have used) the G27 I'm going to compare the G29 more to my DFGT. So to start...►Build Quality:From the moment I unboxed the G29 I loved the quality of the materials and how it came together. You're getting a real leather wrapped wheel, high-quality metal pedals and flappy-paddles shifters. Extensive use of plastics are found on the G29 no doubt but again the key is high-quality plastics.►Force Feedback & Turn Radius:I tinkered around with the force feedback setting in Driveclub until I found something that felt good. I'll say that out of the box the configuration is pretty good. However, going from using my DS4 to a full-on racing wheel was a huge gameplay shift so I spent quite a bit of time sliding around the track. The force feedback felt a bit too strong so I dialed it down. One of the things I distinctly remember loving about the FF is the connection it helps the player make with whatever racing game you're playing. That is still very much true with the G29; I immediately felt connected to the road as I drove my M3 and then later Pagani Zonda around Canada, India and various other in-game locations. You feel the road shift, bumps, rumble strips and run-out areas... it's pretty amazing and totally immersive.The steering wheel also features a full 900° turning radius. It's important to note that because not all racing wheels do and you can sometimes find yourself running into the limitations of the hardware when playing a game.►Pedals:The pedals with the G29 are excellent. You're getting real metal pedals here not plastics like with my DFGT. Each pedal has a different amount of pressure required to press the pedal down. The brake distinctly feels like a brake and not like the clutch or accelerator. I will say that I haven't purchased the optional shifter (yes, optional) so my experience with the clutch was pretty limited. I do intend on buying the shifter I just haven't done so yet. So I'll update my review then.--------------------PRODUCT USE:--------------------I'll keep this a bit shorter since I mentioned using the G29 with Driveclub. I will say again that I really do love almost all of the G29. The steering is tight, force feedback is excellent and strong - so much so that I turned the setting down; the pedals are realistic and responsive. If you've never slurged and purchased a driving wheel you simply cannot go wrong with the G29. This is almost the complete package...I will say I have two areas of disappointment with this wheel:1) You have to purchase the shifter separately for the cost of a new PS4 game. Ouch.2) The flappy paddle gearbox (to borrow a favorite term from Top Gear) is not good. Let me describe it this way - it's ""squishy"". Each paddle shifter has to be squeezed toward the driver and it feels like I'm squishing a stress ball inside the G29 assembly. My own car has paddle shifters and they're so much more better; crisp and responsive with a satisfying ""click"". Not so much here. Yes, this paddles will have to do if you don't intend on getting the shifter but they're not great.--------------------THE GOOD:--------------------(+) Materials. From a real leather wrapped steering wheel to metal pedals and paddle shifters Logitech did a nice job bringing the G29 together into a premium racing wheel.(+) Force Feedback. I love the power behind the force feedback motor and even had to dial it down in Driveclub.(+) Shift Indicator. Just like your favorite supercar or F1 this wheel features LED indicator lights right on the steering wheel. It's a little gimmicky but cool!(+) Button Arrangement. I love that the L2/R2 and L3/R3 buttons are light blue and a good contrast to the rest of the wheel making them easier to find.(+) PS4 Buttons. The 'Options' & 'Share' buttons are easy to find as is the 'PS' button. Great for quick in-game snaps.(+) Quick Setting. The G29 retains some of the DFGTs button layout including the quick setting buttons and radial toggle.--------------------THE BAD:--------------------(+) Shifter. I have to mention it... the G29 is as much as the PS4 and you still have to buy the shifter separately! That stings!(+) Paddle Shifters. Channeling Jeremy Clarkson here... the flappy paddles aren't great. It feels like I'm squeezing fruit when shifting. I really wish these were more satisfying to use.--------------------CLOSING:--------------------All in all I cannot wait to use the G29 on more games. I've avoided buying Project Cars up to this point because of mixed reviews but will probably jump over after I'm bored with Driveclub. For now the G29 and Driveclub is my gaming nirvana. Aside from a few downsides as mentioned this is a fantastic product and easily one I recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSJ0WF7O9BVQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0UWWYC#wasThisHelpful","RSJ0WF7O9BVQ1","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I long ago learned that expensive cables whether HDMI or otherwise is more marketing than picture or sound quality (looking at you Monster Cable) and have been steadfastly buying most of my cables from Monoprice or using AmazonBasics branded cables.I received this 5m cable and had a specific use in mind for my basement where I was intending on doing some rearranging and wanted a long run of HDMI cable. I've had this cable running from an A/V stack in a corner closet to my plasma TV for the better part of two months and it's worked great! I've had no visible impact to picture quality or any other issue of any kind.Comparing this HDMI cable versus Monoprice and AmazonBasics I'd give the nod to AmazonBasics in terms of overall build quality and look and feel. However, if you're looking for a good HDMI cable that gets the job done I'd give these a shot and they're a considerable bargain compared to even AmazonBasics.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31V45WZJ6JPXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI1DKJQ#wasThisHelpful","R31V45WZJ6JPXR","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I really, really wanted to love the Soundpeats Q2 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones; they sound good, look good and are easy to use but I have to echo some of the other reviews - they simply do not fit very well.After receiving these I excitedly opened them, paired them up to my phone, and intended on doing a few hours of yard work. Nope! I spent a good 20 minutes just trying to get the earpieces to stay on my ears. The primary problem (at least initially) is that the cord is wound up in the packaging and tends to want to return to its coiled state. After spending some time coaxing the cord to straighten out I tried the Q2 again... and again the earpieces (one or the other) would pop off my ear with the slightest turn of my head. So ultimately the fitment just isn't right for my head and ears and I gave up using them. No way these would be good on a run... or anywhere where you might need to turn your head.I'll mention that I gave these to my wife to try and she felt the earbuds/earpieces were way to large for her and uncomfortable. So she gave them back. I again gave the headphones away this time to my brother-in-law and he's had better luck with them then my wife and I. Or he's just more patient about resetting the earpieces when they fall out.►The Good:(+) Attractive design.(+) Good sound.(+) Easy to pair.►The Bad:(-) Fitment issues.(-) Cord that wraps behind your head or neck is too short.(-) Earpieces/earbuds are large and uncomfortable.I think Soundpeats makes some good products (check out the excellent Qy7 BT headset) but the Q2 is unfortunately not one of them.

"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I was particularly keen to try these Mosquito Repellent Bracelets out for two reasons: I'm apparently a succulent steak dinner to mosquitos and I dislike most spray on mosquito repellents. My son also attracts his fair share of bites and has an apparent mild allergy to the bites leaving welts on his skin.So first things first - these bracelets DO work... most of the time. I've had the chance to use these bracelets on the whole family; wife, oldest son (2) and myself in pretty much any outdoor environment we frequent. Those areas would be our backyard/patio, soccer field, neighborhood walks, etc. I should also mention I live in the Midwest and mosquitos are quite bad in my area.'Product Description:Each bracelet comes sealed in a little reusable plastic pouch. The bracelets themselves are coiled plastic and smell relatively strong. I'm not exactly sure what's in each but the overwhelming smell that I perceive is citronella. The bracelets can be worn around the wrist or ankle and are meant to be resealed in the plastic pouch when not in use. The manufacturer claims up to 250 hours of use per bracelet though I've not tested that claim. I'm still using the original bracelet I opened after receiving the product over a month ago and yes, it does still smell of citronella.'Use:As I mentioned before the bracelets are mostly effective at stopping mosquitos. Both my son and I have been bitten while wearing them but then again the same is true when I wear spray-on mosquito repellent. For me the main attraction to this product is the fact that I'm not spraying chemicals on my son or me. Paired with other mosquito repellents, at my home it's citronella candles and tiki torches, these bracelets help form a an excellent layered protection for the family!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBIAZ8ND86F7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106IZ86Q#wasThisHelpful","RBIAZ8ND86F7R","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I originally imagined using this light on summer camping trips but with a new addition to my family getting out for a weekend overnight camp isn't in the cards. I have, however, used LiteXim's Smart Handheld Light on a few house projects. Most notably I was repairing some undersink plumbing in my wet-bar that had developed a small leak. Using this light under a sink revealed a whole new purpose besides camping - home improvement. Pretty much anywhere you need a light there's a good chance this little light is up to the task. It's bright enough to light small areas relatively well. After using this light I'm considering picking up one more to throw in my wife's vehicle in her emergency roadside kit.The ""LiteXim"" uses an internal rechargeable battery and can be charged using any mini-USB charger. I've been using my cellphone charger to get the job done. You're getting a few different light modes - high, medium, low, and two strobe modes as well.My only knock against this product is that it's not entirely durable. My two year old son got ahold of the light while I had it sitting under my sink and immediately popped one of the end-caps off. You're getting essentially several pieces of plastics with a rechargeable battery and LEDs. It's fine but I'd be sure to have a backup handy especially for camping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D24V72RE1W7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111WBJUK#wasThisHelpful","R3D24V72RE1W7M","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've recently been shopping for a rear mount child seat and ordered and eventually returned the Bellelli Pepe Standard Fit and the Thule RideAlong because of fitment issues with my bike. I have a Specialized Rockhopper Mountain Bike that I use for unpaved and paved riding and I was hoping to take my 2 year-old son along on smoother paved surface rides. The Peg Perego doesn't have the fitment issues that both the Bellelli and Thule seats have, however, the Eggy has at least one glaring design flaw that makes it difficult to use this seat and a few other issues that make the seat less than ideal.--------------------PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:--------------------The Eggy is actually very similar to both the Bellelli and Thule seat as far as the mounting system is concerned. You're essentially using a clamp-type mount on the bike's seat tube frame (not on the seatpost, but rather the frame). The mount is securely held in place by four bolts you tighten with an Allen wrench (included).The Peg Perego has an excellent design on the mount allowing for all types of sized frame posts directly addressing the issue I encountered with the other two seats. Included with the Eggy are two different size (lengths) bolts, three different frame post guides, and an articulating frame post mount (metal clamp). These pieces kind of all fit together like a sandwich and the bolts hold everything snug to the frame. It's truly an excellent design and even my wide frame on my bike presented no problem.►Installation:The core of the installation process is really getting the mounting bracket installed securely on the frame of the bike. Once you've identified the correct components to use - the bolts and frame post guides - it's easy to tighten everything down. My only advice here is to tighten each of the four bolts a bit at a time to ensure everything tightens at the same time and you don't misalign the bolts or seat.The Eggy features a bracket with two heavy-duty metal arms that have a plastic mount that slides into the seat bottom. A plastic pin slides through all this and holds the position of the seat. There is plenty of room to slide the seat back and forth on along the seat bottom bracket. The metal arms slip around the frame and slide into the mount and clamp in place. That's the brunt of the installation!I will say that the instructions aren't great but not terrible either. Some of the pictures can be a bit confusing but just spend a few moments going over everything and you should get the hang of it.--------------------PRODUCT USE:--------------------My son weighs approximately 34lbs (this seat is rated to hold 40lbs) and fits in the seat perfectly. We learned a lot on our first short ride around the neighborhood; some of it good and some not so good. So I'll try to capture everything (included my attempts to address the issues)...►First Issue:I initially adjusted the seat further back to give my son a bit more room and so that he could see more than just my back while riding. This however, presented another problem - the seat bottom would touch the top of my rear wheel when encountering any bumps or dips on the ride. This generates a loud grinding sound and more alarmingly the scrape occurs on the plastic locking pin. I was worried that with continued contact the locking pin would disengage allowing the seat to slide on the bracket. So I eventually slid my son closer to me and this seems to take care of the issue for most bumps (although not all) albeit he's very close to my back.►Second Issue:The seat features deep footwells  that protect the child's legs and feet from coming in contact with the bike. The footwells contain foot rests that slide up and down to accommodate children's height and leg differences. The foot rests have plastic straps that fold over the top of the foot again acting to protect the child from mechanical or moving components on the bike. This works well except for one issue - the footwells  are large and the plastic seems to stick out from my bike frame enough that the heel of my feet strikes a portion of it. I can sort of compensate for the issue by adjusting my feet on the pedal; I've tried pedaling with the middle part of my foot, but this obviously isn't ideal and a huge chore on hills. Initially I though I'd set the mount off-center and one foot-well stuck out more than the other. But even after carefully dismounting the entire seat and mounting everything again the footwells just stick out way too far. The only long-term fix I can think of is to drill two small holes along the bottom of each footwell and use zip ties to hold the footwells up against the chainstay arms on my bike. But this of course doesn't make the seat exactly easy or convenient to slip on and off for rides with and without my son.--------------------THE GOOD:--------------------(+) Price. Compared to the Thule especially this is a good quality seat for the price point and a good value.(+) Mount system. The mount system is versatile and included components for many bike types. Once mounted the seat is firmly in place and secure.(+) Safety Features. The seat offers good wrap-around protection for the child, deep footwells to protect little feet, and a nice big red reflector on the back. Two nylon straps and a child-proof seat buckle round out the safety features.(+) One-Click Installation. Once you've got the mount in place the entire Eggy seat is designed to slip on/off the bike with a push of a button on the mount.--------------------THE BAD:--------------------(-) Seat Clearance. Minimal seat clearance (at least on my bike) means that the seat can come in contact with the rear tire.(-) Footwells. The footwells stick out from the bike frame and can lead to a situation where the riders heel/foot strikes the footwell. Idealy there would be an easy way (built-in) to strap the footwell to the bike frame preventing this issue.--------------------CLOSING:--------------------Unfortunately the two issues with the Eggy are pretty serious and prevent easy and repeated use of the seat. I really wanted to like this product a whole lot more especially after trying two other brands that didn't work. This issue may have more to do with my bike and the dimensions of it so it may work better on other bikes. Unfortunately not recommended!","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV51LQ6O3BO88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLW5PV6#wasThisHelpful","RV51LQ6O3BO88","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a checkered past with Epson printers but I always try to approach each new item I review from a neutral perspective. For the sake of this review I will be comparing the Epson Expression ET-2550 to an Epson WorkForce WF-4640. This is for two reasons; first, the printers are in the same price range and second I own both and these printers.--------------------PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:--------------------The ET-2550 as best I can tell is Epson's attempt to address the outrageous price for ink. Anyone who's ever purchased a printer knows the routine by now; you buy a printer at a discounted price only to discover with horror that the 4+ ink cartridges inside your printer are not refillable and that ink costs more per ounce than gold. Those shifty printer companies got you again!So I was immediately intrigued by the ET-2550 with its promise of cheap ink that the everyday user can purchase and refill the printer themselves. The good news is that Epson has delivered!Okay so the printer itself is smaller than I was expecting. In fact it sits comfortably on top of my small filing drawer (as pictured). The screen is a disappointing 1.44"" color LCD that is decidedly not a touchscreen. The only printer paper tray is a top-loading one with limited capacity (100 pages advertised). There is an included scanner but you're not getting the option to scan from a feeder, just a top loading single sheet scan. I know it sounds like I think this printer is disappointing - and it is in some ways especially considering the price. But then it hit me... Epson isn't using the same loss-leader type of business model with this printer. They're likely charging fair-market value because they're not making it back on ink. When viewed from that perspective I can honestly say that it makes this printer much more attractive.►In the Box:1) ET-2550 printer with scanner2) Four ink bottles (Black, cyan, yellow, Magenta)3) Power cord4) Manuals, installation CD, large plastic bag (used in case the printer needs to be shipped while loaded with ink)--------------------PRODUCTION USE:--------------------The very first thing you should do with this printer is read the instructions and find a good place to fill the ink reservoirs. Unlike most printers you've probably used the ink cartridges are not removable; the printer has empty tanks you'll have to fill yourself with the included ink. So take special care to figure out exactly what you're doing and where you're doing it before you make a huge mess. I managed to fill each of the four reservoirs with very minimal amounts of ink on my fingers. If you have latex gloves that's probably a good idea as each ink bottle has a foil cap that has to be carefully removed.Each ink reservoir features a soft rubbery cap that fits snuggly on top to cap the reservoirs. The printer has an initial setup process that takes approximately 20-minutes. I decided to go ahead and install Epson's printer software (included on CD) so that I'd get the ink monitoring levels on my PC. The software seems very good overall and an improvement over other Epson software I've used in the past.The ET-2550 does feature WiFi and a variety of options (i.e. WiFi Direct) for getting the printer connected to your network. I opted to use the onscreen guide to find my network and add my password and the process really made me miss my WF-4640's touchscreen. The process of entering text on-screen is clumsy at best but doable.The actual printing capability is pretty good albeit a bit slower than what I'm used to with my WF-4640. Black and white printing which is the majority of what I do is rated at 9ppm and color about half that. I'll go ahead and mention that I was impressed with the quality of the overall print jobs and documents I printed with the ET-2550. They're really good and similar in quality to my WF-4640.--------------------WHAT EPSON GOT RIGHT:--------------------(+) Ink! The fact that you can purchase your own ink from just about anywhere makes this printer (and the entire Expression lineup) extremely attractive to price-conscious consumers. This is hands down the single best aspect of this printer.(+) Print Quality. I was dubious about how good the prints could be given the unique approach to ink but I'm glad to say this printer measures up quite nicely to my much more capable WF-4640.(+) Scan. Epson makes some great scanners and though limited to single-sheet scanning the scanner on the ET-2550 does a great job with bright and quality scans. Epson's scan software is also quite capable.--------------------THE COMPROMISE OF THIS PRINTER:--------------------So there are plenty of compromises to be had with the ET-2550. To get similar functionality to my WF-4640 in the Expression lineup you'd need to spend A LOT more money and probably looking at the WF-R4640 which is about three times the price of the ET-2550. You're giving up a lot of features - large 4.4"" color touchscreen, feeder scanning, PPM, paper tray capacity - but for the home user the simple fact that ink is so much more affordable makes it all worth the compromise in my opinion.--------------------CLOSING:--------------------I highly recommend this product and again the single best aspect is the user-refillable ink reservoirs and cheap ink! I really commend Epson for making a consumer-friendly printer that addresses the insane prices of ink.

"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I have several reading lamps around my house and particularly my desk area. That's primarily where I tested and used this ""LiteXim"" 3.5W Lamp. The version that I received is the standard touch base and not the clip-on light. Also my version arrived in a box labled ""Fashion Wind""; not that it makes a difference but this lamp is probably sold by many different vendors under differing names.I will say that for anything but a small area the light output from this lamp is pretty disappointing. You get three output settings - low, medium, high -  selected by touching a small area of the lamp base. Even at high output the LEDs in this lamp aren't super bright but enough for a small desk area and maybe for putting directly over a book.The light does make up some ground in that it's extremely versatile. With a built-in battery this lamp doesn't need to be plugged into a wall outlet. An included USB charging cable can connect to a desktop or laptop for charging. And best of all the stem is completely adjustable; you can twist, bend, and contort this light in a multitude of ways. The LEDs mean that the lamp won't generate significant amounts of heat while in operation.Overall I'd pretty happy with this lamp and I do think my house will get some good use of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4AUDM0SGWEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012FLMAHM#wasThisHelpful","R1E4AUDM0SGWEJ","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I recently reconfigured my home office in my basement that included moving my Windows 7 based PC to the other side of the room. Not a big deal but my Cat 6e cable wasn't going to reach. Instead of buying more cable I used Etekcity's AC600 Dual-band USB WiFi dongle and it's been great!►Installation:Per the instructions I installed the included software bundle on the mini-CD and followed the onscreen guide to get up and running. The bundled software is pretty lightweight but does run in the system background. I believe that you can get this dongle up and running with the correct drivers (it's plug-and-play ready) without installing the software though I'm not certain you'll get all the features. During installation I was prompted to select the type of WiFi my router supports (AC for me).►Speed:Overall I have no complaints! My machine is pretty lean and I built it myself for quick boot-up times and haven't noticed much of a delay after initially powering on. It does take a few extra moments for the WiFi signal to connect but overall not bad. I do tend to transfer large movie formats to a networked drive connected to my home theater. Transfer speeds testing one >4GB .mkv file were pretty great.Overall very pleased with this unit and it's saved me from having to buy additional cabling for my desktop.

"The Dyson V6 Mattress (just V6 here on) is my first Dyson appliance that I've owned though I have previously used the Dyson Animal mostly to see what the fuss was about surrounding Dyson's products. I'll also preface by saying that I was hesitant to order this product (from Vine) mostly because it's marketed as a mattress vacuum only... which unless you're a housekeeper who really needs such an expensive single-purpose vacuum?--------------------PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:--------------------The most surprising aspect of the V6 that may not be readily apparent from the photos is that the power is activated by a trigger-button (red; inside the handguard) which makes this vac unlike any other handheld vacuum I've used before. At first this seemed so strange but after a few cleanings I've actually grown to like the trigger activation a lot. Why? Well for starters the V6 is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery; by making the vacuum shutoff whenever the trigger isn't pressed you're saving battery. Second, the trigger is extremely easy to depress and kind of perfectly positioned on your index finger when using the vacuum. It's almost like it's not even there.The second most surprising aspect is that the V6 is lightweight! From the product pictures (before receiving the vac) the V6 looked heavy and well, sort of awkward. In practice the V6 just surprised me with its weight and how easy it is to port around and clean without inducing strain on my arms or wrist.►Battery:The V6 is powered by a lithium-ion battery good for about 20-minutes of cleaning time. Which honestly isn't a whole lot but then again considering this is a product meant to clean up mattresses it's probably adequate. An included AC adapter connects to the V6 on the lower-rear section of the handguard. Charging is indicated by two small LEDs on each side of the V6's bottom mounted battery pack. As far as I can tell the battery pack is not easily user removable/replaceable.►Canister:The debris canister is oversized considering the intended purpose but I found that advantageous... more on this in a bit. A spring-loaded, downward sliding toggle opens the bottom of the debris trap for easy emptying.►Filters:You get two user-washable filters with the V6. A rear mounted HEPA filter and a top-mounted filter that fits on top of the cyclones. The filters are a snap to remove and can be cleaned under the tap.►Rotating Brush Head:The main attachment is an adjustable rotating brush head that does a terrific job picking up debris.►Max Power Mode:As if lifted from the pages of Tool Time the V6 features a ""max power mode"" that's activated by pressing a small button on the back of the unit's HEPA filter housing. This revs up the vacuum's motor and gives you up to 6 minutes of higher suction power for tough jobs.►Cleaning Tools:Besides the V6 and the main cleaning head (rotating brush head) you're also getting:1) Mini soft dusting brush (oblong brush head)2) Combination accessory tool (oval brush head)3) Crevice tool--------------------USING THE V6:--------------------After receiving the V6 I had a chance to try it out almost immediately on a mattress and box spring in my guest room. I figured this would be a good test as the mattress is several years old and one of my dogs occasionally sneaks a nap on that bed. After firing up the V6 I have to say that it convinced a skeptic... it simply did a fantastic job vacuuming up debris I never knew (or could see) was on the mattress. But what really sold me on the V6...►More than Mattress Cleaning:After using the V6 the next thought I had was the machine was perfect for other jobs too. So I got to work on my downstairs sectional couch (which again my dogs love) and W-O-W the amount of animal dander and hair the V6 picked up was astounding!Shortly after that cleaning excursion I visited Dyson's website to get more information on the V6 and here's the thing - this machine is way more capable than just cleaning mattresses. For whatever reason Amazon's product page seems extremely focused on the mattress cleaning portion; okay the word 'mattress' is in the product's name. But visiting Dyson it's apparent this machine is meant for a lot more. So I put it to the test cleaning everything from my Rosewill mechanical keyboard, baseboards around my house, sofas and ottomans and generally anywhere my pets visit.--------------------THE GOOD:--------------------(+) Versatility. Despite being seemingly singularly focused on the mattress cleaning portion the V6 is really much more versatile. Folks with pets take notice!(+) Power. Plenty of suction power even for those touch animal hair/fur jobs!(+) Trigger-activation. The trigger activation vice the standard on/off toggle is a great idea and helps extend that 20-minute battery life.(+) Lightweight. Despite looking bulky and heavy the V6 is anything but. I've used this in all manner of jobs and found the machine extremely easy to port around and use.(+) Filters. I love that the filters are user-washable and the inclusion of a HEPA filter in such a small machine is terrific.--------------------THE BAD:--------------------(+) Filter exhaust. The rear HEPA filter is the main exhaust point for the V6 and incredibly it exhaust directly into the operator's face! Even with two filters I did not enjoy having hot vacuum air blasted in my face while using the V6. This is the main reason I'm deducting a star.(+) Limited battery. The lithium-ion battery is very good and gives its all right up until all the juice is gone but being limited to 20-minutes of cleaning time and 3.5-hours of charging time is a bummer.--------------------CLOSING:--------------------All in all the Dyson V6 has been a surprisingly good addition to my home's cleaning arsenal. I can honestly say that for the money I'd buy this machine. It does a terrific job cleaning and especially if you own pets consider this machine!

"My son is probably a bit too young at two years old to get a full appreciation for these Nature Bound Toy Binoculars. Right now he mostly uses them around his neck and occasionally we'll try to get them to work in our backyard playground to spy on birds, squirrels and the wildlife in the neighborhood.Well I'm not sure what I expected, the word 'toy' is in the title and these are most definitely a toy set. As soon as we unpacked them I tried to get the lenses to focus and it's very difficult to do even for an adult. There's no chance my son will be able to focus the binos any time soon.The body of these binoculars is all rigid plastic. My son has dropped these several time on our concrete patio and the binos are starting to show plenty of wear and tear in a few short weeks.My recommendation is to purchase these only for playtime. Anyone interested in introducing kids to even a minor amount of nature watching with binoculars should look elsewhere.

"I've used the Arm & Hammer toothpaste with my electric toothbrush for several years and figured I'd give this electric toothbrush + toothpaste pack a try. I'll say right off the bat that if you're already using an electric toothbrush there's very little reason to switch to this kit unless you're looking for a cheaper replacement.►Toothbrushes:The toothbrushes in this kit use two AA batteries (included) that fit in the handle. The common theme with these types of electric brushes are that they're generally a bit larger and more noisy than the more refined (and expensive) brands like Oral B and Sonicare. That is very much the case here with the brushes in this kit. The other negative for me is that I felt the brushes were a bit too stiff; I already have a bad habit of brushing too hard so paired with these stiffer brushes I'm not doing my teeth any favors.Each brush is considerably larger than both my Oral B and Sonicare brushes and features a multi-action head. I think they do a good enough job cleaning but again are considerably louder and offer a more jarring brushing experience.►Truly Radiant Toothpaste:If you're familiar with Arm & Hammer toothpaste then you'll probably like the Truly Radiant formula. If you're not familiar with brushing with Arm & Hammer products then just be aware that these pastes feature baking soda as a primary ingredient. So your brushing experience will tend to be grittier than with other non-baking soda formulas. Personally the combination of baking soda and peroxide just leaves my teeth and mouth feeling cleaner than many of the other brands I've used in the past.My everyday brand is Arm & Hammer Complete Care Plus Whitening and honestly I'm not able to tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after using the Truly Radiant brand. I may consider ordering more but that will likely mostly be determined by price.►Included in the Kit:1) 2 Spinbrush toothbrushes2) 4 AA batteries3) 4 Toothbrush heads4) 1 Truly Radiant toothpaste tube►Closing Comments:I think this product is targeting two types of people: those that do not already own and electric toothbrush and those that are looking for a non-strip based whitening product. If you find yourself in either group this is probably not a bad purchase. Amazon's product page currently doesn't have a price (item is unavailable) but looking at other retailers this does seem to fit within the budget conscious market of electric toothbrushes. Overall a good experience. Recommended if your needs align to what the product does.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL2IYNGI8I9ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010XPSWGA#wasThisHelpful","RL2IYNGI8I9ZV","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I have been using these SoundOriginal wired earbuds for a bit over a month and I still have the exact same reaction today after using them on a 3-mile walk that I had when I first unboxed them - these are really good for seven-dollar earbuds!I've used these earbuds mostly with my smartphone, a Galaxy S4, and mostly when out walking. Sound is good but I wouldn't say excellent. If anything I think the sound through these earbuds is a bit on the bass-heavy side and some sounds and voices tend to get a little muddled. I've discovered that is mostly due to the position of the earbuds in my ears. It's sort of a peculiar problem I don't or haven't encountered with other earbuds.Another item of note is that when adjusting these earbuds while I'm listening to music produces some static feedback. It's temporary and passes as soon as I stop touching the earbuds but worth noting.So for someone looking at a cheap pair of really good sounding earbuds I may have already lost you with those two comments. However, I do think this is a pretty good deal for nicely built, metal earbuds with inline audio controls. The inline controls include a volume slider, microphone (for phone calls) and on/off toggle that when pressed quickly skips the audio-track.►In the Box:1) Earbuds with extra long cord and inline audio controls/mic2) Three-sets of different sized earbuds (2x white/opaque, 1x light blue)3) Plastic alligator clampIf you're looking for a decent and cheaply priced set of earbuds that look much more expensive and feature good sound this is a great set.

"I have a solid background using SteelSeries PC products and jumped at the chance to try out their Stratus XL Wireless Gaming Controller for iOS and MAC.If you're a gamer and prefer Apple hardware then you may have looked with some envy at the plethora of gaming peripherals available on PC/Windows machines. Particularly Microsoft's own XBox 360 controller for PC. The Stratus XL seems to take quite a few design choices directly from the X360 controller - and I mean that in a good way.►CONTROLLER LAYOUT:The controller layout is very similar to the X360 controller for PC with the exception of the analog sticks which are evenly mounted similar to Sony's DualShock controllers. Personally I've got no problem with this layout. I own both PlayStation and XBox consoles so I've long ago adapted to the differing controllers. One item of note is that the analog sticks do not depress so there's no L3/R3 function on this controller.Again similar to the X360 controller you're getting L2/R2 trigger-style buttons; the shoulder buttons L1/R1 are bumper style too quick presses. The controller buttons get a palette swap and aren't convex like on the X360 pad but otherwise very similar. Button presses are crisp and register immediately. The d-pad on the Stratus is actually a bit better than that on the X360 pad - a huge feature for anyone playing emulators and older games that are better with a d-pad.Additional features on the XL include a series of four-LEDs that display the status of the controller from battery life to connection to a device. Top mounted buttons can be pressed to quickly display the battery life or connect or disconnect to a device. A toggle switch located on the back of the controller turns the unit on/off.►BUILD QUALITY:SteelSeries makes some great peripherals and the Stratus XL is no exception. This is a nice, heavy-duty controller with a bit of weight to it. Every analog stick and button feels extremely well made - all things you'd expect from a top-of-the-line peripheral and one certainly priced at the top of the heap.The one area that I think SteelSeries could've done a bit better is with the analog sticks or rather the coating on the sticks. Each stick features a concave thumb-pocket, however, I still found that my thumbs would slip on the sticks when playing games. The finish on each is a bit too smooth and in intense gaming can be a liability. This is easy enough to mod but something I felt worth mentioning.►DEVICE SUPPORT:Okay so this device is clearly targeting folks who own Apple devices and I think that's terrific as it tends to be underserved when it comes to gaming. However, the as someone whose household includes Apple and Android and Windows devices I really, really wish SteelSeries had made this controller universally functional with each. I realize that a different Stratus controller is in the works for Android/PC but for the price this controller commands I really think it should support all three.►CLOSING:No doubt if you're a series Apple-oriented gaming enthusiast looking for the perfect controller you cannot go wrong with the Stratus XL. One gripe with the slipperiness of the thumbsticks shouldn't keep anyone away from this awesome controller!

"My two year old son is a bit too young to attempt putting a toy like this Bloco T-Rex and Triceratops foam models set together. So I along with help from my 10 year old nephew took a crack. We built both models and the end result surprised us both; the models are really neat looking and better than I think we both expected.►CONSTRUCTION & INSTRUCTIONS:Instructions included in this kit are similar to Lego or Ikea instructions; simply meaning you get a lot of pictures and no words. The instructions in this set are full-color and that's important as there are two shades of green that both dino's use and a lot of pieces that are different in color only. The high-density foam comes in large pre-cut sheets of foam material. You'll have to punch out each piece as you build your dino. I'll go ahead and state that you'll have a lot of little foam extras from punching out each of the pieces.The instructions are about as good as you can expect. The color, glossy insert is very good but there were moments where even I was confused as to how exactly everything came together. The other issue is that it can be difficult to discern exactly what shade of green the instructions are referencing. So while the age range is advertised at 6-12 years I think it best to have an adult handy to help unless your child has a lot of experience with these types of sets.Pieces fit together surprisingly well and consists of high-density foam and brightly colored ball joints made of plastic. A few of the pieces such as the triceratops horns don't fit as neatly together as they should. Also, you'll be using a lot of square sections that fit into rounded holes (e.g. the tail of each dino) which can be a bit challenging to get together.►PLAY & USE:The end result is a really neat looking foam dinosaur with articulating limbs and heads. The toys are surprisingly sturdy and something kids can actually play with. Minor adjustments are probably going to be a norm so I definitely suggest holding on to those instructions. One complaint I heard immediately from my nephew is that the T-Rex doesn't stand up easily on his own. You can adjust the legs but the dino is just too top heavy and tips over.Another neat aspect is that the T-Rex model has two options during the built process. You can build a T-Rex or modify halfway in the construction process to build another dinosaur - a Therizinosaurus. Which is sort of a razor clawed Velociraptor looking dino. So there definitely is replay value here. Of course your more creative kids can go off the instruction sheet and let their imaginations go with the foam pieces and build whatever kind of dino they want.For my nephew and I this was a fun afternoon and the dino's are now proudly displayed next to his Lego creations in his room. Fun toy and definitely something different for the little builders in your family, recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQJ5T1MTWWLVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTLHNI8#wasThisHelpful","RQJ5T1MTWWLVV","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.Orico's 7-Port Powered USB Hub is a cool combination of excellent style - seemingly lifted from the Apple school of design philosophy - and performance delivered at a competitive price-point.--------------------►PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:--------------------The very first thing I noticed about this USB hub is that it's one attractive piece of kit.

The hub is sturdy with a bit of weight to it. Each of the seven (7) USB 3.0 ports is spaced perfectly to allow a multitude of devices to connect.The second thing I realized after unboxing the hub is that it's powered. Which is terrific and a necessity if you're planning on connecting high-draw devices such as smartphones, tablets or external HDDs.

"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I've been enjoying my summer spending a good bit of time biking and like a lot of folks I fully take advantage of the technology packed into my smartphone to track and analyze my outings. I've used a few different bike mounts over the years and Bike2Power's U-TAG Universal Mounting Adapter is ranked at the top of the list in terms of functionality and usability.The U-TAG is two simple components - the sticky sided mount-adapter that I glued directly to the back of my smartphone case and the bike mount kit that clamps directly to the bike's handlebar.►INSTALLATION:Truthfully installation was a bit more difficult than I anticipated. First, the instructions include only pictures and a ton of numbers that aren't referencing any text. There's a thin rubber liner that goes between the plastic zip-tie like band that secures the bike mount. It's awkward to place the rubber liner then the mounts band over that and then use a (included) Allen wrench to secure the entire thing to the bike's handlebars... sound awkward? Well it is but the entire thing works so well once you realize how it fits together that I'm overlooking the slightly confusing installation.The other major plus that might not be readily apparent from the photos is that an Allen wrench is used to spin a hex-nut that feeds the band through the mount. What you end up getting is an incredible snug fit that doesn't slip around the bike's handlebars. Every other bike mount I've used has eventually needed tightening and adjustment. I've used this mount since mid-July 2-4 time per week and I haven't needed to adjust the mount!►USE:The single best feature of the U-TAG is how well it all comes together to form an incredibly secure mount  that let's you use your smartphone on rides. With the U-TAG mounting and then removing the phone is incredibly easy.»Mounting phone: Simply line up the mounting adapter plate on the back of the phone and give it a quarter-twist clockwise and you're set!»Dismounting phone: Depress the two quick release tabs and twist the phone counter-clockwise and your phone is free!►THE HIGHS:(+) Quick-on/Quick-off. The quick mount and dismounting system is superb compared my old awkward spring-loaded bike smartphone mounts(+) Secure. This mount hasn't moved an centimeter since I installed it on my bike's handlebars!(+) Profile. One frequent complaint about some other mounts I've used is how much the mount interferes with the phone. Not so here; you get the full phone presented to you without any additional ""stuff"" from the mount.►THE LOWS:(-) Packaging. I think the manufacturer/vendor has a great product and the presentation of this product (the package) is impressive with clear plastic containers for each component and bright, colorful inserts. But it's honestly complete overkill. There's so much waste material that it felt a shame to toss the container in my recycle bin.►CLOSING:This is a seriously good bike mount and one of those rare items I review that just comes together so well and functions perfectly. I'm planning on getting another mount for the wife.

"I've used hair cremes in various formats - forming cream, styling paste, pomade - and from differing manufacturers for about ten years. This is my first experience with Dove Men+Care styling paste and though it is a decidedly good product on its own, comparing it to leading brands or simply higher-end hair products makes the Dove product less desirable.First, let me mirror what's been stated in several other reviews - the price per ounce (at the time of this review) of the Dove Styling Paste is crazy. This stuff is priced higher by a wide margin than American Crew Forming Cream which I use regularly and consider a better product. Second, the Dove product suspiciously resembles (right down to the packaging) the bargain priced Suave Styling Paste with the addition of two ingredients: caffeine and cera alba.After using Dove's Styling Paste twice I can safely say that I do like the product. It holds my hair well throughout the day albeit with a bit more stiffness than the American Crew Forming Cream I regularly use. The Dove product isn't greasy and seems to hold up well under the intense heat and humidity of a Midwest summer. The Dove paste does smell a bit floral but wasn't noticeable after a few minutes.All in all I'm having a hard time recommending this product. If you're a diehard Dove Men+Care user then the higher price point may be acceptable. Personally if I were looking at something cheaper than the American Crew product I'd try out the cheaper Suave Styling Paste first to see if I could live without the (apparently pricey) caffeine and cera alba ingredients.Recommended with caveats - also check out American Crew or Suave Styling Paste.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8BA6BQ4VXB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOUQTJG#wasThisHelpful","R3N8BA6BQ4VXB8","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.Kootek's 2.4Ghz Wireless Game Controller for PC is a terrific, budget-oriented gaming peripheral that does a great job and compares favorably against other leading products in its class.--------------------►DESCRIPTION:--------------------The Kootek controller consists of two major components: the controller itself and a small factor USB receiver. Installation is quick and easy and fully supports plug-and-play functionality. On my Windows 7 machine the controller drivers were installed in about a minute and I was pretty much ready to go.The layout of the controller is very similar to Sony's Dualshock controllers even down to the color scheme of the buttons. There are some notable exceptions that I'll get to in a minute. The controller uses two (2) AA batteries (not included) and does feature a rear mounted on/off toggle to save the battery in addition to a built-in sleep timer function.Build quality is pretty good but just be aware that you're not getting the same level of quality that you'd get out of a first party peripheral like the Dualshock or the Microsoft Xbox 360 for PC controller. I would say that the Kootek falls somewhat short of Logitech's 2nd party controllers and probably more in line with device manufacturers like Mad Katz. Functionality is spot-on but some buttons do feel a bit flimsy or on the cheap side.--------------------►USE:--------------------I tested the Kootek with a few different emulators without any issue whatsoever. No special middleware management software like the DS3 (on PC) is required. I can confirm that the Kootek works perfectly with both Nestopia and ZSNES. I have not tested the controller with Steam but would expect no issues with the appropriately compatible game software.--------------------►THE GOOD:--------------------(+) Inexpensive. You're getting a good little controller for the money that includes a very similar layout to Sony's Dualshock with plenty of buttons for assignment.(+) Wireless. Again for the money involved it's surprising that wireless is offered at all much less that it works perfectly without any hiccups.(+) Android compatible. Need I say more? With the appropriate adapter you can get this running on your Android device!--------------------►WHAT COULD BE BETTER:--------------------(-) D-Pad. The directional-pad is not very good on this controller and harkens back to old-school mash-pads. I'm not a fan but thankfully the joysticks work much better.(-) Pressure sensitivity. Although the controller may look like a Dualshock you're definitely not getting pressure sensitive buttons here.--------------------►CLOSING:--------------------Overall if you're looking at a budget oriented game controller and don't want to shell out for the MS Xbox 360 Wireless Controller give the Kootek a shot!

"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.When it comes to jewelry or rings more specifically I'm not incredibly picky and definitely prefer simpler, cleaner designs over the bling look. When my wife selected my wedding band I asked her to pick a non-precious metal without any stones. She chose a simple titanium ring and I love it!The King Will 8mm Tungsten Carbide ring is along the same lines as my wedding band; simple, clean and uncluttered. Personally if you're even remotely considering this ring on the product pictures I strongly recommend at least ordering it; the ring looks better in person than in the photos! I wasn't sure I'd like the polished look (compared to my titanium ring which has a matte finish) but it does look sharp; very similar in appearance to highly polished chrome.This is a beefy ring and feels equally heavy; again especially compared against my titanium ring. The weight is noticeable but not in a bad way. I've used this ring daily for two weeks and it's indeed heavy duty with not a scratch on it. For my money I'd much rather have a simple, good looking ring like this one than a much more expensive store bought, precious metal ring.

"I'm using this 64GB Micro-SDXC card in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Ed. tablet as expandable memory mostly for holding multimedia and it's been working great so far! This is my first experience with the Gigastone brand as I typically use SanDisk, Transcend, or Sony memory products. So far my experience has been great with no performance or data loss issues with the Gigastone card.In my tablet the total available memory after formating was 58.42GB. I'm using the card to port around a few movies; mostly shows my son likes to watch over and over again and where WiFi or 4G coverage can be spotty (the park or playground for example). Playback has been terrific and again no complaints with performance. I also threw on an emulator for an old-school game system and a bunch of games and play them directly off the SD card without any issue.The adapter works great too. I mainly use the adapter with my Kingston media bridge to dump files from my Windows 7 PC onto the card. No issues at all there.The Gigastone brand is definitely one I'll consider in the future.

"* While I've got no problem wearing pink I opted to give these shoes to my wife so I'm ghostwriting this for her as she's the person actually wearing the shoesMy wife recently gave birth to our second child and received the all clear from her doctor to resume her exercising routine that includes walking, running, yoga, etc. In terms of shoes my wife isn't particularly brand loyal; she's run the gamut of athletic shoe brands from Mizuno, Nike, Puma, Saucony, New Balance and probably some others I'm forgetting. She has used these NB Vazee Pace Running Shoes for about a week and loves them!► Fit & Support:In simple terms these shoes are pretty much true to size. My wife is typically an 8.5 normal width size and these NBs were spot on. Arch support is equally terrific with no problems during some tune up runs (typically 3 miles). My wife usually likes shoes with good thick soles and plenty of ankle support (no minimus shoes for her) and the Vazee's checked those boxes as well.► Comfort:Again, she is super impressed with the Vazee shoes. She loved them so much after taking them to yoga she kept them on while running errands. My wife really loves how lightweight the shoes are while still offering lots of support and plenty of cushion on runs. The mesh upper is breathable and helps keep her feet cool.► First Week Impression:Both my wife and I have positive experiences with New Balance shoes. This pair of Vazee shoes is no exception. My wife has used the shoes for runs, walking, yoga, everyday errand running and loves them. The Vazee line is definitely a brand she would purchase.

"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.I recently wrapped up a complete renovation of a guest bathroom in my home that included a new tub/shower and of course the requisite fixtures. I was appalled at the price of fixtures; the Moen tub/shower combo I chose was close to $200 (not including the valve which added another $200) and that is for a ""cheaper"" chrome finish!When I was offered the chance to try AKDYs 8"" Round Rainfall Shower-head I initially passed; after all how good can a $15 shower head really be if all the leading brands are ten times the price? I ended up deciding to give the showerhead a shot since I needed a new shower head in my master bathroom anyway. My old master bathroom shower head had an annoying habit of no longer staying in position and would tilt down constantly.► Contents in the box:1) 8"" Round Rainfall Shower Head2) Small roll of white teflon pipe tape► Installation:Installation was incredibly easy and I did it in a few minutes. You'll need a few tools on hand, probably most notably channel locks to remove the old shower head and to also securely tighten the new one. I think it's great that Teflon pipe tape is included in the packaging. You'll want to clean the pipe after your old shower head is removed with steel wool or a specialized pipe-cleaning tool before applying the teflon pipe tape to the threads. Then simply screw on the new shower head, tighten, and test to make sure you have no leaks. That's it!► Performance:So I'll say straight away that I'm not a fan of the ""waterfall"" feature of this showerhead. The idea is that by twisting the middle portion of the head water is diverted through the narrow central slit to create a ""waterfall"" effect. It's a novelty and not really all that great. However, performance out of the oval, shower portion is terrific! Consider me pleasantly surprised to really like this shower head! My wife loved it too!► Closing:If you're looking for a cheap alternative to the insane prices that new shower fixtures go for then consider the AKDY. This shower head really cannot compare to better known brands like Moen, Delta, etc. in terms of build quality but for a cheap plastic alternative in a pinch, for a basement bathroom, or just as a replacement to an ageing shower head this is very good!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZD2KMWAQGM3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1O1FWS#wasThisHelpful","R2ZD2KMWAQGM3T","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this grill brush to replace my worn out Weber grill brush. I have a Weber S-310 grill with stainless steel grates (the ""Flavorizor"" bars type) and my old brush just wasn't getting the job done any longer.The Alpha Grillers Heavy Duty BBQ brush is pretty good with one exception - it lacks any type of scraper tool. So for really tough burnt on chunks of stuff on your grill this brush likely won't get the entire job done. For regular cleaning of the grill grates and for things not super charred-on the surface of the grates this brush is excellent.The overall construction seems good and I'm hoping to get quite a few seasons out of this brush. High marks for the extra long and strong plastic handle. The braided steel neck is up to the rigors of cleaning the BBQ as well. Personally I do like the brush but do recommend having a scraper handy. I kept my old Weber brush solely for the scraper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J74PVA65Z2UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9Q04BS#wasThisHelpful","R3J74PVA65Z2UC","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.Many years ago I served in the US military and used tactical gloves that are similar to the Vorosy Full Finger Tactical Gloves. I've left the military but still occasionally use my old gear for paintball or hunting and that's exactly where I used these gloves.Compared to my military issued gloves the Vorosy are quite a bit more lightweight and softer. The gloves seem well built and feature good stitching, heavy-duty nylon wrist straps with a metal buckle and a thick strip of Velcro to keep the gloves on. The knuckle protection offered here is quite good too with a lightweight plastic coating. I opted for the gloves in green and these appear to match US woodland green pretty closely; similar to the green found on US equipment prior to the move to digital patterns.Performance after an afternoon of paintballing was great. The gloves got filthy with sweat and dirt and cleaned up better than expected in a slop sink with Oxyclean.Sizing is pretty spot-on too. I opted for the medium size and they fit my hands almost perfectly (5'10"" 175lbs).

"For this novice DIY'er the Kraus KEF-15600ORB was about the easiest upgrade to a wet-bar sink that's imaginable. This faucet is advertised as a bathroom fixture but as my bathroom is entirely chrome this wouldn't be a good fit so I decided to replace my aging Delta faucet with the Kraus and it was a simple but dramatic improvement!--------------------DESCRIPTION:--------------------The first thing anyone is likely to notice is just how friggin' big (to use a technical term) this faucet is. It stands almost 15-inches tall (14.48"" x 2.36"")! So if subtlety is your thing keep looking. The entire package as it arrived from Kraus is top-notch including the box the faucet came packed in. The faucet is heavy duty with a beautiful antique rubbed-bronze finish and white (ceramic looking) handle that gives this faucet a farmhouse feel.The Delta faucet this replaced was aging; at least 10 years old but not dripping yet. I'm very happy that the Kraus has a ceramic cartridge which should provide many, many years of drip-free performance.In the box you'll get:► KEF-15600 ORB faucet► Reusable cloth bag (the faucet comes wrapped in)► Cleaning cloth► Hot/cold metal water lines (2ft.)► Instruction manual--------------------INSTALLATION & PERFORMANCE:--------------------Even if you've never replaced a faucet this is completely approachable to anyone! You need some basic tools including a wrench, Phillips screwdriver, pipe tape (I use teflon tape), and silicone sealant (I use the dry clear variety). If you're planning on also updating the sink accessories to match the faucet you'll likely need a pipe wrench and sealing compound (plumbers putty).My install was simple and just involved removing the old faucet and water lines and installing the Kraus faucet to the sink and the new water lines to my under-sink valves.For the novice Kraus has provided very good instructions complete with diagrams to get the job done. But there's nothing here that will present a challenge.Performance post installation has been superb. The single-lever water valve works smoothly and easily makes minute adjustments to water temperature and flow.One word of caution, I installed this faucet in my basement wet-bar and not in a standard flushmount sink and not in a bathroom style vessel sink (on top of the cabinet surface). With the height of the faucet and the depth of my sink water is falling out the faucet and traveling over 2ft before hitting the sink bottom. This can, at maximum flow rate, cause a bit of a mess from the slash. So just something to consider if using this faucet.--------------------CLOSING:--------------------This is my first experience with Kraus and an overwhelmingly positive one at that. Kraus is most definitely a brand I would hold up with the likes of Moen, Delta and Kohler and a brand I will consider for future purchases. Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZ68N2BTDVE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHQW85Y#wasThisHelpful","R1KZ68N2BTDVE5","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product for free as part of the Vine program and per usual I glance at reviews to see what others thought of the same product before I submit my own review. I am a bit surprised to find that this hair gel has received so many negative reviews - overwhelmingly 1 or 2-star reviews (as of the writing of this review). That has not been my experience using this product for a few days, however, I do not have the history with Jack Black Hair Gel that some other reviewers do.My ""go-to"" hair styling product for the last several years has been American Crew Forming Cream. That product strikes a good compromise between styling hold and control and avoids hard, stiff hair a.k.a. helmet head. It is, however, a bit pricey so I am always on the lookout for other products with similar performance at a cheaper price. I think Jack Black Building Hair Gel is that product even if the savings are marginal.I've worn this product two days; both days work days where I keep my hair neat and tidy. The product has performed great! The gel is clear, definitely fruity smelling (no surprise there), and holds my hair while not giving me hard, stiff hair. The Jack Black definitely is stiffer than my American Crew forming cream but nothing like the cheap drugstore gel of my youth. Honestly any stiffer and you might as well buy a tub-o-gel (in neon blue) from the drugstore.I found that styling my (short) hair was as easy as the forming cream I use. The Jack Black product held my hair throughout the day without issue. So for me this is definitely a product that I would purchase and use again.I did deduct one star for the following reasons:► Stiffness: Simply compared to the American Crew product I regularly use.► Smell: I'm not a fan of the fruity smell of the product when first putting it on. It's not noticeable after a few minutes but definitely perceptible at first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQ5ZN15JW7PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKLV9QS#wasThisHelpful","R1FQ5ZN15JW7PS","A2Q2A6JKY95RTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q2A6JKY95RTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I came across this movie as a big Scott Adkins and Wu Jing fan.  Sure the nationalistic overtones were ham-fisted and groan-inducing at times, but no different from your typical Michael Bay movie.  On the other hand, the action scenes were very well done, with generally realistic tactical movements, reloading, accurate gear (check imfdb) and fingers off triggers.  This movie should appeal to anyone who likes believable cinematic gunplay.This movie may be a disappointment to Scott Adkins and Wu Jing fans such as myself.  I was expecting a big climactic kung-fu showdown since both actors are exceptionally physically talented.  Instead, we have a more subdued concluding fight scene, but understandable given that they were going for a more 'realistic' fight.  Wolf Warriors had high production values and was quite entertaining.

"Long time watcher of Strike Back (""SB"").  SB is to guns what Spartacus was to swords.  Pure wall-to-wall action with multiple gunfights every episode.  Although sometimes the action is improbable, i.e. Scott and Stonebridge wear ""hero armor"" while poorly trained henchmen rush headlong into their gunfire, it's generally very well choreographed and far superior to anything else on TV and most Hollywood films.  Scott and Stonebridge have an affable, sarcastic and easy chemistry while demonstrating believable tactical sense.  I can't think of another show where two characters clear rooms, cover each other, call out mag changes and actually reload.  Not to mention the ladies of SB are just as good.Kudos to Phillip Winchester for doing such an authentic sounding British accent.  I didn't realize he *wasn't* British until I checked IMDB.  I think SB Season 3 (or Season 4 if you count the prequel) is one of the strongest in terms of plot, action, and global filming locations.  It's better balanced than the plodding Season 3 (although I loved Tywin Lannister) and more action heavy than Season 2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFUSUX1RX2TF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122UCHYC#wasThisHelpful","RFUSUX1RX2TF7","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the Rhodium/blue tinted version of these TF 144s, popularized by Daniel Craig in the James Bond movies ""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Skyfall"".  I had some doubts about the authenticity of the item, but Sunglass Express shipped these quickly via Prime, and with all Tom Ford branded accessories included.  Additionally, Tom Ford identification was etched into the arms.  A far better deal than ordering direct from Tom Ford.Construction was solid, and these TF 144s are much sturdier than my Ray Ban Aviators.  The TF144s are known for being narrow; they fit more snugly than my RB Aviators, but not to the point of being too tight.  I would say the fit was perfect and sat evenly on my nose bridge.  If you notice in press pictures, the TF 144s are a touch too small for Mr. Craig.The biggest drawback of the TF144s is their lack of polarization.  Note that a lack of polarization does NOT mean these particular TF144s are not authentic; if you check the Tom Ford manufacturer's website, the TF144s advertised there also lack polarization.  While the lack of polarization has the advantage of enabling viewing of cell phones and other LCD displays, it also causes considerable eye strain on a sunny day.I hope Tom Ford releases a polarized version of the Rhodium TF144s in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BTJHATN7LOJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055T10Q4#wasThisHelpful","R3BTJHATN7LOJO","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that other reviewers were initially confused, but this set is stainless steel, NOT non-stick.  I prefer stainless and find it superior to non-stick cooking.  The pans do have a tendency to tarnish over time and will lose their magnificent luster, but Barkeeper's Friend will help maintain some of that original sheen.I have mixed thoughts on this Viking set and give it a 3.5 star rating, rounded up to 4 stars on Amazon's ranking system.  On one hand, it is a beautiful starter set with thoughtful touches, e.g. transparent glass lids and internal volume markings, but you're also paying extra for the brand name.  Furthermore, the Contemporary line is one of their cheaper sets.  I think the brand markup is therefore unreasonable.I prefer the Calphalon Tri Ply line, which performs no worse on my induction range and also offers similar Tri Ply construction at a more competitive cost.  Furthermore, I find the Calphalon Tri Ply comparable 3 quart saucepan more comfortable to hold because it offers an additional, smaller handle.PROS:- Viking brand name- Solid construction and hefty weight- Internal volume markings- Taller sides on fry pan prevent spillage- Mirrored exteriorCONS:- Unreasonable price markup given cheaper line- Saucepan and frypan uncomfortable to hold one-handed due to high arcing handle design and considerable weight- Saucepan, as compared to comparable Calphalon Tri Ply saucepan, difficult to hold one handed due to weight and lacks additional smaller handle","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EWZBAHBV1WW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI7KPWS#wasThisHelpful","R24EWZBAHBV1WW","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Rhodium/blue tinted version of these TF 144s, popularized by Daniel Craig in the James Bond movies ""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Skyfall"". I had some doubts about the authenticity of the item, but Sunglass Express shipped these quickly via Prime, and with all Tom Ford branded accessories included. Additionally, Tom Ford identification was etched into the arms. A far better deal than ordering direct from Tom Ford.Construction was solid, and these TF 144s are much sturdier than my Ray Ban Aviators. The TF144s are known for being narrow; they fit more snugly than my RB Aviators, but not to the point of being too tight. I would say the fit was perfect and sat evenly on my nose bridge. If you notice in press pictures, the TF 144s are a touch too small for Mr. Craig.The biggest drawback of the TF144s is their lack of polarization. Note that a lack of polarization does NOT mean these particular TF144s are not authentic; if you check the Tom Ford manufacturer's website, the TF144s advertised there also lack polarization. While the lack of polarization has the advantage of enabling viewing of cell phones and other LCD displays, it also causes considerable eye strain on a sunny day.I hope Tom Ford releases a polarized version of the Rhodium TF144s in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6KNYE1AWDUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00372ERM0#wasThisHelpful","RY6KNYE1AWDUV","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The critics really trashed this movie, but I enjoyed it.  Better than the average VoD movie.  Sure it was a plot we've seen rehashed hundreds of times, but it was nice seeing Milla Jovovich play a character outside of her usual Resident Evil persona.  Dylan McDermott plays the same character here as he does in every single show.  Pierce Brosnan was a nice addition, even though he seemingly plays the world's most incompetent assassin.

"Absolution was pretty entertaining.  Predictable plot involving nameless Eastern Europeans trafficking girls?  Check.  Steven Seagal wearing his trademark tinted glasses and getting doubled in action sequences?  Check.  Menacing boss getting beaten down by Seagal in five seconds?  Check.  Willing suspension of disbelief?  Check.While Absolution is no Under Siege, it was an entertaining action flick.  Adding Byron Mann as Seagal's sidekick was a good idea, since not only did Mann provide a light-hearted athletic counterpoint to Seagal, but he performed his own stunts as well.

"I was pleasantly surprised by Infini; it's a pretty slick low-budget film.  Although it borrows heavily from existing sci fi movies, e.g. Aliens, The Thing, Event Horizon, etc.., the storyline is engaging.  Some minor quibbles; a) I had trouble understanding some of the characters due to their thick Aussie accents, and b) the middle section drags a bit.When I first watched Infini, I was greatly confused by the beginning sequence.  I'll explain it below (**NOTE, SPOILERS FOLLOW**).  Key to understanding the beginning is paying attention when a few background characters talk about time dilation.1) Captain Johanson's squad slipstreams back to the East Coast Command HQ.  They're held under quarantine while being questioned about outbreak exposure.  This same scene is repeated at the end of the movie, after we follow the squad's linear adventures on Infini.  The storyline is like one giant flashback.2) Whit on his first day of work at the West Coast Division.  Stuff starts to hit the fan when a random squad slipstreams into Infini, spends some time there (recall time dilation), and returns infected.  The West Coast Division Captain orders a random jump ""dirty jump"" which happens to be to Infini.  Whit and his buddy, Pontner, dirty jump, but the Captain is left behind because Pontner is unable to reprogram his APEX unit due to insufficient security clearance.3) At East Coast Division HQ, they learn of the demise of the West Coast Division.  The chief briefs Captain Johanson's squad and sends them to Infini.  Then the rest of the movie unfolds in linear fashion on Infini.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQW8ZE62850EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBUEPZ2#wasThisHelpful","RQW8ZE62850EB","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read several of the other reviews prior to trying mine, I was a little apprehensive about the usefulness and quality of the machine.  I'm happy to say that I'm very pleased, after having successfully made a batch of sweet potato fries in just 20 minutes.I took 1 medium sized sweet potato, sliced it up into fairly non-uniform wedges, and mixed the wedges in about 3/4 to 1 Tbsp of olive oil.  I decided to increase the amount of oil over what was recommended after seeing that the wedges were insufficiently coated.  I also skipped the washing step, since sweet potatoes already have quite a bit of moisture, and further washing seemed unnecessary.  I turned the dial to 400 degrees F, turned the timer to 25 minutes, then loaded the basket at the 20 min mark and waited.  Didn't even have to turn the wedges midway through.  At the 20 minute mark, they came out pretty crispy!  Slightly burned, slightly soft.  A lot better than what I'd expect to make at home in the oven, but not quite as good deep fried restaurant ones, obviously.  I might try adding an egg white wash to the olive oil mixture next time, to further increase crispiness.PROS:- Looks like Eve from Wall-E- Non-stick basket very easy to clean, although I worry about grease sliding underneath the basket.- I didn't find it noisy at all; more like a hushed fan.- Made semi-professional tasting sweet potato fries with minimal effort- Heats up very quickly- Simple, no-fuss operationCONS:- Non-stick basket can't be removed, making it difficult to clean underneath- Tiny font on machine is difficult to read- Probably can't make deep-fried OreosNow that I can make semi-decent fries, I'm looking forward to hosting a few more BBQs this summer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WI7H6DAZJP2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYJW2A#wasThisHelpful","R2WI7H6DAZJP2H","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Will update my review after a few washings.**May 20, 2015 Update**Now that I've worn the Mabuas for a couple weeks, I can comment further.  And my opinion of them has only improved!- 1st wearing was a little too tight; the Mabuas dug into my skin making them slightly painful to wear.- 2nd-4th wearings; Mabuas just right.- After 1st washing, no change to elasticity or tightness.  Non-slip heel works as advertised.Would buy again!  Excellent durability despite washing.

"I recall seeing the trailers for Blackhat and Michael Mann's named attached to the directing credits, but never had a chance to watch it in theaters.  I was excited to check it out on Amazon.  Poor decision.The first half of the movie was interesting enough, as the team tracks down the trail of a mysterious hacker.  Leehom Wang was more entertaining to watch than Chris Hemsworth.  However, pacing suffers in the second half and many plot points, e.g. the romance between Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei, felt forced.  Minor characters are poorly introduced; was I supposed to care when the barely mentioned HK police inspector is gunned down?Furthermore, Mann's reliance on long shutter speeds was terribly annoying.  I never liked the B-roll-esque footage it produces.  Its application in Black Hat made me think I was watching a home video.  Moreover, the combination of long shutter speeds using HD cameras and regular film cameras was distracting.  I realize it might be ""avant-garde"" but I wished that Mann had ditched this technique in Public Enemies.It's a film that tries too hard to be stylish and forgets its foundation.  I think that part of the reason it's not as stylish as say Collateral, which employed many of the same filming techniques, is that its characters weren't nearly as exciting and fleshed out.The action scenes were decent.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1YFXK35OWZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIF58EE#wasThisHelpful","RW1YFXK35OWZV","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to echo what some of my colleagues have already written.For $150, the Nesco FS-10 presents a reasonable and introductory level food slicer.  It's a bit of a niche tool since I imagine most people buy their meats pre-sliced.  However, the Nesco may be perfect for people who turn out large roasts or buy in bulk.  At the least, the Nesco presents a better option than hand slicing.I was a little surprised at the construction.  Given the pictures, I was expecting a sturdier built slicer.  Most of the parts seemed to be made of plastic or cheap aluminum.  Additionally, the footprint was quite large.  This is my first food slicer, and I was surprised at how loud and noisy it was while operating.As for cleaning the blades, I had some difficulty loosening the locking screw, since the suggested quarter didn't quite do the trick.  It's really quite tightly locked in.  Once you loosen it though, cleanup is quite easy.The Nesco does the job, but I would have preferred stronger construction.

"Cat food reviews tend to be very subjective, so I'll just say the cat loved it.  When I opened the can, he started meowing loudly, then quickly devoured the entire can and licked it clean.  I smelled it before serving the cat, and it was quite pleasant; not much different from the canned tuna fish I had for lunch.  The fact that it is real fish and grain free is a big plus.

"Admittedly, I was never much a fan of the last generation of Alienware laptops.  They were too industrial in appearance, and had all the aesthetics of a giant brick.  I can happily say that the new Alienware 15 is now much better looking, without sacrificing any performance.  While it's no Dell XPS 13 or MacBook Pro, it does look better than its nearest crosstown rival, the ASUS ROG.APPEARANCE:  I really like the exterior look of the new Alienware 15.  The corners now sport angled indentations which lend a slimming effect.  The entire top shell of the Alienware is covered in lightly brushed aluminum (no plastic here!) that thankfully resists fingerprints.  A distinctive and trademark alien head rests on the center of the top shell.  The main body and lower shell of the Alienware is formed from a matte plastic material that feels very durable, but does have the tendency to collect oily fingerprints.  The Alienware feels very solidly constructed.  It also sports considerable heft with its 7 lb weight.Surprisingly, there isn't an optical drive available, despite the laptop's vast real estate.  I would've thought they could fit at least a slot loading drive.  The lack of an optical drive is a minor quibble on my part since I can't recall the last time I actually used a CD/DVD/Bluray, but for those of you which actually still use that type of media, this may be an issue.  Otherwise, input options abound on the Alienware.  There are no less than 4 x USB 3.0 ports, a mini-display port, HDMI out 1.4 port, Alienware Graphics Amplifier port, and 9-in-1 Media Card reader to name a few.SPECS/COMPETITION:  The Alienware 15 is pretty much loaded for bear.  The Amazon configuration is a bit cheaper than the retail price on the Alienware website, although I would've liked to see Amazon offer a Windows 7 alternative configuration.The closest 15.6"" gaming competitor to the Alienware 15 seems to be the ASUS ROG GL551JW-DS74 15.6-Inch IPS FHD Gaming Laptop, NVIDIA GTX960M, sold on Amazon for about $300 less.  The ASUS has a slightly higher clock speed processor, faster hard drive, optical drive, lighter weight, but a weaker 960M graphics card with 1GB less video memory, and in my opinion, a less attractive exterior design as well.  The 970M on the Alienware 15 as compared to the 960M has 1280 vs. 1024 CUDA cores, 1038 MHz vs. 950 MHz core clock Turbo, and a 192 bit vs. 128 bit memory interface.  The 970M reportedly has about a 40% higher 3DMark score than the 960M.  For Battlefield 4, the performance difference between a 970M equipped notebook and a 960M equipped one is considerable.  At 1920 x 1080 AA 4x MS settings, a 970M can hit about 55 fps while the 960M manages 33 fps.The 960M's bottleneck lies in its limited memory interface and 2GB of memory.  The 960M is more of a mid-level gaming card for the price conscious.  If gaming is your pleasure, then you may do better paying the $300 to get the much faster 970M on the Alienware 15.  The only other alternative I can think of is the Sager NP8652, but Sager isn't as mainstream a brand as Alienware or Asus.  In essence, I think the Alienware is competitively equipped and priced.OPERATION: Boot times are fast with the 128 GB SSD.  I had some initial concerns about the Alienware 15 only being equipped with a 5400 RPM drive, but performance seemed fine.The Klipsch branded speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop.  Mids and highs sound crystal clear, and there is even a fair bit of bass.  I appreciate that Alienware is using Creative SoundBlaster X-Fi, rather than the Realtek on-motherboard solution that most manufacturers tend to use.  Also the use of Killer NIC is an added premium touch.The keyboard has a set of programmable macro keys on the left.  Interesting, but I'm unlikely to use them.  The keyboard itself has a very good tactile feel and typing feels natural.  With its fully customizable AlienFX light displays, the Alienware 15 looks gorgeous in a dimly lit room.  I appreciated the touchpad itself having a backlight.The IPS screen looks excellent when displaying 1080P content.  No dead pixels as far as I could discern, and backlight bleeding is minimal to nonexistent.  Colors are vibrant and saturated.  Thankfully, bloatware is quite minimal.Battery life is about as decent as one can expect for this behemoth.  I averaged about 5-6 hours with light usage, 4 hours with heavy video/multimedia usage, and 1-2 hours in gaming mode.FINAL THOUGHTS:  I like what Alienware has done with its new generation of gaming laptops.  The Alienware 15 presents a lot of performance in a stylish package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FMZMDCJ1ZRJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJGGGC#wasThisHelpful","R2FMZMDCJ1ZRJ8","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a big fan of Belvita biscuits, so I was curious to try these alternates from competitor Nature Valley.Upon opening the package, there was a strong and pleasing blueberry fragrance.  There are 4 biscuits to each self-contained package.  Each biscuit was slightly brittle, although the brittleness is probably not from fiber, as there is only 1g of fiber per biscuit.  The shape of each biscuit was remarkably reminiscent of Belvita's; surely Nature Valley could have come up with a more original design?

"Happy to add this Baker's decorating kit to my growing collection of OXO items.  I like the easily washable silicone tubes, which beat the messiness and environmental unfriendliness of a pastry bag.  The individual pieces fit together well for a solid connection.  For a starter kit and very competitive price, it comes with six very handy, commonly used tips.  I furthermore appreciated the pictorials included in both the instruction manual and side of the box that demonstrated what types of designs each tip creates.Only complaint I can think of is that the volume of the silicone tubes is quite small, limiting application to small decorations for cookies and cakes.

"I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between unrated cuts and their theatrical counterparts, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: some SPOILERS FOLLOW).1) The unrated cut is still a bloodless affair.  No digital blood either.2) Most of the action scenes are longer by a few seconds.  Christmas, in particular, receives two significantly extended action scenes towards the end.  Doc/Galgo/Luna/Yin Yang also benefit from slightly longer action scenes.3) There is some extra dialogue between Barney and Stonebanks at the end of their climactic fight.4) Language is slightly stronger in the unrated cut, with one or two more uses of ""MF-er"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1V9MCVT0J1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PGANUOW#wasThisHelpful","R1E1V9MCVT0J1J","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to agree with the other reviews about the setup issues.  The iP110's largest asset, e.g. its portability, is also its greatest Achilles heel.  The small footprint means there's no LCD screen, which makes setup an infinitely more confusing and frustrating process.I consider myself pretty tech savvy, but I had great difficulty trying to get the Pixma to work with my wireless network.  So much so that I just gave up and paired it with my phone; a slightly easier process.  I would suggest just going the route of smartphone setup since the Pixma seems to be giving everyone headaches when attempting setup over wireless.For its size, the print quality and speed are impressive, as is the low noise.  I plan on throwing this into my backpack and printing documents from my phone while on the go.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VUEDH6X2INFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV9LL9Q#wasThisHelpful","R1VUEDH6X2INFN","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As other reviewers have noted, these NutriGrain bars are similar to Fig Newtons in taste and texture.  I found them much sweeter than Fig Newtons however, much to my disliking.Size wise, their dimensions suggest the NutriGrains are best for a small snack.  They're small enough to fit several in your pocket or purse.  I liked the apple cinnamon/blueberry flavors the best, and the strawberry flavor the least.  I'm not so hot on the use of artificial flavoring.  I give it 3.5 stars, which rounds up to 4 stars.PROS:- Good value for the money- Convenient size- Brings back childhood memories- Kids probably like itCONS:- Much too sweet- Artificial ingredients- Unpopular strawberry flavor- Very little protein","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AXH1UJUMCHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K9ZV1AY#wasThisHelpful","R1AXH1UJUMCHO","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The BIC Atlantis is a handsome looking pen, and certainly a lot more elegant looking than the plain BIC pens that we've come to know and love.  The ink writes well, without bleeding.  However, it's missing some premium features, such as a finger cushion, which separates it from higher end products from Pilot or Uni-ball.

"The VA2455sm is a wallet friendly, good looking monitor.UNBOXING: The bezel is 3/4 glossy black plastic, and the lower bezel portion has a textured, faux metallic surface.  Standard menu buttons line the bottom, and DVI/VGA/power inputs lie in the back.  The monitor has a single blue LED power light mounted in the center, which looks great at night.INITIAL USE:  I have a Digital Storm PC (Geforce GTX 680 with 4GB RAM) running Windows 7, and Windows automatically installed the drivers for the monitor.  There were ZERO dead or stuck pixels.  Colors look very vibrant on this monitor, and blacks were very good.  Also, no backlight bleeding that I could discern.  I watched a couple 1080P movies which looked excellent on the new monitor.  I turned down the brightness and contrast.  So far text looks excellent, and no headaches from using the monitor.  Perhaps the integrated blue filter works as intended.CONS:  There is NO height adjustment on this monitor, TILT only.  I guess I'll have to find some old books to increase the height.  Furthermore, the base stand doesn't seem well suited to the monitor as the monitor mounting is slightly rickety.  The integrated speakers (Viewsonic really seems to like adding speakers onto its monitors) are pretty much useless, and I disabled these the first opportunity I had through the on-screen menu.  I wish that Viewsonic had deleted the unnecessary speakers and instead added a height adjustment function.  Lastly, Viewsonic only included a VGA-VGA cable in the packaging when I was expecting at least a DVI cable.These complaints aside, the VA 2455sm is a gorgeous looking LED monitor that is as easy on the wallet as it is on the eyes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNMSPTB84BNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O23HKFO#wasThisHelpful","R3RNMSPTB84BNC","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between extended cuts and their theatrical counterparts, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW).The extended cut runs approximately 3 minutes longer longer than the theatrical cut.  The new scenes are pretty minor, although there is significantly more CGI blood in the first battle.1) The first battle against the Bessi is a lot bloodier in the Extended Cut.  Throats are slit, combatants are impaled, and people are stabbed in bloody manners by various bladed weapons.2) General Sitacles makes unwanted romantic advances towards Atalanta.3) General Sitacles threatens to execute Phineas for failing to detect the Bessi ambush, but Phineas is saved by Autolycus's intervention.4) Hercules has a flashback to King Eurystheus condemning him for the alleged murder of his family.Sure Hercules isn't going to win any Oscars anytime soon, but I found it an entertaining popcorn flick.

"I wish I had the Eton on my last international trip!  I recall several instances when I didn't have the right power converter, and my phone was almost out of battery and needed a quick charge.I like the Eton's ruggedized and grippable exterior.  The availability of dual USB output and charging light indicators is helpful.  Furthermore, the Eton's miniature LED flashlight is a thoughtful touch and has a decent throw despite being small in size- sure beats using my smartphone as a flashlight.  Smartphone charging time is fast and my Galaxy S4 was fully charged in less than an hour.However, my Eton-charged smartphone drained just as quickly as it had charged.  Despite being fully charged with the Eton, my S4 drained to just 25% battery in 4 hours with little to no activity.  Additionally, the flashlight/charging indicator button is too small and well-camouflaged that I still have trouble locating it along the spine of the cover.The Eton is helpful if you need a quick charge and don't have access to a plug.

"There's a lot to like about the Farberware New Traditions, with its low price point being foremost.  I imagine this set will appeal greatly to college students and young professionals.Amazon's description oddly doesn't contain the exact pots/pans, but here's what's included in the package:1-quart covered saucepan2-quart covered saucepan3-quart saute pan5-quart covered dutch oven8-inch nonstick skillet9 3/4-inch nonstick skilletNon-stick Slotted Turner, Slotted & Solid SpoonPROS:- Low price- Stainless steel elegance- Transparent lids- Generally good build quality- Bonus utensils- Non-riveted, thermally cool handlesCONS:- Lid tolerances could be better- High arc-ing handles a little uncomfortableI wasn't expecting the addition of the slotted turner, slotted spoon and solid spoon, so these were an added bonus!  I find that all the pot/pan sizes are very practical.  Ideally a larger dutch oven on the order of 8-quarts would have been more preferable, but the 5-quart one is of a decent size for one-two persons.  The lid of the 5-quart dutch oven can be used interchangeably with the 3-quart saute pan and 9 3/4-inch non-stick skillet.The Farberware New Traditions performed well in the kitchen and their stainless steel finish looked elegant.  My main cookware comprises Calphalon Tri-Ply which have considerably thicker sidewalls and heftier construction, but the Farberware still felt solidly built.  I like Farberware's glass, transparent lids which enabled me to look inside while cooking.  Unlike my Calphalons which have handles riveted to the bases, the Farberware has a completely smooth finish in the interior, which means no excess food particles getting stuck in the rivet joints.My dislikes were minor.  I didn't like the loose fitting lids, and I think there could have been tighter tolerances.  This may not bother everyone and the lids didn't roll around while cooking, but it's just a pet peeve of mine.  I found the handles a little uncomfortable to grip due to their high arc-ing angle, but it's not like you're constantly gripping the handles while cooking.In conclusion, it's an excellent and comprehensive starter set at a very attractive price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22V3Z0R6TBT6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8XOD10#wasThisHelpful","R22V3Z0R6TBT6B","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This OXO colander arrived at just the right moment.  My other colander was starting to collect mold in the holes and I instantly appreciated this OXO.  It's sturdily constructed, and the good grips handles provide thermal insulation as well.  I like the fact that it has 3 feet, which will likely prevent the colander holes from collecting mold due to its elevation above my counter surface.I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the 3 feet were attached in such a way that they block some of the holes.

"Don't let the MSRP fool you.  For $70, this is an excellent bread machine.I've always wanted to try a bread machine, but never wanted to fork over the money for an expensive Pansonic or Zojirushi.  Enter the West Bend with its *very* competitively priced 41413.  I think this price point is perfect.  Sure, the functions might be a bit more basic than its competitors, but it gets the job done.  Deliciously so, if I might add.  The 2-lb loaf size is perfect for individual consumption, and a single loaf lasted me approximately over one week.  So far I've baked 3 different loaves; country white, oatmeal, and whole grain.  All three turned out and easily.PROS:- Very easy to program.  Delayed start is handy.- Baking pan cleans off easily- Takes the complexity out of baking- Apartment smells amazing- Cheap price point- Convenient 2 lb loaves- Small counter space footprintCONS:- Bread loaf tops are non-uniformly formed (see discussion on this below)I haven't yet tried the gluten-free recipe, but I'm happy to know that West Bend at least offers it as an option.  The baking pan cleans off easily, even if it must be hand-washed.  My only gripe about the West Bend is that the tops of my loaves were not formed consistently.  Sometimes the tops were completely even post kneading; other times they were misshapen.  Granted they all tasted the same, but I would've liked them a little more evenly formed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TDW6BWRIIDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXQ6MLI#wasThisHelpful","R2TDW6BWRIIDX","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My main vacuum cleaner was a Hoover, but like all traditional vacuum cleaners it's heavy and requires taking out the cord and stowing it after usage.Enter this Air Cordless Hoover.  Excellent build quality.  The low-mounted battery pack provides a stable center of gravity.  It took a few hours to charge each battery pack, and an extra pack (as is an extra filter) are thoughtfully provided.Sucking power was very good on both carpet and bare floor.  The Air Cordless was exceptionally easy to maneuver and swivel, and the vacuum mounted light was very bright, providing good illumination of the general vicinity.  My biggest complaint about the Air Cordless is that the vacuum wand isn't very long.  Additionally, vacuum suction when using the wand wasn't quite as strong, it seemed, as when the main unit was engaged.In conclusion, it's a very well equipped cordless vacuum cleaner that offers all the capabilities of a traditional vacuum cleaner, minus the inconvenience of a cord.

"PROS:- Relatively inexpensive price- Slim form factor- Alienware name- Generous amount of inputsCONS:- Limited upgradability- Graphics card bottle neck- No option for Windows 7 when ordering from Amazon- No SSD or option for oneThe X51 R2 is an entry-level gaming machine; the primary bottleneck lies in the Nvidia GTX 745.  The GTX 745 is a crippled version of the GTX 750 Ti, the latter using the same GPU but having all 640 shaders unlocked.  It's a low profile card that Nvidia specifically builds for Dell.  I wouldn't expect to do any intensive gaming; maybe BF4 at low-medium resolutions but that's pushing it.  It's on par with the Radeon HD 6850 (a 4-year old card) and the Geforce GTX 555.Those who spring for the R9 270 will find a card that effectively doubles the performance of the GTX 745.  The 240W power supply on this particular X51 configuration severely limits the video card upgradeability.The X51 is very competitively priced.  The other small form factor (SFF) machine I'd consider would be the Digital Storm Bolt II (since my regular desktop is also a Digital Storm machine).  Although more capable than the X51 R2, it's also twice as expensive and most people may not be willing to pay that amount.Construction looks solid.  The X51 R2 is built primarily of non-glossy, fingerprint proof plastic.  The miniature alien head on the front bezel can be rotated to match the chassis orientation.  The use of an external power supply is a neat trick.  It allows a smaller chassis and much quieter operation.  The X51 R2 fortunately comes largely free of bloatware.  The only pre-installed software I could find were just Steam, McAfee and Cyberlink Bluray software.The one disadvantage of ordering this machine off of Amazon rather than the Alienware site is that you cannot customize your machine on Amazon and must accept a pre-built configuration.  This in turn means going with Windows 8.1 (ugh)!  On the other hand, the Alienware site allows you to swap our Windows 8.1 for Windows 7.Given that the X51 isn't best suited for high benchmark games, I plan on instead using my X51 for home entertainment since it has a Bluray drive, SPDIF and coax connections, 6-analog outputs for up to 7.1 speakers, and Bluetooth/wireless connectivity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NBXJ3ZY1MOC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0HMX12#wasThisHelpful","R2NBXJ3ZY1MOC9","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was initially hesitant to buy it, but it looked brand new and I did not notice any AF issues.  It pairs nicely with my 6D and the initial results are already very impressive.  I can't wait to take it overseas on my next trip.  I guess the biggest downside is that the Sigma 50mm isn't weatherproof, so I'll just have to avoid rainstorms.Build quality is excellent.

"This Thermos is great!  Well constructed, certified Tritan, so no BPA worries here.  It's also lightweight and easy to carry around.  The filtration is very fast and takes at most 10 seconds to filter the bottom portion.  The filtered water tastes excellent, like bottled water.  After the first use, the water had a slightly sweet aftertaste, but improved significantly after repeated use.  It only filters potable water, so don't bring this on your camping trip thinking that it can filter out microbes.There are only two downsides I can think of.  First, the volume is quite small at just half a liter.  However, I find this amount perfect for use at work/home, where I don't need a giant bottle of water.  Additionally, it's good for drinking on the go.  Second, filter longevity at just 20 gallons seems on the low end.  Also, I'm not yet sure where to purchase replacement filters and how much they would cost.On the whole, I'm very happy.  Now I can freely drink at work without having to bring bottled water from home.**07/01/14 UPDATE** I've been heavily using the Thermos over the past week, and have encountered a few problems that have caused me to lower the rating by one star.  First, charcoal particles leak from the filter into the filtered water.  Second, sometimes the filter is clogged, requiring me to empty out the container and refill.

"My initial impressions of the BlueAntPump were very favorable.  I liked the device packaging which neatly arrayed and labeled the different ear plug tips and stabilizers.  I liked the possibility of the BlueAnt being fully waterproof, provided the battery charging cover is closed.  (**Note, the battery charging cover appeared to have a somewhat flimsy construction, so take note! of this potential longevity issue.)  Battery life was impressive and a full charge took just 2 hours.  Sound quality, while not spectacular, was fine for my workouts.  Charging via micro-usb (cable provided) was helpful.  The wireless bluetooth connection was very convenient, and took just a few seconds to complete.I unfortunately found the sportbuds uncomfortable to wear.  They constantly pinched my earlobes, despite attempts to adjust them, and were painful after just a few minutes of usage.  I suspect that individual comfort will very subjective, so YMMV.

"The Margaritaville is the ultimate in margarita making convenience.  The operation is almost fully automated, save for a few switches that need to be toggled for margarita creation.CONSTRUCTION: This contraption is massive, so make sure you have enough storage and counter space for it.  Despite its size, it's not too heavy.  Nor is it so light that it would suggest poor build quality either.  Everything seems well assembled.  A heavy duty carrying bag is provided and I was impressed at its sturdiness.  It was more than strong enough to carrying around the Margaritaville from one location to another.OPERATION: Fill the top reservoir with ice and the bottom container with your margarita mix, and you're good to go.  I was particularly impressed by the thoroughness with which the Margaritaville shredded the ice cubes.  The ice was ground so thoroughly that it achieved a fine, slushy consistency.  I was not very impressed by the automatic mode however, which gave my margarita an overly liquid-like consistency.  Operating it in manual mode with occasional bursts of ice shredding seemed to do the trick.  Cleanup was a breeze.  Excess melted ice water is deposited in a reservoir which can be emptied out.  Genius!MISC: I wish Margaritaville had included a recipe book in the package.  I saw a few recipes online, but then the website froze.  Also, the instruction sheet was terribly difficult to read because it was printed on dark colored paper.  I guess they were going for the whole tropical motif, but it was just impractical.CONCLUSION: For the ultimate in margarita making, you can't go wrong with the Margaritaville.

As others have noted, no carrying case is provided, but this wasn't a big drawback for me considering that I almost never use the carrying case for my earbuds.Fit was comfortable; although the default pair of ear cushions felt too small, I was able to find a more comfortable size from the extras provided with the package.Sound quality was decent.  Clear and crisp to be sure, but bass was average to below average.  However considering the sub-$50 entry level pricing, I think the sound quality is more than adequate for its price range.In conclusion, it's a crisp sounding, bare-bones but competitively priced earbud set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWGSLCAZ6CWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPNQ3R8#wasThisHelpful","R1YWGSLCAZ6CWX","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I LOVE my iLuv.  It's a good looking speaker that sounds excellent.1)  Everything about the iLuv is stylish, down to the packaging materials and manual.  It is tall and has a substantial footprint, so make sure you have enough space for it.  It is sturdily constructed and made of fingerprint proof white plastic that is easy to clean.  A convenient hand-hold is provided as well.  It can be paired with another iLuv SYRENPROWH to provide left/right stereo options.2)  Pairing via Bluetooth could not have been easier.  Voice controls indicate when a successful pairing has been made.3)  The sound quality is excellent.  I tested it against a rectangular Jabra Solemate MAX, and the iLuv had superior sound.  The vertical design projects sounds more effectively than the Jabra's squat rectangular design.  Bass is surprisingly good as well.4)  I've used it at several parties already and my guests complimented me on the stylish Bluetooth speaker.  Fortunately I've not had to test its water resistant (note, not water proof) claims, but I can more confidently use it at outdoor parties knowing it is weather resistant.Overall, I'm very pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98WHMO2TT5Y9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFRXP9Y#wasThisHelpful","R98WHMO2TT5Y9","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Hamilton Beach is my first French press.  Its 1 liter volume occupies a niche between single serve coffee machines and larger full brew machines.  Obviously it's not as convenient as conventional brew or single serve machines since you have to boil the water separately, but the taste was stronger and more pronounced.  It seemed well built, with a glass (albeit very lightweight) container and sturdy plastic handles.  The metallic coffee filters seemed cheaply constructed because one of them arrived bent, but considering the press only costs $20, it's not a big deal.  Bent yes, but still functional.It cleaned up easily as well.

"The Unrated Cut runs about 12 minutes longer than the Theatrical Cut, and contains several new scenes including a much expanded ninja action scene.  Wolverine drops a few more choice curse words and there is now CG-gore.  I'd say it's more like a hard PG-13 rather than an R-rated cut.The UNRATED Cut is much better than the theatrical cut.**Note, SPOILERS follow, so read at your own risk**.1) There is more gore, but primarily CGI blood sprays.  Some shots of Wolverine's claws going through people's limbs, but nothing explicit.  No graphic dismemberments.2) Wolverine drops a few more f-bombs.3) Some of the opening scenes depicting Wolverine at the POW camp are a little longer.4) The scene involving Wolverine, an arrow, and the hunter is slightly longer and more brutal.5) Slightly longer dialogue with Yukio on the way to the plane.6) Relationship between Mariko and Yashida and Shingen and  Yashida is better fleshed out in the unrated cut.7) A new scene where Yashida asks Logan his age.8) A new scene with Yashida talking to Shingen on his deathbed, telling him, ""You are not the man to lead Yashida"".9) A new scene at the love hotel where the Yakuza show up and get into a fight with Wolverine.  Mariko intervenes and demonstrates some fighting skill as well.10) Wolverine's operation on himself is bloodier.11) The fight scene between Shingen and Wolverine is slightly longer and now depicts Shingen rather graphically cutting into Wolverine's shoulder blade (no blood though).12) A new scene where Viper gives Hadana poison for his arrows, which he later uses to bring down Wolverine at the ninja fight.13) The ninja fight scene is now much longer.  Wolverine gets dragged away in nets and hit by ninjas on bikes.  Yukio shows up to assist Wolverine and drives around in a snow plow chopping up hapless ninjas (some hearty blood spraying).  Wolverine lights his familiar cigar midway through the battle.I'm actually glad the extra action scenes were removed from the theatrical cut.  Some of the action seemed a bit silly (e.g. ninjas hitting Wolverine with their motorbikes, although Wolverine lighting his trademark cigar was nifty).  Furthermore, Yukio's appearance detracted from Wolverine's thematic solo search for Mariko.  Didn't think Yukio added much to the scene.14) The Silver Samurai battle is the same length as previously.Overall, the unrated cut is much better dimensioned than the theatrical cut.  This is the one to get!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMEOALOEUN2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4W40C4#wasThisHelpful","R3BMEOALOEUN2E","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Preface: I'm not a home theater aficionado.PROS:- Good out-of-the-box, pre-calibration performance (contrast ratios, black colors, skin tones)- Dual HDMI inputs- Allegedly long MTBR (mean time between replacement)- No rainbow effect- Decent sounding built-in speakerCONS:- No 3-D- No lens-shifting- Menu navigation awkward compared to Epsons- Negligible zoomThe Viewsonic PRO 9000 is advertised as having a Laser-LED hybrid light engine.  What does this technological mumbo jumbo mean exactly?  It means that the Viewsonic is using a blue LED, a red LED, and a blue laser striking a green phosphor to create its light output.  There's no traditional mechanically rotating color wheel (long associated with DLP technology) so there's no rainbow effect.  The use of LEDs affords near instantly available light and lower power consumption.  I don't have a Kill-a-Watt meter so I was unable to test the power consumption claims.  However, startup time was indeed very fast.  Best of all, there's no expensive lamp to replace.  For comparison, the highly rated Epson 8350 1080p projector has $300 replacement lamps.Viewsonic says the PRO 9000 is rated for 20,000 hours.  That's roughly equivalent to running the projector 24 hours a day for 2.5 years continuously.  Not too shabby.The PRO 9000 felt solidly made, and had an attractive blue-gray exterior.  A carrying case is provided, as are various cables (including a ~ 6 foot HDMI cable), remote control and provided batteries.I was pleased with its out-of-the-box performance.  I connected the PRO 9000 to a BluRay player running The Hulk.  Black levels and skintones were good, and contrast levels were excellent.  Brightness levels seemed fine, since I primarily used it in a dark room to watch movies and/or tv.  I found the menu operation a little awkward to navigate, in comparison to an Epson I recently used.  Zoom was almost non-existent.  The dinky built-in speakers are adequate stop-gap measures until a more permanent solution can be found.I've dinged the PRO 9000 half a star (4.5 stars rounds up to 5 stars) because at this price-point, it's missing a few features which I think it ought to have.  Its main selling point is the hybrid LED engine, but I think that it should've been equipped at least with a better zoom, if not lens-shift or 3D capability.  For those not familiar with ""lens-shift"" technology, it enables some flexibility in projector placement by allowing one to steer the lens vertically or horizontally for an ideal picture.  I placed my projector on-center, so not having this capability wasn't a big problem.  However, it is a feature that is increasingly more common on higher end projectors.  3D images give me a headache, so again not having this capability didn't bother me, but this may be a disappointment to some.As the other Vine reviewer mentioned, the higher price you pay for the PRO 9000 is due in part to the early adopter tax.  If the PRO 9000 were lowered $100-$200 more, then I think it would be a much more competitive purchase give its lack of premium features other than the increased lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YOERZMDUH71A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008R91OZ6#wasThisHelpful","R2YOERZMDUH71A","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I give the Whitening Kit four stars because it worked as advertised- my teeth were noticeably whiter after application.  The MSRP of the kit value is also less than the sum of the retail values of the individual parts.  I've deducted one star because it caused tooth pain during usage.  Additionally, only a few elements of the kit are actually needed for whitened teeth.First, a few thoughts.- The Oral-B 4000 took somewhere between 24-48 hours to get a full charge!  * I liked the brushing feature wherein the toothbrush stops during operation to remind you to switch quadrants.  * Nice of them to include two extra brushing tips in the kit.- The white strips worked noticeably better than the ones I last used.  They're a neater affair these days.  * I no longer foamed at the mouth and took on the appearance of a rabid dog.- You can probably achieve just as good (and cheaper!) results using only the white strips and the toothpaste.***************************USAGE LOG:Day 1: I'm not a heavy coffee or tea drinker, but I did have some yellow stains on the lower portions of my teeth.  Started the kit in earnest, although I decided not to use the white rinse because I didn't like the after-taste.Day 2: My teeth were already one shade whiter!  However, the Oral-B 4000 was causing tooth-root-pain so I switched to manual brushing with the whitening toothpaste.Days 3 - 12: Used the white strips/manual brushing + whitening toothpaste.  Very pleased with the results.  Mild, but tolerable tooth pain.Took a break for Halloween and consumed candy which may have set back some of my whitening progress.Days 13 - 14: Teeth look much whiter.  Even the hard-to-reach-side-teeth look brighter as well, due wholly to the whitening toothpaste.CONCLUSION: I think the entire kit is unnecessary.  It certainly worked as advertised, but you can achieve the same results with just the whitening strips + whitening toothpaste, without the whitening rinse and electric toothbrush.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUD328776WHG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZH3FGM#wasThisHelpful","RUD328776WHG4","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Preface: I am not a home theater aficionado, but I do appreciate good quality electronics.The Epson Home Cinema 707 is an excellent entry level HD projector at an affordable price range, and it displayed very strong out-of-the-box performance.  It utilizes Epson's trademark 3LCD technology, an alternative to the DLP technology used by competing projectors.  3LCD theoretically offers advantages over DLP, including no rainbow effects, lower power consumption, and lower pricing.  However, higher priced DLP projectors are less likely to exhibit the aforementioned characteristics.PROS:- Built-in speaker audio quality- Legacy video input support- Carrying bag- Video quality- Horizontal/vertical keystoningCONS:- Only 1 HDMI port- Mono, not stereo, speaker- Low contrast ratioBUILD QUALITY:  The Epson was solidly constructed upon removal from the packaging.  The plastic had a nice glossy feel which resisted fingerprints.  A carrying bag, remote control + batteries, and assorted cables were also provided.  I appreciated that legacy inputs are supported, including analog audio and composite video.  There is one significant downside in that only one HDMI input is provided.  I don't have an HDMI switcher, so I had to manually unplug my bluray player and swap it with the FIOS/Cable TV connection each time I wanted to change the source.VIDEO QUALITY:  Video quality out of the box was fantastic.  There is NO lens shift capability, but there is horizontal/vertical keystoning.  Keystoning was adjustable via physical buttons, and these buttons helped optimize the placement and positioning of the projector image.  Only 2D/720p is supported, so 3D/1080p fans will have to look elsewhere.  Black levels were very good and skin tones looked natural at default settings.  Brightness was excellent, and I had to turn down the brightness from the initial settings.  There did not seem to be an appreciable difference between the different pre-programmed visual settings.  The contrast ratio seemed a little low when I played the same Bluray disc in a higher end 1080p DLP projector for comparison.SOUND QUALITY:  The Epson is equipped with a built-in speaker which was surprisingly full-bodied and loud.  The speaker only outputs from one side of the projector unfortunately, but the projector is sufficiently compact that a stereo configuration wouldn't make much sense.  If you don't have a sound bar/home theater receiver yet, then the built-in speaker can serve as an interim solution until procurement of a more permanent audio setup.The Epson 707 was positioned at a distance of about six feet from the projector screen and it created a 60-inch diagonal picture.  Sure beats watching the World Series on a 42-inch TV!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO03MFZ70ZD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAJ1QDA#wasThisHelpful","RO03MFZ70ZD2","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The hard part was figuring out how to load the dang stapler.  There weren't any instructions either.  I literally spent 15 minutes finagling the stapler before I figured out that pushing down on the rear ""button"" caused the front loading tray to pop-out.  The loading tray itself also does not accommodate many staples either, so count on refilling more frequently than usual.  Minus one star for not including better instructions, but kudos to Swingline for including sample premium staples in the package.Once loaded with staples, I found the Swingline true to its description.  Very little effort was needed to staple sheets together.  I don't think I'll be replacing my conventional Swingline anytime soon, but I do have to give Swingline credit for trying to innovate a new stapler design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24GD51KSQQ79Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DM8VKW#wasThisHelpful","R24GD51KSQQ79Q","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The guards do not lock into place and it's all too easy to cut off more hair than expected, even if another person is doing the cutting for you.  Who wants an uneven cut?

"The Jabra Motion UC is easy to setup for even the tech un-savvy.  After opening the packaging (an attractive transparent plastic casing), I was up and running within a few minutes.Comfort was generally good.  I have smallish ears, and there is a smaller ear piece included which I prefer.  It slips over the ear fairly comfortably, and is easy to switch to the other ear, and changing that configuration can be done within seconds.The range is excellent.  I can leave my phone anywhere in my apartment and roam with the bluetooth with no change in signal.  In addition, there is a small chip that is included to enable the bluetooth to be used with a laptop.  I haven't tried it yet, but that would be great to be able to skype more clearly, and not have to stay in front of the monitor talking right into the speaker.The bluetooth is charged with an included plug.

"The Unrated Cut runs about 7 minutes longer than the Theatrical Cut, and primarily contains additional action shots (nothing major).  Director Marc Forster has said that the Theatrical Cut IS the Director's Cut, which also unfortunately means that we will not be seeing any footage from the discarded Battle of Moscow (except for a few quick scenes in the closing montage) and the Matthew Fox subplot.The UNRATED Cut is the one to get!  It contains slightly more gore (but not gratuitously so) than the Theatrical Cut, and the action scenes are more fluid and less choppy.I've listed the primary differences between the Unrated Cut and the Theatrical Cut below.  Note, SPOILERS follow below, so read at your own risk.1) When zombies are shot/stabbed/curb stomped/etc.., they spew CG black blood.  When people are bitten, there's more CG red blood.2) During the opening scene in Philadelphia, there are more scenes of pandemonium and zombies getting shot and/or biting humans.  The segment with the red T-shirted male (""Here comes the Number 12 Train..."") being bitten and transformed into a zeke is longer and more violent.3) At the NJ Mart, when Gerry is looking for albuterol for his daughter, the camera pans down to show a dead body lying in a pool of blood, suggesting that the pharmacy employee shot him.4) The chase scene from the alleyway to the apartment is longer and more harrowing.  Gerry headshots a zombie and shoots a few others, also crushing a security guard zombie with a filing cabinet.  In the theatrical cut, this zombie chase scene is instead used during the Lanes' early morning escape to the apartment's rooftop.5) The escape scene to the apartment rooftop is now longer and more violent.  Gerry bayonets, shoots, or rifle butts many more zombies.  In a surprising twist, Tomas saves Gerry from a zeke, rather than Gerry himself shooting the zeke in the theatrical cut.  Matthew Fox's parajumper character also shoots a few more zombies and there's more zombie blood when they're shot.6) When Dr. Fassbach trips and accidentally shoots himself in the head, the wound is more graphic.  Chunks of his back skull are blown into the air and gore covers the exit ramp of the C-130.  Although this description sounds graphic, the camera cuts away quickly so that only brief glimpses of gore are seen by the audience.7) David Morse's character graphically pulls out his last remaining tooth in the Unrated Cut.  This is not shown in the Theatrical Cut.8) The Battle for Jerusalem has additional action shots.  It's now a thrilling and intense sequence in the Unrated Cut!  More IDF soldiers shooting zekes, more zekes biting people, grenades blowing up zekes, etc..9) When Gerry cuts off Segen's hand in the Unrated Cut, we see the bloody stump as well as geysers of CG blood.  This is definitely graphic and not for the faint of heart.10) The zombie attack on Belarus Airways is now more intense with passengers getting bitten left and right.  There is more CG blood too, but nothing too explicit since most of the shots are very quick.11) Gerry takes down a few zekes in the WHO facility more graphically.  He clotheslines one zeke with a crowbar and stomps on the face of another.  More CG black blood.Prior to watching World War Z, I had mixed feelings about the movie based on the trailers I had seen.  Fast zombies?  Blasphemy.I ended up enjoying the movie, even with Damon Lindelof's rewritten third act.  The ending on a quiet, but hopeful note was a better conclusion than the rumored Battle of Moscow.  The idea of using a temporary, but curable disease as camouflage was a unique plot point.  Can't wait for the sequel, even if it has very little to do with Max Brooks' original books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8W154JWPZLSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIN0#wasThisHelpful","R8W154JWPZLSA","A3EFSLEMHNPP6A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFSLEMHNPP6A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With Amazon's shoe selector system, I ordered the 9.5 as recommended and the shoes are comfortably roomy everywhere, but because of the adjustable strap design they still stay snug at the back of my heel.I purchased these just before we went on vacation and planned to use them for a pool shoe, but then had some issues with my feet aching and swelling in my regular walking shoes so I figured I'd try these for one morning walk.

"** I received this item for free in exchange for testing and review **I'll admit it, I have a thing for LED flashlights. We own maybe 5 or 6 small ones, and 3 or 4 larger units. Whenever a new design comes along, I'm excited to see if it's brighter or lasts longer than the last one.I was happy to test this Wasing because it uses regular AAA batteries and also has an adjustable beam.Overall this is a well-made and sturdy light. The only thing I would be worried about for really rugged use is the front plastic housing which is large and seems like it could break if the light were dropped on cement. We have other metal cased LED flashlights that are extremely rugged and have withstood lots of ""drop tests"" without any issues, but they don't have the plastic housing like this one does.On the plus side, it's the plastic housing that make the wide beam of this flashlight work so much better than any other pocket-sized LED light we have. The beam is wide and even with no annoying dark circle around a brighter center. This makes it perfect to use for walking in the dark and also for jobs that require a wider view than a focused beam provides.The only issue I have with this light is the ""Lantern Function"" which puts off a very diffuse and inefficient glow. If you were stuck in a pitch-dark cave, the lantern would give you enough light to help avoid tripping over a boulder or something, but it's not nearly enough light to work by when you're out camping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIUGL6FQ7GU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141895U2#wasThisHelpful","RAIUGL6FQ7GU0","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received this item for free in exchange for testing and review **I'm really loving all these new solar-powered LED light options that have been popping up over the past year or two. We live on a large property so adding Christmas lights to a few trees out by our front gate was pretty much impossible before solar-powered units came along. I love the soft warm white tone of these lights over some bright white ones I bought last year, I think these look more like incandescent bulbs than the brilliant white ones.These are relatively bright and will stay lit until at least midnight as long as they've received an hour or more of full sun during the day, if it's been heavily overcast all day then the charge runs out after a few hours. My one complaint is that the lights towards the end of the strand are maybe 20% dimmer than those closest to the solar panel.Placement of the solar panel is important - it works much better if you can find a spot facing east/west that is never shaded.I'm very happy with these and plan to buy another 3 strands to decorate a larger tree out in front of our house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVLGGFCEHB9ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XMSVX2#wasThisHelpful","RVLGGFCEHB9ED","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received these knives for free in exchange for testing and review **This is my first experience with coated knives, and I didn't really know what to expect, I honestly wasn't expecting much given the low price point.I was pleasantly surprised by their quality and cutting abilities.These feel nice in the hand, they are weighted properly to sit level without feeling too blade-heavy. I enjoy using these most with soft fruits and vegetables like tomatoes and strawberries, cutting crunchy things like carrots requires more effort with these knives than it does with my heavier blades.I really love the sheaths, this allows me to store safely anywhere. I actually added the small paring knife to my travel cooking kit that I carry with us when we're doing motorcycle trips. It's much better than the cheap serrated knife with its makeshift cardboard sheath that I had been using!The coating seems to allow some foods to more easily separate from the blade, but I found that mushrooms seem to stick more to these blades than my regular Henckels stainless.Overall they're a great addition to your regular set of expensive knives. They're quick and easy for small jobs and wash up with hardly any effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABKIE2K68XQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016N6YVFE#wasThisHelpful","RABKIE2K68XQQ","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is so much better than Unity! My family almost wanted to boycott the series after that one, but I’m really glad we gave Assassins Creed another try.Good:+ Voice acting is great and the character’s personalities are intriguing and engaging.+ Safehouse is so cool, what an innovative idea!+ Funny. I rarely laugh out loud when I’m in the middle of a game, but there were a few things that really cracked me up.+ Upgrades, there are tons of them, and most are extremely useful. Love the train!+ The gameplay world is massive.+ The ability to take people hostage almost makes up for not being able to hide behind bushes anymore.+ They really got the Victorian-era feel right. I love it, but my husband was disappointed it wasn’t more steampunk.Still not Great:- Free running and climbing are still awkward and take a lot of getting used to.- Audio is lackluster. Music seems mostly flat, wish it had more bass and drums to match the feel of the game.- No more stealth behind bushes – this took a lot of getting used to for me. I probably used it too much before though.- Lots more fist fighting, less swordplay.Overall this is a great game, it’s easy to lose a few hours inside the world and not get frustrated about glitches or anachronisms. It’s smooth and everything just works. It’s fun, challenging, and ramps up difficulty at a good rate. I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, it's darned fun and definitely worth playing even though it has a few minor flaws so it's not really a 5-star production, however, I didn't feel like it was fair knocking off a full star for the few small issues we had.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBR8WQSYWRH4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X87BLK0#wasThisHelpful","RBR8WQSYWRH4E","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The tough thing about reviewing headphones is that sound is nearly as subjective as taste. I've had headphones that I thought sounded tinny and other reviewers raved about their booming bass, conversely, I have a set of headphones that I've always used as a gold standard to compare against all others (Etymotic ER6), and these also have their detractors.That said, I am very impressed with the full-room sound and extremely crisp tones I get with these headphones. Another plus is that although they do offer some noise canceling, they still allow enough ambient sound in so I don't feel totally isolated from my environment.There are two issues for me that keep these from being a 5-star product, first is if you wear glasses, the over-the-ear design is somewhat uncomfortable. Without my glasses on I could easily wear these a few hours without pressure or fatigue, with my glasses on I was limited to about a half hour before the back of my head started aching.The second issue is call quality. There's no way to position the microphone which hangs behind the ear. Because of this location, my voice is somewhat muffled, although the system does a decent job of canceling wind noise (something I expect from Jabra). While this is fine for a quick ""I'm heading home, be there in 15 minutes"" type of call, if you try for any deep discussions the person on the other end of the line is going to get frustrated.Overall, I'm very impressed with the quality of these headphones. They're head and shoulders better than the $30 pair I own, I just wish they were more comfortable with my glasses!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R79OG9GIFMN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161D1CQ0#wasThisHelpful","R79OG9GIFMN7","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm no expert, but I can usually wade through poorly written manuals and make things work. This one had me baffled and frustrated for a good while.My main issue is with the remote login setup, which requires a dizzying array of logins and passwords. The icons used are not easily understood, I still have a few that are a complete mystery.The company does provide installation and setup videos, but they really don't help that much. If you're wanting to view and control the camera via laptop or remote desktop, expect to spend quite awhile getting things going.On the plus side, the smartphone app is easy and super simple to set up and use.

"I'll admit to using cheap polarizers on my moderately priced lenses because I really hate spending more than necessary for something I consider more of a lens protector than an actual photo enhancer. Then I got a good deal on a B+W for my zoom lens and I learned the error of my ways. The difference in raw images is amazing, even on clear days with little haze, the B+W polarizer made things crisper and more vibrant. The best thing is that they only cause about a 1 stop loss, which is so much better than the cheap polarizers I had been using which would drop things down at least 3 stops.The other great thing about the Kaesemann polarizer is that it has the Multi-Resistant Coating, meaning it's more scratch resistant than glass, and is sealed against dust and moisture.I do a ton of motorsports photography, which means I'm working in dusty conditions and need to be able to shoot at the fastest speeds possible, this polarizer not only gives me speedier shots than a cheaper unit, it also creates a stronger barrier between my lens and the elements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZAG3JW6OOZ9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R69839S#wasThisHelpful","RZAG3JW6OOZ9U","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a Cat Mate Pet Fountain which has worked well to entice our older cats to drink more water. The pump gave out a few weeks ago and although I as able to get it running again I thought it would be a good idea to have a second fountain in case one of them quit while we were away for the weekend.The Cat Mate fountain sells for about the same price as this Oster, so I was interested to see which one I liked better (and if the cats had any preference).First, assembly is easy with either fountain. The general designs are the same with a tiny submersible recirculating pump, a charcoal filter, and a well the cats drink from. Aside from these similarities, there are some differences:1. ""Waterfall"" feature. The Cat Mate has a 3"" tall channel that the water flows down, the Oster has a small bubbler that the water flows up out of (like a drinking fountain) which can be increased or decreased in volume - higher volumes cause some splashing. Our cats seem to like both styles equally well.2. Water reservoir. The Cat Mate doesn't have any additional reservoir, you fill it and will need to add water every few days. The Oster has a reservoir which adds water whenever the level in the bowl gets below a certain point. I really like the reservoir idea and think it's a better setup.3. Pump. The Cat Mate pump is slightly larger and can be set at various volume settings. The Oster has a volume setting on the external dial. Both are relatively quiet, you will be able to hear their slight hum in a completely quiet room, but they are normally not noticeable.4. Filters. The Cat Mate filter is a single unit that is about twice the size of the Oster. Replacements for the Cat Mate are available online for about $2.50 each and they last about a month. The Oster filters are two part, a cell-type foam in front, then a charcoal pad in back. I haven't found a source for replacements, which is a concern.5. Cleaning. All of these fountains get slimy after about a week of running, so easy cleaning is important. I've found scrubbing with a mix of baking soda and dish soap works well. The Cat Mate can be completely disassembled for easy cleaning (but requires a small bottle brush), the pump also has a small cover that is removable. The Oster fountain also comes apart and is easier to clean but the reservoir needs an angled large bottle brush to clean fully.6. Cat happiness. Our two cats are equally happy drinking from either fountain, but do prefer the running fountain to a still bowl of water.I think both fountains are about equally matched in ease of use and cleaning, I can't speak for the Oster's longevity yet, but our Cat Mate has been going strong for a year now. If the price is the same, I'd choose the Cat Mate because the filters are available and I know it has good longevity. If the Oster filters come online and the price is cheaper than the Cat Mate versions, that would tip the scales towards Oster.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12S445437P06Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HAWD1W#wasThisHelpful","R12S445437P06Q","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"** Received product in exchange for testing and review **These are nice basic headphones that tuck comfortably into my ears without any weird flanges that can cause irritation. They are lightweight and don't cause ear fatigue like some heavier headphones do.

Phone calls are okay, the person on the receiving end says my voice sounds somewhat muffled but not awful.Volume is not very loud, even at full throttle, these are probably a good 20% quieter than my regular headphones.

"I've been dealing with dry skin on my elbows and legs for a few months now, I've tried a few different lotions but they all make me feel itchy after awhile and I hate their heavy feeling when it's hot outside so I switched to pure coconut oil. Unfortunately it leaves an oily residue on my body which gets on clothes so I can only do that at night before bed and although it seems to be helping my legs my elbows are still dry and flaky.I was happy to try this Eucerin lotion because I usually don't have an allergic reaction to their products, and it seemed like the in-shower version might work even better.After using this for 3 days my elbows are noticeably softer and feel so much better, the itch is gone! My legs and arms feel better too, and I can put on clothes right afterward without worrying about staining.The only downside is that I feel like it's sort of wasteful to apply the lotion then basically rinse most of it off, but it somehow still does the job so there's really nothing to complain about.

"I have fair skin that is sometimes hard to match with single-color cosmetics, I'm in my 50's (with wrinkles and age spots), and I still have an oily t-zone so I was hoping these would do a nice job of color matching my tone and take care of oiliness while helping to cover my blemishes. Unfortunately, the regular powder seemed to make my pores more noticeable and the powder seemed to sink into my wrinkles as the day wore on and make them look more prominent, especially my laugh lines.I was able to get a very nice match using 3 of the 4 different colors of the translucent powder Shade 10, but it requires some fussy blending with a smaller brush - a regular large powder brush just grabs all 4 colors at once, and applying powder with a smaller blush brush isn't usually as effective. If these were in separate interior containers I could remove the one that I don't use and more effectively grab just the colors I need to mix the right blend, but realistically the only thing that works is a sweep of all 4.That brings me to the next issue - the packaging is very flimsy, these honestly feel more like samples than something I would purchase at a store. I'm not expecting gold-plated metal or anything, but I think I'd be willing to pay a little more if they put each color in its own removable inner cup with a sturdier outer shell.The blush #20 works really well for me, I loved the color options, and was able to create a light and soft look for day, and a brighter tone for a more formal look. The bronzer #30 is too dark for me, but would work on anyone with normal to darker skin tones.Overall I feel Neutrogena has a good basic idea here, there's just some minor tweaks they could do to make this a really great product. 1: Powder needs to be reformulated to not settle in wrinkles. 2: Smaller trays for each color inside large tray so it's easier to use one you decide what blend works best for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IP5NGDQG0P65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2VQZG0#wasThisHelpful","R2IP5NGDQG0P65","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**I received this product for free in exchange for testing and review**These are nicely made sleeves that effectively manage quite a few cables within a single sleeve, so 5 sleeves can corral quite a few cables. They are easy to use and quick to open and close.Unfortunately, the use of a zipper rather than Velcro fastening means that they can only be used on cables 19"" or longer, this limits their effectiveness in many applications, especially for cables going to your monitor, speakers, and other tabletop peripherals that need to exit the sleeve at various points. The other negative is their weight, neoprene is relatively heavy, so the use of one of these sleeves can drag lighter weight items off of tables.Of final note is that these do have a strong neoprene odor when the package is first opened, this scent has dissipated and is no longer noticeable after a week's worth of use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ICLIEXXAMFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CHCG5K#wasThisHelpful","R30ICLIEXXAMFD","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After they arrived I had even less trust in them because they felt so lightweight. I figured the best way to test them would be to put two puffy down jackets in one bag, and a fluffy pillow in another and see how long they held a seal.While squeezing the air out of the bag with the jackets in it, the plastic slider flew off the end of the bag. Had it already broken? No the slider is actually designed to come off, so take it off after zipping the bag mostly shut, then squeeze out the air, use your finger to close the bag completely then put the slider back on and zip the bag again to be sure it's fully sealed.I actually started a stopwatch thinking the coats and pillow would start swelling back up in a few minutes or hours, but at bedtime the things were still flat as a pancake. 3 days later they're still flat and not leaking air.

"**I received this item for free in exchange for testing and review**I wasn't really expecting much from this money belt, it's quite a bit cheaper than the others I looked at, but all I really need is something small and basic that will fit my passport and a few extra things. I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived, it's well made, has nicely laid out compartments, the belt is stretchy and easy to put on and take off, and it stays in place. It's relatively comfortable under my clothes even when I'm sitting down. The zippers work smoothly and are easy to access even when I'm wearing the belt.I think all these belts work best on a taller person (I'm short and round), but this one is much more comfortable that my old money belt that had squared-off corners that would poke into my sides when I leaned over or sat in certain positions.The only thing I would change about the belt is the color, the gray shows through lighter colored shirts, I think a light tan would not be as visible.The credit card sleeves are a cute added feature, and it's nice to have a place to stow my credit card without worrying about RFID skimmers, but I don't think they add huge value to the money belt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XMXFGRQBGV18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QYHBMS#wasThisHelpful","R1XMXFGRQBGV18","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially I was surprised at how large this 1X shirt was, the fit was more like a generous 2x, but I have had other gauze shirts in the past that ""sized down"" after washing according to directions so I took a chance and washed it and now it fits exactly as expected. This is still an oversize design, but hangs nicely and isn't at all clingy. The fabric has nice weight and swing to it, the only issue is that it isn't completely opaque and so I think it looks better with a tank top underneath.It's a great option for travel, they pack well and can be hand washed and hung dry overnight without needing ironing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BWLJ3LG1GWLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBHKHL0#wasThisHelpful","R1BWLJ3LG1GWLX","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My typical weekend around-the-house bra is the Just My Size Pure Comfort Seamless Wirefree Bra, Style 1263. They offer adequate support, and are as comfortable as an old pair of sweats. They usually cost around ten bucks apiece at our local big-box store, so I was hoping to save a little money with these Vogue of Eden 3-pack bras. Unfortunately, the Vogue of Eden bras just don't have the heavy-duty elasticity that I need, although they feel fine when I first put one on, they stretch out and don't really offer any support after a few minutes. I think they'd probably be fine for smaller gals up to a C cup, but they're just not sturdy enough for larger breasted women.They also are sized smaller in the cup area than I expected, however that could be due to the weird sizing on this item, as the size chart doesn't equate at all to the actual bra sizing (chart shows what inch measurements equate to in cup size, but bras are sold in s,m,l,xl,etc. with no information on what cup size equates to in their s,m,l sizing).** I received this product for free in exchange for testing and review **","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5C3GXCFBYMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014BMOH2E#wasThisHelpful","R3H5C3GXCFBYMT","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received this item for free in exchange for testing and review **I loan out USB drives to clients all the time, and it's hard to make sure I get them back, so I usually look for units that are easily identifiable and have some way to attach a fob so I can clip an ID tag to them. Even with these precautions, some of the drives disappear. I thought this Captain America drive might just be obnoxious (and fun) enough that my clients wouldn't lose it.First, I was surprised with the heft, the front case is metal and about 1.25"" in diameter, it weighs in at just under an ounce on my postal scale.The looks are basically what you'd expect from a novelty product, with the slide action of the USB plug a little cheap feeling and the key ring quite flimsy (the reasons I'm knocking it down a star). Outer packaging was for Iron Man 3 rather than the Avengers/Captain America, but that doesn't really detract from the product.I wasn't expecting much when I plugged this in for some speed testing. It did require formatting before it was recognized on my desktop running Win8. For the test I grabbed a file full of 1.22GB worth of RAW images and sent them to this drive. Transfer took 4:02:84 minutes. Next I grabbed my go-to inexpensive 16GB USB drive (the Kingston DTSE9 Kingston Digital DataTraveler SE9 32GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive (DTSE9H/32GBZET)) and dragged the same 1.22GB file to be transferred. A sluggish 5:50:76 minutes later, the transfer was finally complete.Color me gobsmacked, this funny little novelty Captain America drive IS faster than my stylish brand-name Kingston.Now, hopefully my clients will laugh at the looks and remember where the heck they put the thing when I ask for it back!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQ28A7GZH9UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01173N6AE#wasThisHelpful","RAQ28A7GZH9UR","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The connectors are reinforced and the plugs also have a rubberized feel to them, making it easy to grasp and unplug. The two-headed Micro A/B design is brilliant and so simple to use. My only minor complaint is that the end caps provided aren't attached in some way and are easy to lose, then again, my other cords don't have end caps so it's not really an issue.The color is more red than the salmon tone you see in the picture, actually the red and gray together along with the sleek styling remind me of something Ferrari would use as a promo item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMP0GO7PIVXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WE0ZPA#wasThisHelpful","R1BMP0GO7PIVXC","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received this item for free in exchange for product testing and review **These are so neat! I initially thought of a few things I would be able to use them with, but now that I have them I'm using them for everything from clipping coupons together in my purse to color coding client files that need my attention (red for today, yellow for this week). Of course they're perfect for their intended use as a craft item, it's great to be able to trace outlines without having to tape things to my workspace, and they hold watercolor paper so much better than glue or tape.These are well made and have nice snappy clip action. Each gripping surface has a few nubs in the plastic to help it grip uneven surfaces. The jaws will work effectively on items up to 5/8"" thick, yet still hold strong on just one or two pieces of paper or thin fabric. The tiny size means that it requires a bit more strength to open them than the alligator-style clip with the longer folding arms, but anyone with average hand strength and dexterity will have no issues using these.The jar container is clear and fits inside my desk for easy access.

Puncture resistance is slightly better, stretch resistance is the same. The colors make them look more like something that was designed as packing material rather than the clear Costco bags that look like garbage bags.The only downside is that these don't come in a box that doubles as a dispenser, and they tear apart at perforations which is a two-handed operation (the Costco bags are separated and don't require tearing apart).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX0F2O1KSHPGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJL46OA#wasThisHelpful","RX0F2O1KSHPGL","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This foot cream does nice things to my cracked and calloused feet, so why am I giving it only 3 stars? Two reasons, first, the scent is somewhat off-putting, a bit sulfuric with some menthol undertones and an old-fashioned rose scent covering it all. Second reason is the main problem, I was very surprised that there was no ingredient list on the container, since I have issues with lanolin I need to be sure it's not in the lotions I use. I did find the list on their website and was happy to see this contained no lanolin, but it does contain Triclosan which the FDA is currently re-evaluating.I'm not some granola crunching earthy gal who doesn't believe in the wonders of our modern chemical age, but I do think there are some chemicals that are being over-used for no real purpose, Triclosan is one of them. It is used to prevent bacterial contamination and as an anti-bacterial agent in certain goods, but its being reviewed by the FDA because of emerging safety issues of bacterial resistance and endocrine disruption.Aside from that, I've found that AHAVA's Tea Tree Oil Foot Cream does a better job of softening and smoothing my skin, and doesn't contain Triclosan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GNUW7DHNUMKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUY46E#wasThisHelpful","R3GNUW7DHNUMKK","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is our third Beltronics detector, we owned two V955 units previously and loved how well they worked. They've saved us quite a few times.I really love the upgrades they've made to the Pro200 compared to the 955, first off, the all-black is much nicer than the black and silver of the 955. The aluminum center strip on the 955 would reflect off the windshield and could be distracting at times. Second, the sounds and speaker on the Pro200 are easier to hear over the stereo, but aren't annoying in a quiet car.Detection is better with the Pro200, especially for Laser. It's false-positives are also reduced, even when set on Highway mode.I think the best upgrade with this new unit though is the charging cord which includes a light showing the unit is on, and also has a mute button. These both are so smart and necessary, especially since the readout is sometimes hard to see in broad daylight. And having the mute button so close at hand rather having to reach way up to the front of the windshield to quiet things when you're driving past the local grocery store is just brilliant.I think Beltronics makes the best for the best price on the market today, do your research and read online reviews and you'll see what the experts think of this unit. I'm very pleased with the performance for the price, definitely recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWRA9BM0976/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DH9P7Q#wasThisHelpful","R1HWRA9BM0976","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review***We spend a lot of time outdoors in the heat of summer, so I have a few different cooling towels and neck coolers, unfortunately all of them are a bit of a hassle when we're traveling because if I'm not wearing them they're difficult to store (the neck coolers can get moldy, the Frogg Toggs get stiff and hard to pack). This cooling towel is basically a microfiber polyester mesh that dries quickly and cools you as the water evaporates. Like all evaporative cooling devices, it will work better in less humid conditions.The great thing about these is that they do dry quickly, so once you're done using it, you can hand wash it to remove the sweat, then hang it up and it'll be dry in less than an hour. It stays soft and packs small so it's great for hiking or camping.These also are machine washable and dryer friendly, so they're super easy to keep clean.The only downside is that it does dry out relatively quickly during use, so unless your activity is less than 2 hours long, you'll need a water supply handy to re-wet the towel. This isn't a big deal for me since I carry water with us, but could be an issue if you're recreating somewhere without easy access to a water supply.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSECFFARIW65L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013A9YFDK#wasThisHelpful","RSECFFARIW65L","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are everything I want in a rugged short and nothing I don't. Well, except for their slightly-too-slim fit. Other Dickies pants in a size 16 fit me perfectly, they stay put around my waist, but give me room to move everywhere else, these are not horribly tight, but they don't have that comfortable lived-in feeling of my other Dickies pants.

It also is easily dislodged when I turn on my side. The Lewis N.

"** Review of a free item **I have a relatively expensive travel umbrella I bought years ago that has been rolling around in the trunk of my car forever, it's a little worse for wear and is getting difficult to close. I don't need an umbrella often, but when I do it needs to work well so I was happy to get a new umbrella to replace the old one. I wasn't expecting much from this inexpensive unit, but figured it was worth testing out, and I'm glad I did.This looks and feels like a quality item, the action is smooth and works properly every time. Since we're in the middle of summer here in the desert, I had to get creative and use the hose to test its waterproofing, the umbrella performed exactly as expected, with water easily beading up and rolling off the outer surface, a quick shake and the fabric is mostly dry before folding back up. I also took it out and opened it up during a very windy afternoon and it held up with no problems. I had no problems opening and closing it while out in the breeze, although I did make sure to have it facing into the wind.My only question at this point will be longevity, or any issues caused by the more complex self-closure design, but the umbrella seems very well built and I don't anticipate any issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GLHROIEA8M83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUKTHQM#wasThisHelpful","R2GLHROIEA8M83","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received this product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.**It appears I may have received a defective set of these earbuds, as there are quite a few glowing reviews for these things but mine were junk. Sound quality was awful when used with my iPhone, another smartphone, or plugged into a computer. Wiggling the connection made a bit of a difference, changing the sound from some weird pop and squeal to very faint musical tones if you wiggled just right.I have owned many sets of cheap headphones over the years, and most in the $20 range usually have decent sound and last for 6 months to a year of hard use, I'd recommend paying a little more and grabbing something from Phillips or any of the dozens of other name brands in that price range.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AZI7UD5W5R9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UP992SM#wasThisHelpful","R2AZI7UD5W5R9A","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like these Five Star notebooks, I've got a couple of them, plus a few of their three-ring binders. The only problem I have with their design is that the covers aren't rigid. With their 3-ring styles it's easy to just add a piece of cardboard to the back to give it some structure, but that's not possible with the spiral bound designs like this one.These are perfect if you work at a desk, but if you're using binders out in the field these aren't as easy to deal with as the Mead ones with their heavy cardboard back cover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFU1ZPTJ5XJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7HXD84#wasThisHelpful","R2SFU1ZPTJ5XJP","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These aren't bad tasting, but for the amount of sugar and calories here I would want something that had more substance and rich flavor.Usually I like to take snacks like this hiking, but these just didn't hit the spot. Although they don't melt, they're still somewhat messy to eat because of the peanut butter glaze. The deal killer for me is that they're so dry that they make me thirsty every time I eat a few, which isn't really what I'm looking for when we're hiking on a hot day and I'm more likely to go for snacks that make me feel quenched rather than parched.I think these could work much better if they'd do a gooey peanut butter center, but in their current form I won't be getting them again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNX3BIYFTQX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT1ZH2O#wasThisHelpful","R2PNX3BIYFTQX0","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review *These are very nice shears, actually excellent for the price, but they're not quite as good as my mom's old sewing scissors.The pair I received had a small burr in the middle of both blades, once that was carefully removed with the use of a deburring blade and emery cloth, I was very impressed with the sharpness and smoothness of their cut. Action is good, with a very slight catch in some spots rather than the smooth resistance you feel with really high quality scissors - way better than most in this price range though!I love the heft and solidity of these old-fashioned type scissors when I'm cutting heavier material. They keep my cuts straighter and just seem like they do a better job than my modern lightweight units.I used these to cut out some canvas for a project I'm working on and they performed perfectly. My only question is how long these will hold their edge. I noted the steel is relatively soft when I was deburring and sanding with the emery cloth, so that may mean they need more frequent sharpening, which isn't really much of a hassle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFZOLSC8GNKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTM1532#wasThisHelpful","RZFZOLSC8GNKY","A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this TV, especially for the price.  Comparing it to other TVs in this price range (at the time of my review and in recent months), it is usually priced very competitively.  It has a pretty good picture and a lot of great smart TV features.My TV suffers from some dark corners.  I am probably the only one who will ever notice it, but when the image is bright and all one color, you can notice that the corners are darker than the rest of the image.  It's not a deal-breaker.  I didn't return the TV to try another one.  For the price I paid, I just accepted it as a trade-off.The smart TV apps work really well for me.  I have a fast internet connection and my apps like Amazon Instant Video will take 10 seconds or so to open, and a movie will start within seconds.  There are a great variety of apps, like Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube, Spotify, and Hulu Plus (among others).  You can also browse DLNA devices on your network like your computers for pictures, music, and video.I'm pretty happy with this TV, mostly because of the great deal I got on it, but know there is a chance that you may also have some slightly dark corners on your TV.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROKV2UGJ8OXJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRQPEYK#wasThisHelpful","ROKV2UGJ8OXJ5","A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am blown away by this remote.  It is amazing, especially how well it integrates with my Hue lights and my SmartThings home automation hub.SETUPYou can set the remote up using a PC/Mac program or an app on your Android or iOS device.  I found both methods to be just as easy, but the app did crash a couple of times so in the end I finished my work in the PC program and synced my changes from there.Setup is easy.  Things are laid out nicely and it is easy to understand how things work, even for someone who has never owned a Harmony before like myself.I have an LG TV, a Denon A/V receiver, a Dish Network Hopper DVR, Philips Hue lights with the V2 bridge, and a SmartThings V2 home automation hub.  I also have an Amazon Fire TV stick but I haven't set that up yet.HARDWAREThe remote feels great in your hand.  The screen is a good size and thankfully there are plenty of physical buttons for the most important features, like menu navigation, volume control, channel up/down, DVR, Guide, menu, back, mute, etc.  However, channel numbers can only be accessed on the touchscreen (or you can use your channel favorites on the touchscreen).You can also use gestures on the touchscreen, like swiping up and down to change the volume, or left and right to rewind and fast forward your DVR.The screen turns on when you pick up or move the remote, and automatically shuts off after a few seconds of inactivity.There is a main hub and two IR blasters (included) that plug into the back of it.  You can position the two blasters in front of devices that need to be controlled, which can include devices behind cabinets.The remote has a dock that it stands up in and recharges in.PHILIPS HUE (tested with a Hue version 2 bridge)I almost wanted to cry when I saw how well Hue is integrated into the Harmony.  You can control your Philips Hue lights with the remote directly using the dedicated lighting buttons on the bottom of the remote, or you can change lights and scenes using the touchscreen.  It downloads your scenes from your Hue bridge and even shows the scene pictures and names on the touchscreen so you know what each scene is.  It is amazing how quickly the lights respond to the remote... it's just about instantaneous.You can also integrate your lights into your activities, like if you have an activity called ""Watch a movie"" you can set up how your lights should respond when the activity is launched (turning on your TV, switching to your Blu-Ray input, and dim the lights or change the colors, etc).You can control each light individually, and adjust the brightness by swiping left and right.  Or you can group lights into rooms like you can with most Hue apps.The Hue integration is definitely not an afterthought here... it is really well designed and works great.SMARTTHINGS (tested with a V2 hub)The Harmony can control your SmartThings switches just as well as the Hue lights.  It picks up the names of the switches you have in SmartThings so you can do things like start the popcorn maker when the ""Watch a movie"" activity is started.  Each switch in SmartThings can either be assigned to be a light or an appliance in Harmony (they can behave differently).You can also view the status of all of your SmartThings sensors, so you can see which windows and doors are open and closed, and which motion detectors are detecting motion.SUMMARYThe remote is much cooler than I thought it was going to be.  It integrates with everything so well, and all of my devices respond very quickly to the remote.  The price is a bit intimidating, but after using this remote for a bit I can tell you that it is a great value if you have devices other than just A/V devices that you want to control (like lights and home automation products).  A+ all the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R245TNQBLUWRW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PDFP9S#wasThisHelpful","R245TNQBLUWRW4","A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these remotes so much.  They work great with SmartThings V1 and V2 hubs and I use them primarily to turn my Philips Hue light bulbs on and off.  But they are convenient for so many other things since they can control just about anything on your Z-Wave network.  They are priced great, especially when you can get them under $20.  I wish they would just stick with these instead of the V2 remotes that don't have numeric buttons and cost twice as much.  Thanks, Aeon Labs for such a great product and at such a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MK1Q1PEXYCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU7ERAW#wasThisHelpful","R38MK1Q1PEXYCM","A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am using this speaker to replace the center speaker on my Energy 5.1 Take Classic Home Theater System set, paired with a Sony STRDN860 7.2 Channel Hi-Res WiFi Network AV Receiver (Black).  The sound is substantially better.  I've tried music and movies that I have heard a number of times so I would be able to tell the difference right away.  And I definitely could tell there was a big difference.  Things just sound clearer and more powerful.This speaker is much larger than I expected it would be at 8.8 x 18.8 x 7.9 inches.  I didn't measure it out ahead of time, but it fit into my setup fine.  The cabinet feels solid and well-made.  The grill on the front is removable.I'll be enjoying my music and movies a lot more going forward, and will consider the ELAC brand when it comes time to upgrade the rest of my speakers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SH7PYXGSZ8SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GSEQWE#wasThisHelpful","R2SH7PYXGSZ8SW","A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This little camera is quite fun, especially for kids.  My 5-year old niece was enthralled with this camera.  But it's not just for kids.  There's a 10-megapixel camera and SD card slot in there so you can take great photos even without printing them.There were no instructions included, just a few diagrams.  No paper was included either, so make sure you pick up something like this: Polaroid 2x3 inch Premium ZINK Photo Paper TWIN PACK (20 Sheets).Unfortunately for this camera, there is no setting for turning the printing on or off.  If there is paper loaded, it will automatically print the photos you take.  You can take the paper out and then it will save to the SD card but a switch to turn the auto-print on or off would have been ideal.There are three photo modes:  full color, black and white, and a vintage sepia mode.  You can also turn on the traditional white border like the old Polaroid photos used to have.The printed, smudge-proof photos look okay for their size.  They only take a few seconds to print and you can keep taking more photos while a photo is still printing.At a price under $100, this is a fantastic little 10MP instant camera.  The only reason I gave it four stars and not five was because I wish there was a switch for turning the automatic printing on and off instead of having to remove the paper to prevent it from printing.A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBHQEAKCN6CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JIAD7C#wasThisHelpful","R1IBHQEAKCN6CR","A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This camera is excellent quality.  First, both the still images and the video are high resolution and very clear.  Night viewing works well too.  Images are pretty clear, albeit black and white of course.  Images can have a timestamp as well as the temperature on them.The build is all plastic, but it is well protected from the elements, with rubber seals on everything that opens and closes.  It has a built-in LCD screen and a remote control for configuration and testing.  It is powered by ""4 or 8 AA batteries"", with the manual warning that 4 will provide less power.  I assume that means less detection range, lesser quality images, less time it can run on standby.The camera requires a micro-SD card (preferably Class 10 so it can write 1080p video without studdering).  The manual also says that you can insert a SIM card and have it e-mail you pictures (and I'm not sure if it works for video too).  It has a detachable antennae for this purpose.You can hook the unit up to your computer via USB or you can view video on your TV using the included component cables.All-in-all, an excellent camera.

"This receiver provides great video and sound with my TV and Energy Take Classic 5.1 speakers.  Setup was easy, especially since it has WPS for connecting to your network router, so it was a matter of pressing the WPS button on my router to connect to my Wi-Fi network instead of manually entering my long password using the remote and an on-screen keyboard.Using banana plugs on your speakers is the easiest way to connect them to this receiver, but you can twist and insert your wires and clamp them down, too.  An audio return channel (ARC) allows you to use your smart TV's functions and have the sound be returned to the receiver so the sound comes out of your speakers.A software update was available and took quite awhile to finish, so I left it alone until it was done.  The on-screen menus are easy to navigate and respond quickly to remote button presses, which is a huge plus in my book.  There's nothing worse than a receiver that takes several seconds to respond to each button press.  Sometimes it will take a second or two for a menu to show at first, but navigation is quick.  Switching inputs is pretty fast, too.Sound and video is perfect.  I tested a bunch of inputs, like my Dish HD, Blu-ray discs, and streaming video from my Amazon Fire TV stick.  Everything looked and sounded great.  I just don't have any 4K hardware to try.I love that this receiver has Google Cast for casting music from my phone to the receiver.  Any Google Cast-able audio app will work with this receiver.  You can also stream audio using Bluetooth, or use the built-in Spotify.  You can also play audio from FM radio, a USB stick, or from a network resource like a DLNA server.This is a great receiver, but at the time of my review it may be a little overpriced at $450.  I'm sure the price will come down with time.

"This camera was easy to set up and the image quality is really good.  You can use the app to set it up, or you can connect to it directly on your network by going to the camera's IP address and set it up without the app.  So far, I've only been able to use the camera's browser viewer and the downloadable client to view the video.  I wanted to use this camera with the free software iSpy so I can integrate it with other cameras, but there is no information that I can find about the URLs for the camera's video feeds, which are required for setting up in third-party software.  Since it was not advertised as being compatible with third-party software, I did not ding the rating.Whether viewing at daytime or night, the image is clear.  There is also two-way audio for listening using the camera's mic or sending audio through the camera's speaker.  The pan and tilt works really well too.If I had one complaint, it would be all of the lights on the front.

"This siren works great with SmartThings V2 for notifying me in case of movement outside or my windows opening in the middle of the night.  I recently had someone trying to get into my house one night and now I am set up to be alerted in numerous ways of any activity outside or at my windows and doors.  This siren completes the project.In SmartThings, you can choose from 5 different alarm sounds and 3 volume levels on this siren.  The loudest setting is quite loud.  But even at the lowest volume setting, it was still a little loud for my dogs so I put masking tape over the speaker and now it is the best volume for my needs.  There are also bright flashing LEDs when the siren is triggered.This siren is exactly what I needed and it works great.

"Two years ago I moved into a new home whose front yard was neglected by the previous occupants.  The front yard (as well as the back) was in bad shape.  I had someone come and kill all of the weeds and then I covered the yard with this seed, then had someone come and aerate, and then I covered the yard with the seed again.  With enough water and time, and several more applications and aerations, I now have a fairly decent lawn in the front.  During the summer, the front yard gets a lot of shade and the summers are hot, and as long as I water enough the grass never gets brown.  In the spring and fall, when the leaves are not on the tree, the grass still holds up well.  I do wish the lawn was a bit thicker though.  I've repeatedly added more seed each time I aerate and I can't get the grass as thick as I can in the back yard with full sun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZMQK8NOGUOCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHOZ3QC#wasThisHelpful","RZMQK8NOGUOCZ","A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Klutz Lego Crazy Action Contraptions Kit is a great starting point to getting movement in your Lego Creations.  The book comes complete with all the pieces required to make small moving toys, utilizing wheels, rubber bands, and of course Legos!  The projects are simple to follow, and most kids will be able to do the projects themselves with minimal help.I found this book very helpful as it got my kids thinking and adding the moving components to larger Lego sculptures they were building.  Because these are Legos, this set is compatible obviously with Lego, but also Megablok and generic Legos.  The pieces fit snugly together, and when added to slightly bigger sculptures, the kids can have some pretty neat moving toys.Overall, my kids really loved this set - we liked it enough to gift this to Lego enthusiast kid friend with great success.  While this set is definitely isn't as exciting as getting a character based 100 piece Lego boxed set, the replay value of this book is much greater, and a great way to foster creativity in your kids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K6NSVPHEVZ6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591747775#wasThisHelpful","R2K6NSVPHEVZ6P","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think I've found the perfect lights for both Christmas decor and for the long summer nights decor - these is probably the only lights you can hang up year round without feeling a pang of guilt for not taking down!  The Heartybay Solar Led Multi Colored Starfish String Lights is such a fun light string to have in your home - inside or out!  There are multiple light settings (gradient chasing, fast gradient chasing, dim to bright alternating, red/yellow only to green/purple only, fast/slow flashing, steady on, fast only flashing, whole string slow fade on and off) and each bulb is very large solidly made.  The starfish are surprisingly flatter than I expected - the photo looks as if the starfish are flat on one side and raised on the other, but they are as textured as they look.  Each starfish is a little less than 1/2"" thick at the thickest point in the center of the starfish.The lights are attached on a black wire so they blend into foliage easily, each bulb is perfectly clear and take on the color of each LED light, and light's power and various modes can be operated via the small solar panel box. As long as the panel gets light, the string will turn on once the lights go out.  The color combination is exactly as seen in the photo - red, yellow, light green, and purple.There is a small sheet included that give information on the lights, instructions on how to place the solar panel, and warnings not to replace the bulbs should they go out. It was noted that there are over 20000 hours guaranteed for bulb operation. It takes anywhere between 4-8 hours to charge these lights, depending on if it's cloudy or not, and the lights stay on for anywhere between 8-15 hours depending on if you have the light flashing or steady.  I'm not sure what would happen if one bulb burns out, but it looks like I'll have quite a while before I find out. I left the lights in the ""on"" position and found they would turn off during the day to charge, and light up by the time the sun was setting.  The lights stayed on longer than I could stay up to monitor them.  Overall, I'm very pleased with these lights. These are a great ""set it and forget it"" set of lights that are a fun addition to any home or garden.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"I got the ETSYG 32"" silk scarf in the Black Floral Pink pattern, and I must say that it's an absolutely lovely scarf.  It's exactly 32""x32"" square, very well printed, and very soft.  My neck usually gets very cold, even in warm weather, and I like to wear a scarf at most times.  Because wool and cotton scarves are often too hot to wear in warm weather, these silk scarves are a good option to lightly cover my neck and keep it warm.  It's light enough to simply toss into my bag should I get too hot, and stylish enough to tie on my bag for fun.  The scarf does wash very well, and it didn't fade after a wash.  I do hang my clothes on a rack to dry, so I can say how a dryer would affect the fabric.Unfortunately, at 32"" square, it's not big enough for me to tie and wear as a shirt or a coverup on the beach, so if you're looking to make a nice quick vest or top out a scarf, you're going to have to look elsewhere.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the quality and color of the fabric and love the print.  I would certainly purchase this again.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"Prior to getting the Conair Cuisinart 2 lb Bread Maker, I had a Zojirushi BBCC-V20 Home Bakery Traditional Breadmaker.  In comparison to the Zo, this unit has it beat in every aspect possible.  I tossed my old Zo years ago and swore off bread machines until I received one as a gift from family.  I could go on and on about how bad the Zo was from the start (burnt bottoms and raw bread tops, poor mixing, etc) and how it seemed to go from bad to worse.  I'm so pleased to report that the Cuisinart has restored my faith in a good bread machine.  This bread machine is easy to use, easily mixes and kneads dough, and bakes up a very evenly colored loaf.The unit is very easy to use - simply select a mode, loaf size, and crust color.  After setting everything, put your ingredients in the bread maker and push start.  There are multiple modes to choose from, including white, wheat, french, sweet, gluten free, packaged mix, and cake settings.  There are also settings for simply making dough, pasta dough, jam, and even a bake only setting for those who like kneading their dough by hand.  For those who want to have a fresh baked loaf in the morning without having to get up early, there is also a delayed start option.  I tried out a delayed start for a plain white loaf the other night with great results.  I put everything in (liquids on bottom, flour in middle, and yeast on top) and woke up 8 hours later to a beautifully browned loaf.In comparison to my old machine, the machine bakes up a surprisingly even and lovely colored loaf.  I've had so many failed loaves from my old Zo and didn't have high expectations for this machine.  The loaves that come out of this machine are soft, tender, and so evenly colored!  For rolls and filled bao, I've used the dough only option and had perfectly kneaded dough with little work.  The dough doesn't stick to the inner pan, and the single large paddle seems to get everything mixed very well.Overall, while I still enjoy making a loaf using my Kitchenaid or by hand, this bread machine definitely earned its spot in my kitchen for a fast convenient bread.  I can't highly recommend it enough, and am very pleased with the overall ease of operation and product that comes from it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13X0LDJXA6ZSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001C2KY7Y#wasThisHelpful","R13X0LDJXA6ZSG","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The USA Toys Paradise Adult Coloring Book is a fantastic gift for the aspiring artist in your life.  Coloring is very soothing and relaxing, and it's really enjoyable to kick back and color in a coloring book.  Unlike children's coloring books, these books are highly detailed and can only be well colored utilizing fine tipped colored pencils.  The pages are high quality and thick for easy coloring, and each illustration is beautiful and very detailed.Unlike most adult coloring books I've seen in our local craft stores, this book has illustrations on both sides of each page.  Many of the adult coloring books I've seen feature art only on one side (presumably to rip out and display once compete) which really cuts down the amount you can color.  In addition, these pages are full page illustrations.  With little to no ""dead space"", this offers much more opportunity to color, although less opportunity for you to sketch anything in.  There are a few opportunities to free sketch, but on the whole, most of the book is filled in with tiny detailed areas for you to color.  The book has a good thick cover, and all the pages are printed on heavy weigh paper.  This is very helpful as the paper is less likely to tear unlike traditional coloring books.  The illustrations inside are focused on tropical theme - you will see plenty of flamingos, hummingbirds, peacocks, butterflies, fish, and flowers in this book.Included with this coloring book is a 24 pack of Staedler Triangle Barrel Colored Pencils.  By themselves, these pencils cost around $17 on Amazon (Staedtler Mars Triangular EZ Grip Colored Pencil Assorted (24 Color) (1))  If you buy this coloring book set, you're pretty much paying $3 for the addition of the coloring book, which compared to other coloring books is a bargain.  The pencils are high quality, color in easily, and are very vibrant and bright.  There is a good variety of colors, and the colors can be blended nicely.  Having triangle barrels also keep the pencils from rolling around and off the table, should you spread all your pencils out.The book and colored pencil set would make an easy and wonderful gift for a friend - or for yourself!

"I recently purchased a stainless steel gull wing style clothes drying rack (Stainless Steel Clothes Drying Rack - Premium Quality) and wanted a second rack to dry more clothes on.  In an effort to reduce our family's carbon footprint while lowering our electricity bill, I finally got around to getting the second drying rack.  The Household Essentials folding X-Frame clothes drying rack works fantastically at drying smaller clothing items.  The unit folds up and down very smoothly and easily, and it can hold a fair amount of small clothing items such as children's shirts, hand towels, underwear, and socks.  Since it is stainless steel, the unit is not prone to rust.  In addition, the unit folds down very compactly (you can easily stow this under the bed/couch).While this rack is good for drying smaller items, the biggest issue I have with this rack is that it's impossible to dry larger items without having fabric overlap.  Because the bars are situated so they are not staggered, if you were to hang a standard bath towel over the first top bar, the middle and bottom bar will be completely covered by the towel, thus rendering them useless to dry things.  With that in mind, this rack is good, but limited in use.  If you are planning to use this to dry smaller items like cloth diapers, this is a great unit to have.  Also, if you are short on space, this rack is nice to have as it has a very small footprint.Overall, would I trade my gull wing rack for this one? No.  Gull wing racks simply hold more, can accommodate hangers to dry shirts and dresses, and work better when drying larger items like sheets.  However, the X-Frame rack is perfect for drying diapers, socks, small hand towels, and underwear.  Its compact size is good for smaller items, and honestly, any drying rack is better than no drying rack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUN8MU6IM09H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BOCNRO#wasThisHelpful","R1PUN8MU6IM09H","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The husband recently received the Poweradd Pilot as a gift, and I have to say that this is a really great portable charger to have with you.  First off, the unit is very sleek, compact, and lightweight.  At 264 g (9.3 oz), it's not too heavy to carry around, and in terms of size it's about the size of most smartphones out there.  The charger comes with two available USB charging ports, so both my husband and I can charge our phones at the same time, should we choose to.This is definitely a great product to have when traveling, or simply to carry in your bag in case your phone is low on battery and you don't have time to sit at a coffee shop to charge your phone all the way.

"My cockatiel can be quite a picky eater.  I admit, this is not his favorite food (that would be seeds or those fruit flavored pellets), but a cockatiel cannot live by treats alone, and pellets are a good option for his dietary needs.  Harrison's Adult Lifetime Fine at first may seem expensive, but it is definitely healthier than an all seed diet for my little bird, and the waste caused by seed throwing has dropped significantly - any pellet that is dropped will later be picked up by my bird and eaten.  The pellets are easy for my bird to ""crack"" and swallow or swallow whole, and he was much more receptive to these pellets than other brands plain pellets.To help transition my bird from seed to a full pelleted diet, I mixed the seeds with pellets then started lowering the ratio of seed to pellet.  The breeder whom I got my bird from also supplemented the diet with Zupreem Fruit blend, and I noticed those fruit pellets were the first my bird would go for, so I kept it in his diet for some variety (which he loves).  My bird definitely has responded well to this food and his looks very healthy.  A single pound bag lasts my cockatiel quite a while, and to keep things fresh, I put the mix in a large mason jar and keep it on a cool shelf.  Overall, he's be doing very well on Harrison's and looks and acts very healthy.  I will definitely be purchasing this again for him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24WS1PY3VHR7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007LI0WC#wasThisHelpful","R24WS1PY3VHR7I","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For those of you who collect Peanuts ornaments, this ornament may look vaguely familiar.  Well, rest assured, it's not you - this 50th Anniversary ornament is a revamped version of the 2004 ""Love to Dance"" ornament that originally featured only Schroeder and Snoopy (Love to Dance Peanuts Snoopy 2004 hallmark ornament).  While this ornament has one thing I wanted on the original 2004 ornament - Lucy - I think I prefer the original over the newer model.My biggest issue with this version of the ornament is that Snoopy is no longer dancing up and down, but instead swings side to side.  Visually, this doesn't bother me much (although Snoopy does bounce up and down when he dances normally), however the clicking sound that Snoopy makes does.  Each time Snoopy turns, you can hear a distinctive ""clickclickclick"" as he moves.  This is distracting as you can hear the clicking over the music.The noise aside, this ornament is very cute.  I personally would have liked to see an ornament that featured Charlie Brown with Snoopy and the gang around the ""upgraded poor tree"" for the 50th Anniversary Ornament, but hey - beggars can't be choosers.  This is still quite a cute ornament to add to any Peanuts fan's collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JNQ77WCGX444/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSR8WZS#wasThisHelpful","R2JNQ77WCGX444","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For years, my family and I have been collecting various Peanuts ornaments for Christmas.  The Peanuts Flying Ace ornament is quite possibly my favorite ornament to date - Snoopy isn't on his signature dog house, but totally rocking one awesome biplane!  The ornament features the sound of Snoopy flying through the air and bullets firing (similar to the sound of the dogfight scene from It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown) as well as a short ""Flight of the Valkyries"" fanfare near the end.  The sound comes out clearly, the ornament is highly detailed, and the whole thing looks adorable.  This is definitely a great ornament to get any Peanuts fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AYI0DJD41QZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSR8MRQ#wasThisHelpful","R1AYI0DJD41QZE","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TSSS Wireless LED Solar Security Light is very easy to install, charges using sun power, and is very bright.  I needed a small light in my backyard to encourage my dog to go further back in the yard to take care of his business.  I ended up mounting the light on the fence in direct sunlight, and by evening the light turned on by itself and illuminated a good around in the backyard.  The light is bright, charges easily, and literally takes care of itself - I don't need to worry about flipping any switches!  Overall, great light to have - definitely going to consider buying more to help illuminate the small pathway on the side of the house!FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"The AOKDA screen protector is very simple to apply and feels very durable on the phone.  When using it, the touch sensitivity on my iPhone is not compromised, and with exception of the raised edge around my Home button, I cannot tell it's there.  The AOKDA protector can be repositioned if you place it on incorrectly the first time, and does a fine job of protecting my iPhone screen. The protector was much simpler to apply than those bendable plastic screens - the air bubbles come out very quickly and easily, and you really just need to drop this protector on and it sticks nicely.While I haven't dropped my phone to breaking point again, the screen protector is much thicker than my previous plastic protector. Despite being thicker, I'm able to use my phone as normal, and can access the home button just fine (although there is a little ridge there that takes getting used to). I've had a few minor drops with the screen protector in place, and it seems to be holding up just fine. When dropped, it didn't scratch easily and seemed to do it's job.Overall, I'm very pleased with this screen protector. It's easy to install, feels thick and durable, and once applied you can barely tell it's there.

"This book is structured like a journey. You will be introduced to Paul, his background, witness his conversion, follow him along his 1st, 2nd and 3rd missionary journeys. The chapters are entitled, 1.) Called to Follow Christ, 2.) Called to Go, 3.) Called to Suffer, 4.) Called to Love, 5.) Called to Give, and 6.) Called to Be Faithful. To give it more context and meaning, there are many pictures, maps and timelines that accompany the text.Mr. Hamilton draws many parallels in the book including how Paul and Jonah were used by good to calm the storm and deliver their shipmates. For those who are of traditional upbringing in faith this may be heresy as Mr. Hamilton mentions, ""Many have been taught that people who do not personally receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior will spend eternity in hell. Paul's writings and theology are more nuanced that that and seem to leave room for alternative answers to the eternal fate of nonbelievers."" Along with that there are many comparisons and speculations and estimations. ""At most my fitness bracelet registered fifteen thousand steps walked in a day, but Paul routinely walked more than thirty thousand steps while carrying his accommodations on his back."" What I do about this book is how he traces the steps of Paul and has pictures of all the traditional spots. There are questions brought that I never thought of as a ""mature Christian"" who's grown up in the Church. Questions like how, the Book of Acts abruptly ends. He also discuss authorship debates that are more along the lines of Christianity studies you might encounter in a university level study. Also mentioned are the apocryphal Acts of Paul as he cites 1 Clement 5:5-7. (Clement is among the list of Rejected books, not considered part of the New Testament Canon.) He also includes the graphic tradition/legend that says Paul's head bounced three times upon striking the ground, and in each place that his head bounced, a spring or fountain came up from the ground.This might be recommended for the more mature Christian but I would not recommend this to new Christians starting off in their faith.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RREOTCYSWSGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630882623#wasThisHelpful","R3RREOTCYSWSGM","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Petsafe Current Pet Fountain isn't quite what I would call a fountain as much as a ""filtering system"".  It's a vibrantly colored water bowl that operates quietly, filters effectively, but ultimately wasn't for my dog.The Papillon Prince was drank from the Petsafe Fountain with little complaint, but when his original water fountain dish returned a week later and was poised near this dish, he made a definite beeline for the cascading water.  I don't know if it's because the water truly tasted better, but he seemed to enjoy the splashing and ""drinking fountain"" style water dish much more.  While my dog didn't go back to this dish, this may differ for your pet. For all I know, my dog could've been going back to the dish that smelled more familiar to him as ""his"".That said, the Petsafe Current Fountain isn't too bad - just not what I expected.  The large bowl holds 15 cups of water (3.5 liters), takes up about a square foot in space, and has nonsplashing continuous running water.  The water moves just barely, so if you have pets who like the splashing movements like my dog, you may want to look for something else.  The bowl is very lightweight, and can be easily tipped by curious pets.  The cord isn't too long, which can be both a good or bad thing, depending on where you're placing the bowl.  To refill the bowl, you can simply pour in more water, and the filters are easy to change and readily available.Overall, while this bowl wasn't for us, this may be good for other pets.  The deduction of star is based primarily on color and how lightweight the bowl is - it really is easy to tip this bowl in comparison to his current fountain bowl, and frankly, the color is hideous.  That aside, it works as advertised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UUCT4YYOSZEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151JV6MK#wasThisHelpful","R1UUCT4YYOSZEZ","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Omgar Insulated Lunch Bags are a great value set of lunch bags.  The bags are thick, durable, and hold a good sized lunch inside of them.  In all honesty, they're not the most attractive looking bags, but my kids don't really care, and they LOVED the fact that these can keep their lunches hot or cold - depending on what's being served.The bags hold a good amount inside of them.  I'm able to put a 2 or 4 cup round Pyrex container, a full 16 ounce bottle of water, and a gala apple in the bag with plenty of room to spare.  For those who own a Ms. Bento 2 tiered container (Zojirushi Ms.Bento Stainless Lunch Jar, Aqua Blue), this also fits in there.  A six pack of sodas can fit in a single bag.  If you wanted, you could fit a 24 ounce container of yogurt in one with some room to spare - yes, these bags are fairly roomy and you can pack a good sized lunch in them!  There are some side pockets on the bag which I found to be perfect for holding utensils.  The bags are lightweight, easy to wipe the insides to clean, and can be zippered shut.  Because the zipper is on the top, kids will also not turn their food contents sideways, like most insulated lunch boxes.Overall, my two kids really liked their lunch bags. They're lightweight, durable, and hold a good amount of food inside while keeping the food hot/cold.  These would be great bags for day trips, holding road trip snacks, and definitely for every day school/work lunches.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"The Suzuki Piano School Volume 1 is a great starter book in teaching your kid classical music.  This book focuses on ""tonalization"" - the search for ways of producing beautiful sound from instruments in the same way that singers use vocalization to developing their singing voices.  When first starting this book, the music looks (and is) very simple.  The first quarter of the book focuses on multiple variations of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"".  While it seemed redundant to the kid initially, it really helped him hear the differences between the different tempos and dynamics.  Being able to count accurately really matters in the beginning - if you don't have a teacher helping you, there is also a CD that helps you hear the song and understand what exactly is going on.  The CD is very helpful, and will be much more helpful down the line once you get into the second and third volumes.  Also, if you have a teacher who understands and can teach the Suzuki Method, it will help speed things greatly.This particular volume is an international version, so there are four translations inside - English, German, French, and Spanish.  This doesn't hinder nor clutter the book at all.  Overall, this is a great book to have in your kid's piano lessons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3US9FYOOQ4GYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OTEER6#wasThisHelpful","R3US9FYOOQ4GYO","A3U029B8Z5WGI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U029B8Z5WGI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rumio Makeup Coutour Kit is a good kit for the beginner makeup and contour artist.  The makeup goes on lightly, which is great for everyday use, and blends well.  I had no issues with skin irritation, and the color palette included can be blended to match any skin tone.  The cakes are really quite large - with that much product, it's not hard to convince myself to practice layering on, and I don't feel bad using more product.  The one drawback - which can also be seen as a strength - is that the makeup goes on quite sheer.  For those who are trying to get a really pronounced effect, you will need to layer on quite a lot to get the desired effect.  Unfortunately, that also makes the makeup very powdery and noticeable.  For those who like a soft and less defined look, this works well enough.The palette is thin for easy storage, and features 6 different contouring powders.

"I've been using my Keurig 117644 2.0 K200 Brewer, Black for some time now, and while I love my machine, I hate that I have to keep paying at minimum $0.30 per cup for fairly mediocre coffee/tea blends that Keurig puts out. To add insult to injury, the carafe packs are at least $1.88 per pod, and the flavors are not nearly as abundant as the k-pod blends.  To be honest, even finding generic k-carafe pods can be difficult, and while my friends enjoyed that I made each of them a separate k-cup coffee, sometimes it would be nice to just make one carafe of coffee that everyone likes instead of four single cups.The Fanor Reusable K-Cup and K-Carafe Filters are a great solution to my problem. The reusable cups come in a convenient pack of two, so you can make either a single K-Cup or one large carafe of coffee or tea. The overall feel of the cups are durable, and the K-Cups are completely compatible with my Keurig 2.0 Machine so I don't have to have hack the machine with a piece of genuine k-carafe foil and a piece of tape. FYI - the cups are these hideous colors because the color overrides the Keurig's reader so they will work with your machine.  I would've liked these in a less bright color, but it doesn't work that way.To use the carafe cup, simply fill the cup up 2/3 full, place the pod in the Keurig so you can read the text on it (hinge is facing downwards), then use your Keurig as normal.  For the single cups, you'll need to align the arrows so the striped looking arrow faces downward and the hinge of the cup is facing upwards.  I've tested out these cups with both coffee and tea with good results. One disclaimer noted on the package is that you must make sure that if you're using coffee is neither very finely nor coarsely ground. I grind my own coffee and the results have been favorable.  I don't buy preground, so I can't give feedback regarding that.  The cups are also very easy to clean.Overall, the K-Cup and K-Carafe filters work as advertised.  They work well with my machine, can hold a decent amount of coffee/tea, and are easy to clean.

"The Curtzy Silicone Rubber Chocolate Molds are easily washed, very pliable for easy chocolate release, smooth textured, and really very cute.  This set includes six different trays in which to mold chocolates and other candies.  These molds work particularly well with chocolate as they create a flawless shiny surface.  There were no bubbles, pits, or scratches on the interior of the molds.  Be sure when you wash the molds to use non abrasive cleansers or sponges so you don't scratch the insides of the molds - if there are any scratches, your chocolates will look dull.One thing to note is that you should definitely wash these out carefully when you first receive them.  There is a slight plasticky scent to these molds that do go away once washed.The molds included are all five pictured, as well as an additional mold with four rocking horses, three small cars, four Lego-esque bricks, and three whole body bears.  The molds are really adorable, particularly the animal set, and in some cases very detailed such as the flower set.  My favorite set is the chocolate spoon set - the spoon bowl is even slightly concave, so you can pipe a bit of mousse in there for a cute, but elegant dessert.Overall, this is a really great chocolate mold set.  They work very well, and the chocolates comes out smoothly and easily.  I've included some tips on tempering chocolate below for these molds.To get really glossy chocolate, you should temper the chocolate over indirect heat (in a double boiler).  Melt three-fourths of the chocolate needed using small chopped pieces of chocolate and stir constantly as it melts, heating it to about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the chocolate is smooth, remove it from the heat and add the remaining chocolate, stirring it in until it's melted and the temperature has dropped to about 80 degrees. To finish the temper, heat the chocolate again in the double boiler to between 88 and 91 degrees for dark chocolate, or 86 and 88 degrees for milk chocolate.  Place the silicone molds on a baking sheet or tray, and pour the melted chocolate into the molds. For smooth chocolates, the molds must be filled to the rim. You may need to smooth the chocolate into small details using the tip of a toothpick. Air bubbles can become trapped inside the poured chocolate. Lightly tapping the mold on the counter dislodges the bubbles. You can also prevent air bubbles by brushing a thin coat of the tempered chocolate onto the inside of each mold before pouring.  Place the molds in the fridge for 20 minutes to cure the chocolate, then turn the molds upside down and tap or press lightly on the underside to remove the finished candy.  Completed candies will fall from the mold very easily.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"I purchased my first Pure Komachi by Kai 6-1/2-Inch Stainless-Steel Chef’s Meat Knife in 2004, and now 11 years later, I still have and use the knife.  When given the opportunity to try out the Kai Pure Komachi Knives HD, I was really interested.  First off, the most noticeable difference is that the knives are no longer made in Japan by the Kai Corporation in Seki City.  These knives are now made in China as indicated on the handle.  I'm unsure if the knives are full tang as their handles are no longer translucent.The Komachi HD knives are fairly similar to the first generation Komachi knives.  The knives are very lightweight and very sharp.  I tried out all the knives on various food items including meats, vegetables, and fruits of various hardnesses with great success.  The handles fit my hand very well, and the overall look of the knives are playful and fun.  Each knife comes with a blade sheath so accidentally getting a cut while getting a knife from a drawer in minimized.  Because these knives are stainless steel (albeit coated), they can be sharpened if needed (with exception of the serrated knife).While I like these knives for casual ""small meals cooking"" use, I can say that if your budget allows, definite invest in a heavier weight knife.  Because these knives are so lightweight, if you're doing a large load of prep, your hand and wrist may get tired.  In comparison to my Henkels blade, I find that I can do larger amounts of prep with less effort with the Henkels - but that said, the Henkels is much more expensive.If the current Komachi knives are anything like my previous Komachi knife, I will say this knife will last a long time without having to sharpen much.  I'm not sure about the longer term quality as of yet, but I can say that my 11 year old Komachi knife does have some rusting in the handle and discoloration due to lot of use, but still can cut through chicken and vegetables with great ease.  This is with near daily use and a rare sharpening.  The long term Komachi quality (at least the Japan version) seems fantastic.  I'm hoping the China version lasts as long.Overall, these are a great option for a budget set of knives.  These are certainly worth recommending to college students or casual cooks on a budget.  They are sharp and cut well.  Definitely worth a look at as a gift or for your own kitchen.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"The Herbalosophy Nourish Masque is a good deep conditioning hair masque.  Instead of a small tub, the product comes in an easy to squeeze out tube.  The masque deeply conditioned my hair, although I left it in for about 15 minutes instead of 5 (not intentional, just started doing something else and forgot).  The masque made my hair feel soft and very manageable after use.  It is very thick, and the tube holds about 2-3 applications for people with slightly longer than shoulder length hair. The conditioner rinses out easily, despite being a very thick product, and has a mild herbal scent.  The only gripe I have is that this masque needs to be applied to damp, not wet, hair and left on for at least five minutes to work.  Unless you're shaving your legs or something, that's a long time to be standing around in the shower with partially dry hair.  This holds particularly true for those who are on major water restrictions due to drought (welcome to California).  That aside, the masque did work well, although because of the hassle, I would lean back in favor of other conditioners.

"The NockNock Solar Fairy Lights are a fun set of lights to put in your yard.  The lights are completely solar powered, can run in either a steady or blinking mode, and come on a black string so it blends seamlessly into any foliage/item it's hung on.  I put our lights on a small bush in our front yard with good results.  As long as the small panel is situated directly in the sun, the lights will charge well and automatically turn on once the sun sets.  The lights stayed on for quite a while - in fact, I've gone to bed and the lights would still be on.  By the morning, the lights would be off and start charging again.  On days of overcast, the lights don't charge nearly as much, and I noticed them off before the 8 hour mark.  The lights really are dependent on how much sunlight it gets during the day.  Despite being called ""warm white"", the lights do not have an overtly yellow tinge to them - our set didn't have the ""cool white"" blue tinge either - the coloring of the lights is really quite white and looks great outdoors.The lights work very well on ""steady mode"", but I can't say it works as well on ""blinking mode"".  For whatever reason, the company decided to make all the lights blink on and off at the same time.  Because none of the lights alternate in blinking, the entire string will be off, then on - it's really kind of bizarre looking, so I never use that function.  That aside, the lights work very well and are easy to install.

"The Fuloon Foldable Pet Swimming Pool/Bath Tub works fantastically as a foldaway tub.  First off, when you first receive this, I would highly suggest airing this tub out - it smells terribly of chemically plastic when you initially receive it!  My biggest gripe out this pool really stems to that smell - to be safe, I  scrubbed out the interior of the pool to make sure any residual chemical coating was washed off.  I also aired it out for a couple of days, just to be safe.  Once the plastic smell is gone, the pool works great.  I was able to fill it with water without it leaking, and it it held up fine while giving the dog a bath.  In addition, the pool was easy to fold back up and put back into the accompanying plastic carrying bag.  This is great because the pool itself doesn't take up much room, and I can store it on a shelf without much effort.Overall, this is a good sized pool to bath dogs, or to use as a wading pool for a smaller dog.

"The CAILLER L'Art Du Brut Dark Chocolate Cocoa Bar is a delicious bar for any dark chocolate lover.  This bar of chocolate is much thicker than your standard Hershey's bar, and so full of nuts and blueberries that the chocolate can't completely cover everything.  The chocolate is definitely not very sweet - if you've eaten Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate chips, the Caillier chocolate bar is even less sweet than that.  While not very sweet, the chocolate is naturally sweetened by the nuts and blueberries.  I love how this chocolate is minimal in ingredients, and does not contain filler oils that would make it taste waxy.The bar is decadent and makes a lovely treat.

"I ordered the Sztrokia Tempered Glass Screen Protector on October 13 and received it almost 2 weeks later on October 26, even despite the estimated Nov. 25 arrival date.  That said, if you order this screen protector, it's definitely not going to show up in 2 days (unless it's offered via Prime at this time) and since it's shipping from China, will likely take its sweet time getting here.The Sztrokia screen protector is very simple to apply, can be repositioned if you place it on incorrectly the first time, and does a fine job of protecting my iPhone screen.  The protector was much simpler to apply than those bendable plastic screens - the air bubbles come out very quickly and easily, and you really just need to drop this protector on and it sticks nicely.While I haven't dropped my phone to breaking point again, the Sztrokia screen protector is much thicker than my previous plastic protector.  Despite being thicker, I'm able to use my phone as normal, and can access the home button just fine (although there is a little ridge there that takes getting used to).  I've had a few minor drops with the Sztrokia in place, and it seems to be holding up just fine.  When dropped, it didn't scratch easily and seemed to do it's job.Overall, I'm very pleased with this screen protector.  It's easy to install, feels thick and durable, and once applied you can barely tell it's there.  Definitely a good way to protect your iPhone screen.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"I love having my house scented, but I don't like having to use chemical laced air fresheners, nor do I like having to worry about the residual smoke or potential fire hazard a candle may have should I leave it alone for too long.  The Vividay Aroma Ultrasonic Diffuser is a great compromise - I can have a lovely scented house without having to worry about chemicals or accidentally torching my house down.The Diffuser is one of the largest I've seen.  It holds 500 ml (about 2.25 cups) of water and can run continuously for quite a long time before running out of water.  There are three preset amounts of time - 1, 2, and 3 hours - as well as a general ""on"" switch where you can leave it on until you decide it to turn it off or when the machine runs out of water, whatever comes first.  The diffuser also has a built in lamp with two light setting - bright or dim light.  The light is definitely not bright enough to read to, but works well as a soft mood light or night light.  I found when paired with some soft ambient music, this light and diffuser worked well to create a very calming environment.The Vividay diffuser has a very large opening to allow a fine vapor smoke to be released.  The vapor can come out as either a light or heavy mist.  It is recommended to put 2-3 drops of essential oil per 100 ml of water.  I tested this unit out with a ""breathe"" blend essential oil as both the husband and kid suffer from seasonal allergies.  This unit worked very well in helping them breathe a little easier.  The ""smoke"" comes out very cleanly and quietly, and the scent is distributed very well.  The unit operates using a standard two pronged outlet, and can be refilled easily by simply lifting off the top lid and adding more water/oil.The one issue I had with this machine is with the settings.  First, when you make any selection that requires pushing a button, the unit will beep very loudly.  Any button you push will result in either a loud single or double beep.  In addition, when using the machine, it was initially difficult to figure out which was the high/low setting.  I found that when you push the high/low button that the high setting is indicated by a single beep and the low setting is indicated by a double beep.  I couldn't figure this out until the lights were out and I utilized the lamp feature where I could clearly see the smoke.  While this issue wasn't great enough for me to dock a star, let it be known that the beeping can be annoying at times.Overall, the unit really worked well, and I love how well the diffuser worked and how it could hold a large store of water.  While no one has gotten sick yet, I can imagine this will be an incredibly useful machine once someone gets their first cold and when winter comes into full swing and when we have our house heater on.  The diffuser definitely helps moisturize the air, works very quietly, and is simple but lovely looking.  This along with a good set of essential oils would be a great gift for anyone.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"As a long time fan of Harry Potter, I was thrilled to see the series finally being produced as a colorful illustrated version.  My kids are on the younger end of the elementary school, and while they can enjoy chapter books devoid of pictures, having illustrations included are a big plus, and it helps them understand a little more of what's going on/what certain characters and scenes could look like.  The story is included in its entirety, and the illustrations are absolutely gorgeous.

"My 15 lb Papillon is a very selective chewer. For a long time now, I've been giving him pressed vegetarian bones such as Greenies or Whimzees. When he was smaller, I gave him a rawhide bone to find out that they're not nearly as digestible as claimed - rawhide caused him to get upset stomach and the runs.  While he liks the veggie bones, he could quickly go through one in less in than five minutes.  In addition, I noticed his breath was not improving because his teeth were not getting a good workout.  Bully Sticks are a great option for him because they're easily digestible, it takes him some time to chew through them, and they help clean his teeth through all the chewing action.My dog totally loves these Bully Sticks. Initially I was worried that he would have difficulty chewing through these sticks because these are much larger than most treats he gets, but the worry was unwarranted.  My dog was able to chew through these without any issues.  These sticks are all at least 12"" in length, and a little thicker than your average Sharpie, but thinner than a Mr. Sketch marker.  As a warning, the bag that the sticks come in will not seal after you open it because the sticks are so long .  You may need to put them in a gallon ziploc bag, or cut the sticks in half in order to close the bag.  Because my dog is smaller, it's advised to only give him half a stick.  I was able to cut all the sticks in half using my pruning shears and ended up storing them in a ziploc bag in the freezer.  Storing in the freezer was not necessary - most people freeze them to keep the odor down, but these have little to no odor - I stored these in the freezer because my dog enjoys the harder and cold texture.  The Best Bully Stick website also suggests storing these in the freezer as it keeps the sticks fresher longer.My dog didn't have any stomach issues and was able to digest the pieces he swallowed just fine. The sticks are not greasy like a bone, but is smooth and dry like a pig ear.  While my dog chewed, I didn't notice any scent and he didn't have bad breath afterwards.  In comparison to the vegetable sticks, the Bully Sticks are much better at keeping my dog busy while cleaning his teeth. The veggie sticks were too easy for him to chew through, and I've noticed since giving him the Bully Sticks, his breath and teeth health have improved vastly. It's great that my dog can chew for longer than five minutes - I love how it's keeping him extra busy in the afternoon! The cost is reasonable, if not better than our local pet store.  I'll definitely be buying this treat for him once he finishes the bag!FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"The Luseta Coconut Milk Shampoo and Conditioner Set is great for dry hair. I have medium length Asian hair which tends to lean on the drier and more porous side. I often wear my hair tied back, and get plenty of sunshine on my hair throughout the day. The shampoo and conditioner set really helped make my hair feel soft and manageable. It has a lovely coconut scent that's fairly strong when using in the shower, but fades to a soft and pleasant scent when dry.  If you love coconut scent as much as I do, you're going to love using this set - the scent is simply divine!The Luseta Coconut Milk formula was great for my dry hair - the white shampoo lathered up well, rinsed out easily and didn't make my hair feel overly ""clean"" to the point of squeaking. I used the matching conditioner afterwards and its scent matched the shampoo. It also rinsed out easily and didn't leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.  The shampoo is gentle and moisturizing enough to use by itself, but works much better when using in conjunction with the conditioner.Overall, this is a really wonderful quality shampoo. It works perfectly as a daily conditioning shampoo set, and left my hair looking and feeling very healthy.

"The Cupider Waterproof vibrator just didn't cut it for me, in more ways than one.  In comparison to the Cupider Rabbit (Freeker Masturbation Female G Spot Clitoral Multi Speed Bunny Rabbit Vibrator (Rose)) this vibrator really fell short.  First off, this particular unit uses an uncommon battery.  I'm guessing it's one of those shorter AA looking photo batteries, but I couldn't get the battery to come out of the unit.  I shook it, got out some tweezers, and basically spent 15 minutes trying to unsuccessfully remove the battery to examine it.  One this battery is out, playtime is literally going to be over.The vibrations on this unit is really great - there are three vibration modes (one low, one high, and one alternating from vaginal to clitoral stimulation), and powerwise, this unit is on the mark.  The operation is strong, the sound on this is really minimal, and the silicone outside is silky smooth.  However, the overall unit is fairly small - not much larger than your average hot dog - and without a handle of sorts, it's difficult to hold and use.For a buck more, I would get the larger ""upgraded"" rabbit vibrator by Cupider.  It has 30 vibration modes, a handle for better handling, and uses standard AAA batteries.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"The Famili Digital Food Scale is a fantastic small item scale.  The scale is 8""x6.5""x0.75"" in size and weighs 534 g (18.8 oz).  It's weighable surface is about 6.5""x6.5"", if you don't want to block the readout screen at all.  The scale looks and functions almost identically to a body scale - the surface is all glass and smooth and the weight is calculated by the feet of the scale.  You will need to have a good flat surface for this scale to work accurately.The Famili Scale is very accurate and is able to detect and accurately weigh items as low as 3 grams to up to 11 pounds.  It's a little disappointing the scale doesn't weight down to 1 gram like my other kitchen scale, but it's exceptionally rare when I have to weigh out a single gram of anything.  The scale can tare a mixing bowl, so you don't have to make any calculations to subtract container weight, and the scale is able to measure items in fluid ounces.  The fluid ounce measurements were accurate, although there is a warning regarding measuring oil.  If you choose to measure oil, it will result in a volume reading of +10%.  You will need to adjust accordingly.The scale operates on two AAA batteries, and has a very bright LED readout screen so it makes seeing the numbers much easier.  One thing I didn't particularly care for is that the numbers on the readout screen are small - about 0.5"" in size.  I like having larger numbers so when I'm baking I can see what I put in from afar, so this was a little bothersome to me.  Having the numbers in red also didn't help the case.  That aside, the scale is easy to operate, a breeze to clean, and works very accurately.  The scale works silently, has a good surface area to weigh items, and is attractive looking.  Overall, this is a great scale to have to weigh your smaller items.FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

"Head and Shoulders Refresh Dandruff Shampoo not only will make your hair feel very clean, but it also cleans very gently and should not irritate your skin or scalp. The shampoo did a fine job of getting my hair clean, but not so clean that it get tangly and ""squeaky"" feeling.  My son who occasionally gets dandruff flaking about had the best result from using this shampoo - the flakes were reduced dramatically.  There was a little tingling when using this shampoo, but not as much as using a shampoo with something like tea tree oil in it.  The scent is pleasant and not overbearing, and fades nicely as it dries.  The scent is not overly feminine nor masculine, and was well received by all who used it.

"I recently purchased the Chesapeake Bay Candle Blood Orange scent from my local bulls eye store.  Of all the many candles I've tried over the years, this is my favorite scent.  The blood orange scent is not too sweet, not too citrusy, and is just a very lovely calming scent.  This candle comes with two wicks to light, and once lit is very bright and emits the most wonderful scent.  The candle burns slowly and seems to last a good amount of time.I've seen this particular scent put in various types of containers and renamed for the corresponding container collection (Heritage Collection, The Collection, etc), however I've found the scent hasn't changed despite the various collection names.

"My husband recently received the Lumio Book Lamp as a gift, and I have to say that this is an absolutely beautiful lamp.  The cover is one continuous piece of wood that has been carefully cut on specific spots where the spine is, so the book can actually close seamlessly, and yet not be two separate pieces with hinges or glue to keep it together.  The pages are accordion folded ""Tyvek"" - apparently that's a waterproof and 100% recycled material.  The LED lights are inside the pages so that you can't see the light directly and all the wires and such are housed internally - when the book is open, it really looks just like an open book with all the pages flared out.The light is charged via USB on the cover edge of the book.  When you open the book, even just a crack, the light will turn on.  The light is exceptionally bright and is bright enough where you could read easily with it on.  There are magnets in the book cover and book comes with several attachments you can use to hold it open.  The magnets in the book serve several functions.  First, it helps keep the book shut when not in use, can be used to hold the book open in a cylinder shape, and can be used in conjunction with a small magnetic ""wheel"" set.  This wheel allows you to hang the book on the wall like a sconce, or can be used with the included leather strap to hang the book from a ceiling - this is surprisingly a very versatile lamp!  It has a nice weighted feel to it, and is very durable.  We've opened and closed the lamp many times without wearing out the pages at all.Overall, this is a very beautiful book lamp.

"It was right during the time I was just getting into Level 42 that a series of four twofer import CD's came out-all representing their 80's album output. This was the ideal way to really dive into their music in it's original format. Especially as each one presented a series of demos,unreleased numbers and special mixes that enhanced the original content. These two albums from the end of the decade represented music from the band which I'd never even heard of up to this point. And was the most difficult volume to find,and turned out to be the last one I picked up as a result. Still it perhaps represents the most significant musical culmination of their career so far.  The first album is 1987's Running In The Family. My two favorite numbers on it are the throbbing,melodically probing dance/funk of ""Lessons In Love"",the apparent big radio hit here and the title song-a synth and lead guitar fueled example of thick,uptempo rock 'n soul. ""Children Say"" features layers of harmonically complex keyboards and similarly rhythmic drums while ""It's Over"" and ""Two Solitudes"" are both more musically atmospheric art pop style ballads. ""To Be With You Again"" and ""Fashion Fever"" are both frenetic uptempo synth funk while the slow crawling reggae tinged groove of ""The Sleepwalkers"" and the shuffling funk/pop groove of ""Freedom Someday"" conclude this particular album.  1988's Staring At The Sun is a whole different animal from it's predecessor. With new drummer Gary Husband and guitarist Steve Topping? we have the driving fast uptempo dance rocker ""Heaven In My Hand""-with it's staccato clavinet and lead guitar providing a sea of rhythmic interplay that extends into ""I Don't Know Why"". ""Take A Look"" meanwhile is a Caribbean inflected mid tempo number while ""Over There"" embraces a progressive,complex electro jazz/fusion drum solo with a dynamic melody. ""Silence"" and ""Man"" are both rhythmically and melodically heady numbers in a similar genre while the shuffling groove of ""Tracie"",the cinematically heady title song,the AOR pop sound of ""Two Hearts Collide"" and the hugely dynamic live band interplay of ""Gresham Blues"" conclude the album.  These two albums both extend from the other in terms of a band coping with two vital factors. First off was the massive commercial breakthrough of their 1985 release World Machine. This informed the first of these albums in the sense that the music really began to reflect the bands funk,soul and pop craftsmanship more than instrumental soloing. By the time of that albums follow up? The Gould brothers had departed the band. And they began really upping the ante in terms of flexing the harder,more guitar oriented jazz/rock strains of their sound-finding a new way to expand on their classic early to mid 80's sound. It would essentially go from here in their sound after these albums musically. So these represent Level 42 at a very important musical crossroads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R373J3EOKJVC2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004WGYL#wasThisHelpful","R373J3EOKJVC2D","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At this point? It really doesn't matter that Wynton Marsalis has been the head of Jazz At Lincoln Center and all his accompanying prestige-and occasional controversy within the musicians community. What is important is that he and his very musical family sprung from the same soil as his respective musical genre. So he's had a close up view as it progressed for his own generation. In 1991 Wynton bought together a sextet-including such musical luminaries as pianist Marcus Roberts and drummer Jeff ""Tain"" Watts for a series of fairly elongated songs that celebrated his core creative roots.  ""Harriet Tubman"" begins the album with a moody swing that has a lot of conversational sax and trumpet melodic interaction going on about it. ""Elveen"" takes the same mood down a notch in tempo while the title track takes the tempo and overall atmosphere up in mood a notch.  ""So This Is Jazz,Huh?"" and ""L.C. On The Cut"" are both slower bluesy numbers with prominent drum solos. This is a very good musical idea-basically a mixture of soulful hard bop dissonances mixed with a chunkier flavor as well. Harmonically it probes but doesn't seem to come to any musical resolutions. In as much as that seems to be the story of black America so far? This album is as telling on what it symbolizes as any jazz has ever been.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HZRH3W786IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000027SQ#wasThisHelpful","R37HZRH3W786IX","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first began exploring (and eventually reviewing) the albums of the Grateful Dead? Ended up starting with their 70's and 80's albums. And for the most part don't feel that was a bad choice because they made some of their most broad stylistic strides during that time period. But these kings of the San Francisco psychedelic music scene made this debut recording in the summer of love. Have been perhaps more excited to listen to and review this album than anything else they've ever made. Just the idea of this band first getting it's feet wet in the recording studio after already being such established live icons already. And what a journey it is!  ""The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion)"" begins with an electric piano led mix of driving,melodic power blues rock that continues on ""Cold Rain And Snow"" as well as the more surf oriented ""Beat It On Down The Line""-while ""Good Mornin' Little School Girl"" and the extended ""Viola Lee Blues"" really work the 12 bar electric sound into the technicolor stratosphere. ""Sitting On Top Of The World"" is a fast paced country/western oriented number while ""Morning Dew"",""New New Minglewood Blues"",""Alice D.Millionare"",""Overseas Stomp"" and ""Death Have No Mercy"" are all thick,grooving pop rockers. """"Tastebud"" and especially a 22 minute live take on ""Viola Lee Blues"" really kick out some of their trademark jams.  One thing that this album really showcases is Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia's ability to mix strong melodic craft with extended instrumental looseness. Playing even on the short songs with a strong sense of collective improvisation? The Grateful Dead come off here as rock players who think like jazz ones. All trying to have a musical conversation with the intent of working everything out-rather than just making a lot of loud and noisy solos to show up the other members. It's probably that very quality that made the band mean so much to the psychedelic music scene. They were able to bring their music on record to the people without commercializing their own intent out of it. And that's the intent that made them the icons they are today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29G5PHYLD86RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007LTIG#wasThisHelpful","R29G5PHYLD86RY","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my core memories is of continually going to sleep as an older toddler whenever the title song of this album came on the radio. The song was not boring to me ever,but somehow soulfully comforting. In my early adulthood as I was exploring the funk/soul spectrum of music? It came to my attention that Spandau Ballet were major players on the UK post disco/dance/soul/new wave scene along with groups such as Incognito. They had many wonderful early albums especially to chose from. Of course this is the first of their's I ended up with-their big international breakthrough as I understand. And couldn't be more happier about it.  ""Pleasure"" begins the album a percussive,rhythm guitar led boogie groove with some light synthesized touches. ""Communication"" adds a sparkly Motown styled shuffle and falsetto choruses to the mix while ""Code Of Love"" is a stripped down number just bubbling under the surface as it builds. ""Gold"" goes up in tempo with an epic,danceable sense of drama whereas ""Lifeline"",""Heaven Is A Secret"" and ""Foundation"" find the melodic nature of the songs supporting the strong rhythmic interplay of the band. The title song concludes the album,a longer version than I've heard with it's popping guitar,yearning sax solo and mid tempo soulful romance.  Having understood their earlier albums to be looser in their overall approach? This 1983 release find the band very successfully adapting their sound to pop radio considerations. Their strong emphasis on percussive,chugging guitars and strong rhythmic elements in general have not disappeared in the least bit here. But the songs are generally shorter,and the focus is more on crafting choruses and refrains than solely building on a good groove. As the particular music scene Spandau were involved in developed? Most of their contemporaries faced similar musical considerations. But albums like this really helped to show that it could all work very well if done well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6T8NMEU21WMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIPIKLY#wasThisHelpful","R6T8NMEU21WMH","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somehow in these last two years? The topic and music of Fela Kuti has come up a great deal. Watched a wonderful documentary on the man,based on a biographical Broadway show. Plus he's been the topic of many conversations between myself and friend Henrique regarding strong Afrocentrism in music. Still this managed to be one of only three CD's by the man that I've picked up. And he has many more in and out of print as of this review. Somehow today on what would've been his birthday? It seemed right to listening to his music in celebration of the revived understanding of that Afrocentric creative approach he always encouraged.  The title song opens with a huge busy percussion sound-with the rhythm guitar chugging away at lightening speed while unison and solo horns all manage to make themselves noticed with great melodic clarity. ""Mister Follow Follow"" is set at a much slower tempo-with the horn charts and guitars playing  very succinct Arabic type tones. ""Observation Is No Crime"" has a slow,bluesy funk shuffle where Fela himself plays a wonderful sax solo as the cherry on the type. ""Mistake""-a live track recorded in Berlin the same year this album came out is another percussive horn based musical conversation pinned down by a strong bass line.  From beginning to end this album is wonderfully funky. And in the manner of James Brown,with whom Fela shared a complex and mutual admiration, he continually emphasized the rhythmic and harmonic power of the live band as one pulsing unit. Because I have personal difficulty listening through Fela's heavy Yoruba dialect? Some of the lyrics on this album don't come through that easily to my ears. But being able to pick up consistent references to ""black power""? The man's radical activism comes across without having to go into any great verbal detail about it. As a matter of fact? The best way to receive Fela's music is moving to it in some way. Really allows it's spirit to be received well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MIIF6HG7OY1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X43FVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1MIIF6HG7OY1I","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First time I ever heard of Fela ""Ransome"" Kuti was when he was referenced by Paul McCartney when he was recording with Wings in Lagos. It had to do with him feeling that Paul and his band were their to steal African music to to claim as their own. Over the years I've come to learn some about the complex socio-musical ethic that Fela had-going right along with his political awakening. This two albums,the latter of the two produced by Ginger Baker and were both recorded in 1975 after a trumped up drug conviction. This being the first album I purchased from the Africa 70? I was very excited by the prospect of what I was about to hear.  ""Expensive ***t"" is a is set to ringing,fast paced percussion,a light touch on the rhythm guitar and the main melody on the piano. ""Water Got No Enemy"" is a rhythmically full number-filled with thick melodic horn charts,as well as massive vocal leads and choruses. ""He Miss Road"" is an intensely funky number with the guitar and bass lines in heavy vocal interplay with the peppy organ getting in on the musical conversation. ""Monday Morning In Lagos"" has a very unusual time signature (to me anyway) with big horn accents and equally off kilter organ while the whole thing ends with the 17 minute plus poly rhythmic explosion of ""It's No Possible""-with it's spacey organ based melody.  In my long history with music? I've only really ever listened to African music/Afropop in a rather peripheral way. And even then generally as an element in funk,soul and rock music. Something about Fela's sound is extremely appealing to me as a huge funk fan. When playing it in the car with my other driving? I wondered how she'd receive it. Her reaction to the first song was a strong identification-actually wishing to choreograph a dance of her own to it. Since the Africa 70's music was intent on projecting the Afrocentrism of rhythm and movement as a key aspect of life and the aural tradition? Well this album will very likely make a similar impression on almost anyone who hears it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJIKYU2HZX8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E1QCWC#wasThisHelpful","RZJIKYU2HZX8P","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was through yet another session of grate digging that I first came across this album-on vinyl of course. It came to me seeing the title that it had been slighted as one of the bands lesser albums-snidely using the reference point of it's 1983 release date as a main reason for it's lack of quality. This presentation of it having actually encouraged me to pick up that vinyl. Even though doing something just to be a contrarian isn't the best way to go generally? This was so much of a pleasant surprise? Actually ended up getting a CD copy of it that I could listen to on the go. And after several listens? Still glad I made that leap of musical faith to pick this up to start with.  ""Blue World"" is a mid tempo,bluesy dance number with some bubbling synth and live percussion mixed with some clever internal rhyme in the lyrics. ""Meet Me Halfway"" takes the tempo up a notch-maintaining the same flavor with a bigger guitar solo as does the even faster ""Sitting At The Wheel"" right after it. ""Going Nowhere"",""Under My Feet"",""Under My Feet"" and ""Running Water"" are again more acoustically tinged ballads while ""It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart"" has a somewhat electronic country rock flavor. The marching instrumental ""Hole In The World"" and the requisite spoke word lyrical poetry of ""I Am"" provide the operatic element of the album musically.  This is actually one of the Moody Blue's strongest albums of the 1980's far as I'm personally concerned. Pretty subjective I know. That viewpoint comes from the facts that this album basically integrates the synthesizer approach of some of the previous album totally into the bands sound. And also allows the presence of more rhythmic uptempo tunes. The dance/rock power of the music is still full of their trademark symphonic sound. And this progression from one particular element of their new sound allowed for this to be an excellent follow up that,while perhaps not succeeding commercially,lived up to it's creative intent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SESF4OVWJ3RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HMEU7O#wasThisHelpful","R2SESF4OVWJ3RX","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up I was pretty aware of the long musical history of the Moody Blues,while all the same having heard precious little of it. Later on? It became clear that this was a 60's psychedelic era group that had a fairly long hiatus from the early to late 70's before making a comeback later in the decade. Still it wasn't until this one from several years after that where my first entry point into their music came from. And even longer before I went deeper and discovered the album-rather than the song I first heard from it. Tonight is actually the second time I've given the album a thorough listen all the way through. And as much as I enjoyed it the first time? Hearing it again did enhance my views.  ""The Voice"" begins the album with a pumping melody built on acoustic/electric guitar interplay-along with synthesized orchestration. ""Talking Out Of Turn"" has a more percussive  mid tempo soul/folk flavor with very grand strings and bleeping synth bass. That latter instrumental quality is the defining element of ""Gemini Dream"",an strong new wave production update of the bands melodic sound that represents the first music I ever heard from them. ""In My World"" and ""Nervous"" are both pretty acoustic ballads-with ""Meanwhile"" being an uptempo shuffling variant of that approach. ""In My World"",""22,000 Days"",""Painted Smile"" and ""Veteran Cosmic Rocker"" are all super singable progressive pop swells.  From the first song to the tenth? This really is a wonderful album. The craftsmanship of these songs is every bit as wonderful as the symphonic/baroque pop-rock the band pioneered in the late 60's and early 70's. There's also a great juxtaposition of orchestral elements as well. Some of the songs actually use real strings and horns for this purpose-while former Yes member Patrick Moraz essentially replaces the bands trademark Melletron with a variety of differently pitched synthesizers. For a band that pioneered much of the symphonic rock movement that is especially big in the 2010's? This album was high quality as well as being forward thinking as to how their music was now being presented.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VRKEMX86DBJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001F5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2VRKEMX86DBJ7","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my understanding? Hall & Oates 1977 album Beauty On A Back Street didn't do much to please the music listening public or either member of the duo themselves. The pair had the melodic pop smarts,the strong instrumental ability and lots of soul to boot. It just needed a tad bit more of a push to bring it up and keep it out more. This is an album that I always had a huge interest in by them-even when my first copy on vinyl skipped too much to enjoy. And it was a worthwhile effort to pick this up on CD because the pairs introductory record with the production of David Foster really showcases them getting their musical ball rolling along very nicely.  ""It's A Laugh"",with it's slogging echoed rhythms,sax intro and falsetto harmony choruses basically opens the door fully to the sound most people know from their 80's classics. ""Melody For A Memory"" and ""Have I Been Away Too Long"" have foreboding,marching rhythms with a thick late night arena rock ballad flavor. ""The Last Time"" has a full on wall of sound wallop to it while ""I Don't Want To Lose You"" is a bouncy ""Motownphilly"" type soul pop number.  ""Alley Katz"" and ""Don't Blame It On Love"" are two riff heavy,punky styled street rockers that adds a sunny melody with the more surf flavored ""Pleasure Beach"". ""August Day"" is a beautifully harmonized ballad built around some beautifully processed piano.  It's really hard to describe this album in terms that are all that simplistic. But if I could it would be as one which was half soulful pop and half heavy guitar rockers. And say that loosely because both elements show up throughout all aspects of it.  Foster's production has a glittery,cinematic aspect about it that really works wonderfully with what Daryl and John do musically here. On every level? It basically does that rockier sound from the previous album in a way that functions better. That's because rock used more as an instrumental style here,where the primarily foundation is a jazzier soul and pop one. Definitely a key album in this iconic duos musical development.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LXP3N6G214R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AWV2FY#wasThisHelpful","R11LXP3N6G214R","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For quite a few years now? I saw this album and it's cute pun of a front jacket on both vinyl and CD every so often. Avoided it because,as with many recordings I've listened to? It was never represented as being among their strongest musical accomplishments. It was after all made after Daryl and John had been playing with each other in different bands and recording demos. So this was their 1972 debut on Atlantic,featuring the late and iconic Arif Mardin helping out with some production and arrangement. Found the vinyl crate digging earlier this, and decided it was time to give this album the chance I should have some time ago.  ""I'm Sorry"", ""Fall In Philadelphia"" and the orchestrated closer ""Lily Are You Happy"" are bouncing mid-uptempo soul rockers-the former two with pronounced country and western  inflections . A similar flavor with the wheepy pedal steel guitar shows up on the more acoustically inclined ""All Our Love"",""Goodnight And Goodmorning"" and ""Southeast City Window"". The ballads are actually separated into two different types. ""Georgie"" and ""Waterwheel"" are of the stark,piano based variety while ""They Needed Eachother"" and ""Thank You For"" are both primarily acoustic guitar based ones with some electric piano accents to top off on.  Have to agree with what I first heard about it. This is very much a duo finding their sound. In the early 70's groups such as The Eagles,America and C,S&N were all basically throwing off different viewpoints on the country rock/singer-songwriter vibe. And this album certainly seems to be mining hard in that musical quarry. Perhaps it was bucking for a hit,maybe it wasn't. And Daryl and John both due a lot of close vocal harmonies and trade off more than the shared leads they are more known for. Still on many of the songs,their elaborate and soul oriented melodies shine through strongly. And it's not too bad a place to go to discover their beginning together after dealing with their more iconic music to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96RWRC5J06YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RU0UBU2#wasThisHelpful","R96RWRC5J06YN","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whenever I am in a record store and looking at the Thelonious Monk CD's an vinyl they have? It becomes clear how right the liner notes on the back of this album really are. 1957 truly was the year the man broke out as an artist. Especially when we're talking about recording full length album statements in the studio. He had two iconic albums during this year that are a staple of my father's record collection and he played for me on and off. This was actually the first album I ever had by him-purchased it about twelve years ago this year. Listened to it several times and,in the context of what I've heard from him since? It suddenly reveals a lot more of itself to my ears.  This solo piano record finds Monk harmonizing with his own distinctive style of melody on many original numbers and standards long associated with him such as ""April In Paris"" and ""Monk's Mood"". Some of the long form numbers such as ""Functional"" showcase much of his style of playing as much as his instrumental technique. One of my favorite parts here is a 21 minute recording session-complete with several different takes of ""Round Midnight""-really showing how he developed this as a solo piano number. This is an odd place to start for this artist,I'll have to admit. But in a way? It's perfect because it gives you the feel of hearing the man playing and growing musically right before your ears. So it's probably one of his most telling albums.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26884P0BUJYTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000YEF#wasThisHelpful","R26884P0BUJYTC","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I very easily take it for granted that the album length format in music was not yet half a century old before I came into the world. It probably has a lot to do with why I've generally steered away from compilations over the years. Yet it would seem in the case of Thelonious Sphere Monk. In the late 1940's while be-bop was still very much a live,musician's musicians based music? It was individual sides that were still driving recorded music. So these autumn 1947 sessions necessitated a set of this sort. Still when organized in this way? These tunes do tell a very full length type of musical story.  ""Humph"" opens the album with a fast paced sax solo oriented number with Monk's piano building up harmony just behind the main rhythms. There are many alternate takes here. ""Evonce"" presents two versions-the former a lot instrumentally fuller than the later while ""Suburban Eyes"" only changes the arrangement a bit. ""Thelonious"" has an airier atmosphere with it's brush style drumming while ""Off Minor"" deals with a distinctively chorded mid tempo blues. ""Well You Needn't"",""April In Paris"" and ""Introspection"" take a similar rhythmic vibe and focus right in the melody of the piano. ""In Walked Bud"" is a very lyrical,horn conversation based number that swings and bounces along wonderfully.  A fast take on Gershwin's ""Nice Work If You Can Get It"" and the ballads ""Ruby My Dear"" and signature pieces ""Monks Mood"" and ""Round Midnight"" round out the compositions here. After talking more to people such as my father and friend Henrique about this man's playing style? Monk has a fantastic and nimble technical ability that he is presenting idiosyncratically. That really comes out in this collection. By presenting two takes of almost every song here? It really gives you an insight into the jazz icon's creative process as you'll here him,Art Blakey and every other musician on here developing ever more complete versions as they go. An excellent place to understand....well what made Monk the kind of musician he was.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FH8KETUDU354/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005MIZ4#wasThisHelpful","R3FH8KETUDU354","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cannot tell you how many times I've located vinyl copies of this album crate digging in the discount bins over the years. Not being all that familiar with her recorded catalog? It was a record I continually avoided picking up. That is until earlier this year. Of course this was the third in what turned out to be a quintet of ever evolving albums that Nona Hendryx released in the 1980's. For this particular occasion? She came out with hard dance music pioneer Arthur Baker and Chic's bassist Bernard Edwards as two producers for this 1985 set. In this era of huge commercial blockbuster albums? Nona ended up doing so in the more creative end of the spectrum.  ""Revolutionary Dance"" is a rhythmically full,uptempo electro funk jam where each chorus is punctuated by melodically  horn charts. ""A Girl Like That"" is a pounding synth based dance rocker while the first part of the title track follows right in line with it musically-the second part later in the album being a more polyrhythmic funk oriented workout for a double sided attitude of the same musical coin. ""I Need Love"" is more of a mid tempo arena rocker along with the similar if somewhat more groovecentric ""If Looks Could Kill (D.O.A)"". ""Rock This House"" is a Stonsey rocker,appropriately featuring the lead guitar of Keith Richards while while the sleek and bright dance rocker of ""Time"" concludes the album.  In a lot of ways? This album embraces the dance/funk/rock hybrids that were becoming common with black female artists after the huge success of Tina Turner during this period. What this particular album possessed was an extremely strong rhythmic power as well as Nona's knockout musical personality. Basically everything amounts to the most Afrocentric and funky end of the freestyle dance movement that was becoming a major player in the mid to late 80's. Also this album helped to emphasize many elements of the upcoming ""black rock"" movement that was already beginning to gain some heat. So this album got it's musical juices flowing at warp speed from the get-go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33R06FXO1E045/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXCJOM4#wasThisHelpful","R33R06FXO1E045","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Throughout my adolescence? I continually heard the name of Nona Hendryx dropped in reference to being one of the most important and unsung female artists of the early 80's. It wasn't until sometime later did her history get present in the important context of groups-from her time as part of Labelle in the mid 70's to her membership in the expanded Talking Heads half a decade later. Managed to locate this album on vinyl a year or so again-with the CD reissue in and out of print faster than I could grab it. Produced by Bill Laswell and his band Material? This represents an important milestone in Nona's recorded career.  ""I Sweat (Going Through The Motions)"" mixes a brittle new wave dance beat with warm,round synthesizers and gospel/soul choral vocals. ""Soft Targets"" mixes live drums with various percussion effects and a bubbling,liquid bass and/or melodic rhythm guitar line. And this feeling continues on the life with call and response vocal exchanges and a deeply chugging guitar. That flavor extends into the more strident and rocking ""To The Bone"" while ""Electricity"" slows the same attitude down in tempo with a hard electro rock vibe. ""Ghost Love"" evokes a melodic digital dub type vibe with spacey backup vocals while ""I Want You"" closes with a strident post disco styled number.  One of the first things I really appreciate about this album is how instrumentally juxtaposed it is. The combination of synthesizers and drum machines with their live equivalents creates a potent blend of analog and digital musical elements. As for Nona herself? She was one of the most powerful vocalists in the soul/funk community of her era-bringing her hard,throaty pipes with immense passion on every one of these songs. All of these songs are based in funk-emphasizing country rhythms/percussive effects very heavily with a generally stripped down air about it all. In many ways? It's one of the best presented  and realized new wave funk styled albums of this particular year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R355LGWAGRW9OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FDNJCC#wasThisHelpful","R355LGWAGRW9OQ","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While researching the Commodores discography early on? This 1983 album was basically described as their very worse release. Looking back on it having heard the rest of their catalog? I can sort of understand why that might've been. The band were dealing with the departure of Lionel Richie. And following this album their bassist/second composer Thomas McClary would himself embark on a solo career. The witty back cover portrait showcases the band visually playing up common ""Friday the 13th"" type superstitions-playing up that many might consider this album unlucky and creatively cursed. Luckily? It's anything but,to me anyway.  ""I'm In Love"" opens the album with a new wave/West Coast style uptempo groove which continues with the almost Doobie Brothers like ""Turn Off The Lights""-both superb opening pieces. ""Nothing Like A Woman"" is a mid tempo funk groove built around strong electric and synth bass forming a superb,creamy foundation. ""Captured"" is a (then) contemporary country pop ballad while ""Touchdown"" has a strong electro/boogie funk air about it. ""Welcome Home"" merges the heavy funk while at the same time continuing the West Coast vibe as ""Ooo,Woman You"" is a tough,guitar oriented rocker. The piano based quiet storm soul ballad of ""Only You"" concludes the album.  To tell the truth? This album is about as far away from the type of funk the Commodores were doing a decade or so prior to this as the human being is biologically to...the amoeba. Of course there'd already been a strong evolution in their sound since then as well. A good deal of this album is in fact more uptempo based than anything the latter day Richie era ones had been. Walter Orange and newcomer Harold Hudson trade off lead vocals here as well. Newer elements such as the already funk/soul based WC pop sound,the rockier sides of new wave and the electro sound are strong elements of this as well. So it's actually an excellent transitional album from one era of there's to another.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EB98GYAI8VY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DM33BQ#wasThisHelpful","R2EB98GYAI8VY3","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was when I first started getting interested in the funk genre that I discovered the enormous contributions the Commodores made to it's salad days. Often referred to as Motown's kings of ""Southern Funk""? They had a spectacular mid 70's period in that regard. Their first two albums were pretty much undisputed classics of the genre. By the end of 1975? The band were still very much in that framework,but were on the verge of a gradual change of direction that would bring them big commercial success,but divide some of their audience in time. The important thing about this album is just how much it established them as a strong instrumental powerhouse.  ""Hold On"",the shuffling ""Free"",""Mary Mary"",""(Can I) Get A Witness"" and ""Gimme My Mule"" are all squarely in the chunky bass/ guitar/Clavinet heavy uptempo funk that the band had already made their trademark sound at this particular point. ""Sweet Love"" is an interesting ballad as it bridges the soul oriented style of their earlier slow songs with the more pop flavored ones of their later years-this one with a jazzier twist about it. ""Time"" is a very melodic uptempo groove that has more of a Caribbean soul flavor with it's high pitched synthesizers trade offs leading the way. ""Cebu"" ends the album with a spacey,reverbed psychedelic type funk instruments with a great reverbed bass line.  Some years ago? I managed to pick up a cassette reissue of this album. And fast fell in love with it. That is,until it started to ware down with age. Even though it was recently issued on CD? Ended up picking up the original vinyl at a flea market recently,and must say the type of direct ""united funk"" the Commodores are throwing down here comes across beautifully in it's original format.  As it stands musically? This album is a superb companion piece to their first two albums. And also stands with what I consider to be a vital quartet of heavily funkified albums they put out between 1974 and 1976.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41REHFGM0CP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZVNS9E#wasThisHelpful","R41REHFGM0CP1","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A decade and a half ago when I first moved in with my family where I am today? Was at a local salvage store where they had cassette tapes they were trying to unload. One of them was this 1983 album by the Temptations,of which I recognized the cover from a few years of crate digging. Much to my surprise? It became a favorite of mine during the early 2000's when I was still playing cassettes a lot. For years? There was not a sign of a CD issue for it. Until a European company,apparently famous for mastering from high quality vinyl finally put it back out earlier this year. Didn't even think-just ordered the copy and am happy to be able to review it after years of listening.  The title song opens the album-a brittle drum machine and synth bass led funk rocker that actually has a strong period Rolling Stones flavor in some of it's riffs-one of my favorite 80's songs by the Tempts actually. ""Love On My Mind"" is a post disco update of the classic style four part harmony mid tempo ballad they were so famous for while ""One Man Woman"" has a sleek Gap Band type groove about it. ""Show Me Your Love"" is an urban contemporary ballads while ""The Seeker"",""Bring Your Body Here (Exercise Chant)"" and the closing ""Made In America"" are all creamy boogie funk numbers. ""What A Why To Put It"" meanwhile is an intense,bass heavy groove ballad.  One of the chief complaints I've heard about this album over the years was that the producer Dennis Lambert was obsessed with the lead singer Dennis Edwards,and essentially turned this into a solo album for him. From where I'm siting? This album is actually no different than any other Temptations record recorded from the 70's onward: the focus is more on one lead voice and the harmonies of it's members. Another thing it really brings out is how successful it brings the group into the new wave/electro/boogie era-with hefty funk grooves and dance rockers being the order of the day on this album. Even though it doesn't get much notoriety? I highly recommend Temptations admirers give this a listen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18B2KRDLH4HZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQ3Y19S#wasThisHelpful","R18B2KRDLH4HZ0","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In terms of music and the groups own lineup? The Temptations have always been defined by peaks and valleys. This was particularly prominent in the 70's-when members and hit songs were coming and going so fast it was hard to tell what was happening. Even with such a chaotic period? The Tempts were always able to carry on with incredibly high creative standards. For this very early 1975 release? Producers Jeffrey Bowen and James Anthony Carmichael bought in both The Commodores and P-Funk's Eddie Hazel And Billy Bass Nelson to really thicken up the stew of the by this point already iconic Motown group's evolving sound.  ""Happy People"" starts out the album with intensely powerful dance funk-powered by round bass synthesizers and chugging rhythm guitars. ""Glasshouse"" has a similar element though with a straighter gospel/soul dance approach led by some stomping piano.  ""Shaky Ground"" really allowed for a major united funk era hit for them-with it's tough,slippery bass line,horn accents and slow crawling rhythms. ""The Prophet"" and ""I'm A Bachelor"" are both sumptuously orchestrated cinematic funk-the former dealing with the more positive aspects of Christian philosophy. Of the ballads the title song and the closing ""Firefly"" find their beauty in subtlety while ""Memories"" deals with grander arrangements.  Have to really agree with everything I've ever read and heard about this album. It really was their finest album length moments of the mid 70's. Even though many of the members might not have themselves agreed with this? But by sticking primarily to uptempo funk based songs,this album really allowed for each of it's members vocal ranges to cross paths in so many rhythmically and melodically powerful ways. Now before I picked up this CD? Already had three of it's songs on their big box set. Even so? Anyone whose heard the hits from this should still seek this album out as a whole because it's only that really matters in a very funky sort of way!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPOMV6BNM5LH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DBYF#wasThisHelpful","RNPOMV6BNM5LH","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forty five years ago today? Janis Joplin sadly joined the 27 club. At the time it was probably tragic-especially with also losing Jimi Hendrix the same year. Looking back on it from today? Well every raspy blues oriented female rock singer whose come along has basically siphoned Janis's own vocal cross marriage of Bessie Smith,Etta James and Tina Turner. This album was so iconic that when I first of it? Never actually occurred to me that it was a totally posthumous release. Happily it seemed that a lot of great musicians,producers and engineers got this together so well? Turns out she didn't quite make it to reap the success of what turned out to likely be her definitive album.  ""Move Over"" opens the album with a pounding,uptempo mixture of rock 'n soul with a melody straight out from the most gut bucket of 12 bar blues. ""Cry Baby"" is probably one of the most musically and vocally theatrical ballads she ever made while  ""My Baby"",""Trust Me"",""Get It While You Can"" and more so ""A Woman Left Lonely"" tone down the same musical impulse- with more soulful organ on the latter. ""Half Moon"" is driving,percussive guitar and piano funk/rock while whereas ""Buried Alive With The Blues"" really brings the busy uptempo psychedelic soul right back home ""Me And Bobby McGee"" throws down a country soul classic from Kris Kristofferson. ""Mercedes Benz"" is a particually acapella melody that rounds out the original album.  For bonuses we get live,fast and furious takes on Etta James' ""Tell Mama"",""Try Just A Little Bit Harder"" along with ""Cry Baby"" and ""Little Girl Blue"" just bringing down the house with it's eternal choruses. All that included? This really is an amazing album. One of the best parts of it is,while her screaming intensity is what made her as a singer? Janis Joplin sings a good deal of this music pretty dead straight for the type of artist she was. That's matched with material that is far fuller realized in the soul/rock/country vein than anything she'd ever done in the psychedelic era. While it was an end as opposed to the new beginning it was meant to be? I can see how inspirational this album could be in all this time for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MIPBSNYZABL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000K2VZ#wasThisHelpful","R3MIPBSNYZABL8","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I very first heard Janis Joplin singing on a clip from the Ed Sullivan Show? She came at me within the context of a soul/blues shouter right out of the box. Since then? I heard her music discussed in more of a rock context as the lead singer of Big Brother & The Holding Company. First time I heard of this album,her final release of the 60's? It was described in a music review book as being a messy soul album. It was the second of those three words that instantly caught my attention. It wasn't until several years after that I finally got a chance to hear it on this CD (well another copy of someone else at the time) to form my own opinion about it.  With it's mid-tempo percussive groove and countrified rhythm guitar,""Try (Just A Little Bit Harder)"" brings the slick yet stomping Southern funkiness into the mix right away. ""Maybe"" is in a similar vein-only in a ballad mode with climactic choruses and hot horn charts that reveals itself yet again on a version of Nina Simone's ""Little Girl Blue"",""Work Me Lord"" and the somewhat rockier title song. ""One Good Man"" and ""To Love Somebody"" are both pretty straight up power blues workouts. ""As Good As You've Been To The World"" is a uptempo gospel/soul raveup whereas the bonus track ""Dear Landlord"" adds more blues to that same framework.  Two live versions-first a Woodstock version of ""Summertime"" and another version of ""Piece Of My Heart"" with an improvised spoken intro complete this set. Because of Joplin's ability to cross between a scaling interpreter to craggy throated squaker at a moments notice? The only thing I could personally wish from the original album is more uptempo tunes because the ones that are hear are...frankly pretty incomparable in her catalog. The ballads are all excellent of course. Basically it all comes out sounding like a Stax production with the Kozmic Blues Band's much more raggedy rhythm section playing along with her. It's combines rawness and sweetness with a heavy dose of funk. And is very likable to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTITDDU04NB1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012GMW5M#wasThisHelpful","RTITDDU04NB1D","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been seven years since Michael Jackson passed away. During those years? His youngest and (by the end closest) sibling Janet has been totally silent in terms of new studio material. Being a longtime Jackson family admirer? It did all seem to me like an ending. Wasn't hearing a peep out of anyone in the family. My own observations of her post 1990's music is similar to my friend Henriques. They all had excellent music. But sometimes contemporary ideas from newer producers just gave her a lot of blander material. The most exciting thing about this album isn't actually the happy comeback-that's second. First off is her reuniting fully with Jam & Lewis. And I would think that sent her off and running for this one!  ""Unbreakable"" begins the album with a sample heavy mid tempo new funk style while Missy Elliot,also returning herself for this album,brings her classic Afrocentric EDM style uptempo sound into the mix. ""Dammn Baby"" a bassy electro funk jam while ""The Great Forever"" brings in a brittle shuffle into the mix. ""Shoulda Known Better"" is a contemporary orchestral pop number whereas ""After The Fall"" is a more ambient ballad. ""Broken Hearts Heal"" is a stripped down post disco/boogie style number whereas ""Night"" embraces the chill house style-with a full on Minneapolis style synth horn funk breakdown on the finale. ""No Sleep"" is a sticky,mid tempo steppin groove with rapper J.Cole.  ""Dream Maker/Europhia"" is a more electro/hip-hop styled number while ""2-B Loved"" deals with a melodically/rhythmically thick twin city funk yet again whereas ""Take Me Away"" has a folk/rock/drum n bass hybrid. ""Promise"" is a sweet and slow Brazilian bossa while ""Lessons Learned"" and ""Well Traveled"" both have more pronounced modern country flavors. ""Black Eagle"" raises in tempo with it's jingling,light percussive sound reflects the pleas for love and peace in the lyrics. ""Gon' Be Alright"" is a fantastic way to end the album-with a thick and live rock 'n soul styled uptempo jam out of the late 60's Sly & The Family Stone school-complete with lead and bass vocal trade offs.  One of the qualities I've enjoyed of Janet's vocals in the last decade or so is how she's dropped into her lower range. It has actually grown to expand on her tonal vocabulary as well as the general power of her voice. With only a few nods to sounding at all modern in the pop sense? This album finds the artist in just the right place to realize who she is,and what her sound is. Since the 80's synth/electro/boogie funk sound has become a staple of modern grooves again? The sound Janet and her producers coined almost 30 years ago is finally being realized for it's vitality. In many ways? This is possibly Janet's strongest album since the turn of the millennium. And for me anyway,a very welcomed comeback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2CWODT02G63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DL1AVO#wasThisHelpful","R1E2CWODT02G63","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always personally felt that Joe Jackson was excellent at exercising his ability to create music rather uniquely. Of course being that he's recorded and toured fairly consistently since the beginning of his career? There's no way that I could explore every single album and musical period  of his. And that counts his salad days in the 1980's as well. After his wonderful tribute to Duke Ellington last time out? Seems that Jackson recorded his latest studio set across four different locations: New York,Amsterdam,Berlin And New Orleans. Not to mention bringing in local musicians,most unknown to me for the sessions-including Bill Frissell and Regina Carter. So this is all set to draw his listeners right in from the get go.  The album begins with the NYC sessions-starting with the classic jazzy pop piano ballad title song that extends very nicely into the more uptempo and upbeat ""If It Wasn't For You"". ""See No Evil"",one of two covers,has a dense modern rock flavor while ""King Of The City"" has a lightly percussive electric piano driven sound. The horn and violin pop/rock of ""A Little Smile"",the modern classical opera approach of ""Far Away"",the slow jazz bossa of ""So Far Away"" and the almost African high life/British pop hybrid of ""Poor Thing"" round out the Amsterdam sessions. The glam rock of ""Junkie Diva"",the hard prog of ""If I Could See Your Face"",the more ambient ""Blue Time"" and the albums next cover in 1938's Cabaret styled ""Good Bye Jonny"" round out the Berlin sessions.  The shuffling pub power blues of ""Neon Rain"",the Caribbean jazz-pop styled ""Satellite"",the lightly funky ""Keep On Dreaming"" and the West Indies percussion styled ""Ode To Joy"" close out the album's part made in the Crescent City. While I always like the idea of recording an album in different locations? Jackson not only selected already very musical cities to record in,but it goes with the lyrical themes. These songs basically express the yearnings,uncertainties and self observations of an artist whose done and seen much-and seems to feel much regret in the end. The majority of the lyrics are rather depressing as a result. It's why I personally deducted one star off the review. But being a Joe Jackson album? It's filled with his signature sound and loads of celebrating musical diversity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20J21VBR9PWON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130J9PY4#wasThisHelpful","R20J21VBR9PWON","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Technically speaking? I've already given a partial review to this album as part of an older CD twofer with it's own followup. What I didn't know until later was that as with many double record collections of that sort? Tracks were omitted in order to fit them both on one CD. And this had the fullest of the missing songs-the other being a reprise from the next one. About a year ago? I located the complete album on the original gatefold vinyl. Especially now with the sad passing of founding Crusader Wilton Felder? I wanted to actually give this entire album it's own separate review. Every album this group ever did deserves at least that from it's listeners from where I sit anyway.  The album opens with ""Soul Shadows""-one of those songs that feels as if I've listened to it for years with it's slow Caribbean jazz shuffle ,bluesy rhythm guitar/bass and always wonderful lead vocals from Bill Withers. ""Honky Tonk Struttin'"" is squonking sax based funk delight-set even more on fire by the clanking percussion of Sheila E. ""Elegant Evening"" and the title song are both excellent examples of the liquid slow ballad flow that the Crusaders do so consistently well. ""Last Call"" is a very melodic mid-tempo,lightly Brazilian inflected jazzy pop number again led by sax. ""Sweet Gentle Love"" is that missing track-a gentle acoustically textured ballad with a strong bluesy flavor.  Recently my friend Henrique was explaining to me the advantages of bands like The Crusaders having three composers in the band. Each of them could switch off so,if one was lacking in inspiration another could chime in with one of their songs. Again it's that iconic sense of musical chemistry that really makes this album work. By the time 1980 here rolled around? Each of these three members and coalesced into that ""fine wine"" type of creative aesthetic where they all new how to make their sound work every time. There's great music here for cruising,late night romance and funky stuff for getting down. It's one of their classics and superb way to begin the 1980's for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4IEZEVV8AQAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W2GBHQ#wasThisHelpful","R4IEZEVV8AQAJ","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would be difficult for me how many times I'd heard the name of Phil Woods name dropped by various jazz lovers over the years. When the news reached me a couple days ago that he'd passed away? The name was interestingly more recognizable to me than the music-of which I'd actually heard none. My friend Henrique and I have been having a lot of talks about the importance of celebrating iconic musicians while they are still alive. Sadly that's a chance I never had with Mister Woods here. But while people die? Their different arts of course create a sort of immortality for them. It was my father who took this out of his collection and recommended I hear it. It was time worth spent.  The first side of the album includes two extended pieces in ""Chromatic Banana"" and ""Ultimate Choice"". These are both very rhythmically and melodically abstract numbers. Some of the instrumentation veers off into off kilter,almost raggedy harmonic solos now and then. ""The Last Page Sans Melodie"" is my favorite here as it structurally veers from hyper-melodic saxophone with an funky electric piano twist into a swinging be-bop rhythm. After the percussive,flute led Afro-Brazilian romp of ""A Look Back"" the album concludes with ""The Day When The World"" is another  great example of improvised jazz/funk with a strong melodic phrase.  Nothing on this album lacks vigor and excitement. And as many people have already written? Woods' instrumental resemblance to Charlie Parker is very prominent-especially his abstract improvising on the chords of the song. And on that level? That's the only thing that makes this album just a tad less than what it could be. With the wonderful Gordon Beck on keys,announced humorously by the bands children at the end of the album? It all really works better on the second side when the rhythm section is in clearer focus. The more avant garde musical touches on the first two songs won't hold every listeners attention very well. But still not a bad place for me to first hear this man's music at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PPWMC6IKMUEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054DC9LG#wasThisHelpful","R2PPWMC6IKMUEW","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About a couple decades ago? I was readying an illustrated record of Michael Jackson. It mentioned this album specifically,and his participation in it. Up until that time? I never thought of Johnny Mathis as someone still making music up through the mid 1980's. How wrong I was. The man had never stopped going from his beginning up to the point. Just the notoriety of the music itself seemed to vary. This came from a period that seemed pretty successful for the man. Over the years? Probably passed it by on vinyl a number of times. Finally located a cassette of it that was in excellent shape. And from then on was very excited to hear what it had to offer.  ""Simple"" beings the album with a piano,horn and vocal choir heavy R&B/jazz-pop shuffle groove while the creamily orchestrated ballad ""Love Won't Let Me Wait"" again pairs him with Deniece Williams. Similar musical ideas show up on ""Lead Me To Your Love"". ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" again has that bouncing rhythm guitar heavy jazzy pop uptempo sound. The melodically complex mid tempo duet with Angela Bofill on ""You're A Special Part Of Me"" is tempered by the thickly rhythmic funky pop of the MJ composed ""Love Never Felt So Good. ""Priceless"" and ""One Love"" are both climactic ballads with ""Right Here Right Now"" builds from slower refrains into stomping choruses.  Overall Johnny Mathis is in tremendous form here vocally? Musically,the album has a very strong Al Jarreau flavor. Which makes perfect sense since he has apparently cited Mathis as a huge influence on his singing style. Again having not followed the man's career before this consistently? It's interesting for me to here him singing songs with this particular type of production and in this particular sort of genre. But doing so is teaching me not only more about this artist. But also about how someone with as distinctive a style as him can keep the flow with what's going on the given time and still sound totally like himself. Superb album from a vocal icon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DGFPY82AE0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000008I7Q#wasThisHelpful","R19DGFPY82AE0B","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For as long as I can remember? I've always had the utmost respect and admiration for the musical career of Johnny Mathis. He's always proven himself professional,adaptable and extremely consistent with the ever changing nature of the popular song. Over the years? Seen this album during my many vinyl digging sessions at the local Goodwill. Since so many people wanted to get rid of it? Avoided picking it up for sometime. That is until one day I realized what could be so wrong with singular vocal talents like Johnny and Niecy together in the late 1970's?  It's a wonderful example of how sometimes a second guess can lead you in the right direction.  There are three big Motown numbers here-two of which that were famoud duets to begin with starting with a slightly faster version of ""You're All I Need To Get By"" and a heavily orchestrated ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"". Stevie Wonder's ""Until You Come Back To Me"" is given a strong,liquidy mid tempo groove with some chiming electric pianos. ""You're A Special Part Of My Life"",""I Just Can't Get Over You"",'Touching Me With Love"" and ""Me For You,You For Me"" are in a similar rhythmic and melodic vein-only with a more percussive flavor-perfect for Johnny's vocal approach. ""Ready Or Not"" is a bouncing disco friendly number with a pronounced Caribbean uptempo shuffle to it.  ""That's What Friends Are For"" has a similar upbeat tempo but more soulful air while a version of ""Just The Way You Are"" is pretty instrumentally faithful to the original. In terms of the album as a whole? These are an excellent mix of original and interpretations. Being that I listen to a lot of music? I haven't had the fortune to be able to explore the breadth and progression of Johnny Mathis's music over the years. But this album seems to find him squarely in the area of a soul/R&B crooner. Along with a lady whose understanding of that idiom,coming out of gospel is pretty renowned. It's an excellent pairing filled with quality material. Especially for those who enjoy Johnny's soul/pop period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NIC0VNBBK6NG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005IAIM#wasThisHelpful","R1NIC0VNBBK6NG","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's a wonderful example of how one particular discovery led directly into others. After my discovery of this artist? I ended up ordering this albums predecessor and picking up this then new release right along with it. Of course looking at it tonight? It really showcased how music continues to be the key thread connecting myself and Henrique  as friends. And what a great thing that is because a band he also introduced me to,the excellent jazz/funk quartet of Butcher Brown,are Mister Payton's accompanists on these dozen individually number-titled compositions. Honestly didn't know exactly what to expect. And very glad I just went right into this expecting quality,expressive musical talent.  ""Two"" beings the album with a drum/electric piano based groove that builds in intensity throughout while ""Three"",my favorite song on the album is a stripped down jazz/funk/pop with that great low,brittle rhythm guitar and classic urban early morning flavor I love. ""Four"" brings in a heavy wah wah,deep Rhodes and clavinet oriented sound to a more bubbly groove while ""Five"" goes for more of a straight ahead fusion/funk samba shuffle-which shows up without the Latin flavor on the slower tempo ""Eight"".""Six"" goes for the intense,James Brown sounding jazz/funk jam whereas ""Seven"" is another spare piece-this time built on a mid tempo ballad with subtle bass/guitar interaction. That continues on the slower paced ""Nine"" and ""Ten"" as well.  ""Eleven"" and ""Twelve"" both go more for the JB shuffle yet again whereas the delayed jazzy pop rhythm of ""Thirteen"" concludes the album. Odd thing I noticed with this album is that many online reviews seem to give it the same sort of flack the major writers/critics gave to Miles Davis and his many proteges when the jazz/funk fusion genre was first starting. In this case focusing more on Payton neglecting his horn. From what I'm hearing? This is an artist who is extremely functional both as a DIY type multi instrumentalist as well as a bandleader as he is here. Focusing on playing the Rhodes piano allows him to lay a superb rhythmic foundation for the very live sounding funk and jazz/rock fusion instrumentals that populate this album. So from where I sit? Nicholas Payton is really going to some fantastically funky places musically.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WHUR8RHUN5AW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPGITKG#wasThisHelpful","R2WHUR8RHUN5AW","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the things I've come to learn over the years is despite the modern ethic that seems to only reduce society down to the individual? Their are actually very few multi instrumentalists in the music world-who aren't just playing a lot of keyboards. And there are even fewer such musicians yet who have a horn as part of their repertoire. The Crescent City's own Nicholas Payton is among the latter. His music was introduced to me through my friend Henrique-a key inspiration for many of my recent musical discoveries. It was actually not easy to track this fairly new album down less than a year ago. Now that I have and listened to it? I'm finding words are inadequate to describe what happens here musically.  ""By My Side"" is a mixture of powerful Clavinet/bass synthesizer and otherworldly processed lead vocals with a rolling old school electro/hip-hop beat-something that shows up in a similar fashion on the shuttering ""The Second Show (Adam's Plea"",""Flip The Script"" later in the album, whereas ""Freesia"" has a breezy Brazilian rhythm and electric piano for a cosmically jazzy number. ""Shades Of Hue"" takes a similar idea into a melodically powerful ballad area whereas ""Truth Or Dare"" combines an extremely phat mix of electronics with Payton's trumpet and vocals. ""Togetherness,Foreverness"" has a loping,delayed neo soul rhythmic flavor where ""Indigo"" has a straight up,brittle beat jazz/funk swing to it. ""Love And Faith"" has a clean jazz pop shuffle about it  while ""Flip Thee Script"""" Don't I Love You Good"" and ""iStole Your IPhone"" are just plain rhythmically unique.  ""You Take Me Places I've Never Been Before"" is an electronic blues delight with Cassandra Wilson on board while the organ fueled gospel/soul ballad ""Give Live,Live Life,Love"" and the digitized swing of the title song end off the album. With many albums in the funk genre? Some are diverse,others stay firmly on their variation of the one. This album is definitely in the former category. If such a term could apply to this. If I had to give this album any sort of a musical label at all? It would be as if Stevie Wonder and Omar Lye Fook came together to record with Lonnie Liston Smith & The Cosmic Echoes. The rhythms are full of a hard groove,the melodies are soaring and the electronic keyboards create many unique sounds.

"One main reason that I've been hesitant in purchasing that much new music this year,in addition to space issues in my living area,has a lot to do with a seeming lack of quality control. Specifically a lot of artists who have spent the last half decade being more rhythmically exploratory have retreated and basically given up on the funk. When viewing new releases here? This reminded me that it was just about time for a new release by Jeff Lorber. In terms of commitment to that strong groove? This man and his band(s) always deliver. So considering my recent (and unfortunate) extended musical lag? Felt this would provide just the aural vibes I'd want flowing through my ear holes right now.  ""Get Up"" sets off the album in a straight forward bass/horn led groove with a bluesy rhythm guitar lick. ""Up On This"" is a more percussive number where the entire instrumentation stutters along into sassy and melodic refrains. ""Mustang"" and the fast paced ""Right On Time"" bring in a piano/Rhodes based shuffle while ""Fire Spirit"" really gets some more jazzy scaling harmonics into the mix. ""Arecibo"" brings in Robben Ford to really turn up the funkiness to it's maximum proportions and the band itself and this idea basically extends itself into ""Starfish"",""Deep Green"",""Soul Party"" and the hefty groove of the closing title track. ""Tenth Victim"" meanwhile takes a slower crawling ballad outlook on this sound.  Every album I've heard Jeff Lorber,with or without the Fusion,make in the past decade or so have all been excellent. One thing this particular release brings out is that he has officially joined Steely Dan,Boz Scaggs and The Crusaders as among the ""fine wine"" style jazz/funkers. Their grooves have reached a level of fluidity and strength that allow it to work on many levels: whether it be casual at home listening,driving music or just dancing away the blues all night. And as far as my own personal intent with this album? With every ounce of it's instrumentation jamming very heavily on the one? This one truly reaches out to lick the listeners funkiest emotions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MFSA6XOIHATE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BXK5ZM#wasThisHelpful","R2MFSA6XOIHATE","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For two years in a row? Herb Alpert made what was for me a very happy comeback-basically recording originals and standards in a modern setting that's still true to his classic melodic and rhythmic ideas. The two albums released up to that point both had musically sunny dispositions and enormous revelation in the groove. So it was much to my delight when,a few weeks ago I discovered that he was releasing a third album in this series. Seems to be somewhat of an artist of runs and pauses over the many decades-in terms of full length releases that is. After listening to this one? Can only hope there will at least be a couple more like this to follow up on.  The title song that opens the album is an uptempo Brazilian groove that's both featherweight in melody but thick in rhythm that continues on ""Sweet And Lovely"" and ""Night Ride"" later in the album. ""Blue Skies"" has a folksy ska flavor while ""Got A Lot Of Livin' To Do"" really goes for the ethereal end of Cuban jazz. ""Cheeky"" brings in the steel drums and flute to extend on this carnivalesque musical vibration while the tempo of ""Take The ""A"" Train is bought down to a slow swinging attitude-the same treatment ""Something"" gets as well. ""Love Affair"" is orchestrally heady modern classic piece whereas ""Windy City"" has a gentle pop jazz flavor. ""Walkin' Tall"" is a straight up reggae number while the dixieland stomp of ""On The Sunny Side Of The Street"" and the torchy ""Danny Boy"" conclude the album.  Overall this album completes a triad of excellent 2010's releases from Herb Alpert. It does have it's own uniqueness about it however. Of these albums,this one is by far the most live band oriented and really embraces Alpert's strong Latin musical influences on many different levels. One famous jazz quotes that stays in my head was Jelly Roll Morton having said that without the ""Spanish tinge"",one didn't have the right seasoning for jazz. Therefore this album takes a bit of a journey through all of the different tributaries on that level of America's improvisational music form. While this may be the last we hear from the man for awhile? Hoping this particular musical winning streak of his continues for a little bit longer anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1OX7HYPZDWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012G4GUJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1X1OX7HYPZDWZ","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I have several of the 1990's big soul/R&B/funk box sets in my music collection? I've found them very daunting to review here because of the breadth of what they are presenting. The story with this started a couple of years ago when my father purchased the complete Atlantic sessions of Ray Charles pre-owned at a time when I just couldn't swing it. Now just about a month ago? I was at a second hand store in nearby Old Town and notice this career spanning set-all shrink wrapped and never opened for $10. It was simply too much to resist. And almost too much music to comprehend. But glad I did because it's still having a profound effect as I'm writing this.  The first two songs on disc 1 of these are direct from vinyl-both jump blues style numbers before the man really found it his voice. Then we get into his classics such as the gospel/blues drenched ""I Got A Woman"",""Hallelujah I Love Her So"",instrumentals such as ""Rockhouse"" and the ultra groove ""What'd I Say"". Disc two keeps it right on going with ""Let The Good Times Roll"",""Georgia On My Mind"",the stomping rendition of ""Hard Hearted Hannah"",""Hit The Road Jack"" as well as his two famous songs recorded with Betty Carter. Disc 3 concentrates on his country excursions and orchestral ballad projects on his own Tanger.ine Label-along with cinematic grooves such as ""The Cincinnati Kid"" and the deeply soulful ""Let's Go Get Stoned"".  Disc 4 is probably the most interesting to me as it contains a lot of heavily funky soul numbers such as ""In The Heat Of The Night"",""Look What They've Done To My Song,Ma"",""I Don't Know What Time It Was"" and in particular ""If It Wasn't For Bad Luck"" with Jimmy Lewis. After his famous rendition of ""America The Beautiful"" there is a hidden track of his first early 70's Coke commercial. Disc 5 begins the same way with a thick electric piano driven funk rendition of Stevie Wonder's ""Living For The City"" and eventually takes jump cuts to his country duets with Willie Nelson,George Jones and Hank Williams Jr. all the way to the soulful  ""Shake Your Tail Feather"" done for the Blues Brothers movie. Of course there's his new jack duet with Chaka Khan on ""I'll Be Good To You"" as well as versions of ""A Song For You"" and ""Still Crazy After All These Years"".  There are dozens of excellent songs presented here I just didn't have time to mention in this review. But it still ranks high in presentation and song selection what the best box sets should do. It features all the hits,in their full length versions and presents everything in chronological order. It feels like the listener is musically progressing with the man as he goes right along.  Even though it's always been made clear to me that Ray Charles had a vastly diverse musical palette he worked with? This really emphasize how much he allowed his own connective thread of soul to show so brightly down very other stylistic tributary he explored. You know it's him from the start,and by the end. And therefore if anyone wants to get a thorough dose of what made this artist what he was and to soul music? This is an easily recommended place to go for that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354VVT68FOLVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000343O#wasThisHelpful","R354VVT68FOLVA","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with a lot of people with only a casual awareness of his career? I basically had it in mind that by the late 70's,Ray Charles was a country/pop balladeer who had long left anything closely related to soul/R&B behind him. Not only is that not the case. But kept me from understanding something very important about this period of his. His career on Atlantic in the late 50's is music history. Seldom is it acknowledged about his return to the label that mad him famous with this 1977 release. It's something I wanted in my vinyl collection for awhile now. And about a year or so ago finally picked it up. It was a musical investment that I'm growing more happy with over time.  ""I Can See Clearly Now"" starts out the album-taking the pop/reggae of the original into a more uptempo funky soul direction. ""The Jealous Kind"" and ""Heavenly Music"" both have jazzy electric piano mid tempo references while ""Anonymous Love"" is a horn,percussion and organ fueled cinematic soul groove. My personal favorite number here is ""Game Number Nine""-a straight up bluesy synth funk number in the vein of Billy Preston's ""Wide Stride"" of the same vintage and full of Ray's renowned storytelling. ""Oh What A Beautiful Morning"",""How Long Has This Been Going On"" and ""Let It Be"" zero in on his swinging bluesy soul balladry while ""Be My Love"" brings the big orchestras into play for a similar tempo.  Because of the vast amount of albums he tended to make? It's not hard to understand why so many of Ray Charles' studio sets remain out of print today. Yet with some such as this,it's hard to imagine how they specifically got overlooked in that regard. In this case? We have nine songs that just about perfectly tie together everything the man had done musically for the past decade or so before. Especially in terms of his complete melodic and rhythmic re-invention of standards. Also there's some serious late 70's jazz and/or funk elements here that work wonderfully at modernizing Ray's particular approach to music. So it's a very strong late 70's offering from the man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IVZ9TA19W98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018P7TBO#wasThisHelpful","R3IVZ9TA19W98","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes it's difficult for me,of a specific generation to imagine a time when it was very common for some popular artists to record upwards of two or three albums a year. Seems that's basically how Ray Charles spent the mid to late 60's when looking at his discography. He was actually recording on his own label. That was something very few black artists in particular were doing in his day,and along with Sam Cooke they were leading the way in that regard. This album was recorded by an artist who was about to transition into yet another of his many stylistic periods. And as something of a conclusion to this one? It's not too bad.  On this particular album the strings and more easy listening rhythmic elements are in place from song to song. Especially from most of what I've heard of him of this period. Ray's singing here is also a bit more by rote than I'm personally used to hearing from him. ""Love Is Here To Stay"" is another one of his trademark bluesy soul piano shuffles sung with his equally renowned distinctive power. From some on and offline reading I've done? There are mixed feelings about whether this period was musically healthy for Ray Charles. What really matters is how he felt since he was in complete control of these albums. It was an important stage of development for him. And a nice listen,especially if one's in the right mood for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LF0RR6I1JQR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MY5XSS#wasThisHelpful","R3LF0RR6I1JQR5","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking back from a time remembering Ray Charles being very much alive and active? It really fascinates me not just how prolific the man was in his prime,but also how much he innovated in terms of being an album artist. Following the formation of his own Tangerine Records? He released a long series of album length sets of standards-many of them following a loose conceptual thread. Being the great storyteller that he was? He had the creative energy to make unrelated songs seemed like they always belong together when putting them together in this way. And that even goes for album such as this without any obvious connective elements to them.  The majority of this album consists slow ballads that are heavily orchestrated with strings and horns. The songs that stand out musically in this setting are the big band uptempo romp of ""You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Wanna Do It"" and ""Gee Baby,Ain't I Good To You""-a slow swinging piano blues/soul number. There's also the shuffling country soul of ""Here I Go Again"". Vocally what gets me most about this album is on songs like ""Love Walked In"",Ray sang in a breathy high falsetto voice. It's something he does quite a lot here,and a vocal style I seldom heard him sustain as much as he does on this album. It's the genius at his most vulnerable sounding. The fact there's still a strength behind it says numbers for his creative sensibilities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAVU4EWGRQQK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003M65GSU#wasThisHelpful","RAVU4EWGRQQK4","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For most of my teens? This particular album was part of my internal ""discount special"" list. It was always a cutout CD everywhere I went during the mid/late 90's. Which usually meant it was a comeback album for a veteran act of middling to decent success. At least,that's what I was expected to think at the time. Have learned since it's a far more complex situation than that. In actuality? This album was a reunion between Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards-reforming Chic with new instrumentalists and singers to accompany them about a decade after they originally split apart. The only thing I'd even read about it was that it was a good place to get new disco songs. Again,time has offered a new perspective.  ""Chic Mystique"",""Your Love"" and ""Something You Can Feel"" all add an early 90's production sheen to the classic funkified disco groove that the band pioneered. On the other hand songs such as ""Jusagroove"",""One And Only One"",the wah wah fueled ""In It To Win It"" and the fast,live oriented title song are all much more in the heavier boogie funk style primary-with thicker drumming and rhythm in general. ""Doin' That Thing To Me"" and ""Take My Love"" are both in their classic ballad style in every sense of the word. ""My Love's For Real"" and ""High"" both add a more brittle hip-hop/funk beat to the sound while ""M.M.F.T.C.F"" concludes the album with the phattest funk here.  Cannot say why exactly? But I seem to remember this album for exactly what it wasn't: a very programmed pop/house style album. That has nothing to do with the rhythms here,which are mostly live drum oriented. It has to do with that production update I talked about earlier. By the time this album dropped? Music was being fully digitally recorded and mixed. The punchiness that analog recordings had were replaced by often thinner sonic's audible to even non audiophiles. That is the case with this album. Musically? It not only updates their sound but also showcases how much their original music lived on in the many tributaries of acid jazz and dance-pop this album embraced. And it doesn't hurt they really turned up the funk here either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7Q1G8URAZIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000008E6O#wasThisHelpful","R7Q1G8URAZIY","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's really funny to me now how growing up? I somehow managed to totally separate Nile Rodgers as an artist and a producer. Grew to understand him thoroughly as both. Yet it wasn't until adulthood that I began to see him musically outside of his role within the Chic Organization. This was his first solo album from 1983. The same year that his original band ended their seven year run. For a long time? It was extremely difficult to locate on vinyl. And a CD format was unheard of. That all changed about six years ago when two different labels reissued it right around the same time. I feel extremely luck to have gotten a hold of it now,and be able to give it a thorough listen.  The title song and ""Yum Yum""-with it's slamming synth bass,digital bells and call & response vocal leads are both ultra thick grooves on the funkiest side of the post disco dance sound. ""Beet"" is a stripped down new wave rocker while ""Get Her Crazy"" and ""Rock Bottom""  really focus right on hard on the phat rhythm guitar sound that Rodgers had made his trademark long before this. ""It's All In Your Hands"" has more of an electro funk style drum pattern while ""My Love Song Is For You"" is the lone ballad-essentially a slow burning funk groove. ""Most Down"" ends the album with a JB style shuffle that again adds that slippery synth bass.  Coming into this? I expected this to be a very strong album. And it lived up to that expectation in more than one way. Disco music could be a number of things at it's core. For Nile Rodgers? It was funk. In this case very conceptualized too. The nautical map on the cover is an excellent expression of what the album title has to say. The album still has the man's signature instrumental style and framework of rhythm. On the other hand? This is also where his more elastic style as a producer-embracing pop and rock styles meshes right together with the dance based approach he'd pioneered in the previous decade. So on that level? It's probably Nile's most important album thus far. And one I'd highly recommend for those looking for a healthy perspective on dance/funk of the early 80's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DP88PX3V4LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CL36AQ#wasThisHelpful","R16DP88PX3V4LW","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just taking a listen to the major breakthrough album that was Dare! was a year and a half before this? It was clear that a major part of the Human League's basic sound,outside their instrumental approach,was going to be soulful dance and funk music with a lot of strong melody. Honestly not a bad way to go when electronic pop music and what was used to create it was still in it's infantile state of development. While the band were recording their next full length album? They elected to extend on their new approach by releasing this six song EP during 1983. And it proved to be a major continual step in the right direction far as they were concerned.  ""(Keep Feeling) Fascination"" is my favorite song by this band-starting the album out in it's extended version and ending it on a re-edited and sampled improvisational mix. It's essentially a Sly & The Family Stone style vocal trade off between the groups male and female voices-right down to the bass singers part and instrumental breakdown. ""Mirror Man"" gets the uptempo percussion flavor of mid 60's Motown down perfectly for an equally strong number while the danceable ""I Love You Too Much"" and the dramatic mid tempo rocker ""You Remind Me Of Gold"" are more about electronic orchestrations. ""Hard Times"" is a brittle,funky dance number to round this out.  This EP is a superb extension on it's predecessor. The funk/soul influences on that album are actually the definition of most of this one. To talk a bit about my personal experience and having already reviewed the 45 for the title song? This really does remind me of my very first exposure to this band. And really got me to understand just what the UK new wave/synth pop movement really meant set against the post disco black music freeze out of early 80's America.  Seems that overseas? Groups like this were actually innovating on those ideas in new and technologically advanced ways. And that in a word describes the music found here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B4F5B9TZ6DQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KKWVCE#wasThisHelpful","R1B4F5B9TZ6DQ5","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been born when I was and seeing what pop music is based in today? It's sometimes hard for me to believe that the synth pop/new wave genre of music was completely unknown to the vast majority of people in the world. It's been a part of my life as long as I can remember. Yet to speak objectively? It seemed to be in England and Australia of 1981 that this entire movement really began to emerge from the underground. The Human League were a superb example of this. Having lost two key members after releasing a couple of more experimental electronic albums? The refashioned group decided to move onward's and more towards the people.  ""The Things That Dreams Are Made Of"" opens the album with a disco beat-accentuated by thumping synth bass. ""Love Action (I Believe In Love"" has a similar vibe,this time focusing on wonderfully played electronic string charts. ""Open Your Heart"",the abrasive ""The Sound Of The Crowd"" and the brittle ""Seconds"" all focus more on a pop/rock approach while ""Darkness"" comes out with a strong blue eyed soul attitude that continues on the very catchy hit ""Don't You Want Me"". ""Do Or Die"" has a percussive Brazilian funk flavor about it as ""Get Carter"" and ""I Am The Law"" are darker/more ambient ballads.  Included in this set is an EP by the ""League Unlimited Orchestra"" called Love & Dancing. It features mostly instrumental versions of the songs off the main album-in particular a version of ""Don't You Want Me"" that's pitched quite a bit higher. Not to mention ""Hard Times""-essentially a bluesy soul/funk number. Taken as a whole all of these songs are excellent. And the synthesized instrumentation a popular revelation at the time-whereas a cult of people were familiar with the likes of Kraftwerk and such before,especially stateside. The fun part for me was being able to easily discern the other known genres of music amid the electronic musical approach. Funk,soul and disco were (as with most new wave) a huge part of this. And that would set the stage for what the Human League would become as they continued to evolve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUBVWRBEBTE6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007MB2U#wasThisHelpful","RUBVWRBEBTE6T","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the things I noticed about Earl Klugh from the 1980's onward is that every other album or two? He'd tend to release a solo acoustic album. If I recall? That was the case before this release. Somehow assumed that this was another such recording. But it isn't by any means. It was recorded with Greg Phillinganes and a small group of musicians in tow for each song. I discovered this CD completely by accident-stopping at a Goodwill for a bathroom break and afterward briefly browsing the used CD's. Came across a number of them and this turned out to be one of them. Really had no clue what to expect. And am very happy I found out.  The gentle Brazilian pop/funk of ""The Traveler"",with it's shiny keys and thumping bass bookends the album with Part II being the closing track. Of course there's a great deal of musical progression between them as well. ""Just For Your Love"" is a slow shuffle R&B ballad featuring female choral vocals and the processed Rhodes piano sound I always love. ""Second Chances"" is a spare and melodically simple electro pop number with a nice round synth bass whereas ""For The Love Of You"" is a melodic mid tempo,orchestrated disco-pop groove. ""Debra Anne"",""Santiago Sunset"" and the albums sole acoustic number ""Moon And The Stars"" are all ballads concentrating on Klugh's guitar solos.  ""Sandman"" again returns to the percussive vibe of Rio in a very gentle way while ""Return Of The Rainmaker"" is my favorite here-a vast orchestral movement that veers some Latin guitar solos to huge string and horn filled swells for a heavy Spanish folk vibe overall. In many ways? This album is one of the most musically adventurous I've ever heard from this artist. The basic rhythm section is kept even more spare than usual for an Earl Klugh album. And the presence of the Chamber Ensemble adds an enormous and successful musical contrast to that. It has just about every element done in the best possible way for Klugh and is an album I'd recommend for anyone looking to get into one of his full length albums.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIU011O2I64T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002LA5#wasThisHelpful","R3RIU011O2I64T","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was a cassette copy of the 1981 album Crazy for You that first got me listening to the music of Earl Klugh. At that particular time? Just about any album from that time frame that involved musicians such as Greg Phillinganes and Louis Johnson had my instant attention. Came to my attention shortly after that Mr. Klugh recorded quite a few albums in the company of these personnel. And this album is actually the follow up to the aforementioned one as well. It was difficult to locate on CD for years. And that was the format I wished to hear it in due to the sonically clean sounds of the musicians involved. Late last year I found it! And it's a happy musical event for me all around.  ""Back In Central Park"" opens the album with a breezy,uptempo Brazilian jazz-pop featuring the title song using choral vocalists. ""If You Want To Be My Love"" is an extremely powerful funk number-full of solo and ascending electric/synth bass tones interacting with the sauntering rhythms. The title song has a similar vibe to it-only with a smoother pop and R&B flavor about it with a hand clap and rhythm guitar fueled outro. ""Just Like Yesterday"" has the melody based,electric keyboard oriented mid tempo shuffle of a Ray Parker Jr. composition (though he didn't write it) while ""If Your Still In Love With Me"",""I Never Thought I'd Leave You and ""Christina"" are all creamily orchestrated ballads.  'Night Drive"" ends the album with  a slap bass heavily Brazilian jazz/funk attitude yet again-this time on the phatter end of the genre. As far as I'm concerned? This particular album is every bit the equal of it's predecessor. It even goes for blending some synthesizers into the production as more orchestral elements. Yet the core of the album remains very much on the clean end of that keeping it live instrumental spirit. And to quote Stevie Wonder? There's no way this band could lose? While I haven't heard all this man's music from the period? I would go as far as saying that the early 80's were surely some golden period for Earl Klugh.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX70STGUJ3H5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DQS9#wasThisHelpful","RX70STGUJ3H5T","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Almost two decades ago now? My father purchased a CD celebrating a musical style referred to in it's title as Nuyerican Soul. One of the songs on that collection was an updated acid jazz version of the title song of this album,and along with other songs there it featured Roy Ayers. Had absolutely no idea who the man was until hearing that. And this began a voracious time of crate digging searching for music by the man that,during the mid/late 90's wasn't particularly easy to come by in my neck of the woods. It was actually earlier this year that I got a CD copy of this album-featuring the tune that started it all for me with this artist.  ""Hey Uh-What You Say Come On"",""The Golden Rod"",""People And The World"" and ""It' Ain't Your Sign,It's Your Mind"" are all intensely percussive Afro-Cuban jazz-funk jams full of beautiful harmonic passages,exciting compositional changes and otherworldly electronic melodies. ""Keep On Walking"",the mid tempo Salsa kjazzof ""The Third Eye"" and of course the dynamic title song are superb examples of funkiness taken it's slowest possible ballad tempos. ""You And Me My Love"",""Tongue Power"" and the comically romantic  closer ""Lonesome Cowboy"",dealing with the ""urban cowboy gets married"" theme are all thick,bassy hard funk-filled with horns and stomping drum breaks that  keep down the strongest groove possible.  Something about the mid 70's during which this was recorded just seemed to allow funkiness to be it's own lovely reward. Hearing this particular album now helps me understand the acid jazz/funk movement really pumping out of Europe during my teen years. The songs here have the funk and Afro Cuban rhythmic underpinnings that were always central to Roy Ayers sound. Yet he also bought in both lead and orchestral string synthesizers to add great melodic/harmonic color to the music. The way he uses them on this album? The do in fact have the aural impression of bright cosmic rays shinning through from the skies above into these grooves. This all combines to make this a very special 70's Roy Ayers album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV3IQEKK40E1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001FNN#wasThisHelpful","RV3IQEKK40E1F","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years of listening have really helped me to appreciate how jazz,blues,soul,rock and Afrocentric world music's joined together in,so many combinations, under the banner of funk. Having been listening to Roy Ayers for a long time now? I see him as a major figure in showcasing this particular musical unification. Known about and seen this soundtrack for years. Finally decided to pick it up inexpensively on a reprinted,very high quality vinyl because...it just seemed like the right format sonically to enjoy what this particular album had to offer. Even though this is my second attempt at reviewing this? That little bit of time has added greatly to my original perspective.  ""Coffee Is The Color"" begins the album with a percussion and wah wah based uptempo groove with the vibes providing that jazzy melody. ""Pricilla's Theme"" starts out in a flute led bossa nova before going back to that same faster rhythm while ""King George"" is thick,Rhodes piano led hard funk that gurgles and churns. This extends itself throughout the album in different ways such as on the heavily melodic,stripped down ""Brawling Broads"" and the bluesy guitar drenched ""Exotic Dance"" as well as ""King's Last Ride"" with it's rocking wah wah. ""Coffee Sauna"",""Shinning Symbol"" and ""Making Love"" are all beautifully atmospheric ballads. That along with the beautifully arranged ""Coffey Baby"",featuring a talented young singer named Dee Dee Bridgewater.  ""Aragon"" and ""Escape"" return to the same uptempo,percussive flavor of the opener with the looser,more avante gard ""End Of Sugarman"" closes the album. Probably the most significant elements of these soundtrack that stands out for me (having not yet seen the film itself) is the juxtaposition of genres really catches onto the mood of the score itself. The softer,more melodic themes generally catch right onto the harmonic depth of jazz while the uptempo songs expressing actions tend to go for more rhythmic and uptempo styles.

"With their previous album All In The Name Of Love.Atlantic Starr made the full transition into a band who were known for popular adult contemporary ballads than dance music. Of course that didn't mean they didn't stop making uptempo songs of the highest quality. Over the many years of CD browsing and vinyl crate digging? The 80's era Atlantic Starr albums have come up on this occasions again and again. This one showing up quite a lot more often than I expected for what I recently learned to be a relatively uncommon album. Turns out it's their final release of the decade. So thought it would literally follow up that predecessor as a good listen very well.  ""Under Your Spell"" opens the album with a heavy AC ballad which extends through ""My First Love"",""My Sugar"",the closer ""You Deserve The Best"" and the sentimental humanitarianism of ""Friends"". ""I'm In Love With You"",""Woman's Touch"" and ""I Can't Wait"" are more rhythmically climactic mid tempo numbers that emphasize heavy song craft and melodic progressions. ""Love Ain't Fair"" adds a chugging reggae flavor with a like minded Jamaican accent to the lead vocals. ""Don't Star The Fire"" and the title track meanwhile are very sleek,electronic and lightly funkified dance tracks which round off this album.  In many ways,this album is the exact opposite of what came before it. While it's two predecessors were basically heavy electro funk albums with a few pop ballads added to the mix? This album is primarily about slick quiet storm urban contemporary material. There isn't any kind of heavy grooves and stomps to deal with here. At the same time? The bands vocal,instrumental and composing abilities are so strong and well oiled by that this ended up being a culmination of their pop savvy rather than a mere end to it. Their hit period would come to an end after this album so it would seem. Yet they continued to put out new albums once and awhile. And this is a great way to conclude this period for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AXXF0RB9SHIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000008D0U#wasThisHelpful","R2AXXF0RB9SHIW","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It feels wonderful to have already acknowledged Atlantic Starr as being the seriously strong album makers that they were quite awhile ago. It actually helped me to go back and finally pick up this album,which I did today. It's the most common one I've seen. And contains that song that introduced me to them in childhood. Because this did represent the culmination of a musical change in priorities for the band? Was a bit concerned if the entire content of this was going to be boring and bland. Yet already being aware of this albums fantastic predecessor As The Band Turns? Already had in mind to expect the happily unexpected. Turned out to be a good instinct to truth.  ""One Lover At A Time"",""You Belong With Me"",""Females"",the Maurice White produced ""Armed And Dangerous"" and ""Let The Sun Shine In"" are all beautifully crafted melodies with grooves that feature pumping synth/synth bass and rhythm guitar based stomps. With the addition of both real and electronic horns on occasion. ""Don't Take Me For Granted"" and the title song are themselves rhythmically climactic ballads that extends into the more cinematically flavored ""Thankful and ""My Mistake"". ""Always"" of course finds that lovely middle ground between those two slow jam styles-that creamily orchestrated number that represents the first time I heard them. ""I'm In Love"" is a slinky mid tempo groove with the dynamic acapella of ""Interlude"" closes it all out.  Much in the same spirit of the Commodores a decade prior to this? These people started out as a larger band playing the harder and most danceable funk of the period. And in their later period became better known for their ballads. But in both cases? It really fascinates me how well both updated their more uptempo tunes. And this particular album is literally split right down the middle in terms of both musical styles. It really helped to showcase how much slow,singable romantic pop ballads had the potential to pull the listener towards the equally well crafted uptempo and symphonic soul to be found on the rest of this album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STKODYR82F7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002LBB#wasThisHelpful","R2STKODYR82F7T","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very recently,I congratulated my friend Henrique for a blog he did based on a constant conversation he and I have had about music. And it applies to this is well. Having come into my preteen years during the last half of the 80's? Both he and myself noticed that the dance music of that time began to tie period technology very well back into the fabric of heavy funkiness. I am very happy that I was able to experience the late Jermaine Stewart's major hit period as it was happening. Still only knew him wrongly as a one hit wonder. Having recently heard about this album? I located the used CD of this for under $5 earlier this year. And tonight decided to give it a listen.  ""We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off"" is the song that introduced me to this artist. And it's a great opener with it's well crafted melody,chugging rhythm guitar and singing horn accents. ""Dance Floor"" is built around several brittle bass synth accents and deep,sexual backup vocals while ""Jody"" has an extremely chunky,metallic rhythm and bluesy melody-some of the hardest funk I've heard from this era outside Minneapolis while ""Versitile"" and the title song both take the same musical idea and smooths it out just a bit more. ""Out To Punish"" is again based in JB style rhythm guitars while ""Moonlight Carnival"" adds a Afro Caribbean flavor to a fast electro/funk dance number. ""Don't Ever Leave Me"" and the closer ""Give Your Love To Me"" are both jazzy,soulful ballads.  A lot of people I know tend to look at this particular of dance music as being based more on ""12 inch singles and extended club play. Yet listening to this? It's an wonderful album. Of course it's full on danceable-thematically reviving the sensitive masculinity somewhere between Thom Bell and Prince. With a help from Jermaine's own songwriting and the always able production of Narada Michael Walden? This album finds it's sense of rhythm through heavy funk-full of phat bottoms and often very fiery electronic elements. If one is looking for a superb example of how vital stomping funkiness was to 80's freestyle dance music? This is an excellent place to find that hybrid in great form!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CJ4M5QL2R9QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GNUP5O#wasThisHelpful","R2CJ4M5QL2R9QM","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What major factor that's helped me to realize just how much I've actually appreciated the disco era of the late 70's more than I thought I did? That would be the understanding that it was gay and/or black DJ's-people who really loved funky,danceable music who really pushed that particular period forward. As a vocalist and a performer? Sylvester here was in fact both of those things. Though he passed away when I was still a child? It was during that transition in life from my adolescence to adulthood that helped me understand just how significant this man was on a purely musical level as having been such a big personality.  ""Dance (Disco Heat)"",""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"",""Stars"",""Body Strong"" and ""Can't Stop Dancing"" are all gospel/soul four on the floor rave-up's filled with infectious,percussive energy and often very abstract Eurodisco bass synthesizer orchestrations. ""I Need You"" and the faster paced ""Sell My Soul"" are both more sleek early 80's boogie funk-both with strong melodies and somewhat phatter bottoms. ""Cry Me A River"" is an amazing,uptempo blues shuffle featuring the likes of John Tropea whereas a version of ""Ooh Baby Baby"" and the live clover ""You Are My Friend"",featuring the always outstanding Martha Wash represent the slow ballad end of the mans work.  With the strong production help from Motown alumni Harvey Fuqua? These eleven songs bring up a very interesting points about myself and greatest hits collections. Especially in the late 70's and early 80's? These sorts of collections,especially when focused on a single artist,can have the effect of making their sound come off as very one dimensional. To a certain extent? This one has the potential to do this as well. Where it overcomes this is where it shows just how during the 1977-1980 period in which these were recorded? Sylvester was actually showcasing the rhythmic linkages between black American gospel and African poly rhythms in his popular dance songs. Not only that but it even brings out his range and diversity. So where I'd normally go with a full length original album? This collection actually works quite well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PXDWDM5CCH7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TPSZSO#wasThisHelpful","R2PXDWDM5CCH7B","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past five years? Something very unique has happened to me with this musical artist. I was reading about Dam Funk on and offline,discussing him with my friend Henrique,hearing his songs and having collaborations with him. And all without having even one of the man's many albums recorded under his own name. One of the factors of this year for me is that while the new music is not only hitting me the wrong way? But there seems to be a decided absence of funk behind it all. I have my theories why this is happening. But thankfully,looks like I'm not the only one because thematically this album actually addresses that very situation head on.  It starts out with a CB radio style transition from veteran P-Funker Junie Morrison about how music's future depends on our awareness of the funk. Such an incredibly profound statement,than on with the show. ""We Continue"",""Somewhere,Someday"",""The Hunt Of Meat & Lucifer"",""It Didn't Have 2 End This Way"",""Acting"" and ""Virtuous Progression"" blends the man's grand synthesizer orchestrations with percussive,stomping rhythms. ""I'm Just Tryna Survive"" with Q-Tip"",""Just Ease Your Mind From All Negativity"" with Snoop Dogg as well as ""Gldye 2nyte"" with two generations of Leon Sylvers' are given the same treatment. ""Floating On Air"" is a more electronica/rock hybrid. Whereas ""howugonfu*karoundandchoosebusta""  is a synth bass heavy funk stomp.  The police brutality/music industry metaphor of ""Surveillance Escape"" and the amazing,jazzy funk jam of ""O.B.E"" (perhaps my favorite here) round out the album. Overall this is just a flat out wonderful collection of songs. It points to something very important that I've been mulling over a lot lately. Dam Funk here is one of the few younger people to come out and choose heavy funk as their musical base over funk or commercial hip-hop. Boogie and P-Funk are of course his main influences,and he really lets them shine brightly. Also musically and thematically? He really knows how to stay right on the one-driving often topical points as well as humor into his music! Highly recommended nu funk classic to be!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKBHX09QAENO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BU9MW0#wasThisHelpful","RBKBHX09QAENO","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Around a decade ago? My musical ears were all a buzz about a multifarious new artist named Lizz Wright. That's all it was to me though. Somehow never bothered to check out any of her music,and moved on to other things. It was less than a week ago that I learned that she was coming out with a brand new album. Considering that this year hasn't really produced any interest in people I'm more familiar with? I thought that this one,who is making her label debut on Concord, would be an excellent place to start with her music. And am honestly surprised with the actual content that emanated from this album.  ""Freedom"" begins the album with a rhythm guitar heavy funk groove with a strong Afro-Brazilian jazzy back beat while ""Surrender"" ends it with a slowed down retro southern soul ballad-book ending the album with a title song in two separate halves as it were. That same slow soul ballad feel extends into ""Lean In"" and a version of the Bee Gee's ""To Love Somebody"". ""Somewhere Down In The Mystic"",""Real Life Painting"" and ""Blessed The Brave"" integrate more acoustically driven singer/songwriter elements into them. ""The Game"",""You"",""Riverman"" and ""Right Where You Are"",sung as a duet with Gregory Porter are all slow swinging jazzier numbers while ""The New Game"" is a stomping,organ fueled rhythm & blues number.  All and all? This is a very balladic album. The vast majority of these songs are slow and meditative. What's interesting to me is that while all of these songs are very strong? Wright counter balances them with uptempo numbers that are some of the most thickest,vital,bluesy and often full on funky music that's around at the moment. While it's true I can see this albums sweet and poetic nature as reaching out more to the female members her audience than the male ones? It's a very good mixture of folk/jazz,neo soul and R&B and is probably one of the best kinds of label debuts that an artist such as herself could possibly imagine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDK8PALTQDHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YH4XYNA#wasThisHelpful","R2PDK8PALTQDHQ","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I had been in a girl group about a decade ago from this point? Must say that Destiny's Child would not have been the group I'd have wanted to be a part of. As musically and culturally significant as they were at that point? 2004 showcased a time when members had been coming and going right and left. Not only that but Beyonce had already launched a solo career that...well,most people know how that turned out. Because for many years many music writers don't always celebrate groups as much as individual artists? It was wonderful that this group managed to get another trio version of themselves back together to make what's so far been their last album.  ""Lose My Breath"" is a stellar intro-perhaps one of their finest songs with their call and response vocal leads sung rhythmically enormous Brazilian marching band style live drumming. ""Solider"" is a pretty by the numbers contemporary pop/hip-hop number with Lil Wayne while ""Cater 2 You"",""Through With Love"",""T-Shirt"",'Bad Habit"" and ""Free"" are sensuous funky soul style ballads. ""Girl"" has a sweet mid 70's Memphis soul/pop danceability about it while the flavor of that era also continues onward into the reverbed,muted horn fueled groove of ""Is She The Reason"" and the cinematic soul ballad of ""Love"" which closed out this album.  One of the big things this group did during their heyday in the early aughts was to reintroduce world music's rhythmic and melodic ideas into the black American popular consciousness of the day-via contemporary hip-hop/R&B music. And with a very strong Afrocentric focus no less. For their finale? The group seemed to be in something of a more nostalgic mood as it got underway-with far more retro and neo soul style sounds than what they'd been previously associated with. In terms of the vocals,material and production by Rodney Jerkins? This was a rather subdued but still often fiery finale for Destiny's Child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8IKSSW1E57I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000643A5M#wasThisHelpful","R3O8IKSSW1E57I","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Probably the most important lessons I learned from Destiny's Child during their time was that to some people? The musical attributes of a group can be neglected by the listener if their songs are essentially saturating your everyday life. Radio,television,at the store,there didn't seem to be any escape from them in 1999-2000. To this day? There are still a lot of elements I grapple with about turn of the millennium contemporary soul/R&B music. Happily for me now? I've already reviewed a couple other Destiny's Child albums,including their first. Since this release represented my initial knowledge of them? Seems overdue to put some serious writing behind it on my own part.  The introducing title track finds the quartet doing a tongue in cheek impersonation of a Godfather type dialog about the main theme of the album before it all kicks off with the stop/start electro funk ""So Good""-with it's popping drum machines and brittle guitar like keyboards. That style shows up here again intact on ""Confessions"" with Missy Elliot and on ""Bug-A-Boo"",""Where'd You Go"",""Hey Ladies"",""If You Leave"" with Next and the blockbuster hits ""Jumpin Jumpin"" and ""Say My Name"" with a more pronounced Egyptian/Arabic melodic and vocal framework. ""Temptation"",""Now That She's Gone"",""Stay"" and ""Sweet Sixteen"" are all acoustic guitar driven ballads while the album is rounded out by the mid tempo groove of ""She Can't Leave You"" and the beautiful acapella rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" that closes it all out.  All of the songs of this album are introduced by a brief spoken series of biblical style commandments on this albums concept,which revolves around the cycles of romance at this point in time. It's about men cheating on women,those same women expecting men to cheat and then feeling a sense of regret about the ensuing insecurities. This introduces an idea that is central to what contemporary R&B still explores really. Musically however? This album brings out another important element that Beyonce,Kelly and company may not have been aware of. Recently heard comments about how the major religions of the world all derive from the middle east essentially. By blending Arabic harmonies and melodic exchanges with the Christian gospel soul flavor? Destiny's Child transformed that religious concept into a musical reality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRUS7SLZ1C2PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000JQFH#wasThisHelpful","RRUS7SLZ1C2PA","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As difficult as it is to imagine now? There was a time not too long ago where I basically purchased used vinyl based on my knowledge of the artists existence,and if it was something I'd never heard of. That was surely the case with this particular album. At this point? I had no idea of Billy Preston's late 70's/early 80's period recording for Motown. It was certainly a very key time to be there-especially they were then celebrating it's 20th anniversary and beginning to sign what probably amounted to it's last group of artists as an independent label. Of course this artist was already a musical icon quite sometime before this point. So interesting these this creative meeting happened when it did.  ""Give It Up,Hot"" and ""All I Wanted Was You"" are two high octane disco-funk numbers-filled with a busy interaction of percussion,bass and guitar along with Billy's keyboard soloing. The title song and is a more straight up vocal funk number whereas ""You"" is a sleek West Coast pop sounding number with an extremely strong melody. ""I Come To Rest In You"" is another gospel infused ballad in his classic style. Syreeta Wright makes her debut as his duet partner on both the bouncy pop of ""It Will Come In Time"" and the slow piano ballad of ""With You I'm Born Again"". ""Lovely Lady"" is another of his uptempo honky tonk soul style songs while the album ends with the instrumental ""Sock It,Rocket""-a fiery combination of percussive fast paced funk and thick,otherworldly synthesizers.  For the first couple of times I heard this album? Only felt it was decent to very good in quality. Only the final cut on it really blew me away,and it still does. Again in the context of the music I've listened to since? I realized just how important this album was to Billy's career as a whole. His sound beforehand had generally been stripped down and focused on his orchestrations and melodies with many different keyboard instruments.  This album on the other hand finds him as a composer,producer and soloist surrounded by the Motown musicians of the time-all of whom provide very different flavors than what he might've previously provided for himself. It actually showcases him in a more workable team setting that way. And becomes more powerful with each listen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU3HFPETD0HEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LYLQDA#wasThisHelpful","RU3HFPETD0HEQ","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Exploring the music of Billy Preston in album,rather than single, terms within the last several years has given me some important insights into the man's particular musical bent. His previous offerings to this particular album found him working with TONTO in 1975,than moving on to a Philly soul type sound on his follow up the next year. Interestingly enough? I found out about and purchased this album quite awhile before even knowing about the other two just mentioned. So when dealing with what seemed to be his final album for A&M,and completely a very successful run of hits for them? This release was something I really wanted to hear.  The title song starts off the album with some furious funk that blends bass/guitar with the internal interactions of Billy's many different keyboard solos between them. This also goes equally for ""Complicated Sayings"",""You Got Me Buzzin'"" and ""Touch Me Love"". My favorite song,one I share a mutual affection for with friend Henrique is ""Wide Stride""-an instrumental that includes a very early use of polyphonic synthesizers playing the horn charts matched to a stripped down bluesy funk rhythm.  ""Disco Dancin"" blends the dance floor sounds of that era with an organ fueled gospel rave up while ""Attitudes"" is a bouncy rock 'n soul boogie instrumental in his then classic style.  ""Happy"" is another instrumental that really goes for the thick,grooving synth funk and is another favorite of mine here while ""I'm Really Gonna Miss You"" and ""Sweet Marie"" are both late 50's style rhythm & blues mid tempo ballads. The album ends with the wah wah heavy rhythm box funk of ""You Don't Have To Go"". In many ways? This is my favorite Billy Preston album of his 70's period. One of the reasons is that the album is extremely thick with raw,stomping funk and soul. Sometimes he was a musician who lost a bit of focus trying to showcase his eclecticism. But in this case? He merely stuck to doing what he did best,and making the highest quality music in that vein to boot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166I3IPMTW8SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00414IYZY#wasThisHelpful","R166I3IPMTW8SI","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I truly feel great regret at not taking the time to explore Gloria Estefan's music from my teenage years when it was new. One of the reasons for that is looking back from today? It was a steady stream that led up to the massive Latin pop influx in the US during 1997-2000. How this particular album came into my personal collection had to do with revisiting the transitional albums from Miami Sound Machine up through her solo career. Luckily for me? Her albums are extremely easy to find in my area on CD used for well under $4 much of the time. So all I really had to do was pick this up,pop it in my CD changer and let the music to it's thing.  The title song begins the album with a stripped down percussive slow salsa-melodically built around flowing Spanish guitar. ""I'm Not Giving You Up"" takes similar elements and adds small bursts of strings and phase filter effects in just the right places. ""The Heart Never Learns"",""Show Me The Way Back to Your Heart"",""Along Came You (Song For Emily)"" and ""I Know You Too Well"" are on a similar musical path. ""Steal Your Heart"" starts as a solo acoustic guitar number and burst into a full blown uptempo salsa that blows up to full power on ""You'll Be Mine (Party Time"" and ""Higher"". ""As for ""Path Of The Right Love"" and the closer ""Reach"",featured during the 1996 Olympic games bring out a vastly important element of this album.  And that element is deep musical Afrocentrism. Both of the aforementioned songs focus right in deeply on the most tribal elements of African folk forms and American gospel. One important conversational point bought up with myself and friend Henrique lately is that many of the South American and equatorial countries of the world,including Gloria's native Cuba,have a far richer African cultural flavor than an overt European one. With lyrical themes dealing with the complex emotional spirituality of romance and self improvement? This album picks up philosophically on that impulse as well. It's always pleased me to hear that Gloria and Emilio Estefan have continually emphasized that beautiful sense of rhythmic tribalism in both their slow and fast songs. Really helps to give it all that distinctive flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNJ6A8Q62ULKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002B9F#wasThisHelpful","RNJ6A8Q62ULKV","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the things I've noticed in listening to a lot of 90's era Gloria Estefan is how much from the albums of that era I actually recognize. Frankly? There aren't too many cover albums in my collection because,quite frankly,they've been extremely overdone in the past decade and a half or so. In this case? Part of the many qualities that makes her artistry so special is how she approaches her music in an entirely creative rather than solely performance based angle.. Since the focus of the Miami Sound Machine was usually rhythmic and instrumental? Her solo career focused on her voice. And in such a case? An album such as this really helps bring that out.There are a good number of doo wop era numbers here such as the title song,""Breaking Up Is Hard To Do"" and ""Goodnight My Love,Pleasant Dreams"". These are lushly arranged songs that go very well alongside numbers such as ""Traces"",""Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying"",merged here with the intro of Erik Satie's Trios Gymnopedies and ""Love On A Two Way Street""-all of which have a slow Calypso samba about them. ""Turn The Beat Around"" I recognized instantly and like ""Everlasting Love"" and an excellent retake of Dr.Buzzard's Original Savannah Band's ""Cherchez La Femme"" basically add contemporary digital electronics while maintaining the strong disco era rhythms of the originals. ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"" and ""It's Too late"" find her dealing with her jazzy side-taking full advantage of her vocal range in the process.After hearing this? It's probably going to be one of my favorite cover albums. There are many things I appreciate about Gloria and Emilio's musical and vocal arrangements on this album. The songs that require a lot of that receive it,the ones that are more about subtle shadings don't. Have the impression that she probably sang these to herself over and over again for years before doing this album. One of the other qualities that make this appealing for this sort of album is that many of the song selections showcase just how much Afro Cuban percussion was actually present in a good deal of the 60's pop that's on here,and that man Americans grew up on. I really appreciate the fact this album bought that out in this particular manner. And it's a major source of it's appeal for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIOVDT0FGPVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001546PGI#wasThisHelpful","R1TIOVDT0FGPVX","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since I first heard anything about this 1973 release? It was always understood to be the Van Morrison album that was the most difficult to find. Especially on CD. For years it was something I would be searching for during many a grate digging session and come up with nothing. Finally managed to locate the vinyl at Dr. Records near where I live. A couple of weeks later? My main record haunt Bull Moose got a used copy in on CD. This is one of things that totally shocked and surprised me. Over the years,I've heard nothing but positive things about this album. Even from people who were not ardent ""Van fans"" as it were. So was very excited about the musical treasures to be found within.  ""Snow In San Anselmo"" is a ballad with a gentle rhythm,some tasty rhythm guitar and piano improvisations along with Van vocalizing in his fragile higher range he uses for the majority of this album. ""Warm Love"" is a flute led mid tempo soul oriented number while the title has some of the horn based country soul balladry flavor of his previous couple of albums. ""Wild Children"" is a gently swinging bop jazz influenced number while the singer/songwriter pop-rock of ""The Great Deception"" with a surprisingly cynical outlook on the 60's counterculture. ""Bein' Green"" is interpreted in a bluesy manner similar to Ray Charles' version while ""Autumn Song"" paints a beautiful lyrical picture with an upbeat jazzy swing while ""Purple Heather"" extends lyrically on that theme with another country soul ballad.  What really separates this album musically from what came before it is that Van Morrison completely abandoned any idea of creating radio hits. He began to concentrate on jazzier forms-the Miles Davis-type idea that melody and the general hummability of a song could actually come from elongated songs with strong choral improvisations. These eight songs have the effect of all being very strongly crafted and singable without being confined to the 3-4 minute pop song format. The classical touch of strings and female vocal choirs courtesy of the Oakland Symphony Orchestra add heavily to this wonderfully composed and arranged album. One which I feel might be one of Van Morrison's very best of his 70's period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91G1QCKPZNBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002GNM#wasThisHelpful","R91G1QCKPZNBI","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having listened to and actually reviewed a great deal of Van Morrison over the past couple of decades now? Somehow feel that I haven't really given enough attention to the man's solo recordings of the early to mid 70's. This was basically where he honed and developed the sound that has made him famous for so many years. Interestingly enough? I found a lot of this music came in and out of print in almost too fast a state for me to really make a move on picking any of them up on physical media. Ended up finding this one used at Bull Moose,even though my father already had the exact same CD copy. It still feels like something more than worth having two copies of.  ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm In Heaven When You Smile)"" is a bright,beautiful example of a shuffling horn based R&B/soul number and one of my very favorite Van Morrison numbers-mainly because I love his uptempo soul numbers most of all. ""Gypsy"" and ""Redwood Tree"" are both more rocking soul oriented numbers built around both 12-6 string and rhythm guitars. ""I Will Be There"" is a sweetly swinging mid tempo blues while ""Almost Independence Day"" and the title song both focus on more elongated country/soul-folk style ballads built around the acoustic guitar and Morrison's renowned improvised vocal licks. ""Listen To The Lion"" takes this to the next level-adding a mild Calypso rhythm with a bridge featuring Van literally braying in the manner of an actual lion.  Musically this album seems to emanate from the same types of musical sources that had been at the very core of Van Morrison's creative ethic that had spawned his iconic Astral Weeks five years prior to this. By combining a selection of shorter,catchier and therefore more radio friendly songs with longer and more surreal musical selections? Van was able to provide a two sided window into his own creative process. It was one that could allow casual music lovers,as well as serious musicians and writers/scholars to be able to appreciate what he had to offer. And it's an album that even people with only a casual curiosity about Van Morrison's music should definitely seek out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234EREW4OLXHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002GNL#wasThisHelpful","R234EREW4OLXHP","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having seen and heard songs from It's Better To Travel over the years,along with used copies of the album in every format almost everywhere I went? There was a part of me that thought of Swing Out Sister as something of a one hit wonder who only had a small handful of albums. Not only isn't that the case. But it has nothing to do with what they represent musically,and creatively in general. This was an album that I only learned about after purchasing their first. It was their second release-and their last for the 1980's. Considering the technological changes in the rhythms of dance music between 1987 and 1989 when this came out? Wasn't sure what to expect of it. And came out extremely surprised on that end.  ""You On My Mind"" ""Heart For Hire"" and ""Precious Time"" are very basic pop/rock uptempo numbers with heavy orchestration on the choruses while ""Where In The World"" and the propulsive ""Waiting Game"" are both funkified dance numbers. ""Tainted"" and ""Between Strangers"" bring in the programmed shuffle rhythms of the new jack swing sound into their melodic dance grooves while ""Forever Blue"" is a piano and round drum beat based ballad with some beautifully crafted choruses. ""Masquerade"" brings in a very tribal Afro-Brazilian rhythm with acoustic sounding electronics and vast dynamics while ""The Kaleidoscope Affair"" and the epic jazziness of ""Cony Island Man"" go for elaborately arranged instrumental soundscapes. Instrumental versions of ""Precious Words"",""Masquerade"" and a string mix of ""Forever Blue"" all emphasize the same spirit.  While sharing many things in common melodically with their first album? Swing Out Sister elected to go for a very different musical approach for this album. The arrangements here are,for the most part,far more dramatically arranged and orchestrated. While there are a couple elements where the drum programming of the period did show up rhythmically in the songs? The overall sound has a lot more to do with the song craft and general approach of 60's easy listening jazz pop/soul/bossa nova that one might hear from the likes of Burt Bacharach,Quincy Jones,Herb Alpert and Henry Mancini. The presence of the thick,punchy analog recording style helped to bring their growing musical sound even further into focus for a creatively powerful sophomore album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EA6X9U1U55WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001FQC#wasThisHelpful","R1EA6X9U1U55WG","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite only knowing a couple of their songs from the radio? I always had a strong affinity for this particular group. That isn't surprising considering my interest at the time in Sade,Level 42 and later discoveries of Basia and Lisa Stansfield from this era as well. The UK jazz/funk/soul scene of the mid to late 80's added strong melodic pop-craft sensibilities and different elements of contemporary instrumentation into the mix. This particular approach to has stuck with that particular scene to the present day-with different eras adding less or more retro styles depending on the reception from the people. This album hit the first decade of that scene about smack dab in it's center.  ""Breakout"" is the song I know best from this album-filled with disco friendly bass synths along with jazzy funk,horn and string fueled choruses and refrains. ""Twilight World"" has an even more sophisticated orchestral mix,but's it's the accenting percussion that really brings the spark of life up from it's bottom. ""After Hours"" has a minimal rhythm with a jazz suite like melody and spacey synths while ""Blue Mood"" is a thick,uptempo 80's funk number while ""Surrender"" again turns the percussion and orchestration for a slower groove. ""Fooled By A Smile"" and ""It's Not Enough are a direct cross between both of those songs while ""Communion"" is a Brazilian electronic jazz mid tempo ballad while ""Theme From It's Better To Travel"" is one of the best uses of MIDI themes to recreate late 60's cinematic soul.  This CD edition of the album contains four bonus tracks with extended vocal/instrumental renditions of ""Breakout"",a version of ""Surrender"" with a full mock American accent monologue. It ends with a haunting instrumental of ""Communion"". Of the movement this album was a part of? This brings in two important elements of it's own into it. One is the 80's Euro Dance touch,with the pulsing disco beats and bass synthesizers along with the arrangements. And as for them? The album is given a strong contemporary jazz orchestra flavor about it. Something like what a Duke Ellington or a Gill Evans might've done with digital instrumentation of this period. In addition of having superb pop smarts and a great funkified dance ethic? This album looked to accomplish a lot musically,and really succeeded at doing so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KSLAOOAVU153/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001FMC#wasThisHelpful","R2KSLAOOAVU153","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the past five or six years? I spent so much time re-exploring the 80's era Spyro Gyra that I had missed completely the first time around...that I flat out neglected to dig into the 1990's era output. During these years there was a wonderful CD/DVD/video game resale shop in my area called Edge. They aren't in operation any longer. But I managed to find several of this bands CD's for that latter decade there. Still don't have them all,and doubt if I ever will of course. And what little gaps there were I filled in at Bull Moose. This was one of those cases. One where reviews from right here helped guide me to. As it turns out? This was an all around good decision.  ""Pipo's Song"" is a gentle uptempo salsa built around the sax and still drums-giving both the Spanish and more rock oriented guitar each a chance to solo on two separate refrains. ""Breathless"" is a anfaring  fusion/funk groove introduced by a melodic piano solo. The swinging bossa of ""Real Time"",with it's bluesy horn voicings begins in a similar fashion-only with the marimba. ""Jennifer's Lullaby"" is a gentle Spanish guitar/piano based ballad dedicated to the late Stan Getz. ""Whitewater"",,the title song,""Gliding"",""Cabana Carioca"" and Rollercoaster are all multi sectioned Latin jazz/rock fusion numbers with bursts of horns while the smooth ballad ""Inside Your Love"" and the slap bass heavy funk of ""Nothing To Lose"" round out the album.  From about the early 90's to the early years of the millennium? Electric jazz/pop/funk/fusion somehow ended up becoming mired in the ""smooth jazz"" style-really a studio production method rather than a specific genre that became musically stifling and,to some gave the instrumental electric jazz spectrum of music a controversial reputation. This album is extremely melodic,well played on and rhythmically propulsive as any Spyro Gyra album. Yet it is completely devoid of any such production values. The album has a pronounced Brazilian jazz/rock fusion air about it all that's very live instrumental oriented-sounding like a band playing together all the way in a similar manner to their Breakout album seven years prior to this. An excellent early 90's release from this already iconic contemporary jazz band!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSZ8DE76EBQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000001S5#wasThisHelpful","R1JSZ8DE76EBQL","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somehow or other I ended up getting this CD pre owned-during a time where in which I was totally obsessed by anything they happened to be musically involved with. Always finding out new things I appreciate about them in that regard. On it's own terms? Gladys and the Pips started the 80's decade very strong with their Columbia debut in About Love,an album I have on vinyl and consider to be one of their very finest releases actually. Interestingly enough? I learned of that and got it sometime after picking up this album. So am lucky to have a somewhat broader context with which to listen to this now.  ""I Will Fight"" and ""Baby,Baby Don't Waste Your Time"" are swinging,uptempo soulful shuffles full of rhythmic bass/guitar interactions and spacey synthesizer accents. ""If That'll Make You Happy"" and the string filled ""Changed"" are both rich,harmonic ballads with  ""A Friend Of Mine"" being a richly orchestrated mid tempo number with the jazzier ""Love Was Made For Two"" is a highlight for me. And that strength continues onward with the organ drenched contemporary gospel of ""God Is"",the boogie dance number ""Reach High"" and a version of ""I Will Survive"" that concentrates on being more of a piano ballad before briefly going into a Broadway style of gospel drenched disco.  One of the most significant things to be said about this album is that it set the group up with fellow Motown alumni Ashford & Simpson for the majority of the production. They understood Gladys and the Pips' strong Southern gospel/soul funkiness. And how to bring that into the new 80's decade and it's electronic instrumental interests without destroying any of the qualities that made the group what they were. The end result is another album the strikes an optimum balance of slickness,soul and musical eyes that never take sight off of the groove. And the fact that this ethic would essentially be the one this group would follow until their late in the decade breakup says a lot for the understanding they have of their talents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G1E22UTCA6D9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000025LJ#wasThisHelpful","R3G1E22UTCA6D9","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While always having an enormous appreciation for the unique flavors that Spyro Gyra bought to their type of melodic jazz fusion music? There are still many albums from their ""classic"" period which I do not have. And up until today? This 1982 album topped that list. Of course as with many such cases? There have been ample opportunities for me to pick this album in many formats,seeing as it's such a commonplace used item in my particular neck of the woods. Today I actually picked up the CD...in Dr. Records where I found the exact same copy there over a decade ago. And at this point? Am more than thankful that I at last had the opportunity to give this album a chance.  ""Last Exit"" is a bouncy pop/funk jam full of hot horn choruses,solos and strong rhythmic changes with grooving bass/guitar interactions on the bridge. ""Old San Juan"" is built upon gentle guitar and whistling before going into a spirited,Spanish tinged horn fanfare. ""Harbor Lights"" and ""Sueno"" are slow ballads built around glistening electric piano and sax while ""Stripes"" is a stomping,soulful uptempo number built around bluesy guitar and harmonica. ""Oasis"" is a pulsing  funky number built around some of the most thoroughly jazzy instrumental solos from all ends as the title song builds that impulse forward to it's heaviest Afro Brazilian ends. ""Soho Mojo"" ends the album with another sprightly and melodic uptempo theme.  One thing I'll say for this album right away? It thoroughly explores live instrumentation on every type of song featured on it. A good number of these songs really showcase the bands jazziest chops-with the big band Caribbean flavored choral horns blend with the pulsing bass/guitar and keyboards for some truly spirited musical conversations. At the same time? Their renowned concentration on melody and general build is present in every song. Very much like it's predecessor? This album has it's share of unexpected turns. Which proves something I've always held about this band: that Spyro Gyra come across very very differently as an album oriented group as opposed to a singles oriented one. And this album really captures that spirit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8JMHB2XFX1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001O7O#wasThisHelpful","R3F8JMHB2XFX1H","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As it turns out? Bobby Caldwell here is an artist who first came to my attention in a music matching online search I was doing. And it's been largely via the web that I've been exposed to his music thus far. During the last several years? The albums from his prime period in the late 70's and early 80's have become more and more scarce to come by. Luckily earlier this year? I managed to locate a used copy here at an inexpensive price. And this was the album that I most wanted to hear from him because it's his first,and contained the song most associated with him. All told,no disappoints at all!  ""Special To Me"" and the faster, jazzier guitar oriented ""Love Won't Wait"" are both Philly style uptempo dance numbers that are orchestrated with sweeping disco strings and percussion. ""My Flame"" is a gentle mid tempo ballad while ""Can't Say Goodbye"" has a stronger funk stomp about it with Caldwell's powerful vocal croon heavily reverbed for the occasion. ""Come To Me"" is a melodic piano ballad in a Stevie Wonder/Elton John vein whereas the title song,his signature song is as great example of slower jazz/funk/pop as I've ever heard. ""Kalimba Song"" is a gurgling bass and...kalimba driven funk instrumental whereas the West Coast friendly pop/soul ballad of ""Take Me Back To Then"" and the liquid jazz/pop of ""Down For The Third Time"" round off the album.  From what I've been hearing listening to this album a few times already? It is likely going to end up among my very favorites. A crack multi instrumentalist,singer and songwriter? Caldwell excels at being able to balance his talents as a rhythm king and song constructivist in a very appealing way. Musically he picks up on some of the most vital soulful oriented sounds being innovated at the time. Everything from uptown disco/soul to heavy Afrocentric funk-especially with his use of Kalimba which outside Earth Wind & Fire's Maurice White was not at all common at the time. The entire album just has a unique instrumental sound and is matched to a talented and passionate vocalist who is still happily makng wonderful music to this very day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYAKZEX884SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001PGZ#wasThisHelpful","R2CYAKZEX884SZ","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First time I ever saw this album,or this artist was when a DJ who had a jazz and funk based radio show at a local college station showed me this on vinyl. He frankly pointed out the only reason he actually had the copy was because of the presence of musicians such as Stanley Clarke and Jan Hammer-both of whom we had a mutual admiration for. A little under a year ago,I located this album on CD at the local record store Bull Moose. And was very excited by the opportunity to be able to hear this album. Even though it came to me with some significant gaps in Buchanan's catalog in my personal collection. Still happy to hear it nonetheless  ""The Heat Of The Battle"" begins the album with a fast paced shuffle with blends a strong bass/guitar jazz-rock fusion sound. ""Hidden"" meanwhile is a yearning melody filled with rich orchestration featuring classic strings. ""The Circle"" is a very direct early 70's style Stonesy rocker which makes use of huge female vocal choirs on each chorus. ""The Adventures Of Brer Rabbit And Tar Baby"" is a bluegrass duet between Buchanan's guitar and Clarke's electric bass. ""Ramon's Blues"" is another slow crawling...well just what it says it is while ""Green Onions"" gets a significantly more rocked up interpretation than the original.  ""Judy"" is a thick,dense mid tempo jazzy piece while ""Done Your Daddy Dirty"" is a shuffling,hard edged number. The album ends with the fusion vocal ballad ""Your Love"". One of the first things I noticed about this album is how different the playing is from Roy himself. He comes at his guitar with much more of a loud,hard rocking attack here. The cleanliness of his general tone is still apparent however. Not sure if the intensity of his playing here had to do with the influence of arena and punk rock of the late 70's. But the presence of jazz oriented musicians-including also Narada Michael Walden,give the overall production a slick veneer to the crisper instrumentation. A very unique and potent album again representing this artist at the peak of his powers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROU0XRPWE9OFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00091SMQO#wasThisHelpful","ROU0XRPWE9OFK","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was probably about eight years or so ago that I first picked up Roy Buchanan's debut album on cassette tape at the local Goodwill. It was a very enjoyable album,one which I fully intend to pick up on CD in the near future. However browsing the internet on recommendations for good albums from Buchanan's catalog? This one actually came into mention. Turns out it's his second solo album (and actually titled as such) from 1973. Was lucky enough to pick it up on CD. And was hoping it would live up to it's reputation. In short order,it did-and then some!  ""Filthy Teddy"" opens the album with a piano fueled groove while ""After Hours"",Five String Blues"" and the jazzier groove of ""I Won't Tell No Lies"" (probably my favorite hear with it's early Steely Dan-like attitude) are all generally slowed down blues shuffles. ""Treat Her Right"" adds a surf rock attitude and a vocal from the man himself on this classic interpretation. ""Tribute to Elmore James"" goes for a gritty uptempo shuffle while the closer ""She Once Lived Hear"" is a moaning,bouncing slow country & western ballad to close out the album.  Overall this is a fantastic album-easily equal to,perhaps even stronger than his debut. It emphasizes instrumentals primarily. And one of the most important elements of his guitar playing technique. Roy Buchanan plays with an enormous level of feeling-making a lot of use out of tension and crying sustains. But the quality of his tone means that he is also one of the cleanest players in what I'd refer to as the blues-rock/power blues genre of music. It was something that seemed to have peaked during the early 70's. And this album is a key part of the more instrumental end of that movement by one of it's strongest musicians.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17P3OPEQI1GEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001FLH#wasThisHelpful","R17P3OPEQI1GEN","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I've said before? Dan Fogelberg is musically pretty new to me in terms of his albums. Especially when it comes to his earlier work. Somehow or other from what I was hearing of him? Seemed better to not necessarily follow his album in chronological order. And just go for the ones that sounded strongest through the miracle of online/in record store digital song previewing. This came to me through such a situation. And as with every album I've heard by the man thus far? It has it's own kind of musical flavors.  ""Aspen/These Days"" opens the album with a string intro that goes into a slide/acoustic guitar led mid tempo pop/rocker with a steady,marching beat. ""Comes And Goes"" is a gentle,acoustic calypso while the title song is a wonderfully crafted pop number-with multiple Beatle like sections to it. ""Old Tennessee"",""Next Time"" and the closing ""The Last Nail"" are all sweetly melodic,acoustically derived ballads while ""Man In The Mirror/Below The Surface"" and the uniquely chorded ""Crow"" are two more multi-faceted pop rockers.  One of the things I notice about Dan Fogelberg's lyrical concerns is that he's very analytical about his explorations of...what would seem to amount to baby boomers in their adult romantic relationships. And on this album? The music really fits that sense of emotional built. Many of these songs have very orchestrated movements to them. And while not exactly a concept album? There is a wonderful flow to it all. With everything fitting together so well? I would not recommend this as anyone's first album by him. But it's not a bad one at all to take a listen to shortly after discovering him at least.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CX1ONGW57UU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012GMZB8#wasThisHelpful","R2CX1ONGW57UU4","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For many years of my life? I knew only of Dan Fogelberg as an artist who had a few pop hits when I was a little boy whose names don't quite come to mind. But probably know them well upon hearing them. Then he died about eight years ago. One of the things about me,when I'm not greatly familiar with their musical catalog? Seems best to start from the beginning. Unless of course such a debut is not recommended from a huge number of different sources. This 1972 album seemed by such standards to be an ideal place to start. Though it's actually the second album by him that I'll be reviewing however.  ""To The Morning"" is an entrancing melody led by acoustic piano,strings and Dan's ethereally high vocal harmonies. ""Stars"",""Be On My Way"",""Hickory Grove"",""Looking For A Lady"" and ""Wysteria"" are all similar types of songs-only built around the acoustic guitar. ""More Than Ever"",""Long Way Home (Live In The Country"" and ""Anyway I Love You"" are all pedal steel guitar fueled country-rock numbers that again emphasize strong song construction. ""Hickory Groove"" and in particular the closer ""The River"" both emphasize swelling musical arrangements that go right along with these epic ballad melodies.  While there are some songs here that work better than others for me personally? I think this was a wonderful debut album for Dan Fogelberg. He's surely in the singer/songwriter mode of focusing squarely on his compositions. But for the most part he places them in gentle settings,where even the strings create something elegant and beautiful. Some of the drum tracks on the uptempo numbers give me to wonder if this CD edition wasn't remixed slightly. Whether that's the case or not? And despite it's lack of commercial success at the time of release?

"During the time I was first becoming aware of Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band? One of the things I came to understand is that it's band leader August Darnell eventually decided to shift the priorities towards actually having a trio of female backup vocalists rather than a female lead singer. The results were the Coconuts. And Darnell apparently re-christened himself Kid Creole. This 1980 album was discussed in the reading I was doing as being an important transitional album. Al the same? Took awhile to locate it in a used vinyl bin. And today am very happy I did.  ""Mister Softee"" starts off the album with an upbeat pop/funk number led by tingly percussion and a low rhythm guitar. ""Maladie D'Amour"" is a finely orchestrated disco friendly mid tempo soul stomp-with some rhythm guitar and clavinet riffing on the refrains. ""Yolanda"" and ""Darrio"" are deeply grooving boogie numbers with some wonderfully processed bass/guitar on the former while the title song is a stripped down calypso with a distant,echoed vocal lead. ""Lil Marlene"" combines the boogie and calypso influences together while ""Bogota Affair"" has a strong salsa pop flavor. ""Calypso Pan American"" ends the album with a vibraphone charged boogie rhythm yet again.  One thing about this album I noticed immediately is that,for the most part it goes right for the jugular of the Afro-Latin,percussive pop/funk sound,with a harder rhythmic stomp than the more sweetly orchestrated music of Darnell's original group. It was as I'd read a transitional album. There are some disco era elements of this album. But for the most part? This album has a more mic'd and raw production style than the extremely slick studio sound that it very easily could have very well with. In terms of the songwriting? It's definitely leaning towards shorter pop structures as well. So it comes down to being an excellent introduction for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D24LP8TEAVBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DG028#wasThisHelpful","R3D24LP8TEAVBE","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was on the same disco compilation where I first heard Imagination and Teena Marie that this group came to my attention. Found a compilation which merged their first two albums on the BMG Music Service in the late 90's. But it was a few years later that I discovered they had a third and final album out,which was released in 1979. August Darnell,Andy Hernandez and company always had one of the most telling and witty storytelling content in the lyrics to their music. With their second album being a bit more musically experimental in nature? They decided to adapt from where they'd started just as they were about to come to an end.  The entirety of the first side consists of ""Didn't I Love You Girl?"",""Call Me"",""New York At Dawn"" and ""R.S.V.P"". All four of these songs hold together as something of an extended musical sweet consisting of a percussive,danceable stomp as well as the horns (both muted and otherwise) and both solo/choir vocals wavering in and out of the basic mix throughout. ""The Seven Year Itch"" is an extended number which is quite a lot more on the funk side-with it's churning rhythm guitar and bass interaction. ""Once There Was A Colored Girl"" returns to that hurdy gurdy organ grinder approach of some of the songs from their last album while the closer ""Italiano"" blends the big band and funkier musical flavors.  From the way I hear this? The album does musically what it apparently set out to do. That is successfully merging the big band jazz flavors of their debut with the more pan ethnic influences of it's follow up. What comes out of it is the idea that the members of this group basically understand how many strands of American popular music-whether deriving from Latin countries or within the disco sound itself,all have an enormous degree of Afrocentric origin points to them. Because of the heavy reverb and awkward mixing of some of the lead and backup vocals on this album? The lyrics are not always particularly easy to make out. But from what I can here? There are references to racially troubled romances and culturally biased musical appropriation on this album. All I can say is I am glad this wasn't the end for Mister August Darnell!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JD8EQCW0T8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L81507S#wasThisHelpful","R30JD8EQCW0T8H","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When growing up? Songs such as ""Stepping Out"" and ""Breaking Us Into"" were 45's in constant rotation on my family's turntable. Many years later a friend of mine explained to me that a local gay men's choir he was a part of actually performed the entirety of this albums predecessor  'Night And Day' one time. Had no idea the scope with which that 1982 album reached people so personally-both in the musical and thematic sense. On this follow up two years later? Jackson upped the ante by paying tribute to classic Blue Note album art for the famous Sonny Rollins collection Vol 2 and bringing in many new members to his big band for the album as well.  ""The Verdict"" opens the album with a big one/two drum wallop with the trumpets and flugelhorns accenting each beat before the piano based main melody kicks into gear. ""Cha Cha Loco"" is an elaborately arranged slow crawling salsa while ""Not Here,Not Now"" and ""Be My Number Two"" are a stripped down piano and percussion based melody with liquid bass accents. ""You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)"" is a horn packed and wonderfully crafted funk/jazz jam with a thick,busy bass/guitar and horn chorus interaction. ""Go For It"" has a bouncy 60's Motown beat with call and responses blending punk and gospel approaches.  ""Happy Ending"" is a Brill Building style pop duet with Elaine Caswell while ""Loisaida"" and the closing ""Heart Of Ice"" are both enormously cinematic instrumentals built around fanfares of keyboards and horns. This album definatly expands on the melodic live band flavor introduced so strongly on it's predecessor. The difference on this album is the the horns take on a far higher priority. Not only that,but little of the music here has anything even remotely radio/commercial friendly by mid 80's pop standards. Joe Jackson was seeming to be re-writing the music books-creating music for the listeners and the live show that followed this release more than anything. Even though that tour exhausted the man into a brief hiatus musically? This is still a prime example of his musical talents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROYWHQZVY75KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000026GZF#wasThisHelpful","ROYWHQZVY75KR","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since my days as a member of the BMG Music Service? I've been seeing one write up after another about this classic rock album from 1971.  Often popular songs from it were referred to over and over again. Yet I'd personally never heard any of them before. As I later became aware of the AOR sub genre of music? It started to make sense why that might've been the case. In the end? I never actually purchased this album in any format. It came my way via a grad bag of old loose CD's our local record store were selling at one time. Surprised to find such an album that way. And even more surprised when I actually took the time to listen to it.  What really makes this album stand out for me is Ian Anderson's use of flute. Especially on songs such as ""Hymn 43"". Musically and lyrically? It does a good job of bridging the psychedelic and progressive rock era. Not to mention the themes of religious institutions in England overshadowing the actual word of god itself,plus the poverty and crime that eventually comes out of class systems. Musically however? I had a hard time understanding how this could be a classic album. The bluesy electric guitar and folksy acoustic ones are of a playing and melodic style I've heard in rock over and over again. And in all due honesty outside the opening title song? The song craft is not particularly strong for me either. Still in terms of story songs and in terms of transition? I can sort of see why this is important.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNIB2MT4LZ17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003JA9#wasThisHelpful","R1LNIB2MT4LZ17","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Personally have my own outlook on the cultural transitions of the late 80's into the early 90's. Expressed it in many different ways. Yet at the same time? It was certainly an interesting convergence for those involved. The original and even post punk artists were now 30 somethings. And life would go on. That being said? 1987 was one of those big years for now classic albums from that decade. Prince had his Sign O The Times,Springsteen his Tunnel Of Love,Michael Jackson his Bad,Fleetwood Mac's Tango In The Night and..the list goes on. So it would seem U2 made their own contribution to this. Generally whenever I heard of the band? It was this album and the hits contained within that are mentioned. Yet tonight is the first time I've heard it.  The opening three songs on this album ended up being a lot more familiar to me than I could've imagined. ""Where The Streets Have No Name"",""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" and ""With Or Without You"" all take that stripped town ringing,rhythmic guitar melodicism really bought out in their last two albums to their highest level of well crafted musical beauty. ""Bullet The Blue Sky"" has a very confrontational,bluesy style guitar and drum thudding stomp about it while ""Running To Stand Still"" is one of the bands most eerily quiet melodies. ""Red Hill Mining Town"" takes that same approach to a somewhat more high key approach while ""In God's Country"" continues in the direction the album started off in as does ""One Tree Hill"".  ""Trip Through Your Wires"" has a hard power blues shuffle while ""Exit"" and the closer ""Mothers Of The Disappeared"" are both rhythmically and melodically discordant songs where instruments and samples alternate to sound like found sounds at a moments notice. Both lyrically and musically? This album picked right up where it's predecessor's left off. Interestingly enough? It also has two very distinct moods about it. It starts off with it's most listener (would not necessarily say immediately radio) friendly songs-with their strong choruses and melodies. While later on in the album? As the lyrical content grows less certain and more probing? The instrumentation and arrangements split apart into near incoherence. In some ways? I personally prefer it's two predecessors. Yet this album reveals itself to have more to it with each listen. And that is usually the mark of what makes a classic pop album,","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10X3MTND28WXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WS4PCO#wasThisHelpful","R10X3MTND28WXO","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even before I was really aware of their music? A neighbor who was a close friend of the family was a major U2 fan. So heard more about them than actually HEARD them to be honest. Somehow their hits probably zoomed right past me with radio listening at the time. During the late 90's/early 2000's however? I was also becoming very aware of Daniel Lanois and his work with Bob Dylan. Not to mention Brian Eno's understanding of how to harmoniously combine melody and harmony. Through the now defunct BMG? I found this 1984 album in which both artists were involved in assembling it. It was one of the first U2 studio albums I ever purchased. And in many ways a personal favorite of mine today.  ""A Sort Of Homecoming"" opens the album with a massive swell of tribal percussive rhythm matched by the Edge's like minded sheets of high pitched guitar strumming. ""Pride (In The Name Of Love)"" takes this song into a much slower and pop song craft based approach while the funky groove of ""The Wire"" and the title track have a strong,sleek and heavily reverbed new wave danceability. ""Promenade"" strips things down to bare bone guitars and feather like drumming. Same goes for ""4th Of July"",""Bad"",""Elvis Presley & America"" and the meditative closer ""MLK"". Meanwhile ""Indian Summer Sky"" adds a strong rocking snarl to the basic rhythmic sound the album provides.  One thing I appreciate about U2,especially during the early/mid 80's,is how much they embraced what amounted to highly tribal ideas into their sound. Bono's vocals and songwriting are of course very poetic. Being something of a instrumental fan? Especially in terms of how it builds a song in general? It's the Edge's...well really Afrocentric use of guitar as a massive rhythmic element that really creates the bands signature sound for me. And this album is probably one of the very best examples of this sound-operating at about the full peak of it's power. For whose of you unfamiliar with U2's album? I recommend this and it's predecessor as good examples of their basic sound in terms of how it projected in the studio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2P2F3KVGVXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002J8LVO0#wasThisHelpful","R1A2P2F3KVGVXI","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just realized while listening to this album for...I believe the fourth full time tonight? I don't actually have a good chunk of Rick James's original studio albums. Even a few of his classic ones. It's all a matter of relative rarity than anything of course. All the same? This actually came to me via a lot of his vinyl ordered off ebay about a decade ago now. During that time? This was understood from most of my reading to represent Rick's musical and personal nadir in the mid 80's. So honestly wasn't exactly expecting anything special. Several run through's and a bit more experience on the artist later? This comes through with more clarity.  ""Can't Stop"" begins the album with a stripped down,straight up bass/high synth and lead guitar oriented new wave dance style number. ""Spend The Night With You"" has a thumping dance-pop vibe about it-with it's simple rhythm guitar and dinging keyboards. ""Melody makes Me Dance"" has a funky hand clap powered rhythm,again built around the bass synth and an almost folksy blues guitar riff. ""Somebody (The Girls Got)"" is a powerful naked funk number filled with Vocoder refrains. The title song is basically a mid 80's update of Rick's 70's era Stone City Band sound-with period electronics while ""Moonchild"" is a shuffling,somewhat jazzy funky soul number.  ""Sha La La La La (Come Back Home"" is a sax and slap bass fueled ballad as the ultra funky,live band style ""Rock N Roll Control"" ends the album followed by a brief reprise of the title song. Overall? This album presents some of Rick's most thoroughly dance/rock oriented music. The electronic keyboards and drum machines give this album a cooler feel than the usually steely live band ""punk funk"" sound he pioneered only a few years before this. But still this is album is chocked full of beautifully arranged funk/soul numbers as well. Not to mention some of the mans finest compositions and performances. True it's not as flamboyant a performance in general as one would expect from him-concentrating more on song than presentation. Still it's an album more than worth exploring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QA156SNU90FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UC6YD6#wasThisHelpful","R1QA156SNU90FH","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First time I ever saw this album was in a record shop in the city of Portland called Strange Maine. The front art depicted the artist in a scene from a specific episode of the original Star Trek series...whose title is actually also one of the songs on this album. So it was a buy it for the cover moment. When I heard the vinyl? And realized the great musical talent of Allan Holdsworth-former member of the New Tony Williams Lifetime? Well just had to find a way to get this on CD. And another local record haunt in Dr. Records helped me with that a couple years later. This is one of the more tough albums I have to review. But it's sooo worth giving a try at.  ""Non Brewed Condiment"" features a series of swirling and cascading electronic harmonies surrounded by deeply phrased melodic statement. ""Funnels"" seems to continue the them of downward motion with more of a swinging rhythm and a softly wailing guitar solo. ""The Dominant Plague"" is one of my favorites on this album. It has a stomping,tribal beat and a series of complex,intertwining melodies that make it one of the most ethereal and aggressive synth jazz/rockers I've ever heard.  The title song is a melodic fan fare with a higher pitched main theme while ""Looking Glass"" and ""Mr. Berwell"" both showcase Holdsworth's amazing soloing-with the latter going up in tempo from a slow,almost folkish beginning. Whereas the closing ""All Our Yesterdays"" (that Trek episode I mentioned earlier) is a cinematic ballad movement that has an uptempo fusion style conclusion.  While each song features a trio of different drummers and bass players? Holdsworth himself holds down as a guitar player and by introducing the Synthaxe,a unique and rarely produced type of MIDI synthesizer controller that allowed him to realize a certain quality in his playing that I could hear even on this album-without knowing anything else by him. His basic instrumental technique has a vocal,horn like phrase about it all. And with his know synth controller? He was able to realize that aspect of his sound with a new,exciting and often extremely beautiful tonal pallet. Sometimes the atmosphere and almost antispectic,other times flamboyantly futurist. Allowing instrumental experimentation to guide his compositions here allowed for great musical adventure and memorability. So I highly recommend this album. Especially to other musicians.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCGSA7IG0YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003BHY#wasThisHelpful","R3CCGSA7IG0YI","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somehow it hit me listening to this...just how much of my adult musical understanding comes out of the artistry of the late George Duke. Painted his portrait several times. Made a friend because of him,who had me speak to Duke himself on a radio show and later taught me how to play chords on the keyboard to the man's song ""Capricorn"". Obviously this is not the first time I've heard this particular album. It was the first record by him I ever heard of. And the first of his I ever saw sitting in the record store CD racks. It was a major album for the man career wise. So many jazz/funk lovers and fellow musicians have aurally eaten this album whole over the decades. So hear is what I hear when listening to it.  Opening up with the cinematic bass synthesizer of ""The Beginning"",the album goes right into the powerful guitar/bass interaction based jazz/rock fusion of ""Lemme At It"". Opening with a fanfare on the electric piano,""Hot Fire"" deals with some heavy duty Afro Cuban rhythms and melodies. The title track of course finds the classic half rapped/half sung slow bass synth funk stomp holding down what amounts to a ""P-Jazzfunk"" masterpiece. ""Just For You"" is a melodically complex pop/soul ballad with an electronically symphonic instrumental chorus. ""Omi (Fresh Water)"" and ""Diamonds"" are both kinetic,uptempo Brazilian fusion jams while ""Searchin' My Mind"" is an EWF like uptempo pop/funk number sung by singers Dee Henrichs,Deborah and Sybil Thomas.  ""Watch Out Baby!"" is a grinding hard funk stomp with the bass/guitar rhythmic chunkiness of Stanley Clarke and Michael Sembello leading the way. ""The End"" concludes the album similarly to how it began,while the additional unreleased bonus selection ""Bring It On Home"" deals with a down home bluesy soul instrumental. What George Duke and his extremely talented band of players does here is really quite amazing. For the last several years before this? He'd musically sought to locate and lock down the unifying rhythmic/melodic threads between jazz,soul,rock,blues and the music of Brazil. The unifying factor he discovered was a strong sense of musical Afrocentrism. And that's the quality that this album,across it's oozing mix of musical genres,possesses in abundance.

"While I am far from versed in the full intricicies of even old school hip-hop? It seems relatively rare for a rapper or group of rappers to have a debut album that is also a major musical game changer. But if happens in other genres,why not? Ever since I was a teenager? I kept hearing about the controversy surround Def Jam's first white hip-hoppers here. Yet continued to hear about their first album. For some reason as with many albums? I avoided it time after time. Ended up picking up a brand new copy at a local dollar store-sadly right around the time Adam ""MCA"" Yauch's passing. Having just listened to it? Feel like something was terribly missing in my understanding on my generation of hip-hop for not listening to it.  ""Rhymin & Stealin"" begins the album with a slow crawling,heavily reverbed beat leading the way. ""The New Style"",""She's Crafty"",with it's bluesy riff and ""Posse In Effect"" with it's laser beam type percussive sounds are all classic,stripped down early rap/hip-hop tracks of the mid 80's. ""Slow Ride"" features horns and Afro-Latin percussion replicating the instrumental chorus of ""Lowrider"" while ""Girls"" has a ringing,children's carnival style bounce. ""Fight For Your Right"" and ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" are both fierce guitar rockers showcasing the groups punk roots while ""Paul Revere"",""Hold It Now,Hit It"",""Brass Monkey"",""Slow And Low"" and ""Time To Get Ill"" blend their mix of rock,rap, funk/soul and TV snippets together into the beginning of it's own brew.  As a major production triumph for Rick Rubin? This album seems to represent the moment when the freedom expressed in the hip-hop genre began to take hold. In all truth? The trio's vocal delivery and lyrics are straight up frat boy juvenile at this point. So they don't possess the spacious topical word play of the Furious Five or even the poetic artfulness of De La Soul-for example. But the sonically heady musical mix is essentially the beginning of the journey that would culminate in a couple of years after this-with major iconic hip-hop releases featuring the Bomb Squad for Public Enemy and NWA. And in those cases with some of the genres most powerful lyrical assertions. So this album impresses me anyway by contrasting it's simplistic lyrics with music moving toward a stronger and complex instrumental mix.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I1XQE1D9KR01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000024JN#wasThisHelpful","R3I1XQE1D9KR01","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a newcomer to the music of John Klemmer? I seem to find myself with an usually large variety of albums to choose from in used record bins of all sorts. The album and song titles of this CD,which I've never personally encountered before,indicated that this was a Brazilian oriented project. Between albums by Earth Wind & Fire,Lee Ritenour and George Duke during the late 70's? The Latin bug seemed to be getting to many musicians in the most positive of way-expanding their rhythmic possibilities further into deep musical Afrocentrism.  As it turns out? This album is still a very powerful contribution to that particular ethic.  The title song begins the album with an upbeat melody based around the percussion,bouncing bass line,electric piano and flutes in addition to Klemmer's sax. ""Tropical Snowflakes"" is a gentle guitar based bossa while ""Heartbreak"" extends on that theme and is built around some spirited piano,string and accordion accompaniment. The Gershwin standard ""Summertime"" maintains that rhythmic idea as well-with easing transitions in tempo and mood. Same goes for ""Tender Storm"" and ""Copacabana"". ""Bahia"" slows the mood down just a bit. It's the closer ""My Love Has Butterfly Wings"" that really flies with it spirited Latin jazz/funk,uptempo majesty and Klemmer's intense improvisations that do indeed seem to take musical flight.  Overall this album is a bit different in flavor than many of the other Brazilian based jazz/fusion/pop projects I've heard from this era. While there's generally a tendency towards the slower melodic bossa nova throughout the album? On the occasions where the tempo goes up? Klemmer really showcases his talents as a jazz improviser. And is musically excited by the Afro-Latin percussive settings provided so ably by Alex Acuna,Airto Moreira and Paulinho Da Costa. Not to mention the bass of Abraham Laboriel and Lenny White providing some adventurous territory. While this is one only of two John Klemmer albums I've actually listened to all the way through? It's a very welcomed presence in my music collection,a favorite and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BZUG07Q7M9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000001PB#wasThisHelpful","R20BZUG07Q7M9A","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult for me to calculate exactly how many times I've seen this and other 70's era John Klemmer albums in vinyl and cassette budget bins over the years. Reason I didn't pick up any of them is because I simply didn't know anything about him. He was also recording in an era when there were at least two other major pop jazz sax superstars coming into their own. Managed to recently pick this on up an original cassette. A bright sky blue colored one no less. Am both surprised and impressed with what I've heard.  One of the things about this album that's the most interesting for me is seven of it's eight songs all carry such a flowing structure from song to song. Much in the manner of John Coltranes acoustic (and far far far more musically iconic) 'A Love Supreme'? There's a strong melodic sax them that runs throughout this album. And variating into different ones with each song. Rhythmically it's a light drum brushing tone-along with a heavily reverbed and processed Rhodes electric piano. ""Tone Row Weaver"" stands out as more unique-with it's upbeat reggae lilt.  With guests such as Larry Carlton,Dave Grusin and Jeff Porcoro? This album takes a very interesting turn for albums of that era. It's slow and ballad paced. Stripped down. Yet not overtly funky or abstract. Some people refer to it as the beginnings of the ""smooth jazz"" genre. Yet it has that rawer analog era production which gives it a gentle snap overall. Normally an album with such strong repetition wouldn't excite me. But essentially extending on the mellowest side of the Grover Washington Jr. school of smooth,sleek and soulfully melodic sax? This is part of a wonderful era for the pop jazz genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDEBHBZJOW43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000001XL#wasThisHelpful","R3NDEBHBZJOW43","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Truthfully,I've experienced the musical legacy of Traffic almost completely out of order. That may be a good thing. Since it allows the albums to stand out on their own merits,as opposed to solely on continuity from one to the other. This turns out to be their last,from 1974. For many years? I personally thought they were long over by the time. And pursuing solo careers as well. Of course this followed up it's excellent predecessor Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory. Have heard and reviewed that,and with all due objectivity? This album actually expands on and even betters that accomplishment on every level to these ears.  ""Something New"" begins the album with a gospel inflected country soul melody while the 11 minute ""Dream Gerrard"" goes from a slow,stomping piano based jazzy groove into a full on soul rave up in the second half of the song. ""Graveyard People"" is my favorite song on the album-a beautifully fluid jazz-funk number filled with spacey synthesizers,layers of rhythmic electric piano and pumping bass lines. ""Walking In Wind"" is a gentle piano/bass oriented funky soul stomp while ""Memories Of A Rock 'N Rolla"" is a slower churning psychedelic style number.  ""Love"" is a percussive,shuffling jazz/funk fusion number filled with melodic flute while the title song is a strong organ based soul ballad to conclude the album.  All of the elements I've ever heard in Traffic's music were leading in my mind towards clean funk grooves. And this farewell studio album offered that. Some of the members of this group would go on to work with Winwood on his solo debut at the end of the 70's. And considering the direction he'd pursue on that and after? This provides an excellent midway period in that way. Even though many of these songs represent a period when Traffic's music was getting longer in length? Everything has an extremely strong structure to it all that really allows the band members to stretch without losing sight of the groove and song craft. And that makes this a highly fitting finale to their legacy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JW7PM2GNALP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000096FSZ#wasThisHelpful","R3JW7PM2GNALP6","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As it turns out? The most interesting this about this album is that it's the very first CD by Traffic that I ever bought. Recommended to me by my father,after years of experiencing it on the original vinyl. And it's actually a comeback for the band-apparently following Steve Winwood's one off super-group Blind Faith. When I first heard this? I had no idea about the different transitions that the band,and music in general was fast taking during the years 1968-1971. Still found it a wonderful album during a period where my musical understanding was growing by leaps and bounds. Looking back on it now? Makes it even more wonderful for me to hear.  ""Glad"" starts the album with a spirited and percussive melody that slips through jazz,gospel/soul and Afro-Brazilian instrumentation-especially Winwood's sustained organ. ""Freedom Rider"" is a flute fueled psychedelic fusion number with some unexpected arrangements bringing it even more to life. ""Empty Pages"" is an electric piano fueled soul/funk inflected piece while ""I Just Want You To Know"" is an interlude that holds to that style. ""Stranger To Himself"" is a ""blues in technicolor"" example of psychedelic rock while the title song is an elongated acoustically oriented folk interpretation of the English standard.  ""Every Mothers Son"" is the slowest number on the album that essentially ties all the themes explored by the album together while ""Sittin' Here Thinkin' Of My Love"" is a slow piano pop/rocker. Both with and without the addition of the two excellent bonus tracks? Well it's hard for me not to be a bit partial to this album. That's because with this power trios talents from Winwood,Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi? They are able to bring the same strong level of instrumental and compositional ability and adventure that the jazz,soul and blues masters they admired had already innovated. This is probably both representative of their transition from the more psychedelic soul styles of their earlier music to their more jazz/rock based works of the new decade this originally premiered in. A true masterwork for everyone involved. And very highly recommended to anyone who appreciates strong musicality in rock 'n roll.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XW8I0L5UUCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000059T1E#wasThisHelpful","R1XW8I0L5UUCW","A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HU0B9XUEVHIM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Somehow they've figured out how to literally make it look like a laser light show with these red squiggly lights (reminds me of that laser looking windows screen saver) along with several other multi-colored lights moving around on the ceiling at the same time.It has 8 light modes. Each one turns on the different colored lights in different sequences. Sometimes it's all of the lights, sometimes it's just red or just green or just blue. Sometimes they flash, sometimes they rotate through the lights. To activate the different light modes you just press the big button on the front. Keep pushing it until you get to your favorite mode.The head itself rotates about 45 degrees so it can shine the lights directly straight up or at a wall at about a 45 degree angle.The light comes with an opaque lens cover as well that ""mutes"" the light show effect if you want to ""tone it down a bit"", but my kids like to leave it off in favor of getting the full grandeur of this thing. They like it so much that we've gone to rotating it between their rooms at night because they all want to use it. ""It's MY turn tonight for the light!"" they say with excitement! They seriously love this thing!Brightness:In a completely darkened room it shines pretty darn bright. Much brighter than a standard nightlight, so if you're looking for something more muted, this isn't it. It'll shine the lights on a ceiling in a room at day time with the blinds drawn (yeah, it's pretty bright). But my kids don't care one bit. They love looking at the light show it gives off. If you stick the opaque lens cover on it, it does help to tone down the brightness, but it's still pretty bright.It has a speaker!It comes with a headphone jack and an included headphone wire to plug into anything with a stereo plug. My kids always love to listen to music at night. We usually use a blue tooth speaker connected to one of our cell phones or just leave a cell phone in their room, but with this you can plug it right into your phone and pump music right through the light. There's two buttons on the unit to turn the volume up or down too. It's not the highest quality speaker, but it's not all that shabby either and can get pretty loud. There's a bit of distortion at the top end, but for putting a kid to bed, it's perfect!It turns itself off after a while.This feature rocks! While I think having a lightshow in my kids room is cool and all, I also don't want it going all night long. When I first plugged this in and tried it out the first night I found out Soaiy figured that out. It just turns itself off after so long (not sure how long, haven't bothered to time it yet). I love it! When it turns off it also turns off the speaker too. So your kids can go to bed with some nice soothing music along with a lightshow and then after so long it kicks off so your kid can fall asleep. I know it stays on longer than my kids stay awake because they've never complained about it ""going off"" and believe me, if it did while they were awake, I'd hear about it....""DAAAAAAAAAHHHHDDDDD!!!!"" Yep. None of that so far. Love it!Accessories:It comes with a USB charger style plug (reminds me of the one they send with kindles), a headphone jack, and a USB cable.I've used all of them and they all work great. One cool thing about this. Because it's powered by USB, you can even power it with one of those portable battery packs (ie. think outdoor camping or something). We used a small portable battery with it in the middle of a room one night and it was really nice to have that option. I can see using it at lots of events or parties and with a portable battery pack it'll go wherever you want. The cord on it is pretty long too. I'd say about 5-6 feet.Overall:I can't say enough good about this thing. My kids think it's the coolest light they've ever seen and that helps dad earn mega bonus points cause I'm the one that got it. It also has helped two of my kids who have a TERRIBLE time going to sleep, drift off to sleep much easier. So, if you've got a youngster that you'd like to soothe at night with a light show plus some music, grab this thing and hook it up and watch the grins! Or, if you have kids at all, I'm betting they'll love this thing! My kids are 12, 10, 7, and 5 and all 4 of them absolutely love it. Five full, well deserved stars across the board.

"This bluetooth speaker has really nice, rich, deep sound, but getting your device to connect to it can be somewhat tricky. Once you do get connected though, the sound is great. If you're willing to deal with the quirky interface, you'll be rewarded with some of the best sound in a speaker this size in this price range.Sound Quality:The REAL reason you buy a bluetooth speaker, right? It is for me. After owning and reviewing several bluetooth speakers I've come to realize that the driver size and box it's contained in make a world of difference on how well a speaker will sound. This one is in a fairly large box (4"" wide x 4"" deep x 2.5"" tall) and the sound driver fires out the front. I have to say I was honestly surprised at how rich the sound is out of this speaker. The bass is really nice, mids are well balanced, and highs are fairly well represented. Sound wise, it's a great speaker. It can also get really nice & loud too with very little distortion. As a speaker playing sound, it's really great. It's one of the bright spots on this unitBattery Life:Not really all that hot. On a full charge you can expect about 5-6 hours of music. However, it doesn't turn itself off like other bluetooth speakers do when it's not connected, so standby time is significantly less than other bluetooth speakers that I've used. It'll probably make it through about 10 to 12 hours on standby but not much past that at all. However, if you turn it off when it's not in use it'll last much longer. But I do wish it would just put itself to sleep.Interface:Buttons:|<< - goes back a song or starts a song over>|| - play or pause (also mutes the radio and mutes the line in)>>| - goes to the next song- - turns down the volume+ - turns up the volume (32 is as high as it goes)M - stands for Mode. You touch it to cycle through the different modes (Bluetooth Speaker/FM Mode/Aux Mode (if somethings plugged in)/MP3 mode (if you have a card plugged in on it)Ok. Let's get this out of the way. It's a ""touch sensitive"" interface, and no bones about it, it's terrible. It's slow to react and it's EXTREMELY finicky. I rarely use this word in my reviews, but I HATED the interface. Touch it once, nothing happens. Touch it again, then it reacts but it also executes what you previously touched too. ie. if you hit the M (which is for Mode), and nothing happens and you hit it again, then it finally reacts and now it's like you hit the button three times in a row and it cycles through all the modes, really fast. Changing channels on the radio, changing between Blue tooth mode & FM mode, increasing or decreasing volume, all of it just was super, super finicky. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't, sometimes it took on a life of it's own and went berserk. I REALLY didn't like the interface at all. Just give me solid buttons that click or something, but this ""touch sensitive"" interface is for the birds.FM Mode:This speaker features an FM radio built into it. It works, but if you don't have a USB cable plugged into it, it won't get any reception. The instructions really don't say much about using the radio either, so it's somewhat of a guessing game. When it's on, you can use the |< and the >| buttons to go from channel to channel, but without the USB cable plugged into it, you won't get any reception. I also pressed some buttons in a certain sequence and now it has a bunch of presets on it, but I couldn't tell you how I did it or what caused it and the instructions really don't tell you much about operating it. It's there. It works. Bring a USB cable though if you want to use it.AUX Mode:They supply a headphone wire to plug the speaker directly into a headphone jack. By far, this was the most reliable way to get sound to the speaker because it overrides all the other modes when the wire is plugged in. It worked well in this mode, but it kind of defeats the whole reason you buy a bluetooth speaker. But it worked greatConnecting via Bluetooth/NFC:This was a royal pain in the rear. I tried multiple devices too (LG G3, MacBook Pro, Nexus 7). The devices would see it, you'd attempt to connect and it'd just sit there. After about the 4th or 5th try it would finally connect. Only to disconnect a few seconds later. When I FINALLY got it to connect and STAY connected, the sound is awesome! But man, getting it to connect the first time is a beast with this thing! Also, if it drops the connection, it switches over to FM mode. Then you're back to messing with the super sensitive touch screen to try & put it back into Bluetooth mode again so you can re-try & connect. Yeah. Wasn't fun. But again, once you DO connect and if you're only connecting it to one device, it will usually stay connected, but that first couple of tries are a real duzy.NFC:I gave this a try. It works, but because you set your phone on top of it to get it to do it, the phone actually pushes the touch sensitive buttons and sends the thing into a tizzy. So, yep, it does connect via NFC mode, but don't touch your phone to the other buttons or else you'll be off in FM mode or some other thing.Language:This thing speaks in both English and Chinese. How do I know this? Because I accidentally kicked it into chinese mode while trying to get it to connect or get into the right mode. I THINK if you hold your finger down on M long enough it switches languages. After some fiddling with it I finally got it to speak in English again. It says stuff like ""Blue toos mode"", ""FM Mode"" ""Power is low, please charge"" and a few other things. (it's funny. It say's Blue tooth with a chinese accent. Kind of cute really). So if yours goes into Chinese mode, just hold the M down long enough and it'll switch back.Battery Charging:If you plug the big end of a USB cable into it, you can use it to charge up another USB device. I tried this out on my cell phone (LG G3). It worked, but it charges in ""slow charging mode"" (my phone even told me it was slow charging), so you can use it in a pinch, although the battery in the speaker is pretty small by itself (it's removable though. You install it in the bottom).Size/Appearance:It's about 4"" x 4"" x 2.5"" and weighs just under a pound. There are rubber pads on the bottom to keep it from sliding around too. I really liked the weight. Heavy enough to stay where you put it but not too heavy to move around. It's also pretty classy looking too!Included Cables:A USB to micro USB cable - worked great (use this as an antennae too)A line in cable - worked great, pretty long too. About the length of an average set of headphones.Overall:If you can get past the really quirky interface, the sound and volume level on this speaker is awesome! The FM radio isn't anything to write home about but it works. The battery life is less than other bluetooth speakers I've tested in this price/size/range. I really like the sound that this kicks out (it's up there with the best I've tried in this price range), but man, that interface drove me nuts. If you're planning to use it as your ONLY bluetooth speaker, it'd probably rock as once you've connected it, the next time you turn it on and the device you're connecting it to, it'll stay connected. But man can it be tricky getting it there. So overall I give it 3 stars. Sounds great, kind of a pain to get setup & use and I wish the battery life was longer.* I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for a review *","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WW4TB92P2RYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PZ1EGS#wasThisHelpful","R1WW4TB92P2RYV","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tested quite a few of these over the last while and I've gotta say this one's my favorite. Here's why.Compact Design:- Not overly bulky & easy to insert into the cig lighter. I've used and seen a lot of other ones that are just way too big for my liking or they're just really difficult to fit into tight spots on my power ports. This one is really small, really sleek, and just has a nice, simple designColor :- I know, that's preferential, but I really like the dark black color. They didn't load it up with cheesy graphics or color it orange or some stupid color, but instead left it classy black. It really blends in well in the van and doesn't make itself overly obvious. I really like that! Granted, maybe you're up for screaming, ""Hey look, I have a USB Car Charger in my cig lighter!"" with bright neon colors. I prefer the subdued route. Love it!Blue Light:- It has a blue light that comes on when it's running. I love that its there because it lets you know that it's powered. I have mine in a minivan with lots of kids and stuff up front. All of that ""stuff"" gets moved around a lot and bumps stuff I plug into the power ports. The fact that this thing lights up so I know that it's on when I need it is just a really nice feature that I loved having. It's a nice, subdued blue light too. Very classy! Again, loved it!It Works Really Well!- This is really why you buy these things, right? This one doses out a whopper of charge for my phones, tablets, bluetooth speakers, etc... I've been using it for almost a month now and have charged pretty much everything I own with a USB Charger cord on it and love how fast it works! I can stick my LG G3 phone on it and in about a half hour of driving I've juiced the phone up quite a bit. I've used it with an LG G3, a Moto G (1st Gen), a Nexus 7 tablet, a blue tooth speaker, and an iPod 7th Gen. All of them worked great on it.I Love The 4 Ports!When my kids are all in the car we definitely have more than 2 devices on going down the road. The fact that this thing can charge up to 4 of them all at once rocks! I get the extra long USB cables (love the braided 6 foot ones by the way!), run two to the middle seat with kids with electronics running and run the other two cords to my cell phone and the wifes. It powers them all and charges them up pretty quickly. It delivers 2.4 amps to each port too! I've used a few that have some ports at 2.4 and others at slower speed, but everything I own can handle the 2.4 amps going to it--so having that extra juice rocks!It Just Works!I love that there's no switches to mess with, no guessing which ports to plug the cables into (ok, now which one charges fast?), and no headache. It just charges like it should and it does a really good job of staying put in the power port.Overall:If you're looking for a nice, classy little car charger that doesn't draw attention to itself, isn't bulky, actually works, and delivers a full 2.4 amps to all 4 ports, then you'll love this one! However, if you're really into that neon green look that screams ""I'm cheap & made in china!"" by all means keep looking, this one's too classy for that.

"These are by far the most comfortable set of Bluetooth headphones I've tried to date. They also have extremely good sound to them too!Connecting to my LG G3 phone was a breeze (Man I love Bluetooth 4.1! It connects soooo much faster than bluetooth 3.0 and the battery life is way better!) and they actually have surprisingly good range (I set my cell phone down and walked into the other room about 30 ft away and they were still going strong). By far my favorite set out of all the ones I've tried.Connecting:This is by far the easiest set of blue tooth headphones I've ever used as far as connecting to my phone (LG G3) goes. Turned them on, turned bluetooth on on my phone, put it in search mode and BAM! There they were! They show up as Smart i8 with a headphone logo. Tap the logo and connecting is fast and easy. The headphones have a pleasant ladies voice that speaks IN CLEAR ENGLISH ""Connected"". (I can't tell you the number of headphones that either just ""beep"" to indicate they're connected or a broken chinese accented english voice attempts to tell me they're connected). The nice lady also says, ""Power On"" and ""Power off"" and ""Disconnected"" when you turn off bluetooth. If you go out of range she says, ""Out of range"". Ok. Back to connecting the headphones. Absolutely breeze! Also, when you power them down & power them up the next time they use them, they're really good at finding your phone again--and fast! I don't know what Bluetooth 4.1 is, but I know I REALLY like it!Battery Indicator:Apparently, Bluetooth 4.0 (and beyond) allows the headphones to display a battery indicator for the headphones on my phone. I love it! It's accurate too! Worked great!Buttons:MFC Button (Multi-function)Praise the Lord & sing Hallelujah! Someone FINALLY made the MFC button BIG! The whole side of the right headphone is one big honking button--and man do I love it! Push it to turn the headphones on, off, answer a call, pause a song, or go into connect mode. With the headphones on my head I could easily use the button, could reach for it, and could easily use it. Man, I can't say enough good about how NICE it is to finally have the button big enough to realistically use without fumbling aroundVolume Buttons:Located on the right hand side, they're somewhat on the smaller side, but they're still pretty easy to operate. I was able to easily turn the volume up or down with the headphones attached to my head. They don't ""beep"" when you push them, so you don't get any audible feedback like other sets I've used, however, they do beep when you hit the maximum or minimum volume levels; which I really like having.Range:This is one area these seem to excel over other bluetooth headphones I've tried. They actually STAY connected. You'd think with your cell phone in your pocket that a set of bluetooth headphones would stay connected, but I've had several disconnect. These, however, have been rock solid. Just for kicks I even set my phone down and walked about 30 feet away and still got a signal loud and strong. Pretty impressive!Sound:Probably one of the main reasons you buy a set of headphones. These things absolutely rock! The bass is nice, deep, and full, the mids come out really well, and the highs are crystal clear. I've been hearing instruments in songs with these that I haven't heard in other speakers or headphones in quite some time. Also, they get nice & loud! Loud enough that I easily need to knock them back a couple notches from max volume level. I really like that feature because if I get in a really crowded area where I need the extra volume I know it's there. Really, really impressive immersive sound though. The best I've heard in a set of blue tooth headphones; especially in this price range too.Comfort:Outside of how they sound, comfort is one of my biggest things I go for in a set of in ear headphones. If they aren't comfortable, I'm just going to wear them, regardless of how well they sound. These, however, are the absolute most comfortable set I've ever tried. I can literally wear them for hours on end without my ears hurting. Kudo's to whoever designed them to fit in the ear! Just really, really comfortable!Overall:I've reviewed several sets of bluetooth headphones. Most are ok, some are even a little nice, but none of them have sounded this good, felt this great, were this easy to operate, or worked this well. Hands down the best set of bluetooth headphones I've ever used. Granted, I don't go for the super premium ultra expensive ones--just not in my ballpark--but man, these things just flat out knock it out of the park. I really, really enjoy them and they're by far the first set I grab when I want to use blue tooth headphones.

"My mother absolutely LOVES these! She's already come up with several uses for them and has many more planned. They're much better than the others she's tried and loves how easy they are to write on, erase, apply, and remove from items. Just a great set of chalk labels! They totally deserve the ""Premium"" title in their name!Applying To Surfaces:She said they went on like a breeze. Just peel them off the cards, clean the surface, and stick these in place. We tried them on glass, plastic, and metal containers and they all went on easily and stayed on. Bonus points!Pen Use:The pen that comes with these works extremely well. It's a nice pointed tipped pen and writes on the labels really easily and very legibly. It's a nice, bright white too; which makes them easier to read.Erasing:These clean off extremely well and leave nothing behind. We cleaned them with a damp cloth and unlike others we used, these actually CAME CLEAN! In the past, others that we've tried leave a residue behind (think overly used chalk board) or they would smear. Not these ones. They cleaned off all the way to a nice, dark, clean slate every time. Writing back on them was a breeze too. We were really impressed!Removal:This is one area where these really do well. Others we've tried leave a really nasty, sticky residue behind or they tear when you pull them off, but these were really easy to remove and were easy to reapply to other surfaces. They did leave a hint of stickyness, but it was easy to wipe it off with a towel and it was completely gone. Unlike others that just leave a nasty residue, these come off really clean.Overall:My mom absolutely loves them! She's already started coming up with new uses for all of them and has had a lot of fun applying them to all sorts of containers. She's excited to use them for holidays too! You stick them on a little wooden stick and can set them next to food items to indicate what they are. It gives a little ""old fashioned charm"" to the meal and just looks cool. Value wise, these are great! They're inexpensive, they actually work and actually come clean when you want to reuse them, and can be easily removed and applied to other things. Plus, my mom, who's a doting grandma, is thrilled to be able to use them in all the crafts she does!

"My wife & daughter really like this shampoo. It's leaving their hair extremely soft and shiny. I've known of the benefits of coconut oil for several years using it for cooking and soap making so I was excited to try out Luseta's shampoo.I'm really glad I did too. The fragrance of this shampoo is incredible! It reminds me of coconut tanning lotion in a way, I really like it and so do my wife & daughters. The shampoo itself has a nice, thick texture to it as does the conditioner. This makes it go on nice and thick and because of the coconut oil in it, it lathers up extremely well.As far as it's effect on hair, my daughter absolutely loves what it does to her hair; making it nice & soft. Her hair is naturally on the oily side and being a teenager convincing her to wash it all the time can be a challenge, but with how nice it makes her hair feel, she's happy to wash it daily.Overall, it's a great shampoo and conditioner.

"These work really well! We got them to prune an out of control raspberry bush with and really, really were impressed with how well they did.Our raspberry bush had gotten really out of control and I knew I'd need a pretty good set of pruning shears to attack the plant. So, I gave these a whirl. Wow! Really, really nice! The ratcheting action on them is really cool. It ratchets down until it hits some resistance (big raspberry branch) and then it grabs and clips with as much force as you want to give it. When it snaps the twig in half it gives this very satisfying ""click"" too. Kind of an affirmation that you've clipped the thing all the way. Very cool!The clippers themselves are very comfortable to use and the grip works really well. We used it on various sized raspberry branches and it easily cut through all of them with ease. My wife said that they were really easy for even her to use.The clippers have a lock on them too to lock the blade shut for storing. It moves really easily into place & locks them tight.Overall we were really impressed with how well they worked and we now have a much more controllable raspberry patch now too!* I received this item in exchange for a review *","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OQ9W8EY2ZVDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH9TS9G#wasThisHelpful","R1OQ9W8EY2ZVDI","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These headphones have fairly good sound but they sound a bit bright to my ears. I listened to several different kinds of music on them and compared them to a set of MAXROCK (TM) Slim Flat Cable 3.5mm Metal Headphones with Mic In-ear Noise Isolating Headsets (Gray) as well as a 10 year set of inexpensive Sony MDR-CD180 CD Series Headphones with 30 mm Drive Units (Discontinued by Manufacturer) that I own.Sound Quality:The real reason for buying headphones, right?On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being extremely good and 1 being terrible, these are about a 7 to 8.Highs and mids are well represented, but seem to be lacking any depth of sound.Bass was there but not very rich or strong. Especially in comparison to the Maxrock's & Sony's; which both have much better bass response, richer sound, and immersive sound to them. The sound of the Sentey's on the other hand seemed to be coming from somewhat undersized drivers making the sound seem almost distant by comparison to the others. I didn't get the ""immersed in the music"" feel like the Sony's and the Maxrock's give me. Overall, they seem like a great set of bargain headphones, but if you're an audiophile, I'd opt for a higher quality headphone.Microphone:I placed a phone call with these connected to my LG G3 and the caller sounded extremely clear through the headphones and the caller said they could hear me extremely well as well.Cord:Seems to be a very well made cord with braided fabric surrounding it. The jacks to plug into both the headphones and the device you're listening to are also very robust. The plugs are also thin enough to plug into my LG G3 cell phone with a bulky case on it too. Bonus points on that front!The cord also has a button, a manual volume control, and a mic on it. The button pauses or continues a song or if you push it long enough it triggers the siri like program on an android. I tested the manual volume control and it worked really well. If you need to silence your music--and fast--nothing beats a manual control!Comfort:These don't feel overly bulky on my head and with the included case, they're a cinch to haul around. They were extremely comfortable to wear too--even more so than my older Sony's. Also, with the headband adjusted they stayed on my head really well too. I'm not sure I'd ride a bike with them or do something active with them on (in fact it even recommends against that in the included owners manual), but for casual listening or walking around with them on I think they'd stay on quite well.Build Quality:These things look darn near bulletproof. Really, really nice build quality The plastic on them feels nice & sturdy and feels like they could easily last for quite some time. The cushioning on the ears also looks to be high quality too. They don't feel too thin and have a nice, thick rich feel to them.Overall:I'd say they're definitely a 4 star set of headphones. They sound pretty good, they're comfortable to wear, they look to be build for the long haul and I love the foldability of them. I also really liked the case they came with.

"This is an awesome little battery powered lamp. We've been using it in our bedroom at night on it's lowest setting as an ambient light after all the other lights are off and it's absolutely perfect! Not too bright, but bright enough that you can see in a dark bedroom well enough where you're walking & going so you don't run into something.We placed it on our headboard and turn it on once all the other lights are out. We run it for about 3-5 hours at a stint on low and have been able to get about 3-5 days out of it before the battery needs to be charged back up.The light has 3 brightness settings.- Nice, low ambient light- Middle is a bit brighter (easy for one person to read a book by)- High beam is really bright. It easily lights up our bedroom about as much as our nightstand lamp doesSee my pictures. I took several of it on the different light settings.The light is a white light (I'd say about a daylight brightness, not soft-white). It weighs just over 6 ounces (180 grams), The base is 3 3/4"" wide x 2.5"" deep x 1 3/4"" tall. The neck with the light bar includes is just over 16"" long. The neck itself is extremely flexible and is easy to move into any position you'd like. However, if you stick the neck too far out towards the back, it'll fall backwards on you, so it does take a little adjusting if you want the neck to sit very far back. I found that I was able to easily adjust it to fit against the wall on our headboard just fine.The light bar itself has 7 LED lights in it that all come on when it's on.Controls:Pretty simple operation. Touch the round circle on top one for low, tap again for medium, tap again for high beam, and tap again to shut it off. It's extremely easy to use and reacts with the slightest touch. My kids had an absolute ball playing with it (""I wanna touch it next!"").Charging:It comes with a USB charging cable with an adapter plug on the other end. Kind of odd to have a round adapter plug vs a micro USB port like so many other USB chargable electronics, so don't lose the cable or else you won't be able to charge it up again. Charging seems to take about 2-3 hours from completely dead, but there's no indicator other than the brightness of the light once you unplug it to let you know if it has a full charge.One bonus is that when it is plugged in, the light works at full strength, so if you had a USB Charger and wanted to leave it plugged in all the time, it'll always be powered.Performance:It's extremely simple to use (touch to turn it on or off), easy to charge, gets nice & bright, the battery lasts a long time, and the neck is infinitely adjustable. You can even twist the lightbar itself almost 360 degrees to point it in whichever direction you'd like (think Mr Gumpy with a light in it--infinitely adjustable). It also stays where you adjust it too as well.Uses:We used it primarily as a low ambient light in our bedroom at night, but this thing could easily be used for so many other uses. Need a camping light? This thing would make a great tent light! Especially because the neck is so adjustable! Need a reading light while traveling? Bingo! Need a nightlight by your kids bed when they don't have plugs nearby? Yep! This is perfect! And, because it's LED powered, the thing goes forever!Overall:I really like it! It's been awesome to have as an ambient light at night when you don't want the bedroom lights on but still need a little light in the room. It's a little brighter than your average night light would be and the head is directionally adjustable so that makes it sweet! Outside of the quirky charging cable (kind of wish they'd gone with a micro USB slot as I have so many of those cables), the light is just about darn near perfect. I love that it's LED, love the battery life, and love how low the ""low light"" setting is for ambient light at night. If you're looking for a nice little portable LED lamp that's easy to use, you'll love this thing! I think it also makes an awesome portable camping light too!* I received this item from the manufacturer in exchange for a review *","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QI6LHTWWM12L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012MT1J6U#wasThisHelpful","R1QI6LHTWWM12L","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set of headphones are extremely comfortable to wear and the sound quality is some of the best I've heard in a set of small corded headphones of this size. I tested them with an LG G3 cell phone.Sound Quality:I've tried several different in ear headphones out there and most of them sound ok, but they're either too anemic on the sound volume with practically no bass or, if they're big and ""bassy"", the bass overwhelms the mids and trebles so the sound isn't really well balanced and comes out kind of muddled.However, that's not the case with these headphones, they've hit the perfect balance. You get really rich bass along with nicely placed mids and high's at decent volume levels too. They can easily get loud enough that I can hear them over loud environments and even have to crank the volume down on my phone too. I like that!I listened to several different types of music through these too and was really impressed with how well these reproduced the sound and how evenly balanced the sound is too.Comfort:I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of the look of the headphones too, but I have to say these are some of the most comfortable in ear headphones I've ever worn. I'm not sure if it's because of how the cord comes out the end or what, but man are they comfortable to wear! I could wear these things all day long without any issue at all.Cord Length:The cord length on them seems really generous too; which is great when you're exercising or biking as it gives me plenty of cord to attach to my phone sitting in my pocket.Button:The button on the cord started & stopped the songs quite easily too. I didn't try it out with a phone call though.Accessories:Wow! These guy's deliver! Three sets of ear buds in red and two sets of black ear buds, that's 5 different sets you can use to fit your ear.I found the ones that came mounted to the headphones perfectly fit my ears so I didn't have to try out the others; but they're there if you want to.They also send along a little travel case that zippers shut too.Value:Oh my gosh, totally worth it! At the price they have them at, they flat out beat out the more expensive ones I've tried as far as comfort level, sound balance, and cord length is concerned. Plus, they give you more earbuds than I've ever received from any other pair of headphones plus the little travel case. Total home run!Overall:I own several sets of corded headphones and I have to say, these just moved to my daily set I'll be wearing from here on out. The sound balance is just so good and the comfort level is perfect that they're my new favorite.* I received this product at a significant discount in exchange for a review *","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LE2GELV5IUXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGK8AS6#wasThisHelpful","R2LE2GELV5IUXF","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this car charger! It feels well built and it works extremely well.I've been using it in our minivan in the back seat port to let my daughter charger her iPod while we drive. I can also let my son charge a tablet as well while driving..and if needed I can also use the other 2 ports too. It works extremely well!The 2.4 amp charge ports really push out the charging power which gets her iPod fully charged in no time flat. The Nexus 7 that we've charged with it on the high speed port also charges up really quickly as well.It's a breeze to use, just plug it in, plug in a USB cable and you're all set!With all ports maxed out you can draw just over 80 watts. The power port on my van indicates that it can handle up to 120 watts, or about 10 amps, this can draw about 6.8 so I'm fine. Just a note though. If you have this plugged in and have all the ports being used, you might want to watch the battery level on your car or start it up every now & then to make sure you don't end up with a dead car battery after too long.Volts x Amps = Watts for those interested in figuring how much juice you'll draw.In most cases, USB devices don't really pull the full 2.4 amps that can be delivered, but I liked knowing the max that the charger is capable of pulling.I like the blue light on it too as it lets me know when it's powered (ie. when I've pushed it in far enough or if I need to turn the key on to get the juice flowing). All in all it's a simple USB charger that can power 4 USB powered devices, two of which at ""high speed charging"" (or 2.4 amps), and the other at 1 amp.Overall it's a great little charger that we'll continue to use in the van that really comes in handy; especially for those long trips that drain the batteries.* I received this item in exchange for a review","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYCXE9TXA60E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z65KBVM#wasThisHelpful","R1QYCXE9TXA60E","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This backpack is awesome! It's extremely well built and the material is nice and thick on it! My daughter absolutely loves it!The backpack is a fairly large with tons of pockets on it. There's two zippered pockets on the front, two open pockets on the sides, two on the inside front flap, and a big one inside near the back with a velcro strap.The big pocket on the inside is big enough to hold my 15"" MacBook Pro and secure it with the velcro strap. It also fit my Nexus 7 quite well too.The front flap inside pockets fit cell phones and ipods really well too. I was able to easily slide a Moto G (1st Gen) into the top pocket and it fit nice & snug. My LG G3 in it's hefty case didn't quite fit, but it's more like a phablet than a phone. It'll fit in the front zippered pocket though.The bigger front zippered pocket easily fits a scientific calculator that my daughter uses for math with space to spare.Build Quality:The blue material is a heavy duty canvas that feels great! It's nice & beefy and I fully expect it to last for several years. The stitching is all nice & clean and the thread looks to be of a heavy grade too. The rear straps are nice and wide and I love the easily adjustable metal adjusters that the black straps fit into. The material on the side pockets is also made from heavy duty canvas that just exudes long life. This reminds me of the old Jansport canvas backpacks that were so tough that I used back in high school.The zippers are all high quality with heavy duty faux leather straps on the ends that make them really easy to operate.Size:This thing is huge! It easily fits all of my 7th grade daughters books, pencils, papers, and other stuff that barely fit into her old backpack. It's nice and wide and you can cram a ton of stuff into it. She really has appreciated being able to use it; especially where her old backpack was wearing out & tearing. She say's this one is much more comfortable to wear too.I absolutely love the color on it too! That may sound kind of corny, but man, that blue is awesome looking! The pictures don't really convey how nice of a navy blue it is. It just looks looks nice & clean. I like it!The adjustable straps are really nice on this too. Really easy to adjust.

"This is a really nice pair of polarized sunglasses in a classic frame.They're extremely comfortable to wear and really light weight. The frames look to be fairly well built too with the hinges being nice & robust vs others in this price range.The sunglasses come with a case and a microfiber cleaning cloth too; which I thought was a nice touch.As far as how well they work. The set I purchased have a slight green hue to them when you look through them. I love the polarized lenses in them too! It really cuts down on the glare as you're driving into the sun. I had a chance to use them on a road that heads dead west as the sun was setting and was right in my eyes. It was really nice! The sticker on the lens when they arrived also said UV 400 so they provide some UV protection too.For comfort, I thought they felt great on my face. They stayed put while I did yard work and moved around quite a bit too.The case seems to be a faux leather that snaps shut really nice. The microfiber cloth is great for cleaning them with as well.The lenses are plastic, but feel really nice.

"* UPDATE *The wire at the end where it connects into the iPod came out. It quit charging the iPod too so it just hit the trash can.I got about a month and a half of heavy use out of it. Bummer. Wish it would've lasted longer.* Original Review *This cable works extremely well! It's nice and long (6 feet long) and still charges my daughters iPod at full speed.It's really nice to have the extra length as it lets her move around her room with ease while it's still charging.I tested this one along with the 10 foot one as well from NetSun. Both did extremely well and both have ends on them with protectors that help the cord keep from kinking up at the end where it's connected to the connector. The cord works extremely well in just about any charger we tried it on and easily connected to the iPod successfully every time.If you need a nice long charging cord and you want one that's going to hold up, you'll love this one.

"If you like bright flashlights you're going to love this one! It uses an odd size battery called an 18650 which wasn't available at any of my local stores and that I had to get elsewhere, so if you don't have access to these batteries, grab one on amazon if you pick one of these up. They're slightly larger than an AA battery (see pictures)Brightness:- Holy cow this thing is bright!- Bright enough at night to cast a beam up into the sky- This means it's AWESOME for pointing at a star in the sky with your kids ""See that star?"" (point using the flashlight) and the kid actually sees what you're pointing at.- It has 5 different modes that are all accessible by pushing the button multiple times--- 1: Super Bright - yeah, like scorching brighter than the 4th of July bright- It's BRIGHT!--- 2: Still Dang Bright - Not quite firework bright, but man, still pretty dang bright. still casts a beam at this level--- 3"" Sorta bright - Not all that bright; reminds me of an analog flashlight at this intensity--- 4: Blinks really fast - Wanna get someones attention? Yeah, this will do it--- 5: Blinks SOS - slow-slow-slow-fast-fast-fast-slow-slow-slow, repeatIt's kind of annoying that you have to cycle through all of the modes to get back to super bright mode. Kind of wish there was a switch on it somewhere to manually set what mode it always turns on to, but if you press the button half-way you can cycle through them pretty fast.Construction:- All metal (I'm assuming anodized aluminum) all the way through. It has an o-ring on the battery end too so I'm assuming this thing can get pretty wet and it won't hurt it at all (granted, I didn't dunk it in water, but I doubt using it in the rain would bother it at all).Zooming:There's a magnification lens mounted to the front that intensifies the light and wow does it work!Zoom all the way in and you've got a piercing sharp light that's nice and focusedZoom out and you get a really nice open beam of light that spreads wide openSomething kind of quirky, when you're zoomed all the way in and you point it at a wall, instead of a round beam of light, you get this square looking thing with lines through it. I took the cover off the lens and sure enough the LED lightbulb was square looking. Unless you're pointing it at a flat white wall you won't see it, but it's still a little odd to see a square beam of light instead of a round one. It's still super, super bright though!The strap:Yeah, not worth much. Mine fell off within the first few days of playing with it. It's pretty flimsy and felt like the core was made of fishing line. But, you aren't really buying the light for the strap, so it didn't bother me. Just know not to rely on it or just remove it altogether and you'll be setThe button:It's a weird color green. I have no idea why someone chose a green button on a light like this. Looks kind of out of place (I'm guessing someone in China thought pea green soup green would be a cool color). It's a little strange, but it still works fineZooming smoothness:After about the first week of constantly playing with the zoom on it (in, out, in, out, showing the kids, etc), I noticed it started to get a little resistance to the zoom action. But I sprayed a bit of silicon spray on it and it went back to being buttery smooth.Overall:For the price, this thing is a bargain! It really is brighter than just about anything out there in this range and man, talk about an awesome focused beam! Just be sure to pick up the battery that fits it as your local walmart won't have it. Also, don't count on the strap holding up too long.  Besides these few quibbles I still really like the light and how bright it is. Man it's bright! My kids love playing with it too! Being able to zoom it in and out is pretty cool too.* I received this product from the manufacturer in return for a review *","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFEIORM23Y2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FBOHIY#wasThisHelpful","R2LFEIORM23Y2E","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the easiest to use IP camera's I've ever used!I was able to get it set up and broadcasting on my network and out onto the internet really quickly. The software can be a little quirky and sometimes the camera can freeze up requiring a reboot, but for the most part it does a great job. I was able to view my front door on my own IP network in the house, on my cell phone over it's data network, and over a wi-fi connection somewhere else through my cell phone.Using the cell phone software (an app called MIPC on Android), I was able to control the camera's pan and tilt, could listen to the camera, and could talk to the person standing at the camera (2 way communication). My kids absolutely LOVED that part of it!Setup:- Connect the camera to your router through the included CAT 5 cable- Power it up & wait for the LAN light to go green- Download and install MIPC app on your phone- Create a new MIPC account using the included instructions with the camera- Scan for the camera with it's Q-Code on the bottom or enter it's ID into the software- Set up your account all the way and test the camera- In the settings, set up the camera's wireless settings so it recognizes your wireless network- Unplug the camera, plug it in somewhere in the house where it can use your wireless network- Wait for the green light to come on under the Wi-fi light- Fire up the MIPC app and enjoy seeing what the camera see'sUsing the App software:- It's really, really basic software- You use your finger to swipe left or right to pan the camera.- Swipe up or down to move the camera up or down- Push the mic button to enable 2-way communication- Hold your finger down on the phone display to talk through the camera- Your voice will come through on the camera- You can also hear who's at the camera through the mic on itSound Quality:- It's actually really clear and very sensitive. I put it on my front porch and can easily hear cars driving up & down the street or even people talking out on the sidewalk. Yep. That sensitive. I liked it!- People at the camera could hear my voice very clear as well (my kids got the BIGGEST kick out of this!)- Occasionally the phone app wold report ERROR when I did the Push To Talk. I rebooted the camera & the app and it started working againPC Software:- You can also download software onto a PC (I used Windows 7) as well to view the camera- Called mipc as well- The PC software isn't nearly as responsive to moving the camera around as the phone app is, but it still works well- You can also access the camera through a browser by going to it's IP address too- The settings on the camera are much easier to set on the PC software vs typing them in on your phone- The camera works well though and is pretty responsiveUsing other IP Camera Software- fugetaboutit!- Unfortunately because Turcom is somewhat of an unknown brand I wasn't able to find any other software that I could use with it. It's just not a recognized brand.Alarm/Motion Activation- I tried but couldn't figure out how to make this work- There's a bunch of settings I messed with but the only thing I got it to do was once it took a snapshot of me walking past it but then the camera froze & I had to reboot it- It might need a micro SD card inserted into it (there's a slot on the back) for it to work- There's also some sort of Alarm input jack thingy on the back that I had no clue what it was for (instructions didn't say anything about it either)Camera Performance:- It has night vision (which works really well! The little lights around the lens all come on at night)- You can switch between night vision and full color manually or let the camera do it for you (I just left it on auto)- When it gets dark enough in the room it's in, it switches to night mode- It absolutely works over a cell phone data network without having to add a DNS or DHCP server or anything like that. It just works.- It's kind of cool to show off to friends and family, ""Hey look! That's my front door!""Quibbles:- The software sometimes would freeze up requiring a hard-boot of the camera- Sometimes the PC software would freeze the image while the phone still showed the image moving- Same with the phone app freezing while the PC app would still continue showing an image- This is somewhat common with all IP camera's I've used though, they all get stuck sometimes. A good reboot & they're backup & runningWish List:- Wish I could use other IP camera software with it- Wish the alarm and motion sensing worked without the SD car- (ie. my D-Link would send me an email with a shot of what triggered the motion)Overall:- It's a great camera! It pans & tilts. Setup to be able to access it from anywhere on the net is a breeze, picture quality is great and so is sound.- If you need a basic IP camera that sets up fast and works over the net, here you go!* I received this item from the manufacturer in exchange for a review *","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXC2BP7CK5KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CZ35KI#wasThisHelpful","R2FXC2BP7CK5KM","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing rocks! On it's very first use my wife fell in love with it.When I first received it I was a little taken back by how thin it was, but my wife quickly pointed out that it works to it's advantage because it doesn't curl up like other measuring sheets and with it's somewhat tacky feel it ""sticks"" to the counter and holds itself in place.She put it right to use making playdough for one of our kids and loved the feel of it, how well it stayed in place, and how easy it was to clean up.It comes with lots of measurements all over it too. Temperature, pie crust sizes in centimeters and inches, measuring tables, an inch and centimeter ruler along the sides, and it stays nice and flat on the counter top.The mat itself has a fabric-ish feel to it that I think gives it it's strength but also allows it to be nice and flexible too (vs the ones that curl up--see pictures)If you have small children who love to play with sticky things (playdough, cookie dough, or anything in between), this is a great place mat for them t  play on. It contained a really sticky mess of some homemade playdough that my son played with that would've otherwise destroyed the table cloth that the mat protected.Overall, this gets a solid 5 stars from me!

"My wife is really enjoying using these and I've been really impressed with the quality of the metal and the thickness of the glass on the glass measuring cup.The kit comes with 5 spoons, 5 metal measuring cups, and a glass measuring cup.Pros:- All stainless construction- THICK metal construction (these don't have that ""cheap"" feel to them at all)- The wife said she ABSOLUTELY LOVES that it comes with a 3/4 cup measuring cup- She also loves that a 1/2 tablespoon spoon is included too!- They go through the dishwasher extremely well, no problems at all- The glass measuring cup is nice and thick and a great size- Red markings on glass cup are nice and clear and easy to readCons:- Wish the measuring cup had ""cup"" increments- Quickly removed the stainless rings that hooked the measuring cups & spoons together (they got in the way)- Round spoons aren't as easy to get into spice containers as oval spoons, but that's more a preferenceOverall, we really like these measuring set.

The connectors have an ""apple"" look to them and have a good feel to them. The cords also look to be reinforced where they go into the connectors which should help with the durability.I tested them on several devices (LG G3, Moto G, 2013 MacBook Pro, Anker Charger, car charger, etc) and they connected well every time.I absolutely loved the gargantuan length of these things! Particularly in our mini-van. I can plug them into a charger up front and the electronics can still be plugged in in the middle seats; which makes them perfect for long trips. It's also the perfect length for nights hanging out on the bed with the cell phone plugged in & charging while I'm still using it.As far as power capability, I have a high speed charger for my LG G3 that'll charge the phone from about 10% to 90% in about an hour with the supplied cord. When I used these, I noticed a slightly longer charge time (granted these things are 6.6 ft long and my charger cord is all of about 2.5 feet). Still, that's pretty darn impressive! I'll take the slightly longer charge time to have the longer cord anyday.The 3 pack is nice too because I can plug 3 devices into a charger in my mini van or on my Anker charger and be charging all of them at the same time without having to be right next to the charger.As far as value, for what you get, it's a no brainer. The length on these things is amazing! By far the longest USB cable I've ever used and they really work! I love it! One of these has become my permanent charging cord for my LG G3 now and I look forward to continuing to use it. The others are also used for long trips or to charge other devices while I still want to use them.* I received these cables at a reduce price in exchange for an honest review *","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPS6T05IRQASS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012C3CGZ4#wasThisHelpful","RPS6T05IRQASS","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this now for about 2 years and STILL absolutely love it!I'm in about a 4000 sq foot home with 2 levels with the router located in a bedroom in the upstairs on one side of the home.I can still pull a solid signal in the basement on the opposite side of the house as well as from outside the house within about 100 feet of the home.I have 5 computers, 2 cell phones, a tablet, a Roku, a Canon wireless printer, a wired HP printer, and an iPod all running off of the router.I have it connected to a Comcast modem.I can easily pull 125 MBps down and 10 to 12 up through speedtest (that's as fast as Comcast offers me) via the 5 Ghz Signal. Switch over to the 2.4 Ghz signal and it's a little slower. My 2013 MacBook Pro particularly LOVES this router. Lightning fast run times.Over the years I have had to reboot it a few times when it was acting kind of flaky, but that's always been very rare, otherwise it's always on and runs great.I get significantly stronger signal through the 2.4 Ghz signal when I'm further away from the router (say 20 feet +), but that's just a characteristic of 5 Ghz having lousy range. Close up though, the 5 Ghz is lightning fast.Software=======The router is a breeze to work with. Log in and you're presented with ""basic view"" or ""advanced view"".If you're just into basic stuff, you can do pretty much all the administrative tasks needed from the basic screen.However, if you need the more advanced features it's available and easy to get to as well.Reboot times are fairly quick (about 30 to 45 seconds) when rebooting from within the software.I've updated the firmware a few times using the administration panel over the years too and it's always gone well.I've also tested this router out against a few other routers (Apple's basic router, a cheaper Netgear, an off brand router, and Comcasts wireless router). The Netgear in every instance has blown all of them away. In terms of signal strength and speed and staying connected.I get VERY few (if ever) drops on this router. About the only time it happens is when I walk too far away from it (take the cell phone for a walk down the sidewalk).Over all, I've been thrilled with the router. It's a bit bulky on the size side, but it's done exactly what I wanted it to do; offer exceptional range and speed across multiple floors and through walls to several pc's, cell phones, and other wireless devices.Also, I've read a few people have had issues with their routers not working with wireless printers. I have a Canon MX892 and it's been rock solid with it. When the power goes out, it even finds the router again on boot up without any issues.If I needed another router, I'd definitely buy another one of these! It's been great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOJN36TP3CLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0DD0I6#wasThisHelpful","RCOJN36TP3CLT","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This router is OK, but that's about it.It's an inexpensive router that you can use to run wireless (or wired) devices through that's super cheap. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The range being the major issue. Great for single room applications or small apartments, but not great for multi-floor or large homes with lots of walls to go through.Installation:==========It's pretty easy to get it up & running. I tested it in tandem with a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 and a Motorola Surfboard (two separate locations). Plug an ethernet cord into your modem or router you're connecting this to, kick on the power & wait for the lights to light up.You can access the software via a wired connection or by connecting to it wirelessly. Default SSID is JCG xxxxxx. The default login & password are located on a sticker on the bottom. Once signed in, open your browser to 192.168.1.1NOTE: Do this BEFORE you connect it to a modem or a separate router. Particularly if you're using it with another router. Otherwise the other router will assign it a different IP and you won't be able to connect.Once in, you can set the router up as a standard router, repeater, hot spot, or a couple other options.I set mine up as a router.  While you're in the software, you can change your SSID to whatever you want it to be (FBI Van is always popular!) and can change the wireless login and password as well.Connecting once set up:==================Once set up, reboot it (usually does that when you apply the settings anyway), scan your wireless network for the router, and attach to it.Here's the problem I ran into. If you're not within a couple feet of this thing it DOES NOT like to always connect.iPhone 6 = Had a devil of a time connecting. It saw it, I put in the login credentials but it kept saying the password was bad. Walked up to the router w/ the phone in my hand and it connected. What the heck?LG G3 = Fairly easy time connectingMoto X (1st Gen) = Pretty easy time connectingMoto G (1st Gen) = Fairly easy connectingMacBook Pro 2013 = sometimes it'd connect, sometimes it wouldn'tBut then, get too far away from the router (say maybe 15 to 20 feet) and it'll randomly drop the signal.I used a Wi-fi Analyzer on my LG G3 and found this to be the case. Over and over the router would drop it's signal and then come back.All the while the other router in the building still had a solid signal (especially the Netgear Nighthawk--that thing rocks!)What was strange was that it seemed to go in waves too. And before you crucify me about channels, the other routers in the room I tested it with were both using separate channels far away from the channel this broadcasted on (Netgear broadcasts on 3, this was on 8. Motorola was on 4, this was on 8), so it wasn't channel interference. It legitimately would just ""drop"" it's signal and then come back.I even tested the router without it being attached to another router too. Yep. Same thing. It usually happened though when you were a good 15 to 20 feet away from it through a wall.However, when it was working, I could get a good signal from it a good 40 to 50 feet away...but again, then it would drop at random and you're now without a connection. Tried rebooting a few times, etc. But to no avail. Even tried repositioning it.Size:====It's quite a bit smaller than my Netgear Nighthawk (see pictures), but the Nighthawk is a beast! So size wise, the JCG has a much smaller footprint. The three antennae's on the back are pretty easy to adjust too.Recommendation:===============If you need a super basic router and you're in a tight space (say a smaller apartment) or if you're going to use it in the same room, this is probably a great little bargain of a router. But if you need something that'll broadcast further (say down the hall and into the living room) and stay on consistently, I can't really recommend it for that. The signal just dropped too often for me to feel comfortable using it as my primary router.When it was on, it was pretty nice. Good, solid speedtest numbers, nice features, but it doesn't seem to like to broadcast very far away from itself and stay on consistently.* I purchased this router at a significant discount in return for a review *","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11S76E10Z0QH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGULK90#wasThisHelpful","R11S76E10Z0QH8","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're into jumping rope, this is a great option!It easily adjusts to your height and can quickly be adjusted to other heights as well by pulling the caps off the bottom and adjusting the length sticking out of the handles. The jump rope comes with about 9 feet of rubbery plastic rope that's somewhat stretchy and holds up well to rope jumping.The foam handles are comfortable to grip and the finger indents help to keep it snug in your hands. The rope itself can also easily be cut down to size if you won't be needing past a certain length. We cut ours to fit my wife and then adjusted it as needed to fit the kids. My wife really enjoyed it and said because it was adjustable she was able to get the perfect height dialed in to jump with.The kids absolutely loved it and enjoyed using it.If you're looking for a nice, basic jump rope that's comfortable to hold and adjustable to height, you'll love this one!*This item was provided by the manufacturer for a review *","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDMWHQ9MRS1SN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7VE2BE#wasThisHelpful","RDMWHQ9MRS1SN","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nice, crisp highs, good mids, and good bass.They're not particularly loud, so you don't get a LOT of bass, but it's a good, crisp sound with minimal distortionThe drivers themselves are somewhat on the smaller end so that contributes to the lower sound outputI've definitely had louder earbuds, but the clarity and sound quality is really clean coming out of these.You can turn them up all the way and they won't overpower your ears, so that's nice.If you're looking for a loud set (ie. outside use or in a noisy environment) these probably aren't what you wantBut if you want a nice, crisp set of headphones, these are really nice.I'd call the sound somewhat understated, but crisp and cleanIt's a nice, lightweight set of headphones.Mic/Button:I really like the position of the mic button theseIt's nice and close to my mouth which means it's easy to find without ""hunting"" for it.It's also very responsive. Push it once, the song pauses. Push it again and it starts back upPush it twice and it advances to the next song.I also like that it's square shaped. It makes it much easier to grab the button vs. round mics that leave you hunting for the button.I didn't test out the mic on it though, so can't comment on how well it works.Cord Length:I actually really like this length. It's a little on the shorter end but it keeps from getting tangled in things like longer ones can do.The thinness of the ribbon is also nice too. Definitely on the ""lightweight"" end of things.Overall:I really liked this set of headphones. While they're on the ""lightweight"" end of things and not as loud as others out there, they make up for it in their crispness of sound and overall sound quality. They're also extremely comfortable and easy to put in my ears. Love the position on the mic and how short the cord is. Solid 4 out of 5 stars.

"Really nice set of headphones that can REALLY crank out the volume. Nice, thumping bass with good sound.I tried these out on an LG G3 phone.Of all the earbud style headphones I've ever used, these by far can crank the loudest.As in much louder than I could even stand loud (Yeah, THAT loud! They totally rock!)Packaging:They come packed in a nice tin case with a foam insert. Showed up in great shape and was easy to unpackage.They also come with three sets of the rubber ear inserts. The ones that were on them when they arrived fit my ears great.Sound Quality:Oodles and oodles of volume! (Seriously, you'll be floored by how loud they can get).Mids & highs are somewhat subdued though. But man, bass? oh yeah! It can thump it!The only set that's come close to these are a set of Cootree's I tried a while back.Cootree BE318 3.5mm In-ear earphones/earpiece/ earbuds with Microphone Built-in & Universal 1-Button Control for iPhone 6 6Plus, 5S 5 4S, Galaxy Note 4 3 2 S5 S4 S3,any IOS or Android cell phones, and Music Player - Blanou series (Black&Silver)The bass does have an ever slight tinge of distortion though to my ears.Overall though, sound quality is still really nice. And man, talk about that Bass!Mic Button:Press it once and it pauses the song, press it again and the song starts again.Press it twice quickly and it'll jump to the next song.Didn't have a chance to try the mic.As others have said the mic does sit lower (about mid chest on me--I'm 5'9"")Comfort:These are really comfortable to wear. Easy to place in the ear and easy to remove.I love that there's some ""chunky-ness"" to the earbud itself. It makes it easier to grab and put in and pull out of my ears.Cord Length:From the plug to the mic is 31""From the mic to the earphone is 15""Total cord length is 46""Plenty of length to put in my pocket and jog, bike, or walk withCord is a ribbon style too and feels really sturdy.The mic has a metal jacket on it, the plug has a metal jacket on it and looks really niceThe cord is reinforced with rubber at the jack, the mic, and at each earphone which should help the cord last much longer than normalNiggles:When you put these in your ears or push on them they pop. Like the plastic driver is popping in and out from the air pressure.That may just be a side effect of how big the driver is in them, but it was still there. Also, if I moved my jaw in just the right way I could make the right one pop as well.It doesn't seem to effect the sound quality at all, but it was a little strange for them to pop like that.Overall Appearance:I really liked the packaging. Simple, crisp & clean.The headphones themselves have a really nice quality feel to them and I love the metal jacket on the plug and mic.Gives them kind of a premium feel.I also really like that they've labeled the left & right ear buds too. You don't have to guess what ears to put them in.Overall Impression:I absolutely love how loud these get and love the rocking bass, but the slightly muffled mids & high's are noticable if you listen for it.There's also a slight distortion to them when they're up about 1/2 way too. Not bad, but it was noticable to my ears. Kind of like you have the bass turned up too loud on your equalizer. So not a perfect 5 for sound quality, but definitely a solid 4 stars.If sound clarity was a little clearer and if they didn't pop when you push on them they'd definitely be a 5 star set.As far as value though, for the price on these, they're definitely awesome.If you want some of the loudest earbuds around with absolutely kicking bass (seriously, these things can THUMP!), and you're on a budget, this is a no-brainer. If you're a bit more of an audiophile and like crisper mid's and high's and don't want any distortion, you may not be as thrilled with these (the Cootree's I mentioned above may be more suitable).Still, they're definitely a great set of earbuds and with as loud as they can get, they'll DEFINITELY block out any outside noise so you can rock to your tunes.* These headphones were provided to me at a discount in return for a review *","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMCUKUGKEREL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVT4DLO#wasThisHelpful","RMCUKUGKEREL","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used this device exclusively in repeater mode. I used it in two different fairly large homes (3500 sq/ft + w/ two levels).In the first home I was trying it with a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 and a generic JCG router.In the second home I was trying it with a JCG Basic Router.With the Netgear R7000:- I found area's of the house that were furthest away from the router and plugged the repeater into a wall socket and connected it and then measured the signal with a Wi-Fi Analyzer App on my phone and also did a speedtest on my computer.- I moved the repeater to different areas of the home with the test checking signal strength and speed- In every case, my Netgear Nighthawk still produced a far superior wi-fi signal and just flat out blew it away on speed tests.- Granted, the Netgear is one heck of an awesome router, but I expected the repeater to at least give it a run for it's money. Wasn't to be- Speeds on my router are consistently about 50 to 125 Mbps down and about 10-12 up (up is governed by Comcast though, I'm sure it could push more)- Speeds on the repeater were about 12 to 20 down and about 3-5 up even when I was standing right next to it- Granted a repeater ""repeats"" the signal, so you'll never have the same results, but I was hoping for betterWhen tied to the JCG Router I saw mildly higher signal strength near the repeater vs the routerSetup:- Pretty straight forward. Plug it in, connect your browser to the repeater (it shows up as JWA something, something), loging & pass are admin, admin, then go to 192.168.10.1 and you have access to the controls- You choose repeater mode and then select a wi-fi connection for it to ""repeat"". Enter the login credentials for that network and you're in business- It then creates it's own wi-fi network with [name of wifi connection repeating]-ext ie. if your wifi connection is home, the repeater wifi connection would be home-ext- Kind of annoying because a true repeater would simply repeat the same SSID, not make you log into another oneInstructions:- They're ok, not great. You can tell it's a translation. But it gets the point across and if you're mildly familiar with configuring a router, you'll be able to set it up.Lights:- You know it's connected and working when all the lights turn green on itProblems:- This thing messes with your router. When in repeater mode, it causes the router signal to disconnect, then reconnect, then not run the internet, then run it- When connected to the Repeater, it'll sometimes do the same thing.- This happened on both my Netgear Nighthawk and with the generic JCG router- I would have a computer hooked to the router and a phone hooked to the repeater. Almost without fail, with the repeater turned on it'd cause the signal or internet connection to drop on my computer while the phone stayed connected- As soon as I pulled the plug on the repeater, the signal on the router would get picked right back up on the laptop and stay strong- I'm not sure what the repeater was doing, but it happened on both routers testing various phones and computersAs far as a repeater, yeah, it'll repeat the signal, but if you have a half-way decent router, this thing really isn't all that beneficial, plus it really does mess with your router wi-fi signal and causes it to drop (couldn't figure out why, but it did it at both locations and on two separate routers).Recommendation:Pass on this and spend the money to buy a better router* This product was provided to me at a significant discount for a review *","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HIRHZUS128L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGKNDVS#wasThisHelpful","R39HIRHZUS128L","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These suction cups are really cool! Really useful too. You place them on whatever you'd like them to stick to, press the center button and then release and the cup ""sticks"".

Right now one of them is mounted inside our shower to hold the squeegee and puff ball and the other is in the kids basement bathroom to hold my daughters puff thing. They're holding up really well too.Niggles:The swinging hook does swing and if the cup is attached to glass, the back of the metal hook can swing and touch the glass. Over time (probably several years of use) if you hook stuff on it that swings the hook into the glass I could see it possibly leaving a mark, but so far ours doesn't move at all. Granted, it's holding a puff ball and a squeegee, but it's still holding up well.As far as suction cups go, man these things are awesome! They're much bigger than your average suction cup (kind of like a suction cup times 2 in size), which is really cool as you're getting extra suction strength on the back.They come packaged extremely well and have some instructions with them that were written in different languages, but the instructions had pictures on them so I got the idea of what I needed to do to use them (clean surface, attach cup, push button, you're on your way).If you need a fairly big suction cup with 2 fairly good sized hooks on each one, this thing is the one to get! It'd be cool if the whole thing was made of plastic, but man, for the price you really can't beat it as far as value goes.* This item was provided by the manufacturer to me in return for a review *","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35X0ZCB9FQK5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTRGGE4#wasThisHelpful","R35X0ZCB9FQK5Q","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Quick Review:Super small computer with Windows 7 that's smaller than a Wii (really!). All self-contained too. Includes a basic Keyboard and Mouse.The hard drive is slowwwww (5400 RPM) which results in sort of slow boot-ups, shut downs, anything hard drive specific, but once it's up & running it does a good job. Get it with an SSD instead if you can (I'll probably swap my HD out with one soon).I picked mine up with 8 GB of RAM, a 500 GB 5400 RPM Hard Drive (not a good choice), Celeron processorLonger Review:Holy Cow! A REAL computer for under $300? Yep! Really!Once you get over how cool it is to get a fully operational computer WITH included Wi-Fi, keyboard, and mouse and enough ports to get by, you'll notice some of the downsides of this little ditty. Namely the 5400 RPM Hard Drive is one slow spinning platter that puts sort of a black-eye in this otherwise awesome computer.Reason For Buying:We had an old Windows XP Tower that was having a hard time going to ""sleep"" when it was supposed to (it'd just stay on) and because it was a full size tower it was like leaving a 300 watt lightbulb on--all the time. So my main reason for buying was to get an energy efficient replacement for the kids but with some higher tech specs (the old computer was a 2008 dinosaur). I wanted a computer that the kids could walk away from and it would turn itself off (because they ALWAYS left the old one on). I also REALLY wanted Windows 7. Trying to teach the kids Windows 8 or 8.1 wasn't on my to-do list (seeing as I've not even used it). So that was high on the list. Didn't want to spend a bunch of cash.Pro's:==================It's REALLY small!It's super compactIt draws--get this--65 Watts! (oh yeah!)I could mount it to the wallIt had Windows 7 (not 8, not 8.1, and not 10--I purposely wanted 7!)Cons:Hard drive is an absolute dog! (Boot up, shut down, switching users isn't very quick at all--like tar slow by today's standards)It has a hard time going into ""hybrid sleep mode"" Like it'll Blue Screen of Death whenever it doesI went in & disabled ""hybrid sleep"" and it went away, but still. Kind of sucky that a brand new computer would BSOD.But, it'll go into sleep mode and hibernate mode so I'm still happy.Setup was quick & easy (well, kind of if you don't count all the updates).Pulled it out of the box (arrived in excellent shape)Put everything together.Discovered that I didn't have a VGA cable for my monitor (had an E-VGA or whatever that digital port is called) so a trip to walmart and $17 later I had the right cable.Once it was up & running and I've jumped through all the crap Windows 7 makes you jump through to get started, we had the computer up & running. Then comes the Windows Updates. Holy Crap! I swear that literally took half the day going through all of those. Something like 350+ of them too! (think to myself, ""Shoulda bought an iMac for the kids"" but then remembered this thing was sub $300 so I'll live with it. But man, what a TON of updates!With all the updates out of the way it was ready for action. Mounted it to the wall with a Lenovo Tiny VESA System Mounting Bracket (GET ONE! Seriously. Just do it! They're cheap and sooooo worth it!) plugged in the mouse, keyboard, speakers, and a USB cable for the webcam on the monitor and we were up & running.Windows found the webcam and installed the software for it. Printers got installed (Painless--this is Windows 7 after all). And it was ready for prime time.So far the kids have absolutely loved it! Dad loves it because it turns itself off (once I got the BSOD problem out of the way anyway).I'd buy another one of these in a second but with an SSD drive. That 5400 RPM Drive can suck it! It's an absolute pig. But, it was sub $300, so hey, ya get what ya pay for.Ports:=========Front:Two USB ports. No clue what the yellow one is. USB 3.0?Mic and headphone portBack:Power PortDisplay port3 USB Ports (one marked for keyboard so that it'll wake the computer from sleep)VGA Video portEthernet portAntennae jack for wirelessMouse and keyboard are definitely bargain basement, but hey, they threw them in so I can't complain (and the kids don't mind it).Value Question:Oh heck ya! For under $300 I got a fully functioning computer with Windows 7 that only draws 65 watts and will put itself to sleep. I love it! However, if I get another one it's definitely coming with an SSD drive. That 5400 drive would drive me nuts if I had to use it (but it's the kids so I don't have to).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R156GICIUCDJAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SNSFMYA#wasThisHelpful","R156GICIUCDJAK","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved this mount!It's made of METAL (not Plastic) and the fit is absolutely perfect for a Lenovo ThinkCentre M series computer.I mounted it to a 2x4 in an unfinished basement, slid in my Lenovo, screwed in the thumb screws and I was set!It let me mount it up and away from the computer too (off to the left of the monitor in my case where the kids can reach it).It comes with a set of thumb screws, three really tiny screws (not sure what they're for) and a bunch of VESA mount screws (which I didn't use).It has some rubber bumpers on it too so that when you slide in the computer it doesn't scratch metal on metal.I like that it fits it so well and absolutely LOVE the price! If you're getting a Lenovo Tiny ThinkCentre this should be a no-brainer. Pick one up. Or else you'll be picking one up later.

"Bought these for my wife. She REALLY, REALLY, REALLY likes them!Have had for over a year +I bought them with some O'Keefe's Healthy Foot Cream and they've done really well for her cracked heels.She wears them almost every single night and they've made a big difference.The heels are kind of rubbery gel like fitting and the actual socks are more like a spandex material.Worn nearly every night for well over a year, loves to use them, and say's they make a big difference--especially when combined with some foot cream. I accidentally washed them once (got in trouble with the Mrs.--guess I'm not on laundry duty anymore). They survived though. Even in the dryer. The rubbery sole on them looked a little deformed after going through the dryer but the Mrs. says that they ""Still work"".She's just about worn them out and is asking for another pair, so if that's anything for them.Yep.

"Quick Review:I really like the chime. It's a full size chime that rings loud and clear.It'll chime in the slightest breeze too. If you like em loud, this one's the one to get too.Nice construction with great hanging ring. Great customer serviceLonger review:Specs:======Top of ring to bottom of wind catcher - 30""Wood chiming disc (thing chimes hang from) - 5 3/4""Top of wood to bottom of hanging ring - 3 1/2""Hanging Ring - 1 1/4"" outer diameterBottom of chime hanging wood to top of wooden chimer disc - 9 1/2""Shortest chime - 10 1/4""Longest Chime - 14 3/8""Chimes - 6, each tuned to a different noteMaterials:=========The wood is laminated bambooThe hanging ring is made from aluminumThe chimes are made of aluminum and have a cool sand blasted matte finish on them.They each have a rubber grommet through the top that a string goes through and attaches to the big wooden disc above them.The hanging ring is a hefty piece of aluminum in and of itself. I'd guess 1/8"" thick?I was really excited to get this chime as it's the first 6 tone one I've ever owned. It's a beautiful chime and seems to be well built.It arrived EXTREMELY well packed. Big Amazon box with packing material, smaller box inside that, chime inside smaller box shrink-wrapped. Very easy to open and get to as well.The chime itself arrived in excellent shape and was easy to attach to my home.I first placed it on my back patio but it's so windy back there that it was ringing all the time and I was worried about it bothering the neighbors (any noise carries pretty fast in my back yard). I relocated it to my covered front porch where it's less windy and it's perfect there! (More on that a bit later).Mounting it is a breeze. Find something to hang the ring on and you're setSound Level:=========With a good wind pushing the chimer around this thing is L-O-U-D! So loud that I thought it would bother my rear neighbor whose house is probably 20 feet away from mine. Granted, sound carries in my back yard like crazy (cement patio, vinyl fence, yeah...pretty loud back there).If you're looking for a loud chime, this one is definitely for you. It's a full size chime that can chime nice and loud under a good wind.Under a light breeze it's much more quiet and easier to live with. My front porch is shielded from direct winds so even in a rain storm it wasn't chiming near as loud as it was in the backyard. Also, my front neighbors are much further away from my front porch than the rear ones (front lawn, big wide street, their front lawn, their house- you get the picture).Tonal Quality:===========Wow! This thing rocks! I absolutely love the sound the 6 chimes make! Absolutely heavenly sound.Under a good wind, the notes carry true & strong for quite a distance too. Under lighter wind, it's an absolutely gorgeous melody that lightly rings out.Size:============It's on the bigger end of chimes as wind chimes go at 30"" tall and nearly 6"" wide.Also, it'll sway in the breeze too so it'll need a fair amount of ring to swing around and chime in the wind.I've mounted mine 21"" away from the nearest pole on my front porch and that gives it plenty of room to move around (ie if the wind was blowing like crazy the chime won't hit anything).Build Quality:============This looks like a high end chime. The laminated bamboo is absolutely beautiful, the chimes are decked out in a beautiful matte finish and don't have any rough cut edges or sharp edges, the chimer and wind catcher also look top notch. I also like the plastic or rubber black insert they put in the chime that the string goes through. That'll keep the strings from fraying against the aluminum and will help it last much longer. The big hanging ring at the top is nice too. Nice & beefy! I fully expect this chime to last several years under minimal careOne little niggle. When it arrived, the wooden chime holder thing with the strings attached, wasn't sitting level. Kind of sat to one side. But, I discovered that the strings aren't super tight in the piece that hooks them to the hanging ring so I was able to adjust the strings such that I got the chime to sit perfectly level.If I was looking for a cool ""room ambiance"" decoration, it's classy enough that it could hang out in an informal living room and it's definitely great for the back patio (just be warned, if you have neighbors close by and they like to leave their windows open and it's windy, you'll BOTH be enjoying a melodious chime that'll sing out nice & loud).Cool Customer Service==================Not sure if they do this for every chime they sell, but I got a personal email right from the seller with some great tips & tricks for caring for the chime, the bamboo, and the tube. They also mentioned how to personalize the wind catcher too. Cool! Very nice touch!Recommendations:=================If you want a really loud chime, place this in a fairly windy area. She'll sing out like fireworks on the 4th of July.If you want a much more muted chime, find a less windy area to hang it and it'll chime occasionally at a much lower volume.I fall into the latter (I like chimes, I just don't want to hear them all the time) and love it where it's currently mounted.The Value Question:=================I'm not terribly up on how much chimes are supposed to cost, but for what you get, I think it's a really fair price. The build quality is top notch, the packaging they ship it in is awesome, and it arrived in excellent shape and it chimes an absolutely beautiful chime!If you're looking for a full size chime with beautiful tonal quality that'll ring nice & loud, look no further. This one's the one for you.If you still want full size but not as loud, this could still be your friend if you put it in a less windy place.If you want a chime (cause they look cool, but don't care for the sound), mount it inside somewhere.Overall, this is a full size, full bodied chime that'll do exactly what it's designed to do. Chime out nice & loud under a good gust of wind or lightly chime under a less windy conditions. Plus, it just looks cool!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q6TDCPEUNU39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTE0ZGI#wasThisHelpful","R2Q6TDCPEUNU39","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great book for those interesting in seeing what it takes to make Biodiesel on a small scale.I've known both of the authors for years and they're some of the best in the industry. The writing style is really easy to read and understand but still detailed enough technically that you get a good grasp of what this whole Biodiesel stuff is, how it can be made and the pro's & con's of producing your own renewable fuel.It's not a difficult read at all plus they've added several tips & tricks to help save you a ton of time when you make it. It's my go to book that I recommend to anyone wanting to get started making Biodiesel or just those interested in seeing what it would take to make biodiesel. While there's a lot of books out on how to make it, many of them delve into politics and get way off base. This one just keeps it simple. Here's how you make it, here's what it requires, here's some of the things you'll run into and want to plan for when you make it and heres how to do it right. Short, simple, to the point, and sweet. It's also accurate (something a lot of the books on making your own biodiesel are seriously lacking).As a Biodiesel enthusiast, promoter, and retailer of biodiesel production goods and such, I really, really like this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in getting started.- Graydon Blair, Utah Biodiesel Supply","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS8G1AD1WXXB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0865717850#wasThisHelpful","RS8G1AD1WXXB1","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XSKN sent this to me to review on my 2013 MacBook Pro 15"".Overall:I've used several of these over the years and this one is definitely one of the tops. It stays in place, it doesn't feel obtrusive, and it has nice key feelLonger review:Installation:The keyboard cover came in a cool package that was fairly unassuming and easy to pull open. Installation is really quick. Just lay it onto your keyboard, press a few keys to ""set it"" in place, and you're good to go.Keyboard Feel:I've used several of these over the years, but never one on one of my MacBooks so I was curious how it would work. I'm happy to report that it actually feels really nice on my fingers! You can tell that you're typing on silicone instead of the actual keys. It's sort of a rubbery feel to it, but it's not an obtrusive, sticky, overly rubbery feel like you get on some of these keyboard covers. So far, I've really liked it and it hasn't hindered my typing ability at all. I'm actually writing the review from the very MacBook Pro it's installed on with it installed.Staying In Place:This is where this thing really shines. Usually all of the keyboard skins I use either fall off, move around, or the ends stick up and you can really tell that they're there and they look...well...tacky! This one I'm happy to report has been staying put. It's not slid around once yet and I've used the keyboard quite a bit. I'm particularly impressed with how well it fits the keyboard. Some of the one's I've used have ends that stick up or they just flat out don't fit the keyboard, but this one is a perfect fit. I especially like how clean it fits into the grove around the outside edge of the keyboardLooks:You really can't tell it's there--which is what I like. If you look REALLY close you can see the slight cutout of the skin around the arrow keys, but outside of that, it's just a really clean fit.How well it works:So far it's really done a great job of keeping dust, stuff I'm eating, or general junk off the keyboard. I haven't tried spilling anything on it (I paid too much for the MacBook to give that a go), but I'm sure the occasional spill should be just fine with it.Value Proposition:Man, for as cheap as this is, it's a no brainer if you need one. It sticks to the keyboard well, has a good tactile feel, and looks classy on my mac. Can't ask for much more than that.Recommendation Factor:Yep. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend if they were looking for one for this computer. Especially given the clean looks and exact fit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIMK0WSGPPI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2I2O02#wasThisHelpful","R2SIMK0WSGPPI2","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brightech sent me a set of these to review to see what I thought.Packaging:========These are packed extremely well. Each bulb is in it's own cardboard section with the wires sitting below in another section of the box. I have no doubt that these would always show up without any broken bulbs unless the UPS guy drove over the box or something. A+ for packaging a fragile set of bulbs.Setup:========Basically pull the set out of the box, unstring all the wires and you're ready to go.Experience Using Them:=================My friend gave these a try in a couple different places. The first place she used them was in her kitchen. She strung them near her counter. She said the lightbulbs being incandescent gave off a fair amount of heat. With the kitchen already being a ""hot room"", she looked to where she could use them outdoors. With such a great length of cord, the possibilities are endless!She decided though to give them a try around a cool, new bar-b-que area they just built in her backyard (check out the photos). She said they work really, really well! In the evenings when you're sitting out on her back patio they really add to the ambiance of the evening.Being near the bar-b-que, the heat doesn't bother them at all (they're mounted pretty high up). They hold up well to the hot summer sun and don't mind being rained on either.She said they feel like a really nice quality product too (these ain't your cheap ""dollar store string of lights"", these are the real thing).In looking at them I'd have no problem stringing these up around the back yard and leaving them there all the time. Through wind, rain, snow, heat, etc. I really think they'd hold up well.The glow from the bulbs is awesome! It's just a nice, light glow that really adds to the ambiance. She loved it and I loved how it added to their backyard area. Just a really, really nice set of lights. Great value for the money too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAIQFT36UTAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK4Z2M8#wasThisHelpful","R1IAIQFT36UTAM","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Short version:Really strong suction cup, rock solid on the windshield, flexible arm, vibrates too much to use while moving.Long version:I was really excited when this showed up, I tried it with an LG G3 and a Moto G; both while in cases, both of which easily fit in this long neck mighty grips. The grips held it rock solid. I had absolutely no worry about either phone falling out over the worst roads. It grips it like a pit bull on prey and won't let go until you open the clamp. The suction cup must have super vacuum strength because wow does it grab well! The only problem is that it's pretty much useless to use once the car starts moving. Let's say you wanted to use it for GPS. Yeah, ain't gonna happen.The problem comes from that really long arm on the mighty grip. Any bump or undulation in the road gets amplified through the neck and by the time it gets to your phone, it vibrates like crazy. So bad that the screen is pretty much blurred due to the movement. If you're on an absolutely flat road with no variations it was usable, but man, hit a bump (either at high or low speed) and the harmonic balance vibration from the tires comes right up through the windshield and down that long arm and gets amplified onto your phone. Granted, it's not wobbling from being loose, it's rock solid, the arm is just so long that it vibrates like crazy.It would make an awesome grip for stationary use (like when the car isn't moving), but once the wheels start moving it was pretty much useless.Installation:Super easy. Pull the protective layer off of the suction cup and you're ready to go. And, like a leach on skin, it'll grip your windshield like no other. There's some sort of sticky rubber on the bottom of the suction cup that makes it not only adhere with vacuum pressure, but with the sticky adhesion too. It worked great. That sucker wasn't coming off until I released the vacuum release.The head is easy to assemble too. Just twist off the nut, slide the head onto the arm, twist the nut back tight and your all set to go.Grip:The grip easily held my LG G3 and my wifes Moto G phones. It seemed to have just the right amount of tension to it too. Easy to open and easy to shut onto the phones. It gripped both of them extremely well.Pivoting Action:The head pivots around a ball on the end of the arm and is extremely easy to move around. I was really impressed with how easy it was to position the phone in pretty much any direction I wanted it to be. It worked really well. It also stays put where you put it too.As A GPS Holder For Your Phone:You aren't going to like it. Trust me. I tested it with my Garmin sitting next to it and drove around all sorts of roads with my phone on Google GPS. Both at day and night. During both day and night tests the screen on my phone vibrated way too much to really be useful while the Garmin was rock solid. My garmin sits on one of those bean bag mounts. Not a stitch of vibration on the Garmin vs the almost constant vibration with the Ipow arm.As A Stationary Device:If the car isn't moving, it's an absolutely awesome phone holder! It stays where you put it, holds the phone in a herculean grip and the suction cup grips the window like a rock. I loved using the phone when at a standstill.Conclusion:If you need a really long arm to hold your phone in the car and only need to use it when the car isn't moving, this is awesome! The arm is long, it grips like no other, and is really easy to reposition.

For details read on.My mom, a grandmother of 21 grandkids, recently got an iPhone 6 and I received this in the mail to review for Brightech, so I thought it'd be a match made in heaven. Big, nice battery to extend the life of her new iPhone, help protect it on the sides, let her use the iPhone longer in the day. But, alas, this wasn't to be. One of the young grandkids grabbed her phone w/ the case on it when she wasn't looking and started tugging on the iPhone to pull it out. The case is extremely strong, in fact strong enough to bend the bottom of an iPhone if you're a 3 year old kid and you keep tugging hard enough on the phone straight up. (See the unfortunate carnage). Luckily, the phone has a Square Trade on it, but if you have younger kids and you let them play with your iPhone, don't let em touch it with this case on. It could spell certain doom for your expensive phone.Aside from that.....The case is really nice! It snugly holds the phone and the rubber bumper all the way around does a fairly good job of keeping the phone in the case nice and snug. It's no otter box, but it definitely is rubberized at the corners enough to take a blow and keep your phone looking great.Battery Life:The battery on this thing rocks! It definitely will extend the use of your iPhone by about double. My mom tested it over several days and said that usually, about half way through the day her iPhone was dead, but with this on, she could easily go all day long and into the evening without any problem. The battery indicator on the back is cool too. She said it's really easy to see what the charging status of the battery is.We stuck her pretty much dead iPhone in the case and it immediately started charging up the battery. Once the battery was at 100%, it kept it there for quite a while longer as she used the phone.Charging Connection:Occasionally, she said that she'd notice it not always connecting to the battery, so the jack may be a bit on the finicky side (but again, grandkids may have messed with it a few times so take that into consideration).Cables:It comes with a USB to mini-USB charging cable and a headphone jack extender that fits in the bottom of your phone. If you don't have a USB charger, you'll need to plug this into your computer to get a charge into it, but we have so many other USB powered devices that we just plugged it into one of the charges and away it went.Bulky-ness:She said that while it was on the phone, it definitely added some bulk to it and she noticed the size, but it wasn't much of a problem. It'll extend the phone since the jack on the bottom has to stick into it and the back of the device is a battery. So, if you don't mind the added bulk that it brings along, it's not too bad to use.Buttons:With the case on the iPhone it was still really easy to use all of the buttons. It fit the back of the phone really well too and the camera was still very accessible.Installing The Phone:The iPhone easily slides in and out of the case, especially if you do it an an angle. However (and this is important) DON'T try to PULL straight up on your iPhone to remove it from the case. It WILL bend the bottom of your iPhone if you tug on it (as a 3 year old was able to do). If you remove the phone the way it's made to be removed though (angle upward slightly and then pull out of the case) it won't ever be a problem. Just don't pull it out like you'd open a door on a hinge.Overall:If I didn't have kids and I needed a battery extender, I'd probably swing for it. However, where I have kids and I saw the damage that it was able to do to my mom's iPhone 6, I'd probably pass. Great if you don't have kids, not great if you have kids and let them use your phone.*Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer to use and review for Amazon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3223NRP7XJ1RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGEH0C4#wasThisHelpful","R3223NRP7XJ1RF","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These starry string lights are amazing! They project a very nice, white light, and are incredibly durable! They're the perfect lights for a craft project or just decorating an area. If you're looking for a set of white LED lights that can withstand repeated twisting, bending, tieing, and even a hot glue gun, look no further! You've found your lights!These lights come boxed in a small box and include a 3.6 volt power supply. The cord between the lights and the plug is extra long, making it really nice to be able to hide the adapter somewhere and run the cord to the lights.I wanted to find a unique way to test these lights out so I gave them to my neighbor to try out. She quickly came up with an art project to use the lights with and was extremely impressed with how well they worked!In comparison to your average christmas lights, these things just flat our rock!Pros:======- Extremely flexible (twist, bend, turn, pull, you name it, they'll take it)- Very, VERY durable (all that twisting didn't bother them a bit)- Easy to bend (my neighbor said this over and over and over, she was REALLY impressed with that feature)- Don't fall apart, quit working, or break like other lights- Can be glued with hot-glue and still work (see the pictures)- Really really long cord for easily concealing the plug- Extremely well built- Impressive technology LED light- Great for crafts- Nice & bright- Make excellent ""stars"" in projectsCons:=====- A bit on the stark white light, if that bothers you go with the soft-white versionMy neighbor said that she bend, pulled, scratched, glued, and even twisted the heck out of these lights and nothing fazed them. They literally ""took a lickin' and kept on tickin'"". She said they worked perfect for the art project she put together with them too.The only down side she offered was that the white is a bit on the bright side and when the lights in the house are dim, it can be a little ""too white"", but she said that's easy to overcome by using the soft white lights.She's used Christmas lights in her projects before and hasn't been really impressed with them (you bend them wrong, they go out. You twist them wrong, and they go out, you glue them, and they break), but she absolutely loved these ones!Also, and this is big, because they are LED, they don't give off any heat, which is perfect for permanent installations and for art and craft projects.Check out the awesome art project she was able to make with them.** NOTE: These lights were sent to me by the manufacturer in return for a review **","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA3TFDB20IRHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQB211O#wasThisHelpful","RA3TFDB20IRHA","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is an amazing little speaker with a battery life that'll put the energizer bunny to shame! It sounds incredible, gets nice & loud, and has incredible range.Short Version:Holy cow this thing rocks! And man can it pack a punch on volume! If you need a really powerful little speaker with deep, rich sound, and incredible range, your search is over. Throw this bad boy into your cart & call it good.Size:- 3"" wide x 3"" tall x 3"" deepWeight:- 9.6 ounces (with strap on)Stuff it comes with:- (1) 24"" dongle w/ a USB, mini-usb, and stereo headphone jack- (1) carrying strap- (1) set of instructions.Long Version:I honestly wasn't expecting all that much out of a speaker this small but wow......I mean holy cow wow! This thing can rock (and by rock I mean it can get REALLY loud!) Also, the sound that comes out of it is surprisingly really, really good (it'll put your best lap top speakers to shame!!) The other thing that just floored me is how long it'll run on a charge. When it first arrived I decided to see how long I could get it to run before it'd die. About 8 hours later the thing was still chugging along on it's original charge out of the box (granted, I didn't run it at full volume--trust me, you don't NEED to run it at full volume, half-way up is plenty loud in a small room).Sound Quality & Volume:I'd say it's really good from low all the way up to about 7/8 volume. At full volume I heard some distortion coming from it, so I backed it down a notch & it was great. For kicks I downloaded a decibel meter on my phone & decided to see ""just how loud"" this thing can get. Unfortunately, at 98 dB my cell phone mic maxed out and wouldn't read any higher although the speaker wasn't even up all the way. So, uhm...yeah, this thing can get THAT LOUD and more. I compared it to the speakers on my 2011 iMac from a loudness standpoint. While the iMac's aren't going to blow you out of your chair they can still get pretty loud. The Remix 5 hung right there with them. At full blast, the Remix 5 was actually a tad louder than the iMac but the music was distorting at that point vs the iMac remaining rich & clear even at full blast. But yeah, this thing can REALLY get loud.Movie Watching:Netflix movies are terribly under volumed. Not sure what the deal is but they're always quieter than running the same movie from a DVD so I was really curious to see how this speaker would do with them. The verdict? Oh yeah! It's awesome! It can get a Netflix movie so loud that you have to turn down the volume on the speaker or else it's just ""too dang loud!"" My wife watches netflix all the time in our kitchen on her Acer laptop. The speakers on the Acer are TERRIBLY underpowered and when you combine it with a Netflix you get a lot of ""What did she say?"" But with the Remix we set the volume up half-way and it was plenty loud. We also took it with us on a night out at a hotel so we could watch Netflix on my laptop (MacBook Pro) and still have decent sound. I'm happy to report that did an awesome job! It was like you were watching the movie (sound wise) on a full size TV. I even put the speaker on a table away from where we were sitting. I still didn't have to turn the sound on the speaker up more than half-way and it was still plenty loud. So this would make a great ""hotel room"" speaker.Listening To Music:I tested the Remix out on several devices (LG G3, Motorola Moto G, 2011 iMac, Acer Laptop, 2014 MacBook Pro) while listening to a wide variety of music (everything from deep bass hip hop to classical music) and can say that this thing is really good. If you're an audiophile, it may not suffice (treble is fairly pronounced due to it's size and some classical music came out a little ""brassy""), but it never sounded ""tinny"" or ""am radio like"".Volume wise, you can crank the tunes up all the way and rock it all day long. I tried the speaker out in various locations throughout the house (bathroom, living room, kitchen, bedroom, out on the deck) and it worked extremely well where ever I put it. In a 2000 square foot home, I could hear it in every room on the main floor with the volume up about 3/4 of the way. I turned it on in the kitchen on a saturday and we could clean the whole house from room to room and still hear the tunes really well.The ""+"" & ""-"" buttons will navigate your music player really well (I tried Amazon Prime Music, Google Play, and iTunes and it worked on all of them). Pressing the ""Play"" button on the speaker will pause or resume playing a song. PretytUsing As A Speaker Phone:I made a couple ""speaker phone"" calls using the ""blue-tooth speaker"" functionality on it and it worked extremely well (much better than I thought it would). The person on the other end could hear me really well and I could hear them clear as day as well. Pretty cool! If you have a bad cell phone speaker or if you're just in louder environments all the time, you may like this functionality.Versatility:I decided to see just how many different things I could use this for.Kitchen - This is a great little speaker for watching movies while cooking or cleaning in the kitchen The wife LOVES it for this purpose!Kids watching YouTube Videos - I have a 4 yr old & 7 yr old that loved being able to hear their YouTube video's with the other kids still running around making noiseIn the car - I have an old Mercedes diesel (240D) that doesn't have a radio. Out to the car this went for a road trip. Yep! works great! I could definitely hear the tunes with the engine running at full tilt down the roadWhile showering - Stick it on the counter top, kick on the tunes, and jump in the shower. It's PLENTY loud even over water going full blast to clearly hear the lyrics of any song you can playWhile cleaning the house - Yep! Worked great! We stuck it in the kitchen and went from room to room cleaning the house and could hear it every where we went.While browsin' the web - Stick this next to your computer, sync it to your phone, & kick on your favorite play list & rock it out! It made doing the taxes MUCH easier!Connection:You can sync it using Bluetooth or through the included headphone jack. Our Acer Laptop doesn't have Bluetooth, so we connected it with the dongle and worked perfect! (Man, it REALLY made the laptop come alive because of how loud this speaker can actually get)The dongle has two 24"" long cords connected to a mini-usb port that connects to the back of the speaker. One cord has a standard USB port while the other has a stereo headphone jack. I tested them both out and both work really well. Standard USB charges the speaker, headphone jack lets you do exactly that--connect it through the headphone port on any device.Bluetooth ConnectionWhen you turn on the bluetooth part of the speaker, it gives an audible set of tones to tell you it's on. Then, a few seconds later if it finds a device to connect to you get another tone. If it doesn't find anything you get another tone. We were able to connect it with ease any bluetooth device we could find. One odd quirk is that if you set it next to an Apple Bluetooth Mouse, the bluetooth on the mouse causes interference with the speaker and you'll get pops & cut out's on songs--I moved the speaker away from the mouse and it went away. Guess they were competing for bandwidthBluetooth Range:In clear site....LG G3 - 50 feet clear as a bell, from 50 to 100 feet, it was cutting out periodically. At 100 feet it lost the LG signalMacBook Pro - Clear out to 100 feet it was still playing clear as a bell. At about 210 feet it finally lost the signal completely. WOW!!!Inside our 2000 square foot rambler style home, I was able to walk around with the speaker into nearly every room while the cell phone was left in the master bedroom and still get a really good signal. When I took it downstairs, I started losing the signal and it got a little choppy, but still, really, really impressive!TIP: If you're connecting it to multiple bluetooth source devices, you may need to turn off bluetooth on the devices that you don't want it to join because it WILL find them and WILL join them...sometimes before you're able to get the device you WANT it to connect to set up. Pretty impressive!By the way, when I did the outside test, at 200 feet you could still clearly hear the music coming from the speaker. Like I said, quite the amazing little speaker!Volume Level Comparison:2011 iMac - Same loudness, although the iMac speakers had a more refined sound2014 MacBook Pro - totally blew it out of the water. MUCH louder, MUCH better sound quality2012 Acer Laptop (walmart cheapie) - Absolutely blew it out of the water. No comparison. Like going from a cell phone speaker to a hi-fi. Yeah, that much of a difference!LG G3 - MUCH louder (and much better sounding)!Motorola Moto G - MUCH, MUCH louder (and better sounding too!)Battery Life:I've honestly yet to run it completely dead. It's THAT good! I purposely left it running hooked to our laptop (through the headphone jack) while the kids & wife watched several Netflix movies. Then I played several hours of music (Pandora) with it. Then I watched another movie with it. Yep. It was still going. We did accidentally plug the USB in about half-way through these tests for about 2 hours, but other than that, that's the only charge it's had so far and it just keeps on going.Ease of Use:Connecting it via the dongle is a cinch. Plug in the headphone jack, hook the other side to the speaker, turn the switch on to the middle slot and you're set. Bluetooth connects very quickly too (if you have the other devices it's connected to turned off--sometimes it'd grab the cell phone Upstairs on the other side of the house before I could get bluetooth turned on on MY cell phone)The buttons are placed in somewhat of an awkward place (why not right on top?) but they still work really well.Look & Feel:The rubber surrounding the speaker feels pretty nice. It's nice & ""grippy"". The red is a nice looking red too on the back & speaker grille. The included strap is also pretty easy to attach and use. I have fairly big hands and I could still get my wrist through the strap. I will say that the rubber is somewhat of a dust collector though. It's easy to clean off, but because it's black & rubbery it'll collect lint & dust pretty easily.Water Resistant:I didn't test this part out, so I can't say, but the rubber does fully surround it and the flap on the back will cover the ports really well. I'm curious how well the speaker on the front will fair to getting wet though.Summary and ""The Value For The Money"" Question:If you'd like an all around versatile Bluetooth Speaker that actually can get really loud yet not be too bulky, this thing is an excellent choice! I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family (and have been showing it off to everyone because of how cool I think it is!) I think it'd easily go a full day at half volume (say at your work desk or in the kitchen) on a single charge (I've yet to kill the battery). For the money, it's an awesome deal!This product was provided to me by the manufacturer to review (and I REALLY, REALLY like it & keep showing it off! It's a sweet little speaker! I'd definitely buy one!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25VYZ1F0XC1OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFFDDLG#wasThisHelpful","R25VYZ1F0XC1OT","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I REALLY like these lens cleaning wipes! I bought them to clean the screen protector on my LG G3 cell phone. My screen protector is a fingerprint magnet and these wipes work perfectly to clean the screen! It only takes one wipe too to get the screen protector looking squeaky clean again.The wipes have a little bit of alcohol in them to make them moist. The alcohol smell isn't strong at all though and the wipe isn't overly wet; which I've found is perfect for cleaning with. The wipe will pull the greasiest of smudges right off the screen too!If you have a cell phone with a screen protector and want to keep it clean, then you've gotta try these!

"I installed this on my 2008 vintage MacBook Pro back in 2009 when I bought it. It's been on it ever since and the MacBook just died a few months back while the PalmGuard is still doing great!

"This thing is awesome! As in it impressed the heck out of my 9 year old son and me too!We gave this to my son for Christmas because he wanted a rocket (and I didn't want to buy rocket fuel). When he first saw it he read on the front that it'd go ""nearly 200 feet in the air"" and he said, ""Yeah, right! No way!"" Uhm...yes way...as in this thing FLIES!!!We took it outside & set it up and I jumped on the air bag and the thing shot really high into the air and impressed the heck out of my son. ""Holy cow! That IS AWESOME!!!"" Yep! This thing rocks!Setup is pretty straight forward, although the stand is kind of a pain to assemble (it's hard to put the third piece between the other two). But once you get it set up, it's all fun! We shot the rocket several times; each of us trying to get it higher than the other. I even jumped on the air bag with both feet (all 185 lbs of myself) and that sucker shot sky high! Oh yeah! It rocked!What's cool too is this thing is pretty robust. I wasn't being gingerly about my jumps at all (basically jumping as high as I could & landing on the bag to get the most pressure). It took it all and still lived to see another flight.The rockets are fairing pretty well too. So far we haven't landed one on a roof somewhere and the ends are all still in great shape. If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive toy that'll bring a ton of fun to your kids and that won't break after the second use, you gotta try this thing! It'll put a grin on the face of anyone who uses it (this ""adult guy"" turned into a giddy kid while using it--HUGE grins produced!)The airbag is a fairly pliable plastic material that is holding up extremely well (even to repeated jumps from a 185 lb guy--with both feet!). Get it for nothing more than the priceless look it'll produce on your sons face when he see's just how high this thing flies. The price is great; especially for the sheer joy & entertainment it'll bring to everyone using and watching it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WYIC2UYFCPHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006O8Q7Y#wasThisHelpful","R1WYIC2UYFCPHK","A2AINLLX0560S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AINLLX0560S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And some other hair accessories, a plastic brush and a cute little hair dryer.She's wearing an outfit that looks like a little cheerleader outfit. I always thought the Baby Alive dolls were more like infants that need to be bottle fed. I guess they are growing up. This doll is a well made doll. Not a cheap plastic doll at all.

"Cute little dog frame Christmas ornament/magnet. It's well made and cute. Allows you to place a picture of your dog in the frame and hang it on your Christmas tree. It also has a magnet on the back so you could stick it on your refrigerator if you wanted too. I would be afraid it would get knocked off and break, though. I am putting it on my Christmas tree. The glazing is done well with red, white and green, and a touch of gold accents. I wish I could only knock half of a star off. The only problem with it is that the word dog is not easily detectable.

"These bags are really nice for cooking meats in. It keeps all the juices inside the bag and also prevents it from leaking onto your pan for easy cleanup.

The7y are great bags and they make cooking whole chickens and other meats so much easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R118IL09R01QUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LM495E#wasThisHelpful","R118IL09R01QUK","A2RYWPOL4NN2KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RYWPOL4NN2KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like these appetizer plates by Lenox. They are very minimalistic in design and can be used at any time of the year. Not just Christmas. The plates are white stoneware with black designs and are 6 inches across. I really don't know what else I can say about plates other than to comment on the glazing of the stoneware. It is even and well done. They are just really cute appetizer plates and they are microwave and dishwaasher safe. They do look nicer in person than the pictures show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2DTKBZLQTSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QN7LJA#wasThisHelpful","R3L2DTKBZLQTSE","A2RYWPOL4NN2KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RYWPOL4NN2KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These girls polo shirts have been the only garment by this company that I have not been 110% happy with. They are cute and they are made well. They also fit well and are comfortable, but the fabric is way too thin for girls I find it interesting that the fabric on the boys polo shirts seems to be of a heavier weight. If this shirt weren't so thin I would like it a lot. But as it is, I can't recommend it for girls.

"Very cute little Polo jumper dress uniform. This is a rather plain looking outfit, but I decided to do some machine embroidery and applique on it to spruce it up a bit. My granddaughters don't wear a uniform at their school, but this little outfit is something that they can wear, regardless.It is 55% cotton and 45% polyester it should wash well with minimal, if any, shrinkage. It is well made, so that gives me a great base to start with. The fit was good and fit as expected. Looks very cute on and is comfortable. I love the contrasting little belt that it comes with. It adds just a slight pop of color to an otherwise boring color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EV7P9XCK4H1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ANZ5JA#wasThisHelpful","R2EV7P9XCK4H1I","A2RYWPOL4NN2KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RYWPOL4NN2KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 18-year-old nephew was heavy into gaming and played his X-Box all day long every day. We were starting to worry about him not living life or working towards some kind of career. Finally, one day he just stopped. Got up off the couch and completely changed his life around. Now he is heavy into working out and taking better care of himself.When I saw this book, I immediately thought of him and decided to get it. He's really enjoying the book and says that he's learned a lot from it.Some of the things touched on in the book include: Carbs, Protien and fats, calorie cycling,what to eat,nutrition for muscle building,  and more. It also includes some good recipes for high protein foods and smoothies. There is also a section that gives you examples of a daily diet plan and in the back of the book there are some exercises for you to do. At the very back of the book there are several pages of blank weekly menu plans so you can map out your own diet plan. It's a great book for anyone who wants to get healthier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B3Y66JR4GMZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394959#wasThisHelpful","R1B3Y66JR4GMZS","A2RYWPOL4NN2KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RYWPOL4NN2KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a cute interactive learning toy in the form of a puzzle. It is made of wood. The pieces are all wood with a little peg on top for children to easily grasp. It plays 7 different sounds for the pieces when they are lifted up and put back in place. Teaches babies  hand/eye coordination, problem-solving and more. It is well made and because it is would it should last a long time.Although the puzzle or shape sorter, is nice, the sound effects didn't work so well, nor did they coincide with the pieces.

They have an around the neck flexible collar that is removable if you prefer to do without it.They were very easy to pair up with my phone via Bluetooth. I had no problem setting them up at all. I wish they came with a case similar to the Soundpeats I've reviewed, but it's not a deal breaker. These earbuds are very nice quality, I love the way they look and I love that they are white instead of the same old black ones.

The fit is just what it should be according to the size chart. The denim is nice and soft and not stiff at all. They fit just below the waist which is another reason they are so comfortable. Jeans that are higher up on the waist are painful to me and I can't wear them. I can wear these just fine and I don't feel like they are cutting me in half.I have chicken legs so the slim fit prevents these pants from being baggy in the rear and legs like some pants I have tried.

"I'm still loving these Mega Bloks sets. This SpongeBob SquarePants set is very cute. It was a lot of fun watching and helping my grandson put it together. You get both SpongeBob and Squidward's houses in this set. And you get the SpongeBob, Squidward and Plankton figures.The pieces go together very well and easily and stay together until you take them apart. There is a working paddy launcher, but it doesn't really work as well as I think it should. That's the only reason I docked it one star. I would only take half a star I was able. My grandchildren are really enjoying the Mega Bloks sets. They would make a great Christmas gift for boys or girls. Always happy​ with the Mega Bloks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EV30YO9YYQRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U29M53E#wasThisHelpful","R2EV30YO9YYQRI","A2RYWPOL4NN2KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RYWPOL4NN2KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We recently rescued a little pomeranian. She had lost most of her hair somehow, with only a some of her outer coat. Her undercoat was pretty much gone. You could look at her and see her skin perfectly through the wispy outer coat that she had. We took her to the vet to make sure there were no foxtails in her ears. There wasn't, but she did have an ear infection that we are treating. Once she's over that, she is getting a dental appointment to have her teeth cleaned.The Vet pegs her at about age 8 to 10. When she came to us, she was full of foxtails. I even had to pull a bloody one from between two of her teeth. Her breath could knock you over it is so bad, so I bought this along with some toothpaste and a toothbrush for dogs. I had hoped that would help until we get her in for the dental appointment. I gave some to all of the dogs, and only one of them actually likes it. But the little Pom hates it.It does freshen her breath, but only for a few minutes until the mint wears off. Hopefully, her dental appointment will fix the bad breath, or at the very least improve it a bit. I am happy to say that her undercoat is now growing in and you can't see her skin through her coat anymore. I am anxious to see how fluffy she gets. I love her to death, bad breath and all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VHHG7EYRRLDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHU4644#wasThisHelpful","R2VHHG7EYRRLDL","A2RYWPOL4NN2KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RYWPOL4NN2KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I stay away from all sugar substitutes including high fructose corn syrup. They all make me ill and if you have IBS or IBD you should definitely keep away from this stuff.  This is supposed to be a health food for people who work out. Put some fruit juice or real cane sugar in it to sweeten it up. It'll be worked off during the workout. Sugar has a bad rap.

"I was enticed to watch this film based on the two top notch actors (Jon Voight and Dermot Mulroney), but unfortunately the plot didn't really come together to allow them to show off their acting chops. Filmed in Anchorage, Alaska, the film stars Jon Voight as a veteran police detective, nearing retirement, but not ready to be out of the game. He specializes in cases involving missing children, though we never really know why until the end of the film. When the 7 year old niece of his boss (played by Dermot Mulroney) is kidnapped, Voight starts methodically working the case, but soon finds his case complicated by a locally famous radio psychic who claims that a ""spirit"" is putting him into contact with the lost child. The dramatic scenes where the psychic has flashes into another world are confusing and unexplained. Though highly skeptical at first Voight eventually starts to recognize that the psychic has some inexplicable ability to flash back and foretell events.The climactic scene at the end where Voight confronts the perpetrator ties up the plot with a neat bow; however there simply wasn't enough lead up to the climax to make it believable. The stark, beautiful wintry landscape of Anchorage, Alaska is one of the best features of the film, particularly the scenes of Voight flying over the mountains in his small plane, and certainly makes it different than other kidnapping / police procedural films.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33LI2KOUEM8E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CZ324W#wasThisHelpful","R33LI2KOUEM8E6","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the ""Secret Garden"" hardcover journal because of the attractive gold-embossed cover, lined pages, elastic closure and ribbon book mark. When on an International trip, I always keep a daily journal of activities, places visited, observations and things to follow up when I'm back home. The details fade away so quickly after a trip, particularly if it was a busy extended journey of 2 or 3 weeks, and I enjoy referring back to the journal to remind me of the wonderful places we've experienced. This sturdy journal was filled with the activities of a terrific two week trip to Scotland, and will remain on my bookshelves for many years to come.The lined pages of this 8""x6"" journal make it easy to write quickly, the bookmark lets me quickly access the last page written, and the elastic band allows me to fold other papers, tickets and small memorabilia into the journal and keep it all in place.

After ordering the replacement pads, I read further and discovered that the pads could be washed, so I rinsed off the original pair and they now work much better. Rinsing them off (you're not supposed to use soap), gets rid of much of the accumulated debris, oils, hairs, dead skin, etc. and allows the pads to make good contact with your skin.

"The Erayco MicroPlane Zester-Grater is extremely sharp and gets the job done quickly and with ease, whether you're grating cheese or zesting citrus fruit. This kitchen tool is quite light weight, with a comfortable rubber handle and a shiny stainless steel blade.

I was able to grate enough sharp cheddar for a quesadilla with just a few swipes of the blade, and it's equally efficient with very hard aged parmigiana cheese. The tool includes a plastic sheath for the blade which will ensure that it is stored safely in the drawer and that you do not accidentally scrape your knuckles on it when it's not in use. The blade is solidly embedded in the handle and does not wobble or bend during use. This has become an essential tool in my kitchen.

"This is a fun set of clip-on lenses which will allow you to increase the functionality of your smartphone camera and provide some interesting effects. I had tried another set of clip-on lenses from another supplier, but the clip wasn't long enough to position the lens over the camera's lens. The rubberized clip in this VicTsing lens set is long enough for my HTC One Remix smartphone and even fits over the case, so that I don't have to peel it off before using the lenses. Two clips are included, so that you can install the fisheye lens on one clip and the macro & wide angle lens on the other clip. The lenses can slide inside the clip-on bracket so that you can position them precisely over the camera lens.Though these are by no means professional quality lenses, I did not find that they degraded the image quality at all. The macro worked quite well in that it allowed you to focus on very close subjects - something the camera's built-in lens can't do. The wide angle lens just widened the field of view a little bit; but the fish-eye lens allowed a nearly 180 degree view, with only a little curvature around the edges. There was no vignetting at all with any of the lenses.I have included several example images below:1) close-up with camera's standard lens - it doesn't focus well on very close subjects2) close-up with clip-on macro lens - it focused very sharply - you could even see dust motes3) my office wall with standard camera lens4) my office wall with clip-on wide angle lens5) my office wall with fisheye lensI received a discounted sample for my evaluation and review, and can recommend this lens kit if you are interested in expanding the functionality of your smartphone camera.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27CLVZ25FUEFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF8FJ04#wasThisHelpful","R27CLVZ25FUEFA","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"President Reagan made notations in his diary every single day of his presidency, except perhaps for those days when he was hospitalized after being shot. He used writing to organize his thoughts and even wrote or edited most of his speeches. His true nature is revealed through his diary entries. He was not an intellectual giant, but he was a charismatic leader and a great orator. He brought people together and worked toward compromises and agreements. For instance, he will always be associated with tearing down the Berlin Wall.The book is quite long - nearly 800 pages in the printed version, and requiring more than 10 hours to read in the Kindle version. Brinkley, the editor, painstakingly retained Reagan's original words, spelling errors and all, though chose to summarize a significant portion of the diary (probably 50%), rather than include a word-for-word rendition. The summarized info is shown in italics. Classified info has also been redacted (shown with square brackets in the text). I started off carefully reading every word, but by about half way through the book, I thought I'd never finish so decided to just skim the italicized text.This is not an autobiography. There is no historical analysis, no retelling of historic events, no summarization of the issues of the day. For instance, though the Iran-Contra affair is mentioned many, many times, you won't be able to piece together what actually happened by reading the diary entries. Perhaps Reagan was not a deep or introspective thinker, or perhaps he just knew that his diaries would become public at some point, and didn't want to get too personal.Here are some of my observations from the diary:He had a modest ego. Even the ""Tear Down This Wall"" speech in Berlin in 1987 is somewhat downplayed, though he did mention that the speech was warmly received.He had little respect for the press and believed they manipulated situations and chose what news to present; there are quite a few negative comments about Sam Donaldson in particular.He had a contentious relationship with Tip O'Neill.His devotion to Nancy was legendary and he mentioned her absence with longing every time she had to be away from him. He was proud of her work on the ""Just Say No"" campaign.He hobnobbed with the rich and famous, particularly Hollywood types.He loved to watch movies, even the oldies but goodies. He didn't care for R rated or smutty movies though.He didn't use swear words. He writes d--n and h--l in his diary, and never a mention of the F word at all.He was sensitive and touched by many of the people that he met with hardships, frequently commenting that he ""puddled up"".He made friends with some of the most important global figures of the day - Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, Mother Theresa.His main form of recreation was horseback riding and cutting down trees.He was inordinately proud of his physical condition, always reporting that he got a good report from his many physical exams. In Chapter 4 he wrote ""I'm so healthy I had a hard time not acting smug.""He was very concerned about his approval rating, and mentioned it frequently; though he wasn't always rated highly, his final polls in office gave him the highest rating of any president ever.He was photographed thousands of times while in office; ""photo op"" is probably the most commonly recurring appointment on his calendarHe never did learn how to spell Gadaffi (leader of Libya); Quadhafy, Quadafy, Kadhafy, Qaddafi, Quadaffi, Quadafi were some of his attempts.He made history for 8 years, and strolling through his diary is a great reminder of the world changing events of the 1980's. On his last night in office he wrote ""Tomorrow I stop being President."" There's no way to know from his diary whether he was sad, excited or relieved at the end of his historic term in office. However, reading his diaries motivates me to look for a biography to fill in where his diary leaves off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37TAVUM6CJNCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RG1ORK#wasThisHelpful","R37TAVUM6CJNCY","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Enter the magical world of music as envisioned by Mitch Albom in ""The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto"". The voice of ""Music"" narrates the tale throughout most of this charming novel. It starts with the sentence ""I have come to claim my prize"" as we meet Music at Frankie Presto's funeral, where Music has come to claim back the gift of music that was loaned to Frankie throughout his life. Thus we know that Frankie was endowed with a prodigious talent, and how he uses that talent will unfold over the next 465 pages of this enthralling tale.Frankie learned to play the guitar from The Maestro, a blind musician in the small town in Spain in which Frankie was raised until he was put on a boat to travel to America alone, where he survived by his wits and his music. Though he was trained primarily in classical music, he learned rock, R&B, jazz and could switch between all genres at ease. He played and travelled with many well known artists through the 50's and 60's.The story is told is a somewhat linear fashion, though occasional flashbacks and flash-forwards can make it a bit confusing at times. The voices of other musical executives and musical talents also address the reader in a few chapters, including Darlene Love, Burt Bacharach, Tony Bennett, Wynton Marsalis and others. Albom actually collaborated with these musical talents and states in the Acknowledgements ""they trusted me to write in their voices.""Albom, a musician himself, demonstrates his considerable knowledge of the music business and several musical genres. He writes that ""everyone joins a band in this life. One way or another, the band breaks up.""  The band is a simile for the human connections and communities that we surround ourselves with. Though much of Frankie's journey through life was troubled and lonely, he formed some very important bands, in particular the love of his life, Aurora, who he met when she was just a girl.Though Frankie makes some important connections, he is always plagued by the thought that he was abandoned as a child and did not know his real family. His quest for that knowledge is the underlying theme of the novel.Albom has a wonderful ability to create character through dialogue that is sometimes spare and concise, sometimes eloquent but always interesting and full of meaning. The unique device of ""Music"" as the main narrator is unusual and somewhat odd at first, so it took me a bit to get into the rhythm of the novel, but once I got the hang of it, I couldn't put it down. It's a marvellously creative and entertaining novel which I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BHGL4LXSZNZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062294415#wasThisHelpful","R3BHGL4LXSZNZL","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Smithsonian Engagement Calendars for several years, and find that they fit my retirement life style just fine. Though I use an on-line calendar that I view and update on my smartphone and get appointment reminders real-time, I like to keep the Smithsonian calendar on my desk to note other daily activities. I use it as a sort of brief journal to note what I did on a particular day, and to record a few ""to-dos"" for the upcoming days. From time to time, I also refer back to journals from past years, so I keep them stored on my bookshelf.The calendar includes one page per week with the opposite page featuring a beautiful full color photograph of an item from the Smithsonian collections. Each photograph is accompanied by a brief description of the genesis and significance of the item. There is no unifying theme to the images, so it's sort of like wandering through the nation's attic to see what is stored there.If you decide to use the calendar as your primary calendar to note all appointments and obligations, it is small enough to carry in a handbag and weighs only 10 ounces.

The blades are very sharp and give a nice clean cut, leaving no jagged edges on the stems. The padded handles make them comfortable to use and the light weight eliminates hand fatigue. The small clip between the handles locks the blades safely together.

"I have several Barefoot Contessa cookbooks and enjoy using each one. Though Barefoot in Paris is an older book (published in 2004), I purchased it recently after a 3 week river cruise in France during which we enjoyed fabulous French food. I wanted to incorporate more French cuisine into my repertoire, and knew that Ina Garten's recipes are always well written, well tested and easy to replicate at home. Some of the recipes aren't particularly French, but rather an American adaptation, but that's fine with me. Some of the recipes are repeated from her other cookbooks, such as Lentil Sausage Soup, which I highly recommend. Other predictable French favorites are included, such as Boeuf Bourgignon, Creme Brlée and Brioche loaves.The cookbook is printed on large glossy pages with generous use of beautiful photography throughout. There is plenty of white space on the page for your own notes, and helpful notes. You can plan a entire meal from the included sections: To Start, Lunch, Soup and Salad, Dinner, Vegetables and Dessert. Or you can browse through and just select one recipe for your menu.The recipes are achievable by a cook with a modest amount of skill in the kitchen, as long as you carefully follow the steps in sequence and make sure you have on hand the necessary ingredients and tools. I like the fact that nearly every recipe is accompanied by a photograph to help you graze with your eyes but also to help with plating and serving ideas.Whether you're looking for a new book to add to your collection, or one to gift, ""Barefoot in Paris"" would be a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N5YE1S88FWW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400049350#wasThisHelpful","R3N5YE1S88FWW7","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a small free sample bottle from the manufacturer for trial and review and tested it out immediately. It arrives with a small section of light colored wood flooring with 2 white scratches so that you can try it out first before putting it on your flooring if you are at all skeptical. It did work just fine to darken the white scratches on the sample, so I applied it to a scratch on my living room floor that has been there for years. Oddly enough, the product is clear in color and has no dyes. It is rather thick and sticky, but easy enough to rub into the scratch. It does not have a strong or overwhelming scent. It took several hours to dry completely, after which I buffed off the remaining residue with the soft included cloth. The scratch is no longer white. Now it is a similar golden brown as the rest of the flooring, though upon close inspection I can still see the scratch. You should note that this is not recommended for dark wood, only light woods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQQ0Q3FPITQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6U31M8#wasThisHelpful","R3SQQ0Q3FPITQK","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Normally I need to read my Kindle for 30 minutes or more to drop off, but with these caplets I can only read for about 15 minutes. I haven't noticed any appreciable difference in joint pain, but I don't really have a lot of aches and pains to begin with.However, during these weeks that I have been taking the caplets I have been having some really weird and disturbing dreams which actually result in sleep disturbance and awake times throughout the night.

"Though this film reveals a lot about Hoover's tactics and underhanded techniques, it fails as a pure documentary since it is so one-sided and does not give Hoover credit for any of the good things that happened to the FBI and in law enforcement during his years in the Bureau. J. Edgar Hoover reigned over the FBI for 48 years, and is famous for transforming the formerly small Bureau of Investigation into a huge, powerful and far-reaching organization by the time of his death in 1972. His power and connections ensured that he was not removed from his position when new presidents were elected.Hoover remains somewhat of an enigma in that his overbearing personality, underhanded techniques and abuse of civil liberties were rampant, and yet his personal life was so clouded and secretive. This was not covered in the documentary at all. If you are a student of history and are interested in learning more about Hoover, this film might be a resource; however it is by no means fair or unbiased and should be regarded as only one part of the story of Hoover.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3C1WWAZEBHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005O5CS#wasThisHelpful","R3A3C1WWAZEBHA","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Luseta Coconut Milk Shampoo and Conditioner are nicely packaged in matching brown dispensers. Unfortunately, the fact that the containers are identical except for the word ""Shampoo"" on one and ""Conditioner"" on the other makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other when I'm in the shower without my eyeglasses on. To exacerbate the problem, the product in both bottles is the same scent and cream color. A suggestion to the manufacturer would be to make the ""Shampoo"" and ""Conditioner"" labels much larger or in a different color ink.I always pay special attention to product details when evaluating a complimentary sample such as this one. I really like the fresh organic scent of this product. The coconut scent is subtle, not as strong as sunscreen, and it doesn't leave a strong scent after your hair is rinsed. One squirt of the  shampoo is enough to work up a generous lather in my short hair. I try to minimize the amount of shampoo used so that I don't spend a long time rinsing it out (to conserve water during the drought). The shampoo is quickly rinsed out, leaving my hair squeaky clean. One small squirt of the conditioner is all I need, and it rinses out quickly with no oily residue; however this conditioner leaves my hair too soft and fly-away with no enough texture to hold the style.

"I agreed to accept a complimentary sample for my evaluation and review because I've become a convert to the benefits of Vitamin C to renew skin and reduce dark spots. This toner has a pleasant scent, and dries quickly; however, I don't really like spraying anything on my face. It's too easy to get it in your eyes, you can't control the application to make sure all of your skin is covered, and there's always overspray that lands on the countertop or floor. Nevertheless, it's easy to spritz a quick spray on the face mid-day after my makeup has already been applied since it won't mess up the makeup, so I will continue to use it from time to time for that reason.

"I've been using this product for more than a month after receiving a complimentary sample for trial and review. I know that the combination of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid works to reduce pigmentation as I have had nice results with another InstaNatural Vitamin C serum as well as other brands of serums. This cream features the addition of Retinol to fill in wrinkles. Retinol can irritate skin which is apparently the reason for quite a few of the 1 and 2-star reviews. I did not experience any unpleasant side effects from the ingredients - no rashes or bumps or pimples; therefore I will continue to use it until the bottle is depleted. The cream has a pleasant benign scent and non-greasy texture which is quickly absorbed into the skin. I haven't yet seen any reduction in the appearance of wrinkles, though I definitely have fewer dark spots.The cream leaves my skin feeling slightly sticky, and my skin still feels a bit stretched and dry after the cream is absorbed, so I end up having to use a dollop of my usual moisturizer over top of this cream. However, I do have very dry skin and others with less dry skin probably won't have this same experience.What I don't like about the product is the pump type dispenser which emits the cream from the top of the nozzle. This makes it a bit messy, and you end up with cream smeared around the top of the dispenser and inside the cap.

"The ECOHIP bags weigh just 1.7 ounces each and can be stuffed into a pocket or purse or backpack so that you're never caught at a store without a bag to tote your purchases home. I have been using cloth grocery bags for years, and many communities in California have now outlawed the use of plastic bags. That leaves paper bags as your only choice and stores are now required to charge for bags, in order to encourage customers to bring reusable bags. Therefore, I keep a stock of cloth bags in the trunk of my car and also in my home for those times when I walk to the market. However, I usually forget to bring a bag when I go to the mall or a department store. These net bags, since they fit in my purse, will ensure that I never arrive at a store without a bag. The bags stretch considerably to hold a lot more than you would guess at first glance, and the woven handles make it easy to carry a load. My only complaint is that items can get caught in the netting and require some tugging to get them in or out.

"Opening a delivery of Cailler L'Art du Brut chocolate is almost as delightful as the first bite into this sumptuous treat. The carton is labeled ""Certified Frustration Free Packaging"" and includes a manufacture date and an expiration date. The carton lid folds back to reveal two large 6.87 ounce bars of chocolate, each encased in an elegant red and brown paper sleeve with gold embossed print. Inside is a thick scarlet red paper wrapper imprinted with a brief history of the Cailler family brand, and inside that a thin silver foil covering the chocolate bar. By the time you start to peel back the foil and get the first whiff of rich dark chocolate you will be salivating!The chocolate is a dark, smooth brown with whole almonds peeking through the top layer of chocolate which has been drizzled over the nuts and cranberries. The bar easily separates into 5 rows, each with 4 individual bites for a total of 20 servings in a bar. The rich flavor of the dark chocolate, nuts and cranberries explodes in your mouth at first bite, though you will chew slowly to savor the experience. The chocolate is just slightly bitter, and definitely not overly sweetened. Each bite is so satisfying that you will want to make the bar last as long as possible, rationing out the individual chunks slowly and hiding the rest from your spouse (he still doesn't know where I keep my stash).This would make an excellent gift, but I would suggest gift wrapping the box immediately upon receipt so that you are not tempted to open the chocolates...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKP41SBYN0QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGNDS#wasThisHelpful","R3CKP41SBYN0QF","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My review is for the audio CD narrated by Peter Giles who is the same voice used throughout all of the Mickey Haller series. Hearing his voice helps to get me right back into the world inhabited by Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer. Mickey has been representing a long string of clients in their foreclosure proceedings following the collapse of the housing market in 2008-2009. He has become so busy that he has taken on a young recently graduated associate to keep track of all the filings associated with such cases. One of his clients, Lisa Trammel, has become very vocal about her case, staging frequent protests aimed at the bank, until the bank took out a restraining order against her. When an officer of the bank is found murdered in the building's garage, she is immediately identified as the prime suspect. Haller continues to represent her, and as is normal with most defense attorneys, he doesn't question whether she is guilty of the crime. He begins to build a case that she was framed and intends to convince the jury that there is reasonable doubt based on the thin evidence.As is the case in all Connelly novels, there are also subplots woven throughout; in this story, the on-again, off-again relationship of Mickey and his ex-wife Maggie occupies most of Mickey's time when he is not in court or preparing his case.I enjoyed the detailed rendition of the trial and the maneuverings of both Haller and the prosecutor, as well as the judge. The courtroom drama is interesting and engaging. But the trial, and the narrative, just sort of ends with a whimper, not with a bang, and the eventual conclusion of the novel is somewhat anti-climactic and a bit predictable. Nevertheless, I was entertained for many days while commuting and running errands, and found 95% of the novel to be very interesting. I will soon be looking for my next Connelly audio CD novel, since they always help to fill my otherwise idle drive time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OQBE37MIHB30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=044655667X#wasThisHelpful","R3OQBE37MIHB30","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Little Tikes shopping cart is already a huge hit with my 10 month old granddaughter who just started to walk. She just loved standing up, toddling along and pushing her cart all over the family room and dining room. It worked better on the carpet than the wood floor, because the carpet slowed her down a bit. She still needs to be accompanied on her cart excursions to make sure she doesn't go too fast and fall down, but it won't be long until she's zooming around on her own. Since she is still quite wobbly, we needed to make the cart heavier, so filled the basket with two 5 lb. bags of flour. When mom and dad take the cart back home with them, they will put sand in the bottom to make it more stable and heavy. Baby loves throwing her toys out of the cart, but we are hopeful that she will also learn, with much encouragement, to put her toys IN the cart. When my girls were toddlers so many years ago, we had a grocery cart and would play the ""pick up"" game every evening before bath/bed time, zooming around to gather up all the loose toys and put them back in the toy basket.

"I needed a new USB flash drive to move files between computers at a site at which I volunteer as a computer teacher; so when I received the offer to receive a complementary ""Thor's Hammer"" drive for evaluation and review, I quickly jumped at the chance. I like the fact that the drive case is fairly substantial in size, distinctive in design, shiny and a bit heavy. It means that I will be less likely to leave it behind in the computer when I leave the site, and that I will be able to find it readily in my handbag or computer bag. The 16 GB drive itself is a bit stiff to push out of the case, but locks into position when exposed so that you can easily insert it into the USB drive slot on the computer. However, if the USB slots are already occupied by other devices, such as the dongle for my fitbit and the bluetooth receiver for my wireless mouse, you will probably need to remove one or more of them to make room for the head of the hammer. Copying files to the drive is quick and easy - just drag and drop to this external drive.

"I have had a bottle of this Old English scratch cover polish for years. A little goes a long way. I bought it originally for the top of my cherry wood dining table. One of the cats chased another across the top of the table and dug in her claws to try to get a grip on the slippery shiny surface, leaving a good sized gouge in the surface where lighter toned wood was exposed. The polish filled in the obvious scratch very effectively. In addition, to filling scratches, nicks and dings, Old English also cleans and polishes the furniture to a high shine. More recently I have used the stain/polish on my cherry wood cabinets in the bathrooms. The cabinetry had a few nicks and worn spots, particularly around the handles where your fingernails bump into the wood constantly. The stain makes the scratched and nicked areas much less noticeable, and the cabinets now look almost as good as new.Be sure to shake the bottle thoroughly before using, use an old cloth that you can throw away, and be careful not to spill the liquid on carpets or your clothing.

On the other hand, since they're single use cups, perhaps you won't feel as bad about contributing to the waste stream. The bright logo and trademark orange and blue colors make them a fun addition to any gathering of the Gators fans. My son-in-law is an alum, still follows the team maniacally and will love dispensing some of his home brew into these fun and colorful party cups!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30A9ZVVDJF4V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHJMGOC#wasThisHelpful","R30A9ZVVDJF4V8","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 3 tri-pronged ""bones"" in the package can be snapped apart into 3 treats, for a total of 9 treats. Since the Boston Terrier is a medium sized dog (~25 lbs.), I decided that the full treat was too big for him and broke it into 3 sections. He loves to chew, and settled down with the bone treat for a nice chewing session. He seemed to like the flavor and texture, but he's not at all a picky eater and scarfs up everything you toss at him. The treat isn't as hard as the plastic nylabones I've purchased in the past, so didn't take him long to demolish. The treats do somewhat resemble meat in texture and odor, though the resemblance to filet mignon requires a very active imagination! It's impossible to determine whether the relatively short chewing session helped clean his teeth at all. My only reservation about the treat is the cost. At >$1 per serving, it's too costly to be anything other than an occasional treat, particularly since the teeth-cleaning claim can't be validated.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19SZHYLFI3JTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DH4LRK#wasThisHelpful","R19SZHYLFI3JTV","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I obtained the package of Huggies Little Snugglers (size 2) for use by my granddaughter when she visits. I haven't purchased diapers in years, and all I can say, is ""wow, how the technology has changed!"". The elastic waist and legbands keep the messes in, the material is as soft and pliable as fabric, and the indicator tells you when to change so you don't have to stick your fingers in there and get a surprise, like we had to do in the good old days of the 1980's! The diapers are compact, yet sturdy and effective. And they're cute too with the little designs, though I'm sure baby doesn't care a bit about that! The case of 186 diapers is divided into 3 plastic shrink-wrapped bags of 62 diapers, each probably about enough for up to 10 days depending on how messy your little darling is. So, one case should last a month. And of course, with Amazon shipping times and automatic replenishment you should never run out and be heading to the convenience store late at night or at an inconvenient time...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z6E7DLUUVARW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB0WGL8#wasThisHelpful","R1Z6E7DLUUVARW","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Other than the typical complaint that the ink cartridges don't last forever, I have found the Brother cartridges to be well made, easy to install and they provide nice even color. We replace the black cartridge far more often than the color. We really like our Brother printer and use it frequently, but indeed over the lifetime of the printer we will probably spend much more in ink than the value of the printer.

"I received a complementary sample several months ago for trial and review, but deferred posting my review until I had used the product for a significant amount of time. Having tried other Vitamin C serums in the past year, I can now say that I'm hooked on Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid. This one has a higher concentration of Vitamin C (25%) and Hyaluronic Acid (20%) than other serums I've used. The eye dropper applicator and brown glass bottle are similar to the delivery system used in other products. Apparently the brown glass bottle is needed to protect the serum from light intrusion which can diminish the effectiveness of Vitamin C.What is quite different about this serum is the bright orange tint and refreshing citrus scent. The orange tone allows you to see where you're spreading the serum, but it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any colored residue. I didn't notice any residual tint or stickiness as others have reported, nor did I have any breakouts or rashes. It has little or no moisturizing effect, so you need to apply your normal moisturizer as soon as the serum dries.The good news is that the serum really works to lighten pigmented spots on the skin. I had several sun spots on my cheeks which have almost completely disappeared! Those spots are a hallmark of old age, and eliminating them makes me happier to look in the mirror, though I wouldn't say that I look years younger...I noted that quite a few of the low-star reviews are for people who used the product for only a week before reporting or those that had some reaction to the ingredients. Of course, if you experience a rash or reaction of any kind, you should stop using the product immediately; otherwise, don't give up too soon. It took a long time for the sun spots to develop, and will take time for them to fade. At least finish the 1 oz. bottle before deciding if this product will become a permanent addition to your daily skin maintenance regimen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CV52RFRZHU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2B4TQG#wasThisHelpful","R13CV52RFRZHU8","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started using the brush immediately after receipt, and when I remarked how great it felt against my scalp my husband had to try it out too. The curved, large surface with rubber tips on the bristles gives you a very pleasant head massage, and in the process also detangles and smooths the hair. So I give it 5 stars for brushing and massaging.As a styling brush when used with my blow dryer, I felt that it was just too large and rather unwieldy. I sort of turned it on an angle and used only a portion of the brush to catch the hair where the stream of hot air is aimed. As a styling brush, I would rate it only 3 or 4 stars, though I do believe that for long hair it would be much more effective than for my short hair.I received a complementary sample for my evaluation and review, and I heartily recommend it for the brushing/scalp massaging feature. I'm really enjoying using it several times a day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IN556BO40A8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2C1JZA#wasThisHelpful","R2IN556BO40A8X","A2BAAKZHSUGCDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BAAKZHSUGCDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I placed the coiled string of lights and solar panel outdoors immediately after receipt to allow the sun to charge the battery. Unfortunately, the sky has been rather gray for a few days so I haven't been able to fully charge it. By the second day I was able to turn on the lights and test the various modes, blinking and steady. The light bulbs are quite small, but emit a pleasant golden twinkling light. The strung itself is sturdy and doesn't tangle easily. We have strung the lights along the top of a fence with the charger resting on top of a fence post to get the best light. 40 feet is a generous length which allowed us to run the string the entire length of the patio, hooking it to small nails. We're really enjoying seeing the lights come on automatically at dusk and stay on until well after dark.

"I have been on the lookout for a cute, chic but complete set of bags for my daughter for her birthday. When I ran across this set, I knew that she needed it!

The bags/pieces are all very well made, each piece being sewn/constructed very nicely, no loose threads of any kind. The leatherette is soft and actually really gives the look and feel of real leather.My only real complaint with the set is there was a bit of an off smell to them---though I have noticed this to be common when ordering handbags from China. They did include a little scent packet, which I thought was a nice touch and something I have never seen before.I think that this set is a really great value for all of the pieces that you get.

"I have been hunting for a little handheld fan, as I get so super hot, even in the winter time! I wanted something I could easily carry around with me wherever I go, store in my purse and something that wont eat through batteries. I ordered this little pink fan, but when it arrived, despite being super cute, I wasn't sure if it was going to get the job done. It was in perfect condition, arrived in two pieces---the power bank and then the top actual fan bit. It is easy to snap together and it quite sturdy after doing so. You simply charge up your power bank and can take this little baby anywhere with you. It has four different speeds and I was so pleasantly surprised to realize that it WAS powerful enough for my cooling needs! It's strong and effective and keeps me quite cool! I can adjust it to what I need depending on where I am and can easily charge and store it in my bag...everything I was looking for!

"I have had an idea in my head for quite some time now...to take a beautiful rustic lantern and hang on my porch with a large flameless candle inside that can ""burn"" at night time and have a really beautiful but safe effect.

After ordering it arrived quickly, undamaged and even more beautiful than I could imagine. It is well made, easy to assemble ( haha if you can even call it assemble! ) and just absolutely lovely. It has a very rustic beautiful weathered look that I love and looks totally gorgeous with my candle inside---even better than I had imagined! I looks simply stunning hanging on my porch and I am extremely pleased with the look and size! It is large enough to see from the street, which I love.

"My kids have been complaining for quite some time about not having anything to sit on...because, like kids, they like to lounge around in various rooms of the house---apparently the living room sofas just aren't good enough ;) When they were smaller they had little tiny beanbags, but have since outgrown them and really wanted something else they can lounge on while watching movies, playing games or reading books! I saw a great review for these particular ""bean bags"" and thought that they would be perfect! This bag arrived quickly to my home, nicely/securely packaged, in fact, it was a little frustrating to open these out of their package, though I am not listing this as a complaint, because my bag was safe and not damaged in any way.This giant bag was easy to ""assemble"" and required little effort. My kids had a blast slamming the foam around attempting to get it to expand before placing it inside of the case. In fact, this was a big fun activity that they enjoyed for a few hours! The micro suede cover is very well made--all stitches tight and secure and has a very easy flowing zipper. The material is SO soft and very cozy feeling! Very nice! We have had this bag for a while now and I can say that this cover washes up VERY well. My kiddos have gotten so many stains on it and ALL have washed off and these case is still as nice as when we received it.This memory foam bag is a very nice size, very comfortable and can fit not only fit my smaller kids, but my larger kids as well---even though the listing says up to 7 years. They have even been using it as a crash pad and it has been the perfect size and held up well!This is THE nicest bean bag we have every every owned and I am so glad to have chosen one with memory foam as opposed to the cheapies we have owned in the past.

Multiple people in my family have allergies and sensitivities to metals preventing us from wearing your typical wrist watch. This watch is made of wood for the most part and is not only great for those of us with allergies, but it looks absolutely fabulous!This watch arrived nicely packaged in a box that would be perfect for gifting as well as the watch is wrapped around a small jewelry pillow for not only looking nice, but for protection of the watch as well. I received my watch quickly and it was everything I had hoped for and more!This watch is very lightweight, but sturdy at the same time. I can see this watching lasting us for years to come, it is that well made. The wood is very high quality and just looks super stunning. The lovely black color gives it a very eye popping look that has gotten several compliments so far! I addition to the time, this watch allows you to check the day of the week, the date and has a 24 hr display. This watch is gender neutral, but might be a bit big for those with very small wrists.

It is very bright and vibrant and my kids think it's really neat with all of the very retro looking flowers. It is a thick very well made blanket with no loose threads or stitching. It is indeed waterproof and makes their ground sitting experience a much better one! We are quite pleased with the blanket, the only issue being that we couldn't store is the way it arrived to us...it just refused to conform back to the original storage position, but oh well.

"My kids love playing/pretending with doll houses as well as working on project and building and I thought this 3d foam 121 piece dollhouse would combine the best of both worlds and be a lot of fun for them. My package arrived quickly to my home---the house came in a bright/vibrant box that was very detailed and would be great for giving as a gift. The pieces come in foam sheets that you or your child will pop out and put together. It was a snap to pop the pieces out, and easy peasy to determine where everything belongs and what goes with what, however my children did have a teeny bit of trouble getting everything put together and the pieces securely locked into place. I was able to do it and showed them how to do it a bit harder and get the pieces to stick, but it still took them a while to really get the hang of it. Once together everything was REALLY very neat! It all looked do cute and the pieces are able to move and be used like a real functioning doll house---at a fraction of the price! I had never heard of a foam doll house, but it's a great inexpensive idea for your kids to have a TON of fun--both assembling and imagining with!

I have been on the hunt for nice quality art smocks that they can use at home that can easily be cleaned and not just fall apart after one use.

"I absolutely adore these type of soft soled leather shoes for babies...I am always on the lookout for cute pairs for my son and this pair really stood out! I have never ever seen a pair that looked like cars, let alone a beautiful gold color! These shoes arrived to my home in great condition and even more adorable than I had imagined!

These shoes are very soft, the leather is gorgeous, very high quality and these shoes are very well made. There are no loose threads or mistakes and they are sure to hold up for years and years---I know with a leather soft shoe I purchased in the past with comparable quality I have had for TEN years and they are still going, so I am sure to be able to pass these on!

After placing my order, my boots arrived quickly and nicely boxed -- and not bunched up like other boots I have ordered in the past.Immediately I was impressed with the absolutely rich tan colors of these boots--the two contrasting shades compliment each other beautifully and look very high quality as well as high end. I love the slight heel that these have, it adds a bit of height and style to these boots without making them uncomfortable---something I was quite worried about...I have issues with my knees and finding something that is comfortable for long periods of time is very important to me. The other thing I was a bit worried about was the boots fitting my calves. I am plus-sized and have slightly chubby legs and calves---not extremely large, but def. not small---and boots in this style do not always fit, Much to my delight, these did. They are a little bit tight nad took a little force the first try, but they do work and still manage to be comfy.These boots are a nice quality, especially for the price and seem to be holding up quite well.

"Works great, especially for the cost. I tested this on the inside and outside walls of my home, and on a hot stove. The inside walls registered within  a degree or so of the measured temperature in the room, and the stove and outside walls were plausibly hotter and colder, respectively. The integrated laser is a very nice feature, and appears to coincide well with the actual spot temperature reading, at least based on my tests from several feet away (aimed at my stove).

"We have a variety of Z-Wave lights in our house, both from Leviton and GE, and I can say without reservation the the Levitons are worth the extra money. They respond faster and more reliably, they are much smaller and easy to install, especially in older electrical boxes, and they look a heck of lot better, too. We've also had a couple GE-branded Z-Wave light switches die on us, but never a Leviton. The Levitons also have the option of integrating with Leviton scene controllers, which lets you do neat stuff like program in complex ""scenes"" that activate with the single button. For example, in your living room you can have one button that makes all the lights on bright, like you'd want during the day, and another than dims some of the lights, and turns off certain other lights to avoid glare while watching a movie at night, etc.One thing to be aware of when installing these is that a neutral wire is required. If you don't know what that is, have an electrician install these. Many light switches, especially in older homes, are wired without access to a proper neutral wire. You might be able to get by wiring in ground instead of neutral, but I wouldn't recommend it; it's not safe. So, before you order this check out the wires in the switch you're going to replace and make sure that a neutral wire is available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6910J4IMI1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEWQY6C#wasThisHelpful","R1D6910J4IMI1J","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: Very well-built camera, with the highest quality picture and video of any home webcam I've tested. While others advertise HD, this is the first camera I've tested that truly is. The setup is relatively easy, though I had a few hiccups due to the instructions leaving out a few details (see below for some tips). The only caveat to this camera is that it, like any other web-service-based camera, is a potential security vulnerability. If Nest ever got hacked, somebody would potentially have access to a device inside your home's LAN.WHAT IS GOOD:- Relatively easy setup for a webcam- High quality video- Easy to use mobile device app- Reliable web service owned by Nest, not third-party company- Free to use web service with reasonable functionality- Very solid and heavy metal construction makes it easy to positionWHAT IS NOT SO GOOD:- Setup is almost too simple; there is little help if something goes wrong- Not possible to use completely secured within LAN; will only work with internet-based service- Can take a while to start up- Requires subscription for full functionalityTIPS FOR SETTING UP: There are a few things you should know when setting this up that aren't included in the two sentences of instructions that come with the camera. First, even though it will happy to let you try, you CAN NOT use 5 GHz WiFi networks with this camera. The setup will fail but it won't give you any helpful feedback on why. Had to learn this the hard way. Second, you need to stand very close (or leave your phone close) to the camera until the entire setup process is completed. They don't tell you this, but the setup is done by connecting to the camera over a short-range bluetooth connection, so you can't stray too far from the camera while the setup is being processed. If the setup process did a better job of handling these errors (I never got any useful feedback from the app) I'd give this five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUMVFCV5NFI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBJGUA2#wasThisHelpful","R2KUMVFCV5NFI4","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very well constructed headphones, with decent weight and heavy duty materials. The sound is very bass heavy, so it's clear these are oriented at consumer tastes, not the flat response of professional headphones. The high end is not as clear as some headphones I've used, but overall the sound is excellent for this price point. I recommend them, especially if you like bass and listen to pop or hip hop. The iPhone-compatible microphone is a nice touch, and between that and the high sensitivity of the headphones (i.e. they can get very loud without any need for an amplifier) they are a great match for an iPhone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R104W2GGL1UPUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R104W2GGL1UPUD","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: Fairly high quality camera, easy to configure with any web browser.

(I know this by looking at my firewall logs, which show the camera trying to connect to IP address 50.18.57.254, which is evidently a server running on Amazon's cloud services infrastructure.)I don't think the unauthorized ""dial out"" is nefarious, so I recommend the camera with the only reservation being that if you are really paranoid about security, you should block the camera from dialing out at your firewall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R235ALPPDF8JF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPR7UEK#wasThisHelpful","R235ALPPDF8JF1","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE BOTTOM LINEThis is an expensive and inefficient way to poorly press your clothes and make them smell nice. It will yield good results for a fraction of your clothes, and yet not save much time over ironing. This is only worth buying and will only save time and money if you live far away from a dry cleaners and predominantly wear clothes that must be dry cleaned. That said, given that it doesn't actually clean, and is only marginally effective at removing wrinkles, I'm not sure it's even remotely fair for the company to compare this to the cost of dry cleaning. At the end of the day, this is not cost effective for the quality of result.WHAT IS GOOD-For a few shirts and pants I tried, they actually came out less wrinkled than they went in (but not nearly as good as if they'd been ironed).-For outer wear like sport coats and suits the process is very easy, and it does yield an noticeable improvement. There is legitimate time savings, though perhaps not money, from using this on such items.WHAT IS BAD-Getting pants or dress shirts to hang right if you're tall is not easy. The hanger comes off way too easily while you're trying to get the stretchers attached, and there is barely enough room.-The results are mixed, and highly dependent on the material used. For many items, the Swash did absolutely nothing other than make it smell pretty.-It only does one item at a time. So, doing a shirt, pants, and a jacket will take 30-45 minutes, and will cost you about $8-$10, when you consider amortizing the cost of the Swash itself over its life. I'm not sure that's all that convenient or cost effective given that very marginal results you get from this.-There almost no way you're going to save money unless you live in Manhattan. I live right outside of Boston, an an area that's fairly expensive for most thing, and I can get a shirt dry-cleaned for less than $2, and a coat for about $7. Using the Swash costs about $1 for a pod (based on Amazon's lowest price) and the device itself is unlikely to last more than a few years (based on the warranty). So cleaning something with the Swash actually costs a couple dollars for most people. Unless you're only using this for jackets, you're not likely to save much money. Oh, and dry cleaning actually CLEANS and effectively removes wrinkles. This doesn't clean at all and removes wrinkles with mixed effectiveness. Not sure it's really fair to compare it to dry cleaning when it doesn't clean.I got this for free, and yet I don't plan to buy any replacement pods for it, the results were so underwhelming.

It's easy to attach (just make careful bite of the instructions, which let you know that there is one place on the lower left corner you need to start attaching the two halves, and another spot right next to it that you pull on to separate.The mechanism for attaching the two halves is rather clever, and acts sorry I'd like a zipper, creating a very solid and reliable connection.I tested the case for several hours in about a foot of water, and there were no noticeable leaks.Touch ID works just fine when the case is on.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XLBV6ZS1S1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HCPIWC#wasThisHelpful","R37XLBV6ZS1S1E","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The lamp is more than bright enough to read by, but probably not much more than that. My wife has been using it as a nightstand lamp for reading, and it's been great.

However, the convenience of being able to use this wirelessly is more than worth it.

"I was interested in this wallet because my current leather one keeps bending and damaging the magnetic strips on my credit cards. However, I was a bit concerned that a metal wallet would be uncomfortable to have in my back pocket, especially when sitting. That fear was completely unfounded; this wallet is thin enough that you don't notice it at all. In fact, the first few times I went out with this one, I kept thinking I forgot my wallet.This is big enough for six plastic credit cards, or you can stuff multiple paper cards (like coffee stamp cards) and bills in one of the slots. You really can't double-up credit cards, however, so if you have more than five credit cards you're going to have trouble using this wallet.The construction is solid, with heavy spring steel used for the clasp mechanism, and a solid metal hinge on the back. I don't expect this to wear out any time soon.The only possible disadvantage to this wallet (besides the obvious space limitation inherent in a thin metal wallet) is also probably an advantage for some. As they claim, this wallet does indeed make it impossible for a hacker to pull information off of any RFID cards you have (such as subway cards or building access card). However, that means that in order to use any of those cards, you'll have to open the wallet and take them out. This is obviously less convenient than just taking your wallet out and holding it up against the card reader, but if you're really paranoid (or live near MIT) you may think the extra security is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SQYZ0JGMLR92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149RZKZY#wasThisHelpful","R2SQYZ0JGMLR92","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many Chinese made cables are not actually Apple certified, but are actually using reverse engineered chips. Unfortunately for people trying to save money with these knock-off cables, Apple has ways of breaking these fake cables with iOS updates. So, even if a cheap cable works now, you have to wonder if it will work after an update.Well, I can answer that for you, unfortunately, in the case of these cables. I'm currently beta testing iOS 9.0, and I can tell you these appear to be fake cables, not truly Apple certified. Neither my iPhone nor my iPad recognize these cables. However, the Belkin cable I bought recently still works, so I'm confident there isn't a bug in the beta version of iOS 9 that is causing them to break. Most likely, iOS 9 includes a firmware update that breaks some reverse-engineered, non-MFi certified cables, and everybody who has these cables will suddenly find them to be useless when iOS 9 is officially released later this year.I wish it weren't so hard to trust these Chinese companies, but this isn't the first time this has happened, and it won't be the last time.

"I had a lot of trouble connecting to this, initially. It turned out that this isn't yet compatible with iOS 9. (It's currently in beta test, so it's fair that they don't work with it yet, but be aware that when it's released early this Fall, it may still not work.) Once I tried using an old iPod that was using 8.4, everything worked. It's not a flawless setup, as it takes a very long time to connect to the Guardzilla WiFi, but it worked.Video quality is fine. Not great, but perfectly serviceable for security purposes. The night vision doesn't work terribly far if there are objects in the field of view nearby (which get too much IR, causing the camera to underexpose far objects). The best place is in a corner away from furniture. This will also give the motion sensor a good view of the room.I tried talking to my kids with the build-in microphone and speaker, but the sound was too weak for them to hear me. I tested it myself, and it's indeed weak but could be used to talk to somebody if they knew to be standing next to it. You just can't expect to get anybody's attention in the house with it.The other reviewers are right about the loud clicking sound; for some reason the motion detector must be firing a relay that makes a really loud sound. I'm not sure why they needed a relay, but my guess is they used a prefab sub circuit designed for hard-wired security systems that needed a relay. They clearly don't need a relay for this application, so that's a bit of a design flaw, in my opinion. There's no need to make that much noise for something that should be all transistor.The industrial design is interesting, but unfortunately not very well-considered. The device is very unstable, and wants to tip forward. It just barely rests upright and any jostling will cause it to tip over. Not exactly what you want in a security device.All in all, while the device has some short-comings and could use some redesign, it does do what it is supposed to do. For $99, you probably aren't going to get a similarly capable device, so I recommend it for people protecting a small apartment or studio. For a whole house, it's not going to work, but if you just have one entrance, this is actually a very cost effective way to get some peace of mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCZZ7KYLMTMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEKXJ6U#wasThisHelpful","R1SCZZ7KYLMTMO","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this light. It's bright as all heck, and has a nice feature where you can set the light level by how many times you click. However, unlike other multilevel flashlights I've used, this one is smart enough to know that once you've chosen a setting, the next time you hit the power button it should just turn off, regardless of the light level. In other words, if you set it to dim, you don't have to cycle through ""bright flashing"" mode to turn it off.The flashlight doubles as a cell phone charger, and itself charges off of any USB port. Given that most cars these days have USB ports in the glovebox, a nice use for this light is to keep it charging in your glovebox, ready for use in an emergency.

"Bottom line: While not commercial quality, the microscope is good enough for home use and introducing kids to the science of microscopy. The image quality is not great due to over compression (at least on the Mac version of the software), but is more than good enough for educational purposes, especially considering the price.What is good:- Camera is easy to setup and use- Integrated lighting- High quality opticsWhat isn't so good:- Stand not very stable. The course focus adjustment has way too much play, making it hard to keep centered on a specimen- Lighting interferes with image when zoomed out- Mac software doesn't work well- Images overly compressed. (See some of the images attached.) Since this is actually just a video camera with a macro lens, the data coming off the microscope is compressed video. When taking snapshots, you're really just getting a frame of video, with all the blocking artifacts inherent to compressed video. The quality could have been MUCH better had they written firmware for the camera that allow high quality JPG frames to be sent over.Tips:- Zooming is handling by moving the entire camera up and down using the knobs on the stand (or manually, if you're holding it). Once you have the image the size you want, then focus the image using the knob on the camera itself.- Unless your sample is reflective, you generally want to use as much light as possible. At first the image will wash out, but just wait a second and it will adjust the exposure. The more light you have, the less noise you'll have in your image.NOTE: If your computer doesn't have a CD drive, you're going to need to download the software over the Internet. As far as I can tell, Crenova doesn't have a website for this purpose. However, this microscope is exactly the same hardware as the Celestron digital microscope, and I've confirmed that their software works on the Crenova. (It's likely all the same, provided by the same company that made this white label for both Celestron and Crenova.)

"My hair is thick, and grows pretty much straight out my head. The only way to have my hair take a style other than “mid-electrocution” is to use some sort of product. I’ve tried lots of different things (pomades, styling creams, not showering, Mobil 5W30) but I generally hated using them because they made my hair look and feel like that of a New Jersey bouncer. I really don’t like having greasy hair.I’m really glad I got to try this stuff. While it goes on like a regular styling cream, once it dries it actually makes your hair softer than before, and yet somehow stays in place. Basically, if you have thick unmanageable hair, this stuff will somehow change your hair on a molecular level to the normal hair of a person that dated in high school.It smells fine, but not something you normally associate with hair. Sort of like standing between a hair salon and an Italian restaurant, in terms of scent. I assume that's due to the Rosemary.So, given that this stuff is so great, why four stars instead of five? Because it’s overpriced. Jack Black recently lowered the amount of product, but kept the price the same. The tube you get is far less than half full. Unless they were losing money before, they are price gouging now.  You used to get about 18% more in a bottle than you do now. Unlike a pomade, you’ll go through a bottle of this fairly quickly with daily use, so I think $15 is a bit high. In fact, it works out to be about as expensive per ounce as the historical value of silver. Or $550 per gallon. No matter how you look at it, this is a lot of money for stuff you put in your hair. (Incidentally, the company is named not after the actor, who would never overcharge for hair product, but was a name completely made up by the company before the actor became well-known. Apparently, it sounded like an approachable name, somebody you would trust enough to not bother to check the weight on the package.)At the end of the day, I can definitely recommend this stuff, but also recommend that you try other less expensive options first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14YD9XZ3FE84H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKNJLRU#wasThisHelpful","R14YD9XZ3FE84H","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nature Valley is known for making candy and selling it as health food. I was hoping they were turning over a new leaf with this product, but they most certainly are not. They brag that they aren't using corn syrup, which is true, and sugar is the third ingredient. What they don't tell you is that there are three forms of sugar in the ingredients list, and when added together, they essentially make sugar the second ingredient.

"Bottom line: Does the job, but is cheaply made and poorly designed, with a metal cover that gets extremely hot very close to the knob that lowers the bread. More details follow.What's Good:Well, the toaster works, and it does toast bread and bagels fairly quickly and evenly.What's Bad:The construction is very cheap, with many of the mechanisms made out of plastic, and the controls with a flimsy feel to them. It doesn't feel like something that will last very long; I will update this review in a few months to say more about how well it holds up.The worst thing about this toaster is the poor design, however. Our prior toaster, a Kitchenaid, would get hot on the outside, but nothing that would burn you. Somehow they insulated the outer surface from the heat of the interior. However, after just toasting once, the top surface of this unit gets hot enough to really burn you. So, fine, just don't be an idiot and touch the top surface, right? Well, if you look at the picture you'll see that they made the poor choice to wrap the top piece of metal around to that it's very close to the handle that pushes down the bread. It's thus very easy to accidentally brush your hand against this when pushing down a second or third piece of bread.

"These work well and are a good value, compared to ones we've seen at the big name orange hardware store. Just be aware they aren't that bright, because fluorescent lights don't have tremendous amounts of red in them to begin with, so if you filter down to only the red you're not left with much. That said, it's enough to make a small room glow a very satisfying, deep red. Fun for kids, and immature adults like me.Are there any practical uses? Supposedly red light has health benefits, but I'm guessing much of that is psychosomatic, given that all regular white lights have red in them. That said, it is well known that red (or orange) light is better for use before bed so as to not fool your brain into thinking its day time. So, perhaps it's worth replacing one light in a room with these for use as a ""night light"" that won't mess with your sleep cycle if you need to get up in the middle of the night.

"There is no such thing as a free lunch, but in the case of LED lights we find that somebody has been stealing our lunch for a long time with standard bulbs. Most of the energy you pay to put in an incandescent bulb gets wasted as heat. Compact fluorescents are efficient and don't have that problem, but they are not as full spectrum as incandescent and take a while to get to full brightness. An LED light, however, has nearly the same spectrum as an incandescent, turns on instantly, lasts nearly as long as a human, and yet consumes a sixth of the energy for the same amount of illumination. The only cost is a higher upfront cost, but these pay for themselves in lower energy use and longer life. The future of lighting is clearly in LEDs.What's nice about these bulbs is that they have the smooth appearance of a regular bulb, and will fit anywhere a regular bulb fits, with only few exceptions.

"We've got two small kids in our family plus a father who is a nerd with lots of electronic toys. So, we are constantly recharging batteries. I got this to replace a Lacrosse BC-1000 recharger, one of the more popular ones out there. It worked well, but it eventually overcharged a battery which leaked all over the unit, a known problem with the BT-1000s. Furthermore, it had a horrendously complicated interface.I'm very happy to have switched to this. The interface couldn't be more simple; just a single button. Build it down to change modes, and click it to switch between charging rates. Unlike the BC-1000, you can change charging rates in the middle of a charge without having to take all the batteries out.The charger makes a noise as each battery is done, which is either awesome or infuriating depending on the time of day, especially since charging four batteries at once yields four alarms at slightly different times. Wish there were a way to disable the alarm.What do you lose in exchange for this simplicity? As far as I can tell, the only thing this charger is missing that the Lacrosse had was the ability to have a different charging rate for each battery. Of course, in five plus years with the Lacrosse before it died I never used that feature even once.I'll be sticking with this charger, and will update this review if anything goes wrong with it. If you don't see anything new below this line, you can assume the charger is working great since the original date of the review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEVY2NSTF35N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCCNBOE#wasThisHelpful","RPEVY2NSTF35N","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two greats things about these batteries. The first is the main point of using lithium chemistry: these really do last much longer than normal alkalines. I've used this in a home security camera and got way longer life out of them than normal batteries, by at least a factor of five (though I didn't measure exactly).The second great thing about these is that they are incredibly light, with regular batteries weighing almost 50% more, and rechargeable so even more than that. So, when you throw these in, say, a wireless mouse, not only will they last longer but you'll be amazed at how light your mouse feels.The only disadvantage to these batteries is that they cost more. However, when you consider that you're paying for power, and these deliver a lot more, in the long run these are actually a pretty good value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXVEH0FSAOGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DC4EL#wasThisHelpful","R1BXVEH0FSAOGA","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, this is going to hurt my considerable street cred. Nothing says ""bad @$%"" like a five star, excited review for triple action dust wipes. But these are AWESOME! Among my many manly qualities lurks a particularly manly species of obsessive compulsive disorder, which, to the consternation of my wife, will result in me stepping over mounds of laundry and half eaten plates of food to dust our TV, or piano, or computer. The inside of my car? An operating room. The living room? Mayhem. With most things I'm pretty slovenly. But if it's electronic or moves, I'm like Martha Stewart after a cocaine binge.What's so good about these? They are impregnated with something that makes them dust magnets. Not sure what it is, but there is a very subtle tackiness to these such that they just grab dust, and don't spread it around not matter how much you dust something. I tried them on a really dusty table in the attic, and the wipe came away dark with dust, but the table was perfectly clean.Keep in mind, though, that these are ONLY good for dusting.

"I was skeptical of how good these would be given the cost, but they are now my favorite wired headphones. They are extremely light, and very comfortable. They don't protrude uncomfortably far into the ear like a lot of other in-ear phones. The cord is a nice touch; high quality braided nylon, not rubber. It looks like it will hold up much better than rubber, will is not as likely to deteriorate, discolor or crack.The sound quality, however, is probably the most important thing. The sound is crisp and natural. The bass isn't overdone, but it's solid. For the price the sound is just excellent. The only better sound from headphones I've used were from a very expensive pair of Etymotics, which cost about 10 times more and hurt my ears after wearing them for more than 30 minutes.I recommend this without reservation, especially when they are selling for less than $50.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1BAB5DQ7HYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K35XI88#wasThisHelpful","RK1BAB5DQ7HYG","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHAT'S GOODThe fit is probably the best part of the headset. It's the first in-ear headsets I've tried that stay firmly fixed in place and yet don't hurt after a long while. I wish other companies would figure this out, but the Soundpeats folks have come up with a very nice design here. It's very easy to forget you're wearing this, since they are comfortable and the cord is so light and short.The sound quality is good, but not stellar. You don't buy a Bluetooth headset to get phenomenal sound, you do so for convenience, so I consider the sound quality more than adequate.I've used this for a few weeks now, and I've found them to be very reliable.WHAT'S NOT SO GOODI've only found two issues with it: if you pair this with two or more devices, it can get in a loop where it keeps bouncing from one to the other in rapid succession. If you avoid trying to pair this with multiple devices, you'll be fine.The second issue, and why I'm giving this four, instead of five, stars: the microphone is very poor. When I tested it, the person on the other end had a tough time hearing me. I was in an area of strong signal, so I assume it was the microphone. It's not surprising; the location of the microphone is not great. Unless you have an incredibly tiny head, the microphone will be on the right side of your neck. Assuming the cord is going behind your neck, as designed, there's really no good way to pull it closer to your mouth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R62OKBZLB663C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RE0KUOK#wasThisHelpful","R62OKBZLB663C","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You put your phone in the special holder, and on the back of the case there is a mounting bracket. That bracket is the exact opposite of the spring loaded mount that you attach to your bike, except rotated 45 degrees. When you put your phone in and then rotate it the two halves snap in place very precisely and securely. Ok, so I'm having trouble explaining this in words, but trust me when I say it's very solid. If you crash your bike, you and the bike will probably break before your iPhone separates from the mount.The only reason I can't give it five stars is that the case is a bit of a pain to get the phone in. Maybe that's a good thing for protecting your phone, but unless you plan to keep the bulky case on your phone all the time, you are going to spend a bit of time taking your phone in and out of the case.

"The keyboard itself is well-built, and pairs easily. For a small keyboard, it's quite easy to type quicklyu, and they made the nice design decision to make the keys rather small, leaving plenty of space between them and limiting misses. That said, there are other poor design choices that keep from from rating this higher. First, it's very difficult to get the iPad in and out of the case. Given how bulky the folio is, you probably won't want to use this all the time, so that's a problem. When I tried to get my iPad out, I was afraid I was going to break it; there is no good way to grasp the iPad when trying to remove it so you end up having to pull it out by the corner. The other unfortunate thing about the case is that when closed the keyboard contacts the iPad at only three rubberized points along its perimeter, leaving a large gap in the center. When in a bag I'd be concerned that any pressure on the case will put push the keyboard into the screen, possibly scratching or cracking the glass. It would've been better had they added a few more contact points to keep the hard plastic keys from contacting the iPad's screen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CB7FPQ9OA0V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVVTELA#wasThisHelpful","R3CB7FPQ9OA0V4","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are no visible buttons on the speaker, making for a very clean look. There is also an integrated five LED battery charge indicator, a very nice touch.The sound quality is quite good, but not stellar.

"BOTTOM LINEThese are the best wipers I've ever used, and employ a unique design to hold the curve of the windshield without lifting in the center. While they are expensive, it is worth the money.WHAT'S GOODThe performance, so far, is stellar. It's the quietest wiper I've ever used, which I assume is due to the graphite coating on the blades. I've only used them for about a month, but I will come back an update this when I see how long they last. If they are anything like the ICONs (and these should last longer given the coating) they should go for the better part of the year, at least.The installation is very easy. It's got a universal adapter that works with most wiper mounts. In my case (a J bracket) you just slide it in place until it clicks, snap the cover back down, and you're done. About five seconds on each side, no exaggeration.The spring steel does a good job holding the wiper to the windshield, regardless of the speed. I have a pretty curved windshield that is sometimes hard to find wipers for, at least on one side, but these leave no streaks where the wiper missed the glass.The spring is encased in a spoiler that is built as a series of articulating links. Not only does it look pretty cool, the way it's built means that they spring can have a lot of force at the edges (to hold the curve of the windshield) while not lifting up in the center due to that force. It's very ingenious, and nothing I've ever seen on wipers before.WHAT'S BADWell, the only thing that's bad about these is that they are more expensive than just buying the rubber wiper inserts. When these need to be replaced, you'll be throwing out the whole thing and buying a new one, even though the only part that will be worn is the rubber insert. It's not a huge expense, but I wish Bosch would figure out a way to let you just replace the rubber. I'm guessing they could do that easily but would never want to give up having us all pay to replace the entire wiper blade even though the most expensive part of it doesn't wear out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNIEGTC5W08QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ4XQ#wasThisHelpful","RNIEGTC5W08QZ","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I guess you just can't get a reliable pulse through the feet... The air quality measurement is suspect as well, given that it changed significantly over the few minutes I tested it. Same with temperature, and I'm guessing they didn't go a great job isolating the temperature sensor from the effects of your feet heating the scale.

"I've been using this product for several years, and it's the ONLY thing that has cured my seasonal allergies. Before taking it, I would not only have the usual runny nose and itchy eyes, but I would also have what felt like asthma. A doctor suggested that it might all be due to allergies affecting my nose (rhinitis) that was causing the other symptoms, and they were absolutely right. Once I started on Flonase, after about a week or two all the other symptoms went away, especially the problems in my lungs. Evidently if allergies are causing a runny nose, that can drip into your lungs and irritate them, and all the sneezing can cause problems with your eyes.So, if you suffer from bad allergies and are taking inhalants and doing eye drops, etc. try starting with this and see if it solves those other problems.Because this is a topical steroid, and not an antihistamine, it's going to take about a week or so before you see the full effect. In fact, just one dose probably won't yield a noticeable improvement. That's the relatively small price you pay for a drug that has so very little side effects. I generally don't tolerate allergy medicines well, and most make me feel groggy, even the second generation ones that aren't supposed to.

"Given how thin the iPhone 6 already is, adding this case doesn't actually make the phone unreasonably thick. It's about the thickness of one of the original iPhones. It's not much heavier, either. So, what you get for that small increase in weight and thickness is absolutely worth it: you get more than twice the battery time.I confirmed the extra battery time by running my iPhone down to nothing, and timing how much usage I got. I then charged up the phone and this case and repeated the experiment. The result was a little more than twice the battery life with the case, just what they advertise.The unit also includes an integrated battery indicator, a series of small LEDs cleverly hidden in the case that let you know how much charge is left in the case. A very nice touch.This case would be perfect for anybody who travels, as you could watch movies or do e-mail on the phone on a long flight without the phone coming close to discharging.

"We decided not to use these, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they would catch mice had we left them in place. They are easy to load, and much safer than normal mousetraps if you are worried about you or your curious kids coming across them and accidentally getting whacked. You'd have to really try hard (or be a small hungry mouse) to set these off.So, why one star? These aren't even remotely humane. I assumed that inside was a regular trap that would quickly kill the mouse. However, all this does is slam the mouse up against the side wall with a little scoop and trap it. I'm guessing it's a slow death, either from starvation or slow asphyxiation. If you catch a mouse, you'll likely throw it in the garbage still alive. The entire point of this trap is to insulate you from having to deal with the idea of killing a mouse, which is fine, but I can't really support that if it comes at the expense of being the least bit humane. Seems kind of weak to needlessly hurt the mouse just so you don't have to deal with the idea of looking at it.I'm no PETA zealot, and I have zero problem with killing rodents. But I think if you have two options for how to dispatch the little buggers, and one is a quick death and one is a slow one, it's not fair to choose the latter for the animal just so you don't have to look at it after it's dead. Had I known how these worked, I would not have ordered them.

"Prior to this set, we had a rather expensive set from a well-known store with the initials W.S. They were nice, but they were made out of single pieces of brushed aluminum, pressed into the shape of measuring cups and spoons. They were solid and heavy, and yet they bent all the time when scooping dense ingredients (such as brown sugar). This set of measuring cups and spoons don't look as good, to be honest, but they are clearly meant for serious duty in a kitchen, and are about function over form. The handles are much more solid, and are welded to the cups. They won't fold over when scooping heavy ingredients, no matter how much force you use. It's clear these will stand the test of time, and I'm glad we finally moved from the trendy to the functional.

Some of the facts are interesting (such as how dry cleaning works), but don't take it too seriously. For the subjects where I'm actually knowledgeable, I found enough errors that it's clear this book was not well-researched.

"I've got through four (!) of these Bluetooth wireless transmitters in as many years. This one has far and away the best sound quality. I don't know how they are doing it.

I live in the Boston metro area, so there really aren't any completely dead frequencies, and this is the only one that can overpower the out-of-range station on the ""dead"" frequencies in the area.The only reason I'm not giving this five starts is that the speakerphone on this is absolutely the worst of the four units I've used.

"This works great with an iPhone for listening to music or news radio in the shower. As an added bonus, if you hold down the Phone button, you can activate Siri and ask ""her"" questions while in the shower: you can ask about your schedule that morning, check the time, or start any song in your collection by request. Kind of a cool thing to be able to do while standing naked in your shower; most personal assistants will sue under such conditions!The sound quality for music is surprisingly good. It's not stereo, obviously, but it's actually not a problem. The shower acoustics seems to create its own stereo! I got this to listen to the news while in the shower, but was pleasantly surprised that it's actually quite nice to listen to music, too. Just be careful; you're likely to waste a lot of water with this thing!The only caveat I have is that this is next to useless as a speakerphone, especially in the shower. The microphone is very low quality, and has no noise canceling. As such, nobody will be able to hear you if you're in the shower, and they will barely be able to hear you otherwise. (I've tested this a few times by leaving voicemails for myself and checking the voice quality.)I can recommend this without reservation so long as you don't actually expect to use the speakerphone feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D0Q8QHAIADU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O15BQC6#wasThisHelpful","R2D0Q8QHAIADU2","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best baster we've ever used. (No, that's not a sentence I ever thought I'd say, but it's true.) The bulb is well sealed to avoid messes, and is made of silicone, compatible with disinfecting cycles on modern washers. In fact, this was engineered with proper cleanup in mind. The tip comes off, and a brush is included which allows the interior to be completely cleaned. This is pretty important when considering that this will likely be used on poultry. With the tip attached, the baster is gently curved, making it possible too use in a much more natural grip. It's hard to explain why without venturing into way more baster-related prose than I'm comfortable with, so you'll just have to trust me that it's a much better design than typically used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HBH5E87GAS8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X2XK2#wasThisHelpful","R3HBH5E87GAS8O","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but just somebody who really likes music and who thinks that good speakers/headphones can help you appreciate a song more. These headphones have a very full, balanced sound, but without being overwhelming in bass. I have the same experience with these that I did when I got a pair of etymotics in-ear headphones; when you hear a song with these that you've only heard with the stock iPhone headphones, you notice all sorts of details you didn't hear before. However, unlike in-ear headphones, these are actually comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and have a more solid bass.

"After two months, the box started to become flakey, hanging and crash. At some point, the box wouldn't even boot up. It just hangs at the Roku icon screen upon start up. Customer support is awful, and they want me to pay to have this shipped back to them for replacement, even if they deem it to be defective.It's clear Roku's policy is try to make something reliable but cheap (which they seem to succeed at, given the high average review) and then not really support the few people that get bad units. Maybe that works as a business model, but it's infuriating if you get one of the bad ones.Down vote me if you will, but I'm just adding my experience. The review system only works if you get a good statistical sample from across all the experiences. I'm glad it works for most people, but those considering buying this over an Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV should know that if something goes wrong, you won't get much help from the company and will have to pay to have it shipped back to be fixed. So, my advice: if you have an option to buy a supplemental warranty with it, do so. Otherwise, be sure to keep ALL of the original packaging and accessories, because you will need them if you have to make a warranty claim against Roku.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LJRW1UP3LVTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGGDVOO#wasThisHelpful","R3LJRW1UP3LVTP","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a better way to type notes in my iPad than the touchscreen keyboard. This has worked perfectly. The keyboard basically feels like a slightly smaller version of the keyboard on a MacBook.

"I wanted to add Z-wave controllability to a cool old bakelite switch that was probably installed around 1930-1940 in our old house. One of the big heavy old switches in a ceramic housing, back when they used BX wiring and small metal workboxes. However, there was not even close to enough room to fit this behind the switch. It's not Aeon Labs' fault, it's just that there is no way they could possibly make something small enough to squeeze in the tight spacings that were the norm in old electrical boxes, given how fat the old switches were and how small the workboxes were. So, please be aware that if you're looking to use this to retrofit existing switches, they really have to be relatively modern switches installed in modern, large workboxes. That's absolutely the only way you're going to have a chance of sneaking this in behind. Fortunately, one of the switches in the five gang panel was not being used anymore, so I pulled that out and used the empty space for the Aeotec switch. Even then, it was a very tight fit!The way this works is that you hook up your existing switch to some low voltage terminals on the Aeotec device. These are low voltage and just used to sense when somebody toggles the existing switch, and so that's why the terminals are so small: you're supposed to use small gauge wires. The reviewers who complained about stripped terminals didn't read the darn instructions and used full 14/16 gauge high voltage wires. You have to use something more like thermostat wire. In fact, that's exactly what I used and it worked great. You then hook up the high voltage terminals of the Aetec switch to your house power and load. You can either turn the light on and off with the old switch or with a zwave command; it doesn't matter which position the old switch is in. Flipping it always flips the state of the light. Very clever.One more piece of advice: unless you are installing this in new construction, you may not have all the wires you need. This product requires access to a neutral wire, and a lot of old installations didn't bother to run neutral to switch boxes. If you're in this boat, you'll have to either give up on this or do something potentially unsafe: use ground as neutral. I don't advise doing this, however, because you're completely doing away with all the safety advantages of a separate ground path. So, open the box you're planning on installing this in and making sure you've got all three wires you'll need before buying this.In summary, this is an extremely clever device that allows any switch to be used as a Zwave device if you have the right wiring and enough room left over in your box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGOPWEACLRQH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VWAPU4#wasThisHelpful","RGOPWEACLRQH1","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's ugly and big. But while they won't win any industrial design awards for it, it's the most solid and well built inflator I've ever used. The hose is heavy duty gauge, and all the fittings are brass. I checked the gauge against two other pressure meters, and it was right on. My only complaint is that the chuck requires you to constantly push in on the valve or it will leak quite a bit of air. This is not a huge problem, however, because the inflator is easy to operate with one hand, leaving your other hand free to just hold the chuck on the stem.UPDATE: I'm dropping this from five to two stars. The battery will die after less than a year, even if you almost never use it. I suspect there is some sort of leakage in the system that causes the batteries to die (as others have found). Unfortunately, replacing the battery is not at all easy. My recommendation: skip this tool and buy Astro's excellent tire inflator that uses a manual gauge. The digital version is a complete PITA, and I'm guessing most people (like me) just write a glowing review right after they get it, and before they discover how quickly the battery dies and how it is to get at it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24R3C1FTE23U0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PUTC0M#wasThisHelpful","R24R3C1FTE23U0","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've gota Kohler sink that is leaking around the base, replacing both of these O-rings will likely save you the expense and trouble of having the whole thing replaced. A good indicator that these rings need replacing is if there is even a tiny bit of ""wobble"" in the sink spout, or if the spout has very little resistance to rotating around the base. With a properly sealing set of rings, the spout should feel very firmly set, and have a bit of resistance to swinging around side to side.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QJF7GEK3K2KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MTVINM#wasThisHelpful","R3QJF7GEK3K2KH","A198CCH4NNLI2E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A198CCH4NNLI2E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a small construction staple stuck in my tire. Right on the tread, small holes. Exactly what this product is designed for.

"While Scalpels are not a common household item, my mother was a registered nurse and we always had one in our home.  There are plenty of uses for them.  I keep them on hand for some pesky skin tags that I seem to get occasionally.  With a super sharp blade, I don't even feel it when my husband cuts them off.

"The MyBand Armband for iPhone 6 is absolutely unique in design and it is also very comfortable to wear, while providing excellent support and security for the phone.  Of all the different armbands I have tried for various phones, this is, by far, my favorite.  It holds the phone perfectly, while allowing me to wear it on my lower arm, instead of my upper arm.  I have always found the upper arm versions to be awkward to wear and most of them are down right painful and aggravating.  This band that allows me to wear my phone in an alternative location is simply amazing!  I love the pink terry cloth, too.It also has a small, zippered compartment that provides adequate space for my house key and ID.  To top it all off, they also added a reflective strip, which surrounds the phone and since it is positioned on the outside of my forearm, I can rest assured any oncoming traffic will see it and be aware of me as I take my nightly strolls around the neighborhood.  I love the design and execution of this product and I am so glad I was chosen to receive a sample of this, gratis, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  It is definitely worth a 5 star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D7QYP32G1BPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6YV5CQ#wasThisHelpful","R2D7QYP32G1BPG","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Breathe Essential Oil Blend works wonders for my respiratory system when I put 4 to 5 drops in my diffuser at night when I am getting ready for bed.  It helps greatly when my sinuses are stuffed up, and I also use it by putting a few drops on a cotton ball and inhaling it directly from there.  I got the 10ml bottle, and while it may not seem like much, I only use up to 5 drops at a time, so quite frankly, this will last a very long time.Prime Cosmetics also sells it in an amber glass bottle.

"While I was waiting to receive this, I had convinced myself this product would not work.  I will admit, I have tried other meal supplement shakes, and failed miserably.  I have put on an extra 20 pounds lately, and I needed this to work.  I could kick myself for ever thinking this wouldn't work because it does, and very well, I might add.It tastes just fine, right out of the container.  It has a creamy orange flavor, but it's a bit grainy.  I add it to a blender along with some ice cubes, low fat yogurt, water and either some frozen berry mix or frozen tropical mix of fruit.  Doing this and using my Ninja Blending system, makes my drinks like a smoothie.  YUM!  and no more grainy taste!  I have been using this for 2 weeks, without any addition of exercise, and I have already lost 5 pounds.

"I will admit, I am a foodie, and as such, I have several different kinds of thermometers.  The Instant Read Cooking Thermometer by BasicWu, is the very first one of this kind I have tried, and I am really enjoying this one.  I have one that is almost the same exact shape as this, but it is about 1/3rd the size.  I like this version, but the longer one I have here is great for getting readings on meat that is on the grill.  The larger size keeps my hands further away from the hot grill, which feels like my skin is going to melt!  The one I got takes a small, button battery, like watches, and it was included with the thermometer.  All I had to do was put it in, and I was ready to go.The case it comes in has a great, little wrist strap, so I can still have both hands free while keeping up with the temps of my food.  Another feature I really like is the ""hold"" button.  It will store the reading, just in case I can't get to it immediately.  This is great if I am grilling late at night, with poor lighting.  It also has an auto shut-off after 10 minutes of inactivity, which prevents me from blowing through batteries.  It also shuts off on it's own if it is folded up.  You really can't ask for more when it comes to an excellent and high quality thermometer.  I am so glad I was chosen by BasicWu to receive a sample of this, gratis, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  I highly recommend this ""smoking hot"" product!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SV4HJ2WNZDQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013A8GK5M#wasThisHelpful","R2SV4HJ2WNZDQP","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Energy Synergy Essential Oil Blend from Plant Therapy Essential Oils is DIVINE!!  I am still relatively new to the wonderful world of essential oils, but I have done a lot of studying about the health benefits of using them.  I love to keep my diffuser going around the clock in my bedroom.  Sometimes I will only use one scent, like Ylang Ylang, I really love that smell!  I was already beginning to mix customized fragrances for use in my diffuser when I found this.  The mix of Peppermint, Rosemary, Eucalyptus and Lemon is sheer bliss!  I think the price is a great bargain for this 100% pure and natural blend of oils.  One of my new favorite things to do is to add this to my unscented body cream.  It takes very little, and my husband always compliments me when I am using it.  He didn't do that when I wore my $70+ bottle of perfume!  I am delighted I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, to evaluate and keep, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.

"I didn't quite know what to expect when I ordered these, but now that I have them, I think they are so cute.  I like wearing them all together, but I think they look great split up, too.  They arrived in a small, royal blue storage pouch,  and each ring is roughly one millimeter wide.  They are very shiny, and I am really enjoying wearing them almost every day.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover they do not turn my finger green, at all.  That is the main reason why I normally do not wear costume jewelry.

"I thought this would make a nice little gift for my husband.  One of those gifts for no reason....Well,.....Too bad I've already staked my claim to it! OK, I guess I will share it with him.  When I first received this, we both tested it out.  It just smells so freaking amazing, I couldn't help but to use it, and I am so glad I did!  It comes in a nice, large, 3.8 ounce bar.  The round bar is ideal for use with the shaving brush I got him a couple of months back, and to top it off, I also got a couple different kinds of old time razors.  He now has a shaving set up that reminds me of the one my grandfather had over 35 years ago.  The bonus pack of blades was a nice little surprise, too!So, I decided to shave my legs with it, and all I can say is ""WOW""!  My razor glides right over it, so quickly and easily, and it leaves my legs so wonderfully soft and smooth.

"This Essential Oil Aromatherapy Diffuser by URPOWER has become my new favorite.  First of all, it is unbelievably quiet.  Several others I have all claimed to be quiet, but this one is practically silent.  This makes for a very zen-like atmosphere and it's much easier to fall asleep without having to hear a diffuser run in the background.  The color changing LED lights are very relaxing and the super lightweight construction makes this one of the most portable units I have owned.  I was very happy to see this came with a measuring cup, too, since it just makes everything easier.It is very impressive how the entire unit is only about 6 inches tall, however, it puts out a great amount of fragrance for aromatherapy bliss!  It holds up to 100 milliliters of water, and since it's ultrasonic, it only takes a couple of drops of my favorite oil to fill my entire, large bedroom with a Heavenly fragrance.  I have had over a half-dozen different items from this company, and they are always of the highest quality.  I have never been disappointed with anything from them, and I absolutely recommend URPOWER and any of their wonderful products.

"I love the bright colors of these Micro USB Cables from Magic-T.  Almost every device I own utilizes this cable, so it's great to have a pack of 4 that are all over 6 feet in length.  With all of the special features behind these, it's hard to choose a favorite.  First off, the colors are great!  The pink, green, orange and blue are vibrant and attractive.  Then, they are all over 6 feet long.  This allows for super fast and easy charging, no matter where I need them.  I think the best part is that they don't get tangled up because of the design of the cords, and this feature is magnificent.

"I have an enormous affinity for these Infuser Bottles.  In my opinion, there is nothing more refreshing than taking some frozen fruit pieces and adding them to the infuser with some spring water.  The frozen fruit makes the water icy cold and it tastes absolutely amazing.  I also add a couple of teaspoons of Splenda, and I can drink these blends all day long.  I have Type 2 Diabetes, and these drinks are so healthy for me.While these bottles have skyrocketed in popularity over the past few months, for the most part, they tend to all basically be the same.  There are few exceptions to this rule, and this amazing product is one of them.  This is not the average cookie cutter Infuser Bottle!  First of all, it holds an unprecedented 32 ounces of liquid, while most others max out at half of this amount.  The infuser is large, and holds plenty of fruit, for the tastiest water.  On the side is a large, rubbery grip to keep the bottle in my hand.  Of all the other infuser bottles I have tried, I have yet to see this feature before.  It has a flip-top lid, so I never have to worry about losing the top and the lid snaps firmly into place, preventing any leaks or spills.Honestly, I thought I had seen it all when it comes to Fruit Infuser Bottles, but I was wrong.  This version by Refill-Life has set the standard, as far as I am concerned.  There are so many features about this that makes it really give the ""wow"" factor.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  If you want an Infuser Bottle that has everything, including several features that no other competitor has, look no further.

"This Beach Blanket is definitely multifunctional!  It is perfect for the beach because sand does not stick into the weave.  It reminds me of parachute material, so it stays slick.  It is plenty wide and long for at least 3 people to use very comfortably.  I love the way it comes in a very small pouch, and it folds up and fits perfectly in it, which makes it super portable.  It is also very light weight.  There are small pockets at each corner in case of a windy day....all you have to do is add a few stones and it keeps the blanket in place.  If it is windy at the beach, you can pack the pockets with sand.  I like to lay it out, then put my beach towel on top of it, it makes for a very soft and sturdy, clean surface, and I can relax all afternoon.

"The New Version of the Selfie Stick is sublime!  The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the retail packaging is that is is very light weight.  However, this does not mean it is cheap, it is of excellent quality.  It expands and retracts quite easily and does not get too heavy when I am using it.  I have carpal tunnel, and in the past, I have had to quit using a selfie stick after only a few shots because of the pain in my hand.  This is not the case with this newer one.I got the turquoise one and the color is very attractive.  There is also a matching wrist strap, so I can carry the stick without tying up one of my hands.  The phone holder is white plastic.  It's also super light, yet made very durable.  It extends out to hold a Note 4 with the greatest of ease, and with this being one of the larger phones on the market, I imagine it will fit almost anything.  I also tested it with the Samsung Mega 2, and it also fits, and considering the phone is basically the size of a small tablet, I know it will cover anyone's needs.My favorite thing is there is no more pesky Bluetooth connection to worry about.  All you have to do is plug the wire at the end of the stick into your audio jack.  It works immediately with iPhone, and if you have the ability to use your volume key as the camera button, you are good to go with Android phones.  If not, simply install an app, like Camera 360, and, problem solved.  I have tested over a dozen selfie sticks, and this is one of my favorites.  Also, you cannot go wrong with any products from Foxnovo.  I have had around a dozen of their items, and they are always top notch and made of the highest quality.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive a sample of this, gratis, to evaluate and keep, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.

"I have struggled with my weight for most of my adult life.  I can go from an almost ideal weight all the way up to a 30 pound weight gain, so I hate to love my set of scales.  Recently, I began another diet and exercise regimen and I needed to be able to keep precise track of my weight.  When I saw the sale price of this scale, I didn't hold out much hope for it to be very accurate, because I have had ones in the past that cost 3 to 4 times as much, and they still weren't very reliable.This scale arrived at my door, packaged perfectly and carefully by Amazon and it comes in a super nice retail box, which is ready to be gift wrapped.  The scale worked great, right out of the box, after I removed the pull tab so the battery could work.  I love the look of the glass with black and silver accents on the bottom.  This scale looks amazing in my bathroom, and has a very attractive appearance, sure to compliment any home.  I tested it with a set of hand held weights and it is very accurate.  I also compared each measurement to my current scale, and this set was more accurate than the very expensive set I was using.  I love that it provides readings in .02 pound increments.  This is great when I realize I am on the cusp of losing another full pound.For the price, I would say these scales cannot be beat in looks and dependability.  Don't waste your money, like I did, on a more expensive set.  Another thing that made me happy is that when compared to the scales at my doctor's office, the weight is always the same within a half-pound.  I have never had this luxury before.  Usually, when I am weighed at the doctor, my weight at home is almost always from 5 to 10 pounds off.  This can be detrimental to a diet and exercise routine.  Fortunately, this is a thing of the past.

"With body wraps being the new craze, I was happy to try these out.  I was injured 5 years ago, and as a result, I have put on some unwanted weight.  Recently, I have been doing some light exercise, trying to be more active and watching what I eat more closely, so I figured it was a good time to give these a try.  The box arrived at my door, fully sealed and in retail packaging, so this would make a great gift.  Each box contains 8 treatments and 2 reusable wraps.  The directions are super simple to follow and it only takes a few steps to enjoy the benefits of this at-home spa treatment.As long as you soak and wring the wraps out properly, add the precise amount of water to each treatment and stir, you will have success.  Also, be sure to keep the heat in the area by applying cling wrap over the area.  I make sure to use extra and apply it generously, since I feel this is the most important step.These work great if you need to shed some water weight before going to the beach, a wedding, or formal affair.  I think they mainly reduce water weight, but they absolutely work.  Be sure to measure the area before and after each wrap to keep up with the results.  They are not a miracle and if you want permanent results, you should already have started dieting and exercising prior to using, or at the minimum have started the same day.  I am very happy with the results I have achieved using this detox body wrap system and I am very grateful Brazilian Slimming Tea chose me to receive a sample of these, gratis, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.

"I recently purchased the LG G4, and when I saw this case with the little Android Bug Robot, I had to have it.  This is my favorite new case.  It is a very well made case and it's somewhat flexible, but it provides excellent support for my phone and the buttons and ports are very easily accessible when I have the case on the phone.  I love the tone on tone color, with the android bug outlined into the case with a cool pattern of lines.  I pops on the back, very simply, but it sticks out a bit on the edges to keep the phone elevated off of any surface if you have it face down.  This is excellent protection from liquids penetrating the phone.

"Over the years, I have used the cheapest hair care products, all the way up to a $50 tub of conditioner.  I have definitely learned not to judge a book by it's cover, since some of the cheaper brands produce amazing results.  However, I must say, this Tea Tree & Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner set by Luseta is absolutely phenomenal!  Right away, I noticed how divine these products smell.  It is a heavenly fragrance and my hair smells unbelievably fresh and clean after each use.I got the 16 ounce bottles, and I am very pleased that it takes very little of each product to achieve the desired results.  With other products in the past, I had to add a ton of shampoo to get a good lather going, and I always had to fill my hand with conditioner at least 3 times to properly coat my hair and get it smooth.  It is a huge money saver to be able to use so little of these products to get awesome results with my hair.  After using this system, I have also noticed that it is much easier to use the flat iron and curling iron, without damaging my hair, and my hair stays either straight or curled much longer than it did with previous products.I was a licensed cosmetologist for many years, so I am not blindly trusting these products without thoroughly using and testing them.  I would be willing to bet they are just as good, if not better than many of the most expensive hair products on the market.  I love the pump bottles, there is no waste, and I just love how wonderful they make my hair feel and smell.  I feel so fortunate to have been chosen to receive samples of these, gratis, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  I would give them 10 Stars if I could, but 5 will have to do!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U6KXL37AVNWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HMM6J0#wasThisHelpful","R2U6KXL37AVNWP","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very impressed with the quality of this herb grinder by Kloud Kingdom.  I use a lot of fresh herbs when I cook, and this makes it so much easier to prepare them with very minute amounts of waste.  It is very heavy duty, and one thing I really like about it is the fact that I can grind and pretty much pulverize something through the sharp, grinding blades and remove it from the second cap, (above the sifter), or I can press it through the sifter, if it's dry, to the next level, which runs it through the sifter once again.  Another nifty feature is the pollen scraper included on the bottom level.  If you grind bee pollen, this will absolutely insure your pollen is very finely sifted.  The solid, anodized body, will last for years to come....they actually offer a lifetime guarantee, so this is absolutely a no-risk purchase.  The sifters are stainless steel, so rust will never be an issue.  It can be used for tobacco, too.  I am so glad I was offered the opportunity to receive a sample of this, gratis, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  It's definitely worth 5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SS5Q5KQ9QMYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWTS2ME#wasThisHelpful","R2SS5Q5KQ9QMYM","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 16 ounce Stainless Steel Mug from Suner is so unique and beautiful.  I got this in Rose Red, but honestly, it is more of a frosted medium purple shade.  On my computer, it even looks like the same exact color.  However, this shade of purple is my favorite color, so I was delightfully surprised when I received this in the mail.The outside is so soft and smooth.  I love the way it feels when I am holding it.  It seems to have a soft, silicone covering the outside.  The company logo is on the side of the mug, down towards the bottom, just like the description photo shows.  It arrived at my house in a gorgeous box that is ready for gift giving, but I am going to be greedy with this and keep it for myself!  The purple against the stainless steel looks awesome, and I have noticed they paid attention to every single detail in the design and creation of this beautiful drinking mug.  I am so proud of mine, and have received several compliments on it.  I am thrilled that I was selected to receive a sample of this, to evaluate and keep in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  I give this a glowing 5 star rating.  This is absolutely a top notch mug.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KN3MRHYR7OQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7GKAXO#wasThisHelpful","R3KN3MRHYR7OQ1","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All I can say about this Memory Foam Cushion from GoActiveLifeStyle is WOW!!  It is absolutely my new best friend.  I have 7 damaged discs in my back and having this amazing support helps tremendously with the pain.  It is also very sturdy, and the stitching on it is nice and tight.  They definitely put a lot of thought and love into this product, because the results are so incredible.  I have suffered with pain for many years, and I do find myself typing and driving in my car quite often.  This helps greatly with both of those tasks, and alleviates a large amount of my pain, without having to take my prescription pain killers.  Anytime I can find another method for relieving pain instead of swallowing a pill, I am all for it.  I am so thankful I was provided with a sample of this cushion, to test and evaluate, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  If you suffer from back pain, like I do, I highly recommend this awesome cushion to help with the agony.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9YZ18T813N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X80CGLU#wasThisHelpful","RQ9YZ18T813N6","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Screen Protector for the Surface 3 is fantastic!  My brother in law is super tech savvy and he always gets the newest gadgets, as soon as they come out.  I thought this would provide excellent protection for his investment, so I had to get it for him.It comes in a binder, which reminds me of a hard bound book.  The presentation of the product is top notch!  There are very precise and simple instructions to insure proper installation, and it only took him a matter of minutes to apply it.  It absolutely holds up to scratches and water spills.  He didn't want to drop it to find out how well it prevents the screen from shattering, but I don't blame him!If you are looking for a great, tempered glass screen protector for your Surface 3, I believe you will be very happy with this product.  He's had it on for a couple of weeks now, and hasn't had a single issue.

"I have several other Silicone Baking Mats, or Silpats, but they are all rectangular in shape for my cookie sheets.  I've wanted a round one for some time now, and I am so glad I found this one by Mrs. V's Kitchen.  It is the perfect, finishing touch to flawless pizza execution.  When I got it, I gave it a quick wash with a small amount of dish soap and dried it thoroughly.  As soon as it was pizza time, I simply wiped a small amount of olive oil all over the top, to prime it for years of use.  The crust turns a beautiful, golden brown and nothing sticks to this, at all.  You can use it for anything, and I am so relieved to have one that fits my pizza pans, especially the large, 15 inch ones.  Now that I put a coat of oil on it the first time, all I have to do in the future is basically wipe it down with a paper towel after each use and it will continue to work for years.  I'm so glad I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.

"I have tried nearly a dozen different products from Sentey and I have never been disappointed in any of them.  This 5 Port USB Charging Station provides everything I need to charge my multiple devices.  It arrived at my door, perfectly protected and boxed, ready to wrap as a gift.  However, I am greedy when it comes to my products from them, and I am keeping mine.  Aside from the unit, there is also a two piece power cord, much like the one that comes with laptops.  It has the prongs to plug in the wall and then has the box that the cord that goes directly into the device is attached to.  Also in the box is a protective pouch for carrying and storing the station and a short and simple, but detailed instructional booklet.Of the 5 ports, 3 of them are universal, which means that port will adjust itself to only put out the required amount of power for each device plugged into it.  The other 2 ports, which are smart ports, will charge the device twice as fast as the standard charger.  This option is great if you forget to charge your phone and need it to be quickly charged.  There is a small, blue light that shines when the station is powered on.  I like this feature because it reminds me to unplug the unit when it's not in use.  It has a very small profile and is roughly the size and shape of a Blackberry.  I feel fortunate to have been chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  In my opinion you can't go wrong with this product, or anything from Sentey.  The quality of their items speaks for itself and I can always tell they pay close attention to every effort put into their products.  They are always made very well and I have nothing but positive experiences with items I have received from them.  I definitely recommend this item and any product from them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199NAKP50K7SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKSRIIU#wasThisHelpful","R199NAKP50K7SE","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hanging Shower Caddy by Simple Health Shower is nice and I like it.  There are a couple of things about it I feel could be improved upon.  First of all, it is relatively small, and doesn't provide enough room to hold larger bottles of shampoo and conditioner.  It does work great for body wash, face wash, my bar soap and razor.  I hang my shower loofah sponges from the small hangers on the bottom.  It is designed so the items are only surrounded by supports on the outside.  If, for any reason, it becomes dislodged from the shower head, the items will fall out of the back.  I think the addition of suction cups to the inside would keep it in place better and provide sturdier protection for my shower items.  I like the green color, and while it doesn't match anything in my bathroom, it is a nice shade of green.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.

"This Stainless Steel Tumbler is awesome!  This is the first item like this I have owned and it is quickly becoming one of my very favorites.  Since it is double walled, hot drinks stay hot and cold ones stay cold.  I did have a bit of concern about how well it would keep my hand from being hot or cold when I used it, but I was absolutely surprised when I used it for both and my hands didn't suffer the consequences.  Unlike a common stainless steel product, it doesn't transfer the temperature of the drink to my hand.  Huge Bonus!It holds up to 16 ounces of beverage and I find it perfect for my coffee.  I generally drink more tea, so after a few tests, I love having my coffee in this tumbler.  I also drink frozen and iced coffee, so it has me covered, no matter what I choose to put in it.  I am in love with the stainless steel drinking straw.  I have seen them sold here on Amazon in packages, but, again, this is the first one I have tried.  I am proud to not be throwing more plastic into the recycle bin, since I no longer need a disposable straw.  It's also super easy to clean, just put it on the top rack of the dishwasher and it's good to go.  I have been opting for more reusable mugs and cups over the past few months and this has earned it's place in my ""favorites"" category.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  These thoughts and words are my own, and reflect my personal experience.  I would definitely recommend this and it is positively deserving of a 5 star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315VX2O6A2NAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HR23PI#wasThisHelpful","R315VX2O6A2NAS","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried two different MP4 Players from G.G. Martinsen and I have been very happy with them.  This is a definite upgrade from the previous one because it comes with a 16 GB SD Card, that can be removed to easily upload music to the device.  It's also easy to transfer songs from my playlists to my laptop, phone and tablets.  I really like this new design, as well.  It now has great character of it's own with the rounded edges on the top and bottom.  It no longer looks like an iPhone clone.  The interface is easy to navigate and selecting from the wide array of options is much easier with this upgraded version.  It comes in a clear, acrylic retail box that is ready for gift giving, but I am keeping mine, and the metallic tealish blue color is quite attractive.  It is sturdy, because I accidentally dropped it a couple of times and other than a small scratch from the concrete, it works perfectly.

"The Parasheet Beach Blanket by Gecko Active is so versatile!  They have honestly thought of everything when it comes to this awesome product.  First of all, it covers a large area, 6 & 1/2 X 7 Feet, but it literally weighs only a few ounces and packs up conveniently into this little storage/carrying pouch that has a drawstring and wrist loop.  There is the cutest little gecko logo on the front of the pouch, too.It's perfect for the beach, with a place to put sand in the corners to weigh it down.  It is also great for a picnic because there are little loops on each corner to secure it to the grass.  Another thing I love is that it can also be used as a sun shade.  Just stretch it out and secure it to a couple of trees and it will provide great protection from the sun's beating rays for a wonderful afternoon outside.

"When I received the Silicone Cutting Board from SM Health Kitchen, I was pleasantly surprised by the weight of it.  It is very lofty, but in a way that is very beneficial and appealing.  I have a set of three, similar cutting boards and if I stack them on top of each other, they aren't as thick and hefty as this one.  While I am quite fond of bamboo boards, this one has stolen my heart.  I appreciate the fact that silicone is so easy to care for and clean, and it doesn't harbor harmful bacteria, whatsoever.To sanitize this in the microwave, just tuck the one end into the slotted end and put it in for one minute.  You can do this with each use, guaranteeing  a fresh, clean surface with every use.  The green color is bright and pretty, it is not an unattractive green, at all.  The bonus pastry/basting brushes are a great gift, and I have allotted one for BBQ and one for basting with butter.It is easy to see why they call this a ""Premium"" Cutting Board.  It is definitely superior quality to others I have tried.  It also has a juice well, to keep liquids from running over the edges and it also has measuring marks for even cuts.  I am delighted with this awesome cutting board and thrilled to have been provided a sample, gratis, to evaluate, test and review, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.

"I was so glad when I realized I was receiving 5 of the Invisaband Mosquito Repellent Bracelets/Anklets.  Me and my husband each wore one when we grilled out this evening.  Before tonight, we were bombarded by those nasty pests and they made grilling a nightmare.  Even with Citronella candles, we still got bit by a few stragglers.  I chose not to light the candles at first, to truly test the bracelets, with no other help.  We both found them very easy to put on and the adjustable size is perfect for families.  While they look to be made of rubber or silicone in the description photo, they are more of a material or fabric.While they are not 100% effective, they did GREATLY reduce the amount of mosquitoes that came in for attack.  After I lit the candles, about half way into grilling our meal, we had not one single bite, afterwards.  Granted, it is hot here, and we were a bit sweaty, especially with the heat of the grill adding to it.  Over the years, we have tried every spray under the sun and even those little clip on fans, and these provide as good, if not better protection than the other products.  I saw some harsh reviews on these, and the only thing I can think of is difference in body chemistry because we both experienced wonderful results with them.

The lids are attached and easily pop into place, providing a safe and secure closure.  I love the tie-dye colors of the molds.

"I was so happy to see this 5 piece silicone kitchen utensils set.  Most of my kitchen gadgets and decor is red, so this fits in perfectly with the other items I have and they are superior quality.  I am impressed with how easy they are to use and clean up.  They don't scratch my cookware and each one has a hole on the end so they can be hung up on the wall.  The color perfectly matches all of my other red items and I love the variety that is offered with this set.  They are sturdy, and well made, and everything I cook just lifts right off with nothing sticking, at all.  I have purchased other products from Magnifeko and they are always of excellent quality.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive this set at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  They are definitely deserving of a 5 star review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE0MIDSFXJN7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RT0MAWA#wasThisHelpful","RE0MIDSFXJN7R","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Modern Family has recently become my favorite show on TV.  I adore the dry wit and humor.  Every episode makes me laugh out loud and it truly reminds me of life, these days.  I saved up my slow shipping credits to purchase the entire season and I think I have enough to get a couple more.  Now, the hard part...which ones will I choose?  You can't go wrong with this hilarious sitcom.

"I already have the knife set by Vremi that comes in matching colors, so I had to get this beautiful and unique utensil set to match!  I love decor that is different from the norm and this 6 piece kitchen essentials set is that and so much more!  It comes with a red and black stand that holds each utensil, perfectly.  I love the shapes of the cut-outs in each utensil, they are geometric and absolutely unique.  The colors are bright and bold and match my decor, wonderfully.  I am so happy to have a spatula, potato masher, spaghetti spoon, ladle, slotted spoon and spoon.  The colors look amazing, especially next to my matching knife set.  I have to give Vremi credit for making such artistic kitchen gadgets.  They are like no others you will see and all of my friends compliment me on their beauty, function and quality.  However, they do get a bit jealous when I tell them I received these as a sample, gratis, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  I have no ""cons"" about this, but with most other utensils being made from silicone these days, it would be nice if they made this set from it, as well.  I love my utensils and I am so glad I have them.  They also have an awesome apple and potato peeler!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25TFMQ1LRNLHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKP3K88#wasThisHelpful","R25TFMQ1LRNLHC","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mother had wind chimes at my childhood home for as long as I can remember.  I always enjoyed listening to them when the wind was blowing.  This gorgeous set, made of renewable materials make such a beautiful sound!  I got the medium sized set of The Freedom Chime and I was in complete awe when they arrived.  They are made of bamboo and metal and are a delight to have for my home.  They are of excellent quality and the craftsmanship is flawless.  There are a total of six chimes.  I also think Brooklyn Basix has a superior product and they stand behind them with a 100% satisfaction guarantee and one year warranty.  These would make a great addition to any home.  They took me back to many wonderful childhood memories and I absolutely love them.

"This Backpack by BTOOP is awesome!  It is very sturdy and I noticed right away that all of the stitching is even and tight.  It comes in blue and pink, but the blue would be fine for a girl, too because of the adorable little giraffe print all over it.  There is a zippered pouch on the back and deep, slender pockets on each side.  The straps have a very comfortable and supportive neoprene like material in the lining which keeps it from cutting in on the shoulders.  The straps are also adjustable and there is a large loop at the top to hang it in a locker or on a storage rack at home.  The zipper pulls are large and easy to find and they and the bottom are made of tan leather.Once you unzip it and open it up, there is a large, lined pocket to keep a tablet or other electronic device.  It opens wide for deep storage of books and there are also two small pockets on the inside to hold plenty of other items.  I am quite impressed with the high quality and design of this bookbag.  It far exceeded my expectations and is perfect for back to school!  I am so glad I was chosen to receive this as a sample, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  I definitely recommend this backpack and I wish I had one like this when I was in school.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS2UOIC0XMKHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011R9X176#wasThisHelpful","RS2UOIC0XMKHE","A23XCUSIRPREG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XCUSIRPREG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Waterproof Bag by 3Cworld is the absolute perfect accessory for my upcoming trip to the beach!  I have already started testing it by packing items in it to see what all it can hold, and so far, it holds 2 phones, an MP4 Player my keys, money, ID and debit card, plus there is still a little room for other items like a room key, etc.Honestly, I didn't hold out much hope this would work properly, but when it arrived and I saw it has 3 separate ziploc type closures, it alleviated my fears.  Then, I tested it out and not so much as a drop of water got on my expensive electronics.  I just want to know where this has been my entire life?!  It also has a very sturdy waist strap that also doubles as a shoulder strap.  I can walk all over the beach and know my valuables are safe from sand and water.

"The Extreme Anti Oxidant Facial Mask by Derma-nu is becoming my favorite face treatment.  I have tried over a half-dozen products from this company and they never fail to deliver great results and always contain superior ingredients.  This mask is Kaolin Clay based and I love the tightening effect it provides when I apply it.  I put it on after I wash and tone my skin and allow it to dry for up to 30 minutes.  It does an amazing job at purging my pores and it tightens them too.  I have also noticed my skin texture is smoother and softer with each consecutive use.  It smells great and has a wonderful, thick consistency which leaves my face feeling super clean.

"I have been using the Collagen Crystal Eye Masks once a week for the past couple of weeks, and I am very happy with the results I see.  The first thing I noticed is the dark circles under my eyes have completely faded.  I thought they would never go away!  Also, my eyes aren't as puffy and the skin looks more refined, too.To apply them, simply wash your face, then pat the eye area dry.  It is a little tricky, at first, to get them on just right, but after a couple of minutes, I had the technique down the first time.  I leave mine one for about an hour.  I relax in the tub while I am wearing them and the time goes by very quickly.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive these as a sample, gratis, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.

"This ReliefX Natural Pain Relief Cream by Naturo Sciences really helps me on days when my pain is severe.  I was injured 5 years ago and I have extensive damage to my neck, back, shoulder, knee and elbow.  After using a small amount of this cream, I immediately feel the pain subside.  I really enjoy the cooling sensation I get after applying this.  I am very impressed by how quickly it works.  While there are a ton of topical treatments available, I have always found them to be expensive, and I only tried one.  This does contain menthol, which is the ingredient that reminds me of my grandmother, but I have noticed the smell quickly dissipates, and this is a huge bonus for me.

"My roommate has a sugar glider, which is an annoying little rat/squirrel looking thing.  He feeds it fresh fruit, but doesn't clean up the leftover food.  I think this is a disgusting habit of his, so I found this All-Natural bug killer, and decided to give it a go.  Honestly, I didn't hold out much hope for this bug killer, but to my surprise, it works very well and is safe enough to use around other, small, indoor pets.It arrived in a bottle that is thoroughly sealed and the trigger sprayer is included, so all I had to do was remove the lid, and puncture the seal with the end of the spray nozzle, then I simply insert the sprayer into the bottle and Poof!  I have a 16 ounce bottle of bug spray, ready to go!  I started in the kitchen with the armada of fruit flies, and I was able to kill them all!  This stuff works wonders on all of the household bugs I have used it on.

"I used to play tennis in high school, and ever since then, I have suffered from pretty bad tendonitis, or tennis elbow.  I had seen full elbow sleeves in the past, but I thought they looked too bulky and cumbersome to be comfortable for all day wear.  When I saw this, I wanted to give it a try.  The super soft braces are actually light and easy to wear, plus they are adjustable and very well made.In the box I received was two braces and a wristband.  The braces are made of Neoprene, which makes them light and easy to care for, but they provide more than adequate support for carpal tunnel and every day pain associated with constant computer use.  I really like having a 2 pack of these braces because when one is being laundered, I can wear the other.  The stitching is lined up, perfectly, on each brace and they absolutely feel like a high quality product when I am wearing them.

"I love the design of the Stainless Steel Handheld Shower Head by Waterbella.  It has a very luxurious look and the shiny chrome was a great fit for the cord I already had with my old one.  I was surprised by how easy it was to install, and they also include plumber's tape, so you don't have to go out a purchase some for fast and easy installation.  The rubber nodes on the end work great as a massager, but they also make it easy to clean any limescale out of the shower head.

"Over the past few months, I have become quite the collector of these portable power banks.  This 7800mAh Power Bank by Sentey is one of my very favorites.  While it is in the higher mAh rating, it is still super portable and even has a built-in flashlight.  The rubber coating makes it easy to find, even if it is in the bottom of my purse.  It also has dual outputs, which means it can charge two devices at once, but the best part is, it detects what amperage your device needs to be charged at to do the job more quickly and efficiently.  I also like that it has power level indicator lights, so I know when it's time to recharge the power bank.  I have this same style product in the 5200mAh size and they are both excellent quality items that I would highly recommend.  I love knowing I don't have to worry about my phones or tablet dying when I cannot access a plug.  With this on hand, I can easily charge both of my phones and tablet from around 25% battery power and still have a little extra to use the flashlight if I need, before recharging.  I have tried over a half dozen products from Sentey and I am always impressed with the quality, function and durability of them.  They are an amazing company with stellar products.

"This set of Bluetooth Headphones from CL-Power look and sound amazing!  They paired up quickly with our iPhone, Android and Tablet.  They fit very comfortably in my ears and come with a wide variety of sizes and shapes of rubber covers.  The cord keeps them securely on my neck if I want to remove them during my evening walks.  I love the built-in microphone and the sound quality of both phone calls and music is awesome.  The only con, which is really nothing, is the Micro USB charging cord is very short, but since we have a zillion of them lying around the house, as I am sure most households do, I simply used one I already had.  Don't get me wrong, it works great, but is just a bit short.  Other than that, I am very pleased with how easy these were to pair across all platforms and I also listened to a wide variety of music on them.  They sound great with anything I choose to listen to.  For the price, these are excellent quality and they really look great and they are quickly becoming my favorite headphones to wear.  The black and silver looks awesome together and I have received several compliments on them.  The instruction booklet is very detailed and these would make a great gift.

"I had been looking for a long tank with the cute side split for a bit and came upon this one. My one concern was that it is advertised as ""Juniors"" which is usually a size smaller than regular adult sizes. This is not the case though- I am 5'1"" and 105 lbs and always wear a Small so I just got a Small in this hoping it would be ok. The sizing is just fine. The Small fits like any other small Id order.The fabric is very soft and horizontally striped. The neckline is flattering. Length is about mid shin on me. The under tank is included and comes to the end of my rib cage and the rest is slightly see through. Not so much so that you see every detail of your stomach, but if you are uncomfortable showing that area of your body at all this is probably not the shirt for you. I like how it is slightly see though because you can see whatever shorts/ pants you have on underneath.Shipping was fast and easy with Prime.Im definitely going to buy this in the grey color next.

"I just recently discovered (or shall I say re-discovered) my love for coloring and all things art. Before I got this Adult Coloring Book Id gotten two others, one that was great and the other...not so much. I have tried getting coloring books with very different designs and themes to see which I like more- I love this one!First let me note the the pages are serrated so you can tear them out- a great option if you want to photo copy a page or keep each page in a book of your own art (I created one with a binder and some slip covers). The paper is thinner than construction paper, but thicker than a regular sheet of paper so any color you use is soaked into the page. I chose to use Prismacolor Colored Pencils but fine tip Sharpies or Prismacolor double tipped markers would do great too- really any medium that allows you to get very detailed and incorporate multiple colors but also color the full design.One Adult Coloring book I purchased either had too intricate of designs or very boring, repetitive ones. This one has neither, entertaining the eye with almost 3 dimensional designs that look almost Dr. Seussian. With just a mix of color you can make a part of the picture stand out or fall into the background because of how it is drawn. The designs leave room for multiple colors if you like to blend but not so much space that you waste a ton of color in one area. They are intricate but in sections so as you tackle each one the picture really comes alive.I am so glad I got this Adult Coloring Book and would recommend it to anyone who loves coloring imaginative, unique designs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19BC9X0K1EY9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486494225#wasThisHelpful","R19BC9X0K1EY9H","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this dress knowing it had a unique fit but I like unique, one of a kind clothing so this looked like a fun addition. I absolutely love it!First let me say I am pretty small: 5'1"" and around 105 lbs so I bought the Small. The straps are adjustable so you can change the neckline to be a little higher or lower. When I got it I noticed there is no tag on the inside so I had no idea which side was the front and which was the back- both are deep vee's. I found I can wear it either way and the desired result comes out fine (the pockets arent at an angle so you can do this).The pockets are a fun touch and if you put your hands in them and pull out you see that the dress is shaped like a diamond, with the top and bottom areas tighter than the hips which have a lot of roomy fabric.One of my favorite things about this dress is how it hangs on the body: like its draped horizontally (if that makes sense : ) ) Its a really fun fit and reminds me a lot of Harem pants.I can already tell Im going to get a lot of wear out of this dress. Its light enough for summer and easily paired with a sweater or jacket and boots in the fall. Its also well made so it wont fall apart after a couple wears (though I will probably never put it in the dryer).Funky dress with a different silhouette- love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CGRLDKHOOPP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OC6XYLA#wasThisHelpful","R2CGRLDKHOOPP6","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just recently got back into art and intricate coloring and found after getting the tips of 2 of my Prismacolor Colored Pencils chewed off by a sub par sharpener that I needed something better (to say the least. Prismacolor stuff is not cheap.). After searching a short bit I found this Prismacolor sharpener and figured since it was made by the company and ""colored pencil"" was in the title it would be perfect. I wasn't wrong.This is a simple little sharpener that sharpens my colored pencils to a long point- almost like when I just got them. It doesn't break the tips off or mangle the wood below the color.

"What fun and unique pants! I am so glad that I gave this style a try because they are incredibly comfortable, well made and versatile.The Design: The cotton fabric is soft and lets air flow so they dont feel too heavy- I wore them out yesterday (it was around 85 degrees) and didn't feel too warm or like all the extra fabric impeded movement. They actually are great in the movement department because you can sit down and not worry about crossing your legs if you have a skirt on yet you get the flowy-ness (lol) of a skirt. There is also a pocket on the leg that, brilliantly, has a zipper to close it. With the pant having so much fabric and movement to them anything you'd put into such a big pocket may have fallen out so the zipper is great!The fit: on the label it says ""32-44"" so I was a little worried, being on the smaller side, that these pants would not fit. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them on and they fit in both the ankle and waist/hips (you can wear them up higher or a little lower on your hips like in the picture). I have 33 inch hips and I was worried that these would fall off if I walked around but I wore them all day and they were both incredibly comfortable and stayed on. The waist and ankles are definitely designed to stretch so anyone with bigger measurements will fit into these as well- I call them the magic shrinking (or growing) pants I am 5'1"" and the length fit perfectly as well. Im not sure if they would fit, length wise, anyone over 5'6"" though. They have a lot of fabric to stretch and move with but Im not sure if they'd fit anyone taller....but who knows :)The only drawback, and this will happen with any version of harem pant because of their fit, is that they make your legs look very short and your torso very long. This in no way impedes the cute design and comfortable factor, its just an observation.Fun, versatile pants for those with a different kind of style.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZUGKWHUQ0I9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J36X1GW#wasThisHelpful","R3JZUGKWHUQ0I9","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second adult coloring book (the first one I bought I loved and found to be quiet relaxing and fun so I got another by a different designer/ artist) and I was a little disappointed with it.Let me start off with the good: the pages are thick paper that soak up color (if you are going to use anything other than colored pencils (I use Prismacolor Colored Pencils) or crayons than a piece of paper between pages will be necessary), some of the Mandala and Henna inspired artwork is fun and challenging to color and there is a lot of variation when it comes to design.The bad: the Paisley designs are so intricate that it is very hard to get anything in between the lines medium wise. Ive found I have to sharpen my colored pencil to the sharpest tip just to get in between the lines. Using a fine tip Sharpie would work as well but anything with a thicker tip will not work. And then many of the other designs are overly simplistic and I easily got bored of them. These simplistic designs aren't very pretty nor are they interesting to decorate so I found myself skipping pages and wondering why they put these designs in in the first place. Lastly, some of the Mandalas are also so intricate that its very hard to color them. When the image leaves that little space for color the end result is barely recognizable- you can hardly see the colors you put in. Using the medium I do, it takes a lot of the colored pencil to fill in the big, repetitive patterns. Unfortunately there are a lot of these large, repetitive patterns so I ended up skipping half the book. One I even started inserting design of my own just to break up the monotony.So, for those who like the bigger, repetitive designs or very very intricate ones I suggest this. For those who like detailed yet accessible enough designs for multiple colors as well as plenty of patterns that keep the eye interested, I don't think this is the book for you. There are a few pages that I found really pretty and will have fun coloring, but the majority of this coloring book is a bore.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30RM2LJ1KE7G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941325122#wasThisHelpful","R30RM2LJ1KE7G8","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a meditative hobby that I could be creative with while simultaneously letting my mind drift. After a bit of searching I found a few adult coloring books on Amazon and thought I would give them a try. Ive always enjoyed coloring intricate patterns and pictures so this book was the perfect fit!I use Prismacolor Colored Pencils but you could use fine tip Sharpies or any other coloring utensil with a fine tip. The patterns are so intricate that its best, from what I found, to have a pencil or pen that has a very fine tip. The pages are just thick enough that, when using these pencils, the color doesn't bleed through or indent the next page. If I were to use pens, though, Id definitely put a sheet of paper between so no bleeding occurs.The patterns are beautiful: ranging from larger and flowing to very detailed and small. Many of the designs look like paisley or Henna inspired.This is my first coloring book for adults and I am so glad I got it. Its fun and relaxing to color and has just enough complexity to the designs that you stay interested in finishing the page but not so much that you can't use multiple different colors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AHVJH6VP5SWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502406896#wasThisHelpful","R2AHVJH6VP5SWX","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title is misleading. Let me first start off by saying that. But let me digress first; I bought this book for a class about the female psyche. Since it was required I didn't investigate what the whole book was about. I knew it had to do with Greek mythology, the Goddesses therein and how those archetypes present in society (in women but these archetypes supposedly can be used for men as well).I won't go into why I think this book is completely off for the class because this is a review of the literature, not the class, but it is safe to say that I don't agree with its premise or that these Goddesses personality traits present themselves in women today. This book is based off of ONE culture, one set of beliefs, one time period, etc. And that's just the beginning. Every single one of these ""Goddesses"" (excluding Hera and the Virginal Goddesses) was raped, used, abused and forced. These myths were written by men. Men that thought women were property. It is evident in their personalities, what happens to them and their place in the Greek world. Basing all womens' personalities on myths from a culture thousands of years old and male dominated makes zero sense to me. I see that each Goddess has certain personality traits, but what I fail to see is how this helps any woman understand herself thoroughly and the use for ""activating"" other Goddesses in herself. Why? What would be the point? Its much easier to recognize personality traits in yourself that you find lacking and find ways of growing from them, not activating a male-conceived idea of a fictional person whose sole purpose, in one way or another, is to care for, heal from or grow with her male ""companion."" The whole premise of this book is flawed in my opinion.I did give it three stars because there is valid, in depth research, thoughtful analysis and a comprehensive understanding of Greek mythology. I see where the author was going, trying to make these Goddesses more approachable, more relevant to the age we are in. I just found no reason to do it.I would recommend this book to someone interested in Greek mythology, specifically the Goddesses of Greek mythology. I would NOT recommend it to someone trying to ""find"" themselves as you cannot find yourself in another person. Especially not one that never existed, was thought up by a male dominated society and was abused to the point of ridiculousness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TGKREF2HP8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062321129#wasThisHelpful","R13TGKREF2HP8Z","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really cute dress with a couple of issues that make it less flattering than other PattyBoutik dresses Ive purchased.First off, let me say this dress, like the others, is well made with soft, durable fabric. Like one other dress I bought its a tad too long and I will have to take it in (I am 5'1"" and wear a small). The slit is not too high, on one side of the dress and very cute.But...I found the shirring detail on the hips to be a tad too much. It makes your hips (or mine rather) look wider than they are and the fabric in between hangs in a funny way that isn't as flattering to the tummy area. When I looked at the picture I thought it would be a lighter detail, but the shirring is quite ""bunchy"" and draws a lot of attention to the hips and butt. Now, if you are comfortable with that, by all means rock it and be merry but I found it to be a little too bottom heavy.Like I said, for short people this dress may be a little long. Ill have it taken in. One thing I did notice, though, is the shirring detail bunches and lifts the hem of the dress higher so its not as long. When it does this there is more fabric gathered in your hip area creating the effect I mentioned above.All in all its a pretty dress. The neckline is lovely and the basic design of it pretty. I personally just think the shirring detail is a bit too much. Will that stop me from wearing it...no way! Its pretty and different.Shipping was ok. I got it in a week and its shipped from the states. No issues there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F67QNTYPOEWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJB7JPU#wasThisHelpful","R2F67QNTYPOEWZ","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hadn't bought shorts for awhile so it did a lot of hunting around before choosing these. I personally don't like the new fad of having half your bottom hanging out of the back of your shorts while they top comes up to your rib cage. I don't feel comfortable showing off that much skin and regular shorts are short enough, not to mention that look (in my opinion just looks cheap).Anyway, Volcom is a great brand so I knew I would get a well made short, which I did. I got a size 3 (Im 5'1"" and 105 lbs) and it fits perfectly both around the waist portion and length wise. Like I said, they are well made and really cute shorts.They got here very quickly with Amazon Prime.So if you are looking for shorts that are cute, well made and don't show too much in the back, these are the shorts for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NYFLW6YKOQ48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKFZN86#wasThisHelpful","R3NYFLW6YKOQ48","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a unique shirt/ dress!I will begin by saying the top is great- its so different and fun. I have a unique style so this dress/ shirt fits right into  my wardrobe.I started by asking ladies who had already bought this if a small or medium would fit (I am 5'1"" and 105 lbs). I got great advice from other people who bought it who recommended that, even though its short, to get a small because the top geometric portion would be too big and look sloppy. They were right! I got the small and it fits just like it does on the model (give or take :) ).I can see some of the stitching on all of the little pieces that make up the geometric top portion, but other than that the lining, zipper and rest of the dress all are well sewn. Its a tad stretchy which is nice as well (around the chest area). Women with larger breasts would probably have a harder time with the dress as it doesn't give a lot of room up top for more than a B cup (which I guess would vary upon what size you bought).Lastly, the length; it is very short. You definitely wouldn't want to bend over in it. Im going to wear it with black leggings or fun, thicker tights to solve that problem.Coming from China, it took a couple weeks to get to me, but got here before the date scheduled.Im very happy with this. Its cute, different and a fun addition to any wardrobe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZ4BMV3WCYDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBSVZF4#wasThisHelpful","R1KZ4BMV3WCYDY","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off let me say I love these boots. They remind me fashion in the 60's and they are adorable. The suede is soft and the boot is made well, especially for such a low price (to get something like this for less than 20 bucks is a steal!). I have small feet, never wearing above a 6 in any type of shoe. These fit perfectly with plenty of room for socks and leggings/jeans to be tucked in the top. I also really like that they are versatile- you can either wear them over the knee or fold them down and have a different look.The ONLY reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is because they do tend to fall down a bit. I noticed that I had to keep pulling them up to keep that above-the-knee look. What Im going to do (and suggest to others wanting to buy these boots) is buy a really thick pair of socks that will help hold them up around my leg, then the slipping down wont happen.I got them really fast thanks to Amazon Prime and am really happy I got them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZFRP7L3XQQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GAP3MF4#wasThisHelpful","R2VZFRP7L3XQQD","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty kimono. It feels good against the skin and all the tassels were unkinked and free from knots. I got a small as I am a small person but wish it was a little larger. Its probably best, though, because the tassels hang pretty low so with a medium they would be scrapping the floor.

I am pretty small all around and it was hard getting this dress over my head. Once it was on it fit correctly, but it wouldn't fit anyone bigger than me. It is incredibly short so theres so way you could wear it out without leggings or pants. The model in the picture must be 95 lbs because thats the only way this dress will fit someone like it does in the picture.Anyway, the skirt poofs at really strange angles too- in the front making you look way bigger than you are, rather than the back (like it does in the picture). It would take a ton of styling and messing with the top grey layer to make it look like it does in the picture of the back where it has 3 tiers.It took a good amount of time to get here but thats because it came from China so Im not complaining about that.Overall I would NOT recommend this dress.

"This is a cute dress but it takes a lot of tweaking and adjusting to get it to sit the right way on top.First off, let me say I am 5'1"" and 105 lbs and the Small fits perfectly. Ive found that Uxcell garments generally run by US sizes if you are smaller. Not sure if this is the case with bigger people.Secondly: the dress. It doesnt come to a neat little V at the top but is very open and kinda big up top. You have to wear a bandeau bra or tank underneath and thats as long as you tie the dress right. I havent tried wearing it out yet, but I could already tell from wearing it around the house that Id have to fix it regularly. Once you get everything fixed and adjusted, it does look cute. Its a tad short so leggings or thicker tights would be good. The fabric is a cheaper wool type but the sewing and condition of the dress seems to be in order. If it wasnt for the strange top section this would actually be very cute.What Im going to do is take it in and have the top stitched closed a bit so I dont have to spend so much time tying it perfectly and then having to retie it every time I move.Taken all these issues into account, I am a little disappointed that I didnt get another plaid dress, but Ill make this one work.

Many times why buying from China its best to get one size up from your regular size, but Ive had experiences with some companies where I got my regular size (a small) and the dress fit perfectly.

"This dress has a lot to recommend it and just a few things Im not as eager about; its made well, with a very soft fabric and looks on the body exactly (well, almost exactly) as shown in the picture.

It folds over nicely but you have to keep adjusting it in order to get it to stay in the right place and folded over. I might just take it in and have it sewn down. I havent tried this on with leggings yet, but I think Ill feel most comfortable in those. I used Amazon Prime so it got here quickly.

"The best word to describe this film is ""strange."" Without giving the plot away or too many details, this bottom feeder of a human being (if you can call him that) who preys on others to survive ends up filming the horrid stuff people do to sell to the news. Hes evil, crafty and utterly insane. But the story meanders and in the middle you find yourself wondering what the point is.....if there is one. The only part of this movie I found astounding, and the real reason I rented it was to see Gyllenhaal's amazing transformation- down about 40 pounds or so. It reminded me the Machinist with Christian Bale- amazing what actors do to their bodies for a role, but that role and the story has to be worth it. Not so sure this one was worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROPU3EQRKTICF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF874XE#wasThisHelpful","ROPU3EQRKTICF","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really nice, loose tunic shirt. My husband loves this brand and has gotten a ton of shirts from them so I decided to look at their stuff for women and I wasnt disappointed. I love the strangely placed pocket and, sizing wise, its true to American sizes. Im 5'1"" and 105 lbs and the Small fits just like the picture.

"After looking at the sizing (it said that a M was like a US Small) I got the medium, trusting the sizing instructions. Well, that didnt work out. The medium was way too big on me but Amazon (and Tom's Ware I think) immediately sent me the postage to return it and, the day I put it in the mail, they put the money back in my account. So I immediately went back on and got a S or US XSmall. It got here very quickly (Amazon Prime), which is always a good thing. Ive never had anything but good experiences dealing with Amazon.So, onto the garment. I am 5'1"" and 105 lbs and the S/ US XSmall fits perfectly. This item, from my experience, did run a tad big. The fabric is soft but heavy enough that its very warm. One of my favorite features of this jacket is that it can be worn open for one look or zipped up for a completely different look. It is now one of my favorite jackets and I wore it all last night and was warm and comfortable. The only issues I found (and they really arent that big of a deal) are that the wrists are pretty tight and the bottom of the jacket is as well. Not sure why this is, but Im hoping the wrists will stretch out with wear. Other than that I am more than happy with both the customer service and the garment itself. If youre looking for a cute, unique jacket/ hoodie (by the way, the hood is the perfect size and fits really well) that has 2 neat looks, look no further. Great buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AASGC3V9SGUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KV0WJYO#wasThisHelpful","R3AASGC3V9SGUC","A1MW215W7L41T1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MW215W7L41T1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice vest; well made and attractive on. The only reason this was given 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because it looks nothing on like it does in the picture. The vest goes up way higher on the chest instead of the deep V shown in the picture. Either way it looks very stylish and nice on. My husband did have to get 2 sizes up from his usual size (he usually wears a Large but had to get a XXL and its still a bit tight) so that would be another issue he had with the garment. Other than these two issues this vest is an attractive find. He did get this article very quickly and it came from China- less than 2 weeks.

"Another win for the Doublju brand! My husband really likes this vest/ scarf combination. He got a size up (and XL whereas he usually wears a Large) due to the difference in Chinese sizing and it fits him perfectly. The vest is made very well and has a great look to it with the slanting buttons. He loves this brands unique clothes for men. All are a little different in one way or another as well as very well made, making them a great buy. The scarf section can hang to the sides or go around the neck which is a nice touch. Its a soft material, which is different than the vest which is regular vest material (not sure what kind that is. Smoother, etc.). Due to Amazon Prime we got this item quickly.

As usual, he got a size up from his usual size (he usually wears a size Large but got an XL due the difference in Chinese sizes), and it fits perfectly.

"So darn cute. We bought this for our 1 year old son to grow with. Our almost 3 year old had a lion one- almost exactly the same only didn't bounce- and he loved it as he grew and was able to walk and then push things around. That toy was retired due to excess wear so we wanted one for our youngest son. We like the handle that he can hold when sitting on it and scooting along. Right now hes too little to do much but sit on it but Im excited for when he'll be able to push it around the house, etc. Only problem we have with it; when we put the handle up (it does stow nicely underneath), its wobbly. We've tried tightening it, making sure pieces werent missing, etc. but I think thats just how its made. When you're pushing it with the handle the handle wobbles back and forth quite a bit.

"I really wanted to like this little all in one unit.Setup is not as easy as they make it seem and if you ( or rather when) you run into a problem the instructions don't even give you a hint of what to look for. I read online somewhere that if your router has an B/G protection and its enabled, you can't connect this to you router with any kind of password protection. I found the setup to be odd, you plug in this security system and it creates its own wifi ssid. You install the app onto your phone and connect it to the ssid of the security system and set up your account, before it's even connected to your home wifi.Once you're lucky enough to get it set up, the video is adequate at 640 x 480. The sensor is cmos, but not HD. You can take still shots thru the app, but not video. The plastic triangle top that covers the camera and 9 night vision lights is removable, but it doesn't make a big difference either way. The manual does say not to point the camera toward a window or light source, it greatly affects how well the motion sensor works ( which isn't that great to begin with).It doesn't have the ability to tilt, so you have to set it up high enough to get the view you want. I have three dog and a cat, they never set it off, even without using the pet function. It's pretty good at sending email notifications, but I never got the other notifications to work at all. The siren is VERY loud, and there are several settings for how long it sounds, which is great if you want to scare off intruders before they take anything. There is no zoom, even digital.It supports a 32gb sd and overwrites the oldest recordings when it gets full. The app gives you the option to arm, make all the settings and even shows how much free space the SD had.It says there is two way communication and I can see what I believe is a mic, but I haven't been able to figure out how to activate communication, or set the audio detection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KRYAX0JC094A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEKXJ6U#wasThisHelpful","R3KRYAX0JC094A","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The handheld unit is small, about the size of a deck of cards. It has 4 contacts, but comes with 2 large, double pads. Each pad uses 2 contacts, but you can purchase different contacts. The type of pulse depended on the setting you choose, 6 in all. When you select an option, it shows you how long that session lasts, 20 minutes or 30 minutes, then it shuts off automatically. You can intensify the strength of the pulse to what ever your most comfortable with. I used it on my lower back, which was really sore from lifting and moving heavy boxes. I went thru two 20 minute sessions, and it did help a lot.I've read that many people use this for bad knees and even to expedite healing of broken bones.I did see the same device with the same contents, for sell on costco dot com for about $70.The gel backed pads are reusable and can be wiped with cool wet cloth to clean the gel when it gets full of body oil or dust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317L2RXTTUFRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EDYF3O#wasThisHelpful","R317L2RXTTUFRA","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little concerned about some of the reviews I read about burning. I'm also highly allergic to perfumes and have a pretty keen sense of smell.When I but this on my freshly washed face, it did sort of have a very slight ""burning"" sensation on the areas of my face that had sores, especially around my nose. But I wouldn't say it burned, just that I could slightly feel it working.As for it smelling bad, I couldn't smell anything but an extremely slight scent of mud.Even using it as suggested, liberally, there are far more than 3 or 4 uses. I didn't but a dent in the 3.4 oz tube I got. I consider it to be average size with an average amount of contents. Maybe others got different size tubes than I got, I don't know.It did leave my skin feeling a little dry, but I've always thought you were supposed to follow a mask with a light moisturizer, which I've always done.The ingredients only lists Dead Sea mud and minerals. I didn't follow up by looking it up on the website.After a couple uses, I did notice smaller pores. Though my face did breakout a little at first, I guess from bringing all that junk to the surface, it stared clearing up and is noticeably better than it was before I started using it.I think All skin products are too expensive, this no more so than most of the other general store brands, and a lot less than some some specialty brands. So I feel it's in line with other, similar products.The part I like the best is that you only have to keep it on for two minutes before rinsing. I don't think it's the best product I've ever used, but it certainly isn't bad, in my opinion.

"I must admit I'm surprised this really long cable actually works with my older i9900 cannon printer. I have two desktop computers, one running windows 7 and the other 8.1. I never could get this wide inkjet printer to work with my windows 8.1 computer, but the printer is so large I have no where to put it near the other computer. So when I was offered a chance to try this long cable, I thought I'd give it a try. Most printers suggest using a 10' or less cable, so I never really thought this would work. I'm not sure how or why it does, but I'm really pleased that it does. It's a well made, heavy cable, a little thicker than most of my other USB 2.0 cables. The connectors are nice and snug so I'm not worried about loose connection.

"I'm sure everyone's read about the games, earning coins for the wheel to unlock more games, but the part my kids loved was winning stickers for decorating and being able to take selfies with the characters.I like that the playing cards are also stored in the game so if they get lost the kids can still play the game. I find the graphics to be really good, and I can connect the leap pad to my computer to print out the selfies. The 5 and 6 year olds really loved the game and the ability to use the camera with the game, but the learning part is great for preschoolers.Because of the combination of actives (games, learning, selfies, decorating), and the challenges get harder the better you get, I think this is a great game for preschool through 2nd grade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SH6QE64W0BPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1OP90#wasThisHelpful","R3SH6QE64W0BPO","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The picture looks like the mist is thick and low, but I see a cone shape mist that widens as it gets higher. It's a fine mist, but is clearly visible. I use distilled water so I don't get crusty buildup that needs to be cleaned. I also only plan to use it during those really dry nights when my 8 yr old is uncomfortable sleeping. You can hear it, but it's a steady, soft sound that I actually find soothing. It comes with two risers, you can use one or connect them and raise the mist about two feet. The night light is quite bright but can be turned off. The changing color numbers on the front can be annoying, but I taped a small piece of colored tape over the display. I can still read the display but it dims the light.There is a water tank that lifts off the back and a cap that unscrews from the bottom for filling. I recommend removing the tank after each use to let everything dry completely. The manual also recommends cleaning the small hole in the base to keep it clear.My only complaint is that the warm mist doesn't really seem warm. It feels the same as the cold mist to me. Otherwise, it hasn't leaked and has worked as promised. I've only had a chance to use it in testing, so during winter use, if I find any issues, I'll update this post.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P71P3QNN7BV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9IJK5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1P71P3QNN7BV4","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Super cute, but 1 yr old needs help coordinating the go button and steering. It's pretty small, so even a big 3 yr old looks a little big on it, but it says it will hold up to 40 pounds.Most of it is pretty simple to put together, but don't get over confident and not pay attention, as I did. Taking a wrongly placed wheel off is not as easy as putting it on.I let the kids help with the stickers, so they aren't on exactly as pictured.... Or even close. So if you care about that, better put them on yourself because once on, that's it.It seems very sturdy and well built, and once the battery is fully charged it lasts as long or longer than the attention span of the child. Ours was actually working the next morning for about 10 minutes or so.I've never seen a little battery operated vehicle for kids so young, it's great to watch the little ones trying to keep up with bigger brother. I'd say the perfect age for this bike is about 2, but the little one yr old sure gets a kick out of it.Worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R8OEHWWJPTEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2SD340#wasThisHelpful","R2R8OEHWWJPTEH","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a parent  I love this game for a few reasons, kids think they are playing while they are actually learning, the games get the kids up and twirling, waving and watching themselves on TV with the characters from frozen.I found setup to be simple, I did by pass the wifi part, and the games were 100% usable.I agree that it feels like a Wii for little kids but this sensor has a camera that puts the kids right on screen and in the game.The math starts out really simple, recognizing numbers, then putting them in order and finally equations. If you have 2 battery operated controllers 2 kids together.I found the on screen motions to be pretty good, quick response and accurate. The pointer controller took longer for my little one to master, but did.The 5 games are all completely different and the kids get rewarded with interactive play.I thought the product is great for per schoolers, especially when the weather won't permit outdoor play.

"My 8 year old has developed an interest in science, and has always been an aggressive and successful Lego builder. He was excited to get this project. He cleared off his work table and layer out all the pieces with the instructions in front of him. He realized he put two pieces together before inserting one of the rubber bands, so he had to remove a piece. Well, it broke. It was the main shaft, so that means he can't build any of the projects. He is really upset with himself, and it's not a piece I can ""fix"".This kit is definitely meant for a little older kids or kids and parents together.

"The perfect blaster for younger zombie hunters. The other blaster that he has that uses these larger darts is so big he can hardly hold it up for accurate blasting. This is smaller, easier to hold and easy to recycle or pump for the next round. He didn't have any jams, and is able to fire very quickly.

"we had a nerf blaster battle yesterday and my 8 year old went through all his 6 blasters and finally decided he liked this one better than all the others. When everyone else was out of darts, he kept going. These darts shot the farthest and fastest. When one chamber is out, he just cranks over a full one. The size is perfect for him. He could carry it and run and fire at the same time. The cock action is easy and it didn't jam a single time in over an hour of rough play. I wish I could upload a video of the battle, I had so much fun just watching them.The green darts this comes with are the same size as the blue ones, but it's nice to have the two colors when two kids are using different shooters so they can keep track of whose darts are whose.I should mention, he doesn't have any trouble firing or rotating the chambers. Even his little 8 year old hands fit nicely on the trigger and kind of trigger pump. He didn't need any instructions to figure out how it works.It is by far the most fun blaster he has, and no batteries, so it doesn't die half way through a battle.

"These fit my tall kitchen trash can perfectly. They have an elastic opening, but it isn't like the opening is smaller than usual, just stretchy. I still pull the handles in and tie the handles to make the opening smaller so it stretches around the top of my trash can. It does stay put much better than other bags of similar size. I notice a ver slight scent, but it's a clean rather than perfume scent. The most improved thing I notice is that, when I pull the full bag out of the trash can, it seems to come out much easier and doesn't get hung up or tear. Considering I use it in my recycling trash can, with bottles, cans, and other large, heavier items, that's impressive. The handles are secured to the bag better too. They don't tear off as my 8 year old is taking out the trash.Because these bags are so stretchy I can add a lot of stuff after I pull the bag out of the trash can. It seems pretty empty once it's out of the metal can. So I save my milk bottles, and other large items, to go into the bag after other bags I've considered to be full.When I use these bag on my bag holder under my sink, they stay on the rack much better than other bags because of the stretchy opening. When that bag gets too full to fit under the sink, there's enough room in the bag for me to collect all the trash from all my waste baskets. I can really cram all that stuff in. Once I tie the bag closed, there's no odor....These bags might measure slightly smaller and/or thinner, but I find I can get as much or more in them, and they are nicer and easier to use.Oh, and another plus, 4 educational box tops on each box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZNPAFPZ0BVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBGVQE8#wasThisHelpful","R33ZNPAFPZ0BVK","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a lot bigger and heavier than I expected. I'm assuming because it's industrial strength, what ever that means. There are not really any instructions.

They fit together, so I put the plate on the bottom, but I'm not sure why. There is a tiny light on the front, but I couldn't tell it was on, maybe because it's so small. But if I look through the side of the charger I can see a light, so I know it's plugged in correctly.. When I plugged in my iPod and android phones, they lite up right away and stared charging.I like that the ports are ""smart"", so they provide the amount of power needed by each if the devices.

"We were invited to a bar b q and I brought this kit as my hostess gift. I was surprised to see the young adults were as excited by it as the kids were. One of the suggested heating methods suggested for a bar b q is to put the ingredients together, for the s'mores and wrap them in aluminum foil and set them on the grill for about 4 minutes, after the grill has cooled a bit. Each of us stacked and wrapped our own s'more. The kids were great, the ""big kids"" we're trying to find new ways to make s'mores. By having everything wrapped in the foil there's no mess on the grill, cool. And it worked beautifully, the marshmallow and chocolate melted just right. If your grill is still hot from freshly cooking meat, 4 minutes might be too long. Even though we didn't get to roast the marshmallows, it was fun and delicious. All the kids, big and little, were licking the foil after eating their smore. It was a great gift to bring to a bar b q, different and something everyone got to participate in.

"The vacuum works really well, one of the best I've used. I prefer bags because I can't stand cleaning messy bagless containers. The low setting is quiet, and still does a decent job in situations where you might be concerned about the noise. The high setting, though not as loud as many, still is noisier than I expected.It has a short cord attached to the vacuum and comes with a standard, 35' three prong extension cord. The cord wraps and stores just like any cord on a vacuum. But you can replace this extension cord with a lighter, shorter cord if you want.The part I was most disappointed with, having three dogs and lots of hair, is that you have to remove five screws to get the brush out for cleaning.There are angled little brushes on both sides of the base to get the dirt right up against a wall. It doesn't come with any attachments or any place to put attachments, so you still need a small canister vac for all those other areas that need vacuuming, like baseboards.But for a school or commercial vacuuming, it is heavy duty, easy to move around with handles in several places.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5SG5G8HRZDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","R3E5SG5G8HRZDM","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My slender 8 year old likes his jeans tight at the waist, even with the elastic waist sizer pulled and buttoned on the tightest notch, it's still a bit too wide. The length is just perfect, just below the ankle, so if your boy is on the taller side, it might be a tad short. It says it's pre shrunk, so I'm going to wash it a couple times to soften it up. The denim is heavy and very well made, a definite plus for an active boy. The price is great. The only thing that worries me is the metal button waist is really tight and hard for him to get buttoned. But I'm sure, after a few washes and wears it will loosen up and get easier to button.

When you stop pushing it stops flowing.There is no air hole, so it can be a little tricky to drink hot coffee without getting burned.It's a nice looking mug, the exterior is textured, and because it's so small around it's easy to hold in my small hand.I can't really drink from the hole, I have to let the coffee fill into the extended ridge and drink from the lip. I think with a little practice I could get use to it.It does seem to be leak proof, which is a plus, especially since it's so tall and narrow.It won't be my number one mug, but on those special occasions where this shape makes the difference, it's a good choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNNFJZ226Z42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VG761C#wasThisHelpful","RYNNFJZ226Z42","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this mop. First, you have to be sure to screw the handles together all the way. Even then, this isn't a scrub mop, I found I had to be a little careful how much pressure I used while mopping. Carrying the bucket around, with one side full of water and one side pretty much empty, is awkward. Then, to spin the mop you have to manually get all the little mop pieces in the spinner, or you wind up with a hug mess everywhere. Also, you're supposed to be able to remove the mop from the plastic head to launder, but getting it out isn't easy. I was afraid I'd either break the mop handle or pull the mop pieces apart. I think it's too expensive and doesn't work as smoothly or as well as I'd hoped.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZRUYPBFCDO1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KU2V8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZRUYPBFCDO1A","A3NOBH42C7UI5M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NOBH42C7UI5M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never thought in my life that I would be interested in this topic of the Supreme Court and Dissent, but I think in light of recent events and the role of the Supreme Court decisions in the Obama Administration, I knew I needed to learn more. This is a long, detailed book and so I've been reading small sections at a time so I can focus on Mr. Urofsky's thorough discourse without distraction.In particular, I found his overview of each Supreme Court Justices and dissents very good and informative. The opening to Chapter 12 ""CODA"" includes some harsh criticism of the Supreme Court and its members stated (surprisingly) by the very same Members in their dissents. Antonin Scalia's dissent in the recent Court decisions on Same Sex Marriage received a lot of attention in the press, and Chief Justice John Roberts' dissent led to a Montana man to file for a marriage license to his second wife as he felt the Justice's comments on plural marriage rights encouraging.I have no direct comments about the results of this Supreme Court decision and dissents, but reading this book at the time all these historical decisions were at the forefront was very helpful and interesting to say the least.

No heavy pressure needed and it's alot like slowly brushing through your hair. I still need to comb out or detangle before straightening, but once that's done I do a section at a time. No fuss.I decided to try to keep the straight hair over a few days and see how maintenance will work out. It's been so EASY! I just work on the sections that frizzed or curled--like underneath near my neck where I sweat--and in a few minutes my hair is refreshed and straight. I can't say enough!

"The gentlemen in the household gave it a thumbs up, but it's not as good in quality or results as a similar Remington razor we have (it is more expensive though). I like the idea of a cleaner to keep the blades clean and make them last longer. In fact, the cleaner makes this a better razor because after a cleaning, it shaves closer and smoother, so it does add value. The question is that is the cleaner necessary to get a closer/better shave -- for this shaver I say yes. However, you may find another similar type razor does as well or better without a gadget and $$ refills.The cleaning station itself is MUCH larger than the razor (unlike in the photo) and takes up more than normal counter space. You insert the razor upside down (it will charge this way too) and then press a button. I had trouble fitting the razor into the station until I figured out that you press/release the top and it pops open wider. You do not need to squeeze the razor in place. In the end, I like this razor but still the (considerably more expensive) Remington XR1340 does a better job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJ2KPZHXSCJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDMS#wasThisHelpful","R2TJ2KPZHXSCJS","A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“The Wild Inside” promises suspense and mystery and Christine Carbo does something a lot of debut authors wish for--her first book really delivers and fulfills every expectation.  I really enjoy her writing style—it feels modern and fresh with a lot of thought-provoking information packed into the story without slowing the reader down.I am very familiar with the area of Montana close to Glacier National Park and have been in the park often. There have been several really high profile crimes and attacks that grabbed the headlines in the last 5 years and Ms. Carbo fills in with answers to questions on how these investigations work and how all these government agencies work together in complicated situations in a remote part of the country.The bear attack images reminded me of a recent “Dateline” that covered a father and daughter grizzly attack in Glacier – it’s frightening and very realistic when you realize this can happen to anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time. I personally witnessed a grizzly bear in Glacier one year when we took a group of students to the Logan Pass visitor’s center and walked the trail behind it. It’s thrilling but scary even at a distance.For those of you who are fascinated with Glacier National Park, grizzlies, mysteries and a good investigative thriller, “The Wild Inside” is for you.NOTE: I received a free copy of the book from the Publisher in return for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OA7NZ1XB8LEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476775451#wasThisHelpful","R2OA7NZ1XB8LEW","A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This could have been a good match for me, as Ms. Slater and I have a few things in common: I grew up in Massachusetts, I spent a lot of time in ""Southie"" when it was still an Irish, blue-collar section of Boston and we've both spent time in Japan. But because of my background I'm afraid this book was not the right match.I have a degree in Japanese Language and Lit and lived in Japan for two years. I started in HS hosting Japanese students over three years, then went to Okinawa as a junior. After college, I was the only American in a prestigious girls' private school with over 1,500 students and over 100 Japanese staff (about 50/50 men and women) with a Principal and Vice Principal who were Japanese NUNS. I came back to the US and spent two summers teaching Japanese college students from Nagasaki English (boys and girls).:: Stop here if you do not want to read spoilers! ::As a memoir, I cannot say anything to invalidate Ms. Slater's experience in Japan, of course, as we all experience life through our own eyes and it's an individual's POV. However, I take exception to the book's implication that Japan is place so alien and unreachable (and somehow less than society and culture in the US) that Ms. Slater's experience and POV is a common one any American would experience. In fact, I found the first 148 pages of her not even trying the least bit to communicate, making assumptions about the Japanese people and culture based on American thought and refusing to do anything to learn the smallest thing about Japan except through her husband disingenuous.This is someone who is highly educated, teaches graduate students at a top Boston university and lived a life of upper class privilege (although she claimed at some point in the book to be ""middle class"") who can't navigate the simplest thing (shopping, eating out, basic phrases, walking in the neighborhood) in a different country where the people bend over backwards to help you and graciously ignore any faux pas or rudeness you cause. At the same time, she had very high expectations for Toru, her future husband, to fit into life in Boston complete with speaking English at a higher level than he could manage and being social with her friends. I don't get this double-standard.I'm concerned about her assumptions and stereotypes about Japan giving readers in the US an incorrect view of the people and culture. I get that from a writing standpoint there needs to be a story arc or character arc, but this goes beyond building a story board where the main character make a complete change by the end.For example, Japanese women being subservient to their husbands and having to stay home instead of being independent. It's not always the case at all. I worked with dozens of Japanese women who taught full-time (6 days a week in Japan) with families, some were still working at over 50. My landlady ran a large boarding house and taught part-time with kids going into college and one entering high school. My Japanese best friend and her fiancé clearly had a relationship where he worked but she called ALL the shots and he accommodated her fully much like Toru did for Ms. Slater. This was the case for several other Japanese women I knew. The biggest reason someone needs to be home in Japan is that the education system is so demanding that a parent (99% mothers) has to manage their child's educational career from pre-school on. The mother takes care of every need and these kids study 12-14 hours a day.She includes ""cute"" anecdotes that are supposed to show how alien and quirky Japanese people are, for example, otaku: ""Toru explained that Japan bred otaku of every stripe, fanatics passionate about one phenomenon or another: manga, anime, even cosplay, where adults dress up and walk around as characters from video games, movies, and comic books."" Um, we have that in the US... Hasn't Ms. Slater (or her big publisher's editor) ever heard of Comicon? Or watched the Big Bang Theory? Or heard of geeks or nerds (I am a proud one!) It's 2005 in the book, but readers may think that it's referring to today. Many, many US teens love anime, manga and graphic novels that are the fodder of otaku pursuits in the US, too.Finally, after page 148 where she realizes she can't communicate the slightest bit with her new future in-laws, clearly causing social situations that are difficult to tolerate and maneuver for Toru and his family, Ms. Slater decides to learn some Japanese. I felt this was a more realistic direction although she is self-serving to the bitter end of the book.  And it's the only reason I gave this book ""three stars"" instead of two.I could go on, but I think it's up to the reader to see the incongruity and discrepancies and to read knowing that this person's experience is not a true education on Japan and Japanese society. If you are interested in reading some (fictional) books that include insight to the Japanese mind and experience I highly recommend Ruth Ozeki's ""A Tale for the Time Being"" A Tale for the Time Being: A Novel which through the story and footnotes, she conveys a lot of Japanese culture in a compelling story about a non-mainstream Japanese teen. Also I enjoyed the fictionalized ""American Fuji"" by college professor, Sarah Backer, who writes about her experience teaching in Shizuoka, Japan.American Fuji","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGLSPYB8T2FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399166203#wasThisHelpful","R2GGLSPYB8T2FZ","A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure how this hair color would be any better than every other hair color on the market,but so far I really love it! I don't have alot of gray (and  it's only semi-permanent) but I used this as a kind of root touch-up to color around my face and a couple spots in my hairline that are getting more gray hairs. I normally use whatever is on sale (often just a root touch up product) and some kind of medium to dark ash brown. I mixed half of the containers in a small plastic tray I saved and applied with a left over Root Touchup Kit brush. I saved the leftovers for applying next time I need some color (they say not to do this but I have for sometime now with no problem!)The dye is a creamy, orangey colored mixture with NO odor at all. My eyes didn't sting and my scalp didn't either. No ammonia smell in my bathroom and that made coloring a pleasant experience. I followed regular directions to leave it on-- and hoped for a rich brown without orange/red brassyness. And that's exactly what I got. It blended covered the gray and blended with the other shades in my hair wonderfully. I can't see the chocolate tone indoors but I do see alot of shine. Outside it's a nice rich chocolatey color. What's even better is NO HELMET HEAD solid dark color that looks unnatural (have you seen John Travolta lately?).

"Like everyone getting all the phones and tablets charged from one outlet is a pain (No, you BETTER NOT unplug my phone!). This charger helps with some limitations. It's got a relatively small footprint (about the size of a cordless phone base) and 3 USB slots to plug into. You do have to provide the USB>MiniUSB cords yourself but that's not a big issue. I like that the power cord stows away in the base and it's decent length. The slots to place your phone or tablet works with my Kindle Fire 7"" and the original Kindle Fires my kids have. BUT unfortunately the slots are too narrow for the Kindle case on my Kindle so I have to remove it to set it in the slot.

"The Kenwood dicing attachment will tackle almost anything you put through it! I am thoroughly enjoying my Kenwood Chef mixer (KMC010) and I find the attachments make the mixer an all-in-one workhorse. The dicer only _dices_ fruit, vegetables and meats, you cannot slice or shred with it. However, I am a busy cook--who cooks often from scratch--and dicing is the #1 chopping I do because I use alot of recipes that call for onion, carrot, celery and potatoes. This weekend I went through 5 lbs of carrots, 3 lbs of onion and 3 lbs of potatoes for 3 separate meals in one session, quick and easy. If you do alot of big family meals or a small catering service, the dicer will be a  big time saver.The pluses: Great power, comes apart for easy cleaning, parts fit together easily, does pound after pound of dicing with no strain on the motor.The cons: only dices, VERY sharp blades so be aware when taking apart and putting back together, cannot change the size of the dice (there's only one size).I HIGHLY recommend you keep the included manual/instructions in order to know what each part is and how it goes together. I was very glad to to have the manual when I needed it. Also, I do recommend cleaning out the hopper when changing ingredients otherwise you will get a mix of two ingredients once you start dicing a new one.NOTE: I received this Dicing Attachment from Kenwood in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SC6KHGDXYGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QS981O4#wasThisHelpful","R31SC6KHGDXYGM","A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on my experience reading Bill O’Reilly’s other books, this was pre-ordered since the day I heard it was coming. I am not a history expert, but thrilling books like this encourage me to continue learning about it. In each of the ""Killing ..."" series, I surprisingly have learned much more than I formerly did on the subject and about the person. With Ronald Reagan comes personal history like facts connected to his days in the actors guild and of course the facts leading up to the shooting. The story unfolds as only O'Reilly can tell it, very well--with great emotion! The master story-teller! Maybe Bill's reading, and later Robert Petkoff's, is the best ingredient for this (I bought the audiobook) as they present a ""big picture"" of all this. It is a quick read, because you want to get to the highlights. It is written in a way that there is a gradual buildup, chapter by chapter. Even if you know what's coming, the authors are all about maximizing the suspense by delaying what is anticipated. And, it's done masterfully by adding more and more details to the story in a way that moves like a mystery novel. It thickens the plot, pushing the culmination further out. Great suspense! Engaging!

"This is a great, and let me add, a necessary concept presented here in this day and age. I think it is isolating something that requires attention and focus in all of our lives, something to integrate into our daily living or just our life. This was referred to me by Amazon during a search for something I was fascinated by after reading Eric Metaxas' fabulous work: Seven Men: And the Secret of Their Greatness. Somehow, I did not record the reference, however, the recommendation was for a spiritual benefit that would be gained by reading this. The recommendation was on target. It was a quick read, about three days. McKeown's focus was what would be considered ""Simplicity"" in the Spiritual Life. This is quite critical if one is to practice detachment and be rid of the distractions that divert us and the obstacles that set us back. And speaking of ""essential,"" there is not much more important in the Spiritual Life than what he presented fabulously: learning to live in the ""NOW!"" The whole thing resonated well. He gave very good examples. However, about two-thirds into it, it grew very monotonous. That's why I took off a star. He could have said the same with a lot less ink. Instead of repeatedly harping on the ""Essentialist mantra,"" he could have used imaginative analogy to communicate his thoughts and not have worn out the reader. Still, the concept is great. I am left with vivid memories of action that can be of great benefit if incorporated into my life, or maybe better as he said simply lived and not another task to perform.

"This is one of the best set of tires I have ever owned or driven on. For decades I have been an exclusively Michelin buyer & driver. I had only bought Continental tires once & hated them. When I began to look into buying tires for an AWD Cadillac STS, I was very surprised by the research I did and the reviews that I read. So, I took a chance, based on others recommendations. These tires have been excellent on wet and dry ground. They wear extremely well, so far. After more than 25,000 miles they were still looking fairly new. If I could fault them in any way, it would be that they are a little soft on hard turns, and are a bit noisy on badly paved roads--not too bad though! They are fun to drive on and handle well in almost every way. If I could fault them in any way, it would be that they are a little soft on hard turns, and are a bit noisy on roads with poor pavement conditions--not too bad though! They hardly ever hydroplane--it takes torrential downpour to happen, or an unavoidable incredibly large puddle to appear, before this occurs. They drive well in snow and have better than average traction on ice. These would be a confidence-builder to anyone afraid to drive in snow on highways or major thoroughfares. I was forced to have to drive home one evening in over 12 inches of unplowed snow. I was genuinely surprised by the grip and control I had while driving a good number of miles. I am sure that some of this was due to the car's all-wheel drive, traction control, and ABS braking. Still, I say these tires are a winning combination to work with these. I cannot recommend them too highly. These allowed me to look forward to the snow!With the performance package on my STS, these are the rear tire size.

"When I was much younger, I did very well in the subject of undergraduate Philosophy and so I went go on for further studies. I already had a degree in Computer Science and had done well so far in an Engineering career. I now enrolled in the graduate program at Fordham University. I spent a year doing some of the most fascinating studies and research in my life. With the books and articles that were part of my curriculum, I read about 6,000 pages that year. At lot was spent studying the human mind, knowledge, and how we come to know. A good part of the remainder was spent studying evolution from a philosopher's point of view, i.e. what makes sense and what doesn't. Philosophers then take those things that make sense and show why they do and vice-versa. I was not able to finish the program. I tried later on, but after a semester found I could not give it the time it deserved. The Masters and Ph.D. I had to forgo, but I walked away with another priceless addition to my education. One of the riches came from a microbiologist, Michael Denton, and his work Evolution: A Theory In Crisis. He painstakingly showed the complexity of life down at the molecular, cellular and atomic levels. He showed how incredibly ordered it was also. Using these scientific facts, he compared them with the supposed ""randomness"" of evolution and also of the mechanism of what we have called ""natural selection."" His conclusion was that the probability for something like a molecule to mutate to another kind of molecule was very high. But the probability for the number of molecules to mutate in the same way (like in the case of the human eye from an animal) and result in the same basic changes in every creature was astronomical. This idea is worth following. It is worth investigating. So many people continue accept the things of evolution as fact. It would only take a small number of our people, with minds that question and search for the truth about things to follow Denton's ideas and premises further and reach the bottom of this argument once and for all.Years later, I read some more by Michael Denton. I found Nature's Destiny: How the Laws of Biology Reveal Purpose in the Universe to be another of his enthralling works. You'll get a look at how many are being duped by the ""carbon"" theory.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFP6IGLEFHBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0917561058#wasThisHelpful","R3UFP6IGLEFHBB","A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In autobiographical form, a comprehensive account of this brilliant and scholarly Anglican priest's conversion to Catholicism. This man was an intellectual giant--head of the Oxford Movement. They were going to reform the Church. They were sure they had it all together and were on the right track. Like many others, he was fine until he began to read the Church Fathers. It was there where he first saw his error. He then began to study and master the history of the heretical Monophysites of the 5th century. He was also convinced that he was on the side of the Early Church and vice-versa. However, here he found that Rome stood exactly where it did currently in the nineteenth century, and his Anglican stand reflected the heretical sect. He said, ""I saw my face in that mirror, and I was a Monophysite."" Case closed! He explained, ""Of all the passages of history, since history has been, who would have thought of going to the sayings and doings [of this heretical sect] in order to be converted to Rome!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P1Z2MZ60E44Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486442136#wasThisHelpful","R3P1Z2MZ60E44Z","A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the ""Preface"" of this spiritual treatise, Father Eugene Boylan tells us,""There is a phenomenon in the natural order which illustrates a great principle of the supernatural order; it is the structure and the growth of crystals. Each crystalline substance has its own characteristic shape; wherever complete crystals occur, not only the whole crystal, but also each unit of it, has that particular shape. If a crystal be suspended in a suitable solution of the substance of which it is composed--the ""mother liquor"" as it is called--that crystal will grow by drawing to itself material from the solution, forming it to its own image and likeness, and then uniting it to itself, yet so that the new and greater unity is an exact replica of the original nucleus and of each of the component units.""Father Boylan tells us what we already know that ""On the cross, Christ 'summed up' in one sacrificial act His whole life and His whole love."" Yes, it was in His life and death that He still ""sums up"" the whole life and destiny of His Church, and also the whole life and death of each member of that Church. What he ""summed up"" we have received in Baptism. It is in Baptism that we have become this ""exact replica of the original nucleus."" As Saint Gregory of Nazianzus tells us, ""Christ is bathed in light; let us also be bathed in light. Christ is baptized; let us also go down with him, and rise with him."" We share in his life; we bear his resemblance in Baptism.Father Boylan explains that this book is his attempt to outline the love story of God and the human race. He also wants to show that the Spiritual Life is a partnership of love between God and us which has taken place in Christ. This union, although actually occurring in Baptism, must be perfected individually in the lives of each man and woman--growing by being drawn to what we resemble until we become the replica. This is to remove the obstacles that plague us because of Original Sin and the fall of our first parents, and our own personal sin--the obstacles that obscure and thwart this replication. This is similar to the concept Pope John Paul II developed in ""Familiaris Consortio,"" and insisted we must do, ""Become what we are""--become what we became at Baptism. Hence, the Spiritual Life is also a pursuit of the perfection of this union that completes this loving relationship between God and us. It is like Saint Paul proclaims that, ""the love of Christ urges us on"" (2 Cor 5:14, ff) to become that which he began and wants to complete.Father Boylan takes us chapter by chapter showing us the many ways in which we must seek Christ and the means by which we can attain union with him and his will (see Table of Contents using ""Look Inside""). Perhaps my favorite--the one I continually return to--because it is extremely practical is Chapter 17, ""Union with Christ through Humility.""Not only does he stress the importance of humility; he indicates its necessity. Father's methodology is extremely helpful because, instead of trying to specify what humility is, he takes the approach, which I believe is much easier to grasp, describing what humility is not, or presenting situations and circumstances where humility is lacking. And so he says that our lack of humility is the reason why we are ""so touchy, so resentful of criticism, so impatient of opposition, so insistent on getting our own way, so eager to be known, so anxious for praise, so determined on ruling our surroundings.""Humility can seem vague; hitherto, Father Boylan suggests an attitude of mind and some examples that can help us to understand the virtue better. His advice is to ask ourselves questions he proposes: Do I speak as little of my own affairs as possible? Can I mind my own business? Do I avoid curiosity? Do I want to manage other people's affairs? Can I accept correction or criticism? Do I insist on my own opinion? Can I pass over the mistakes of others? Can I hide my abilities? Can I accept blame when innocent? Can I accept being slighted, forgotten or disliked? Can I accept insults and injuries? Can I refrain from seeking special love or admiration? Can I accept my own clumsiness, mistakes or failures? Can I be gentle and kind even when provoked? Am I ambitious for showy success? And the list goes on....I think we can see: humility is not easy! There are probably very few who could not see themselves lacking under the above circumstances. These things trouble all of us. We could also ask, ""Well, if I am being shown I am lacking in humility, what then is the reason, what is it that causes me to be this way?"" Also, we can add, ""But, how can I become humble?""The answer to the first question is ""Pride."" Real humility of heart is found only where pride has been overcome. The answer to the second is, Father Boylan says, ""by the grace of God."" What's scary is that we are all called to ""conduct ourselves with humility"" and ""humble ourselves."" Just as we are called to holiness; each of us is called to humility. We cannot attain the former without the latter.Thankfully, Father Boylan gives us plenty of insight on how to proceed and to do it with humility. But make no mistake; this is a demanding and challenging book. I guess it should be. Living the gospel and choosing Christ, and following him as a disciple, is about as challenging as it gets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TJAOZFPLSU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007FHOFM#wasThisHelpful","R31TJAOZFPLSU6","A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an incredible book of Sacred Scripture. I have used it when teaching the Books of Genesis and Exodus. It is the complete TANAKH in Hebrew with their own English translation, which many times provides great insight for us Gentiles. Especially rich and helpful is the commentary which borrows from the great Rabbinic tradition and gives us Christians a look at the Jewish perspective of things. We are all familiar with the Books of the Prophets, but this intersperses passages from the Prophets, which they call the Haftorahs, into the places where the text is referring to the original Torah texts. It's like a term we use in interpreting Scripture: it is best to use Scripture to interpret Scripture. And so it does here. If you are serious about reading or studying the Jewish Scriptures, or their Bible, or as we Catholics and also the Protestants call the Old Testament, You might want to try using this.

"While most people are accustomed to speak of Mother Teresa in a glowing sense, as a very holy woman, a woman of great faith, someone of outstanding virtue, this book is a revealing look at her inner world. The Spiritual Life of Mother Teresa was not filled with the ecstasy that we hear with many other saints. No, hers was a Spiritual Life that over-abounded in desolation. The sense of God's presence in her life all but vanished for most of the time that the world knew of her as Mother Teresa. Since we are created as individuals, God does not treat us all the same. As disciples of Jesus, he knows how to treat us as individuals, meaning so as to bring about in us the most good and also to give the Father the most glory. How this works itself out in individual lives can produce remarkable differences in persons. Lest we think that some get ""off the hook"" we must remember: for all of us there lies before us the decree of Jesus who summoned the crowd with his disciples and said to them, ""Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me"" (Mk 8:34). Saint Paul declares that in become his followers, from baptism on, ""we have died"" (see Rom 6:3-8)! If this is reality, then our growth in the Spiritual Life must be such that we must become what we are. We must become dead.Archbishop Fénelon, in his book Let Go, tells us that all that really needs to die is ""the living."" In reality, we look for all sorts of solutions, which are not solutions at all. They only prolong the agony. Likewise, he says, ""You asked for a remedy, that your problems might be cured. You do not need to be cured. You need to be slain. Quit looking for a remedy and let death come. This is the only way to deal with self."" The author of the book The Cost of Discipleship expresses this well. To open it and read the Forward is enough to scare anyone. It begins, ""'WHEN CHRIST calls a man,'"" says Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ""'he bids him come and die.' There are different kinds of dying, it is true; but the essence of discipleship is contained in those words.""And so we see in the life of Mother Teresa the shadow of the Cross. Following Christ brought the gospel to life for her. As Bonhoeffer said, ""When a man really gives up trying to make something out of himself--a saint, or a converted sinner, ...a righteous or unrighteous man... when in the fullness of tasks, questions, success or ill-hap, experiences and perplexities, a man throws himself into the arms of God... then he wakes with Christ in Gethsemane. That is faith....""We see here that Mother Teresa paid the price for responding to the call of Jesus. She's happy now, though! More than we can imagine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NYWFIZNCFM6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385520379#wasThisHelpful","R2NYWFIZNCFM6E","A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On Friday, August 2, 2002 Peggy Noonan penned an article in the Wall Street Journal called ""John Paul the Great."" It began with her addressing the pope's recent trip to the Americas which had ended in Mexico with the canonization of Juan Diego, the young man who received the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe on his tilma. She also reflects back on her travelling to Rome for a business trip in June 2000 when she happened upon a private audience with John Paul II. Noonan has a great art in explaining experiences like this. This book gives her the opportunity to elaborate on what this pope has meant to her. It is especially nice that she reads the audiobook because, even though her words are expressive, her emotion carries through as she reads and we get a bigger picture of what this whole thing really meant to her.Although the book is also entitled ""John Paul the Great,"" it is not entirely about him. Yes, she speaks a great deal about him. It offers us one of the early biographical works on the Pontiff, but she also speaks about the current affairs of the Church and what is going on within it, how they relate to him, etc. She is a true journalist in this aspect of her writing. She is Reporting! It is also partly autobiographical because she takes us through her own conversion and a host of experiences that were part of that time in her life. She recounts other personal experiences and how they relate to the pope, his leadership, and the teachings of the Catholic Church towards which she was certainly moving. One of the climaxes is her description of the Pope coming to New York and Saint Patrick's Cathedral and how she kind of unexpectedly found herself with the Cathedral to witness this first-hand.It is a nice, pleasant, enjoyable read of someone who penned and then read what she penned for us. It leaves parts of her message stamped indelibly on our minds and in our imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R268M5JUAI55D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143058290#wasThisHelpful","R268M5JUAI55D8","A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my opinion, this is one of the best and most informative books I've found on the Book of Revelation. It came highly recommended by Dr. Scott Hahn in his university based course on the subject The End: The Book of Revelations. Dr. Hahn follows a lot of the historical aspects put forth in this book which interprets the timing of the writing of the Book of Revelation and the meaning of this Sacred Scripture as centered around 70AD and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. He also follows Chilton's proposal that the structure of the book is something that resembles the structure of Catholic Mass, the new worship and sacrifice that replaced the temple sacrifices, which Dr. Hahn later put to pen more concisely in his well-known The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth. David Chilton draws heavily on the rich historical sources that we have from that time, namely Josephus and other Roman figures.

"Just adding more of these to the collection! I already purchased a set of 12 of these Sassy Deco Diaper Pins. I found that these are very beautifully colored and/or decorated, much nicer in person than in the picture. These probably are also some of the strongest and most well-made pins I have owned. So, I am buying more to replace some of the cheaper ones I've picked up over the years.A few decades ago, I was living in a residence for a summer which had a housekeeper who took care of dinner, cleaning, and laundry. In explaining the rules of the residence, one of them was unlike any I have ever heard before. The housekeeper made it clear, ""I don't sort socks! If you want them sorted, pin them together with Safety (Diaper) Pins."" So, in the next few days, I bought a bunch of these at the local supermarket and did as I was told. I found that pinning them at the bottom of the heel area made them easy to fold and put away.These are sometimes hard to come by these days. Yes, I still use them! And, it's been over 25 years since I started. I never stopped pinning my socks together after I left the residence that year and assumed responsibility for doing my own wash once again. First of all, in all this time, I have never lost a sock! I might have lost a pair, but I never kept track of them that closely. I also learned something new that summer. I do not like to sort socks either! With this new knowledge, I was not going to go back to old ways. That would be quite stupid. What I thought might have been a cranky complaint, was actually a mouthful of wisdom.I still have most of the pins I bought that summer. Every now and then I restock. Occasionally, I lose a pin or the plastic breaks for some reason or another. These, however, are constructed for the safety of babies. They are stainless steel and do not rust. When they close, they lock in a way that they must be deliberately opened. They are strong and can last through several decades of weekly washings. If you do the wash for a family, you can assign different colors (like these fancy ones) or one color like Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin or use Cloth Diaper Assorted Color Safety Pins to each person so that you never have to figure out who belongs to which socks (another trick of the housekeeper).

"Pope John Paul II taught us that the parish is not principally a structure, a territory, or a building, but rather, ""The family of God, a fellowship afire with a unifying spirit,"" ""a familial and welcoming home,"" the ""community of the faithful."" (Christifideles, 26, pg. 63). Many others and much more has been said on the subject. However, Pope Francis has taken things to a whole new level for most people. He says, ""This is the mission of the Church: the Church heals, it cures. Sometimes, I speak of the Church as if it were a field hospital. It's true: there are many, many wounded! So many people need their wounds healed! This is the mission of the Church: to heal the wounds of the heart, to open doors, to free people, to say that God is good, God forgives all, God is the Father, God is affectionate, God always waits for us."" He says also that we must take part in this. We must also build the structures or organization to do this work. As experience has shown over two millennia, and with any apostolic work, most of the groundwork must be in the Spiritual Life. If the Church is a ""Field Hospital"" and we are going to work in it, we need the training that will support us in this work. It was kind of prophetic that Father Heilman named this a ""Field Manual"" for Special Forces Training. As one other reviewer notes, the author does not reinvent the practices of the Spiritual Life, but rather draws on the tradition of the Church. Just a look at the table of contents will show you that. Very much like The Spiritual Combat, called the ""favorite book"" by Saint Francis de Sales, this is preparation that requires readiness, weapons training, and practices that must be learned and must become second nature. He had to learn it. Sometimes we do not know where to begin the work of the Church, or how to begin. You can find this described as things like ""inertia"" and ""beginning"" and ""momentum"" in an easy but good read like A Travel Guide to Life: Transforming Yourself from Head to Soul. You won't be disappointed. Anyway you look at it, the ""Field Hospital"" requires that you go back to the wisdom of others like Saint Francis de Sales, Saint Ignatius, and Saint Vincent de Paul, and others as Father Heilman does here. This is nothing new. For 400 years, the Church has been eager to promote things like the Discernment of Spirits, penned in The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius, pg. 313, ff., or the application of which can be found in The Discernment of Spirits: An Ignatian Guide for Everyday Living). The concept of Father Heilman is surprisingly right on target. If you have read The Soul of The Apostolate, you know that much ink is devoted to speaking about ""shock troops."" Yes, Dom Chautard claims, ""Next to the official clergy, have risen, beginnings of Christianity, companies of volunteers, shock-troops, whose continued and abundant growth will always be one of the clearest signs of the vitality of the Church (pg 6)."" He explains that Pope Pius X judged the effectiveness of his priests by their ability to develop and use these ""shock troops"" (see pp.165-172 for an in-depth look at this). As important as this sounds, Chautard stressed that priority always must be given to the Interior Life over the Active Life. So, this is solid stuff. There is a convergence of many great ideas from many great people and of holiness, which is the Church! Join in with Father Heilman. Join with him and the other great teachers of the Church. This is a good place to start and to prepare to become part of the History of the Church and one of its Saints!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C4DIX8WPAT2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615649920#wasThisHelpful","R2C4DIX8WPAT2J","A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is another variation of the one I heard first, One Day (New Album Version). It has an extra lead-in before getting to the main song. This was very popular on a weekend youth retreat whose theme was ""I Am Here for a Reason"" - words mentioned early on in the song.

"If you like to drink soda, and the sugar is too much for you or you must stay away from it, or those artificial sweetener chemicals you no longer want to put in your body, this may be right for you. Although it lacks some of the sweetness that we're used to enjoying, it is still flavorful and very refreshing. It does not take much to get used to it. The Stevia is a natural sweetener coming from a leaf. I began using this by purchasing Zevia All Natural Soda, Rainbow Pack, 12 Ounce (Pack of 24). There are 12 different flavors. You get two of each. This lets the household sample everything until everyone's favorites are determined. Then you can buy different flavors by the case. The Black Cherry is my favorite.

"These are great boxes! Don't just buy these randomly. Make them work for you and others! When planning your move, make a determination how much heavy stuff and how much other stuff you will be packing or shipping. Then, buy boxes by size, accordingly. For example, for books or anything of similar weight, you do not want to use anything bigger than a small box. You will be surprised at how many books one of these can hold. I've done this a number of times. I just finished a shipment. My experience has shown that a full small box of hardcover books averages about 40 pounds. You do not want to go more than that. You also want to be able to stack them in the same size boxes. Whereas, for pillows, comforters, and other bedding, you can probably use the large boxes without any serious weight problems. The fit is one thing. The weight is another. Someone has to carry these! You will be thanked and appreciated for taking this into consideration.

"I was sure I wrote a review on this, but recently I found I didn't. I bought and read it four years ago and have been talking about it ever sense. Three years before that, I went through a period where I read The Total Money Makeover: A Proven Plan for Financial Fitness, The Dream Manager (Audio CD), a bunch of Patrick Lencioni's works beginning with The Three Big Questions for a Frantic Family (Audio), then The Five Temptations of a CEO (Audio CD), ""The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,"" The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive, and there were others about General Patton: General Patton's Principles for Life and Leadership, and Alan Axelrod's ""Patton on Leadership"" to name a few. During this whole time I kept hearing about this book, ""First, Break All The Rules."" It came highly recommended, but I did not even like the title. That's not how I think! Finally, I gave in and found this to be a groundbreaking and life-changing book on management and leadership. It first of all introduced me to Marcus Buckingham, who introduced me to his ideas and the results of 25 years of research by the Gallup Organization with great managers and their organizations. This was groundbreaking! I began to understand: to make things work effectively, you can't go by the ""rules"" as we have been led to believe. Secondly, following the trail of Buckingham, he then led me to Now, Discover Your Strengths, then to taking the Clifton Strengthsfinder Test, a code for which came with the book, then StrengthsFinder 2.0, then finally Living Your Strengths, or the Catholic Edition Living Your Strengths: Discover Your God-given Talents And Inspire Your Community.Life has been different.

"This is a great and unique kind of honey to use in this day of over-processed foods. I have been using it for about a decade. I have always bought their Honey Gardens Raw Orange Blossom Honey. I saw this kind recently and thought I would try it. To tell you the truth, I can't tell the difference between this and that. Maybe it's the way I use it! If you go to the Honey Gardens website and look under ""Honey Education"" you will get an insight to all of this. One of the things you will read is: ""Apitherapy honey has never been heated or filtered, and thus it retains the beneficial traces of pollen, propolis, and beeswax, which the flowers and bees have provided. These contain healthful minerals, vitamins, enzymes, amino acids, and carbohydrates. "" They also have a comment that ""Scientists at Cornell University, Geneva, New York report 'Honey has been used as a topical and gastrointestinal remedy for thousands of years, and has recently gained recognition from the medical field.

" 3:07 Mins The Self Balancing Scooter Two 6.5"" Wheel Self Balance Electric Board Drifting Personal Transporter Mini Unicycle with Led Light was sent to me (free of charge or at a discounted cost) so that I could provide an honest and an unbiased review.This is some really impressive engineering.It works perfectly.It's incredible fun.It takes patience and practice to be able to enjoy it to it's fullest.I have been cursed with being clumsy my entire life. I do good to walk and chew gum, simultaneously.I AM the proverbial ""Bull in a China Shop"".So, when I was asked to review this dandy device, I was just a bit apprehensive, but I have too much ""kid"" in me to turn it down.After I charged it for about 90 or so minutes, I loaded it up and headed to my buddies shop.He has a really large, flat parking lot and is almost ideal for a beginner. We tried it in his shop for a few minutes, before we ventured outside.The first time I stepped on it, I was more than apprehensive, not scared, just very aware of my lack of equilibrium and good sense.However, we only live one time!I was able to ride, and balance on it at a very slow pace with zero problems.It will take practice to master, that much is for certain.In all my days, I never thought I would meet another person more clumsy than myself. My buddy, Jesse is. He is duck footed and has a low center of gravity. He was just not able to get a balance on it while in the shop, he looked like a windmill and the scooter was only teetering back and forth just a teenincy bit. His wife and I almost busted our guts laughing at him.So, we ventured outside to see how well I could do on the asphalt. I did about as I had done inside and took it a little further. I was gaining momentum, when I hit a very small crevice and it tipped me. I landed on my right side.Jesse decided to give it another try and he did a bit better than when we were indoors, but still needs some practice.I went to my wife's school and decided to take it for a little spin on the campus side walks.JUST my luck, I hit another small crevice and it tipped me again and I suspect I may have broke my left wrist with that fall.This is a very well made and fun device.My ONLY complaint is that I would like to have seen some rubber bumpers on it, because when it spills the rider, it CAN and sometimes WILL whirl away and get scuffed and scratched.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FFTOP7P8KR5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156KAS1Y#wasThisHelpful","R3FFTOP7P8KR5E","A2D4OMRVB52M1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4OMRVB52M1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The VonHaus 24 x Nitrile Garden Gloves for extra Safety and Protection while Gardening, Working and Laboring (12 x Pairs - White & Grey - Size Medium) were sent to me (free of charge or at a discounted price) so that I could provide an honest and an unbiased review.I was changing an 18650 battery in a flashlight, and while I was twisting the head off, I heard a sound that I most certainly NOT should have. It was a sound of pressure being released. I immediately stopped and fetched a pair of these to finish slowly removing that head.It appears that one of the LED bulbs had leaked (if possible) or ruptured and leaked some kind of foul smelling liquid inside the housing of the light. With my gloved hands, I tilted the body of the light and let the batteries fall out and they were both covered in this liquid, (which makes me cringe when I think of what it would have done to bare skin) in to my palm.Not a single drop of the nasty stuff touched my skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3777LAL7K5Z9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTDQR0K#wasThisHelpful","R3777LAL7K5Z9H","A2D4OMRVB52M1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4OMRVB52M1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Which allows me (the Owner) to choose those final settings as I want to, not what a merchant chooses.A few of the other devices I have gotten for review, the merchant had setup and used some activators on the device, which bypasses the Windows licensing. (In other words, they had installed bootleg copies of Windows).After I set my privacy options and finished the initial settings, it loaded the desktop and I went to see if it Windows was activated. It was not.I connected it to my wireless network, and about 30 or so seconds later, I checked it again and it was indeed activated.The display is fantastic, and the IPS panel is sharp, clear and crisp.The speaker is not impressive, however since it has both Bluetooth and an audio out jack, that is easily fixed with an external speaker.More details and then some in the video.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P3W2QDIXTADQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176UTBEC#wasThisHelpful","R2P3W2QDIXTADQ","A2D4OMRVB52M1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4OMRVB52M1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for the 64GB model.It is currently upgrading to Windows 10. Aside from being a slow process, all is going well so far.I found something very odd when I was looking at the drive via Windows Drive Manager. It shows 14 RAW partitions in varying increments of 32 and 64 MB.I have no idea why the OEM would do such a thing.Through some good old fashioned googling, I discovered there is a BIOS update, however I do not know if it is the same version that is currently on the device, since there was no ""read me"" in the file I downloaded. The OEM has no support links on their site. I have also discovered that some units have heat issues which can cause the touch screen to artifact. I have not seen my unit do this yet and it has been on for the biggest part of 5 hours.The OS switch program is buggy. It works, but not exactly like it should, in Windows anyway.It comes as a simple and small executable that is on the Windows desktop and is baked in to the Android KitKat install.In Kitkat, it works great. It is accessed via the pull down settings on the upper right corner.It comes with a 1 year Office 365 subscription.There was no bloat or junk installed on either OS.The touch screen performs well and does exactly as it should. When loading Windows, some of the time it will not set itself to landscape and I have to give it a knock with the hammer...err I mean pick it up and tilt it.Windows 8.1 ran smooth and was exactly what I expected.Connecting an external monitor via HDMI works fine and perfectly in Windows, under Android it is not a pretty sight.The display lags and does not scale correctly under Android.When I powered it on the first time, I truly expected some kind of boot options so that I could select what OS I wanted it to load. It did not do that, it booted to Windows.The option to choose what OS to boot to only shows itself some of the time.These are my findings, thus far of about 5 hours of tinkering.Windows looks and runs like Windows and Android looks like Android and does not run as well as I would have expected.Windows 10 installed and is working exactly as it should and as I had hoped.All drivers installed and Windows 10 is activated.Video added on 8-7.I have discovered that the OS switch DOES work fine and I was wrong in what I said on the video.The return arrow on the screen is ""Enter"" and after getting the circle around the OS you want to boot in to, pushing the return is what does the magic.I got Android rooted on it, using Kingo Root, it works fine rooted and everything is working as it should.I did discover that plugging an HDMI cable in to it, put it back in landscape mode.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DOH9IXOUHN9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DL5XRK#wasThisHelpful","R2DOH9IXOUHN9K","A2D4OMRVB52M1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4OMRVB52M1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Some times it works well and other times, not.I would rather not waste the time with trying it with a mobile device, because the browser UI works and works quickly, every time, provided the hardware is working as it should.Fortunately, the website for Vstarcam has the software for download and it has a search tool, which enables setting it up via a browser UI.Once I logged in to the browser UI, it was as easy as can be to set it to my network and allow it to reboot.The clarity is good, as it is 720p.I plan on mounting on one corner of my home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RYMIPBAJCQWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W17W32S#wasThisHelpful","R1RYMIPBAJCQWS","A2D4OMRVB52M1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4OMRVB52M1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have 7 IP cameras on my network, all set to wireless.Getting the 824 set as an access point was easy as can be, as soon as I remembered how!The IP cameras I have are from different OEMs such as Edimax, HooToo and Wanscam.I set one of the wireless channels as a dedicated camera, so that only the cameras use it. The 824 has enabled me to get better coverage from the outdoor cameras that are further away from the 828.The only issues I encountered were that the 824 was NOT happy when I logged in from Internet Explorer 11. It did not want to accept the password.Logging in from Waterfox solved it and all is good.I would like to see more options in the UI for details on connected devices.I also need to mention that TrendNET support is exemplary. I had a couple of questions and they were polite, professional and prompt with replies.It's a shame that more manufacturers do not have the same practices, I have waited for as long as 4 weeks for a reply from some folks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9DVNTVPGIK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016YJRO7C#wasThisHelpful","RI9DVNTVPGIK1","A2D4OMRVB52M1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4OMRVB52M1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:07 Mins The Self Balancing Scooter Two 6.5"" Wheel Self Balance Electric Board Drifting Personal Transporter Mini Unicycle with Led Light was sent to me (free of charge or at a discounted cost) so that I could provide an honest and an unbiased review.This is some really impressive engineering.It works perfectly.It's incredible fun.It takes patience and practice to be able to enjoy it to it's fullest.I have been cursed with being clumsy my entire life. I do good to walk and chew gum, simultaneously.I AM the proverbial ""Bull in a China Shop"".So, when I was asked to review this dandy device, I was just a bit apprehensive, but I have too much ""kid"" in me to turn it down.After I charged it for about 90 or so minutes, I loaded it up and headed to my buddies shop.He has a really large, flat parking lot and is almost ideal for a beginner. We tried it in his shop for a few minutes, before we ventured outside.The first time I stepped on it, I was more than apprehensive, not scared, just very aware of my lack of equilibrium and good sense.However, we only live one time!I was able to ride, and balance on it at a very slow pace with zero problems.It will take practice to master, that much is for certain.In all my days, I never thought I would meet another person more clumsy than myself. My buddy, Jesse is. He is duck footed and has a low center of gravity. He was just not able to get a balance on it while in the shop, he looked like a windmill and the scooter was only teetering back and forth just a teenincy bit. His wife and I almost busted our guts laughing at him.So, we ventured outside to see how well I could do on the asphalt. I did about as I had done inside and took it a little further. I was gaining momentum, when I hit a very small crevice and it tipped me. I landed on my right side.Jesse decided to give it another try and he did a bit better than when we were indoors, but still needs some practice.I went to my wife's school and decided to take it for a little spin on the campus side walks.JUST my luck, I hit another small crevice and it tipped me again and I suspect I may have broke my left wrist with that fall.This is a very well made and fun device.My ONLY complaint is that I would like to have seen some rubber bumpers on it, because when it spills the rider, it CAN and sometimes WILL whirl away and get scuffed and scratched.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0FNBEDPCTQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147FLBM4#wasThisHelpful","RL0FNBEDPCTQ8","A2D4OMRVB52M1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4OMRVB52M1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Midnight Sun is the second book in Jo Nesbo's Blood on Snow series.What ties these two together is The Fisherman, crime kingpin of Oslo. Jon worked for The Fisherman selling drugs and other 'special' jobs as needed. Except Jon couldn't do it - he couldn't kill. So now he's run to a remote village at the top of Norway where the sun never sets. And he took along drugs and money that weren't his to take - and The Fisherman wants it back....A local woman, Lea, and her son Knut, give Jon shelter in an old hunting cabin. But after a few days of the sun never setting, the flat unending landscape and being alone in the small cabin, he craves people - and alcohol. So he heads to the village....Nesbo's description of the village and the landscape creates an sense of otherworldly isolation that mirrors what Jon is feeling. The eclectic residents and their behavior keeps both Jon and the reader wondering what could happen next.Even though Jon, aka Ulf, is a 'bad' guy, he's a bad guy with a good streak and a conscience. The reader can't help but hope that he escapes those after him and that maybe, just maybe, he's got another shot at a good life. Sami culture and the Laestadian religion are woven into the story - redemption is a major theme and plays a part in more than one character's life.I love the noir, staccato pace of Nesbo's writing - think of a Tarantino movie put to print. For me, another great read from Nesbo.(I have no idea if Nesbo will ever resurrect Harry Hole - but I do miss him.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XAR2V82B69O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012089LOK#wasThisHelpful","R2XAR2V82B69O5","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 Have you started your holiday reading yet? No? Well, here's one to add to your list - The Further Adventures of Ebenezer Scrooge by Charlie Lovett. (And I have a copy to giveaway as well as a bonus book!)You read that right - further adventures. Lovett imagines what might have occurred after Scrooge was visited by the three ghosts and changed his outlook on Christmas - and life - in Charles Dickens' book A Christmas Carol.Well, Scrooge is celebrating year round - wishing everyone he meets a Merry Christmas each day of the year. But those who benefitted from Scrooge's change of heart twenty years ago have also lost their way. Partner Bob Cratchit is a workaholic, nephew Freddie ignores the plight of those around him and Scrooge's creditors can't see the human side of his largess, only the debts. So one summer's day, Scrooge calls upon the ghosts to help them as they did him so many years ago.Lovett writes in the style of Dickens (sometimes employing phrasing and referencing Dickens' other works) to recreate the tenor, tone and message of A Christmas Carol.The Further Adventures of Ebenezer Scrooge is a lovely reminder that ""...scores and hundreds understood the ways of wealth and money and even of philanthropy, but their hearts lacked the true wealth of love, of family, of Christmas joy, which, he now saw, might have been theirs all the year round.""The Further Adventures of Ebenezer Scrooge is a quick little one night read.  Guaranteed to put you in the holiday spirit - hopefully year round!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4JY7WCOMKIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525429107#wasThisHelpful","RR4JY7WCOMKIE","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Catherine McKenzie from her first book. She's just released her fifth novel - Smoke. Each of the previous four books have been completely different reads - I never know what to expect when I start one of her books. But what I do know is that I'm going to enjoy it.Elizabeth fought wildfires as a profession for over ten years, travelling to where she was needed. Its taken a toll on her personal life though. So, now she stays put, living with her husband in a quiet mountain town in the Rockies. Instead, she works as an investigator for the town's attorney. But when an out of control fire threatens the entire town, her skills as an arson investigator are called into play again.Elizabeth's ex-friend Mindy is also worried about the fire. She knows something is 'off' with her teenage son - and has been for quite a while. And whether or not she wants to admit it, she wonders if he might have had something to do with starting the fire.Smoke is told in alternating chapters from both women. I really enjoy dual narrative novels - a second look at a same event and/or two stories that will intersect farther down the road as more is revealed.Although the fire is the stage for the novel, there's much more to Smoke. The personal lives of Elizabeth and Mindy are explored - motherhood, friendship, love, marriage and secrets. While Elizabeth is the 'lead' character, I found myself more drawn to Mindy. I didn't like Elizabeth's secret keeping from her husband - and her justification for those choices. Mindy has made some questionable choices as well, but I was more inclined to forgive her. Her 'redemption', if you will, appealed to me more. McKenzie does a great job of creating a 'mean girls' group that Mindy hangs out with. (But I do want to know what happened to the siphoned library money?) The petulant and aggressive teens are also well drawn.The mystery of who started the fire runs through the entire book of course. I did have the 'whodunit' sussed out before the end, but quite enjoyed the journey to the final reveal. The fire, the methods used to fight it and the mindset of a firefighter were well researched and believable.I'm always intrigued by cover choices and titles. I'm not overwhelmed with this cover, but the title made me think of the old adage - ""Where there's smoke, there's fire."" And its applicable in so many ways to much of the plot line and many of the characters in Smoke.Smoke is another engaging, easy read from McKenzie. Those who enjoy contemporary women's fiction with a touch of mystery will enjoy Smoke.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G1IOIS0OQM3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503945650#wasThisHelpful","R1G1IOIS0OQM3N","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 I'm not sure why, but there's a plethora of 'dying teen' movies being made. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is recently released from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. It's based on the novel of the same name by Jesse Andrews.Greg Gaines has worked hard at blending in, going unnoticed and being on good terms with all the different groups at his high school. Oh, and he makes quirky little films with his 'co-worker' Earl. He's coasting along just fine. Until his mother insists he spend time with Rachel who is battling cancer. They really don't know each other very well....but things change as he and Rachel become unlikely friends. Greg is forced to confront the truths that Rachel lays out - about both herself and him.Great casting! Thomas Mann is wonderful as Greg - his glib banter and self-deprecating manner hide his lack of confidence. The connection between him and Rachel (Olivia Cooke) is absolutely believable. Cooke masterfully underplays her role - any louder or affected would not have worked. I must admit that Earl (newcomer R.J. Cyler) kinda stole the show for me. Again the relationship between Earl and Greg really works. Molly Shannon as Rachel's mom brought me some Saturday Night Live flashback moments. Jon Bernthal plays teacher Mr. McCarthy. Although his appearance is quite different, I still had a hard time not associating him with his Walking Dead role.Now you might think that the plot would veer off into doomed dying girl teen romance territory. And I thought it was going to as well. Not so. Instead, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl explores friendships on many levels, coming of age, loss, love and more. Humorous, sad, quirky. An indie kind of take on what seems to be a newly recurring style of 'teen' film.Cinematically, I found some of the long lens and fish eye shots took away from the movie for me. I started focusing on whether or not that staircase could truly be that steep instead of the dialogue happening. But, movies play a large role in Greg's life and the film, so I can understand why director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon would add some artistic touches. (Now this is just me, but I really didn't enjoy Greg's movies - and while Greg's final film has it's moments, I wasn't blown away)All in all, I enjoyed Me and Earl and the Dying Girl - winner of the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E6I5TXYXWK3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014662FQ0#wasThisHelpful","R2E6I5TXYXWK3G","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 I started with the first book (Postmortem) in Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series way back in 1990 when forensic mysteries were becoming popular. Her latest release, Depraved Heart, is the 23rd entry in this series.Now, I must admit, I just haven't enjoyed the last few books - they seemed mired in extraneous detail and became repetitive. But I was willing to give this latest a go. And up front, I want to say, I did enjoy Depraved Heart.Scarpetta and Marino are at the scene of what appears to be the accidental death of a wealthy young woman when a video link appears and starts playing on Kay's phone. Although her policy is to never interrupt a scene investigation with personal calls, she is powerless to stop watching. The video is a twenty year old video of her niece Lucy - and her then lover Carrie Grethem. Grethem was thought to be dead, but surfaced in the last book and attempted to kill Kay. It looks like she's back and still determined to wreak havoc with Kay and her family.""The FBI placed the niece I raised like a daughter into a psychopathic monster's care, and that decision changed the course of our lives. It has changed absolutely everything.""Depraved Heart picks up two months after the abrupt ending of the last book, Flesh and Blood. Readers who have kept up with the Scarpetta books will have a better understanding of this perpetrator and plotting.One key element of Depraved Heart is the concept of 'data fiction'. ""It's what can happen if we're so reliant on technology that we become completely dependent on things we can't see. Therefore we can no longer judge for ourselves what's true, what's false, what's accurate, what isn't. In other words if reality is defined by software that does all the work for us, then what if this software lies? What if everything we believe isn't true but is a facade, a mirage?"" I was fascinated - and somewhat disturbed - with this notion. (I thought of how much time I spend online...) Are the videos (yes there's more than one) true? Or false? Is Benton lying to her? Who and what can she believe and trust? The reader sees the entire book unfold through Scarpetta's eyes and thoughts.Marino is a perennial favourite of mine and this time Scarpetta seems to be a little kinder towards him. For the life of me, I have no idea why she stays with Benton. Lucy just annoys me, but I think there's more of a forthcoming story with her new partner Janet.The book takes place during a twenty four hour period. The book moves along quickly as Kay and Marino attempt to deal with both their latest case - and the apparent danger to Lucy.  The tension is palpable as everyone's actions and motives are called into question. I was easily caught up in the story and possibilities. Cornwell does weave an intricate plot, one I appreciated. (But one glaring omission by investigators, that is mentioned and is part of the final whodunit, will be caught by sharp eyed readers.)The title? ""Legal definition of Depraved Heart - 'Void of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.' Mayes V. People, Illinois Supreme Court. 1883.""The ending leaves the door open for a continued story in this vein. Although I quite enjoyed this latest entry more than the last few, a wee bit of me thinks it's time to end this ongoing storyline and give readers a fresh mystery and investigation next time 'round.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R81SRD6LKZ6O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006232540X#wasThisHelpful","R81SRD6LKZ6O4","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Poles Apart is the fifth novel from best-selling and award winning author Terry Fallis.Blogs are de rigueur reading nowadays. I must admit I read and follow many, many blogs on widely varying topics. (And thank you you're reading this one!) Some bloggers share personal details, but others choose to remain anonymous. Such is the case with the blog that is at the center of the plot in Poles Apart.Eve of Equality is a new feminist blog that becomes an overnight success when it posts a story on the owner of a chain of 'high-end' strip clubs that are opening up across the country. Why would the author not acknowledge their success? Television shows, radio hosts, newspaper articles and even a book deal await this feminist movement advocate! Well, the author happens to be a man named Everett Kane, who truly is an ardent feminist. But who will take a man's writing on feminism seriously?As Everett attempts to keep his identity private, there are others just as determined to find out who he is. Everett's location choice for his new apartment is a great comedic plot device. It also brings in a great cast of supporting players and a romantic possiblity. Everett is in Florida to help his father recover from a stroke. Dad is a unique personality with some good lines, as is the recuperating feminist pioneer also in residence at the home.The dialogue is great fun, witty and smart and the characters are all a little left of centre -  you can't help but mentally cheer for them. The plotting is somewhat telegraphed but is great fun. But mixed within this comic tale are many grains of truth. Everett's blog posts, musings and beliefs can all be read and taken quite seriously as they contain many valid points.Poles Apart is another witty, charming read from Terry Fallis, again underscoring whey he has earned the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour more than once. Although No Relation remains my favourite Fallis book, I quite enjoyed Poles Apart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BN7B92NU7CA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEFDACI#wasThisHelpful","R20BN7B92NU7CA","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Improbability of Love is Hannah Rothschild's debut novel. And what a debut it is!The Improbability of Love is actually a painting - although the title can be applied to many of the relation. Annie's fourteen year relationship has ended, she is a talented chef, but works for two sketchy art dealers, her mother is a life long alcoholic and her attempts to find friends - and love - have fallen flat. When she comes upon a dusty little painting in a junk shop, she just likes the way it looks. She has no idea that it's a lost masterpiece. But others who spy her with it are aware.....the cast of art collectors, art dealers and art thieves is large and eclectic.Rothschild has a keen eye and wit, skewering the art world with tongue firmly in cheek.  I suspect insider knowledge has much to do with this - Rothschild is Chair of the Trustees of the National Gallery - UK.Her character are all richly drawn and fleshed out. The art aficionados were by turns evil, funny and desperate. (Some readers may find this cast too large) It's impossible not to fall in love with Annie and hope that she does indeed find happiness and love again.  But the character I enjoyed the most came out of left field - the painting itself has a sardonic voice - and memories. Through those recollections we learn the provenance of the picture and the details of the man who painted it.Annie is a talented chef, using food as her empty canvas. Rothschild's description of Annie's meals and their inspiration mirror her evocative descriptions of the paintings and art history used throughout the book. Both were equally fascinating for me.Clever, very clever, is the first description that springs to mind in describing this book. Those looking for a literary art novel with a distinctly satiric tone mixed with history, romance, dodgy dealings and more, will enjoy The Improbability of Love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392I0DYQM9XB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408862441#wasThisHelpful","R392I0DYQM9XB7","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can find me glued to the television during national and world sports coverage - especially the Olympics. I remember watching Clara Hughes race over many Olympics - she is a six time Olympian with six medals to her credit - in two sports - speed skating and cycling. She has numerous other accolades and victories.But what you don't see on television is what's going on behind the scenes, what it takes for an athlete to rise to this level, the obstacles they've met, the obstacles overcome and who they are besides being a public figure and athlete.Clara Hughes' newly released memoir, Open Heart, Open Mind, lays all of that bare. Hughes' father was a verbally abusive alcoholic, Clara drank, did drugs and skipped school. When she did start to channel her energy into competitive sport she landed with a coach who was results driven, caring little about her mental health. Hughes has suffered from depression for most of her life. In 2010, she put her own struggles in the public eye when she became the national spokesperson for the Bell Let's Talk mental health initiative - ""A wide-reaching, multi-year program designed to break the silence around mental illness and support mental health all across Canada.""I am always appreciative of reading someone's memoir - the bravery in sharing your life with the public. Hughes shares both professional and personal. I was fascinated by the behind the scenes look at a professional athlete's training and performance. Clara's athletic accomplishments are extraordinary. But it is her personal triumphs that are outstanding. Hughes has taken that same energy and drive that she used in sports, applied it to her mental well being and advocating for others through numerous projects, such as Right to Play.The title? Hughes participated in a Squamish First Nations brushing-off ceremony in 2010........""Another elder addressed each of us in turn, opening our hearts to the energy of the flame and brushing away negativity. He told us, I cannot heal you of your pain. Only you can heal yourself with your open heart and your open mind.""Wise words. Great read.

Warm, wonderful, friendly, quirky characters inhabit the village of Tindledale and Sybs is immediately welcomed. When she discovers a wool shop, she knows she's found a kindred spirit in Hettie, the aged owner. But Hettie's nephew is determined to put her in a home and take over her property. Oh, and did I mention the handsome (single) village doctor?Sybil is a character the reader is immediately drawn to - she's someone you'd love to have as a friend. The reader can't help but cheer her on as she starts to reclaim her life and move forward. There's a lovely sense of community as the residents work together to save Hettie's store. Romance of course figures into the plot - with the requisite missteps, mistakes and miscommunication. Good and bad (that nasty nephew) battle and there are many poignant moments with Hettie as her past is explored and revealed.Me? I'd love to be part of the knit and natter group.

Make yourself a warm cup of tea - or better yet a cup of cocoa - and settle in for a perfect, heartwarming Christmas read.

Gabriella is a crime reporter in San Francisco and her partner Sean Donovan is a police detective.The past plays a large part in Blessed Are Those Who Mourn. Belcamino provides enough back story that this first time reader didn't feel at a loss at all.Someone is murdering women - and leaving taunting clues - bible verses - that mirror those left decades ago when Ella's sister was taken. And then the unthinkable - Ella and Sean's daughter Grace is snatched. And nothing will stop Gabriella from getting her back......Blessed Are Those Who Mourn is an emotional, desperate, fast paced, action filled race to the final pages.Blessed Are Those Who Mourn is written in first person from Gabriella's view. It is her thoughts, her actions and her feelings that drive the book. Family, love and loyalty play a large part. Gabriella is a member of close knit Italian famiglia. Those relationships are explored and filled out, again providing fodder for other stories in the future. Religion and bit of mysticism also factor into Ella's life.The 'bad guy', although despicable, never really jumped off the page for me. I thought his reasons for his action a bit far-fetched. But then again, who am I to say what crazy does?Belcamino has written what she knows - she herself was a police reporter, comes from an Italian family and worked in the Bay Area setting she has chosen for her book. Her first  Macavity and Anthony Award-nominated book - Blessed Are the Dead - was inspired by her dealings with a serial killer during her life as a Bay Area crime reporter. Fans of Tami Hoag and Iris Johansen would enjoy this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLCZJBUE4OOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG1ELNW#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLCZJBUE4OOR","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Alice Goffman undertook a massive project for her academic dissertation in sociology - an ethnographic study documenting the lives of a group of people living in a predominately black, crime ridden neighborhood in Philadelphia. She ended up doing more than documenting - she lived in and around the 'hood for six years, becoming roommates with two of the young men who figure prominently in her book.Goffman ends up being accepted as part of the scenery in the pseudonymous 6th Street, welcomed by a group of young men and their families to document their lives. And those lives are full of trouble - crime, drugs, poverty, arrests, warrants and any other number of hardships. Goffman immerses herself in part their lives, crossing the impartial observer line in many cases to become a participant.Her statistics regarding young, poor black men are frightening. This book does serve to underscore what we see almost every day on news feeds. We also get to know the friends and families of this core group. Goffman does also make connections with people in the neigbourhood who are 'clean' and trying to make a good life without the crime, guns etc. These subjects are just as interesting, but receive less focus.I did find that some stories were repeated in more than one chapter - Goffman seems to be using certain compelling incidents to illustrate numerous points she wants to highlight. I found the appendix of  her own journey to and through the book quite fascinating.On the Run is an accounting from one side of the street. There are some questions as to the veracity of some of the anecdotes and interactions that Goffman describes. Some of her own motives, behaviors and recollections have been called into question. Despite that, On the Run does provide much food for thought - and discussion.Robin Miles was the narrator. She has a voice that is easy to listen to, clear and well modulated She is able to emphasize and empathize with a change in tenor and tone. She's also able to provide suitable voices when one of the subjects of the book is 'speaking'. I thought she interpreted the book well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QWU0FXZQZR5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MNOFXW#wasThisHelpful","R2QWU0FXZQZR5G","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'ve been eagerly awaiting the release of Linwood Barclay's new book - Broken Promise. I didn't read any synopses  - I knew I would love it, (as I have all his other books) and wanted to be completely surprised.Well, wasn't I surprised to find many characters I already knew and enjoyed living in the pages of this new book....Newspaper reporter David Harwood (Never Look Away) moves back to his hometown to provide a better life for his young son. But he loses his job shortly after returning and is forced to move back in with his parents. He's on an errand for his mom when he stops in at his cousin Marla's house and discovers her with a baby that 'an angel dropped off.' Marla's baby died at birth - so whose baby is this?Promise Falls Detective Barry Duckworth (a favourite character of mine who was in Too Close to Home, Never Look Away and Trust Your Eyes) has his hands full. In addition to the baby case, someone has ritualistically slaughtered and displayed 23 squirrels, a ride at the defunct amusement park in town is up and running - with mannequins in seat 23, and a rapist is on the prowl at the local college.Uh huh, lots going on.....I wondered how is Barclay going to tie all of this together?I find Barclay's storytelling so engaging. We are introduced to many of the residents of Promise Falls. Backgrounds and personal storylines are detailed - some more than others. The reader is never sure who is going to play a part - and how large and in what capacity. I loved the detail and the ensemble cast - it somewhat reminded me of Stephen King's narrative style. (King calls Barclay ""A suspense master."")But are these the only crimes in Broken Promise? Or just the only ones we know about? There's lots of hinting at events in the past that may paint a larger picture - snippets and tendrils tease the reader. Clues to many of the current crimes are quietly inserted at the end of some chapters, slowly building the answers to whodunit. I did figure out one of the crimes before the end, but I was happy to discover that I was not completely right. And that there's more to the story of Promise Falls.Now, I've read that a few readers feel cheated at the ending as not every loose end was tied up. This reader? I loved it - especially now that I know there will be two more novels in the 'Promise' series! The next book, Far From True, is due out in March 2016.  A must read for me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6IOYG8F2THR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451472675#wasThisHelpful","RY6IOYG8F2THR","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a tablet, but I find typing on it difficult, as I usually end up one finger pecking. I was interested in a portable keyboard - one large enough that I wouldn't be hunting and pecking.

"I have a tablet, but I find typing on it difficult, as I usually end up one finger pecking. Takes longer and annoys me. So I was looking for a keyboard that I could use with my tablet. And specifically one that was portable - to be able to comfortably keep up with my blogging at work, on planes and while staying at someone else's home. Pretty much anywhere I am.This keyboard was the perfect solution. It's tiny, but has a full QWERTY keyboard. It's small, but big enough that I'm not hunting and pecking to type. But the best part of all? It folds up! The two ends fold back on the center piece making it completely portable. It's small enough to slip into my purse. (3.5"" x 5.5"") and incredibly light. The hinging mechanism is actually a slider - it works easily and seems sturdy enough to stand up to repeated opening and closing. The exterior case is an aluminum alloy - also sturdy - and attractive.Bluetooth is used to connect this wireless keyboard to your chosen device. I found the enclosed instructions clear and easy to follow. (and also discovered that the operating distance is 10 meters! I tried it out and yep, it is!)

"Oh, I'm telling you right up front that Crooked Heart by Lissa Evans is going to be one of my top reads for 2015!It's the height of WWII and England is on high alert. Ten year old orphan Neil Bostock is evacuated from London. He lands with Vee - a small time con artist with a good heart, but not great luck. Neil is educated, precocious and misses his suffragette Godmother Mattie terribly. Neil and Vee seem like an unlikely pairing. But 'war makes strange bedfellows.' And they might just have what the other needs.....Evans has created such tangible characters in Vee and Noel. My opinion of Vee changed as the book progressed - from dismissing her as a hustler, to getting to know her, to empathizing with her losses, and finally to cheering her on, hoping against hope that the ending I want would materialize. We get to know Noel slowly as he assesses his current situation and adapts as need be. I was immediately taken by him. Other supporting characters are just as interesting - I especially enjoyed the myriad letters that Vee's mute mother pens. Mattie makes only a brief appearance, but her presence is large in Noel's life and memories and we come to love her as much as he does. The wartime setting is also a character in Crooked Heart. The rationing, the attitudes, the bombings and more all shape, direct and change the course of Vee and Noel.Now, yes, there are sad situations, but.....Evans has a wickedly dark sense of humour that's quite appealing. Her sly wit is visible in a description, a look or a snippet of dialogue. Above all, Crooked Heart is entertaining. I read so many books and often find I can predict where a tale will go, or recognize a plot. I truly had no idea where Evans was going to take her tale.Initially, I took the moral high ground when confronted with Vee's scams. But, my opinion rapidly changed as I got to know Vee and Noel. I found myself soundly in their corner - and hoping they could scam the scammers. Evans nicely explores right and wrong through many characters and situations in Crooked Heart. And by the end, it's impossible to say that a little bit of wrong isn't a little bit right.I love books that speak to the human condition - life, love, death and everything that comes in between. This unlikely pair totally won my heart. I was sad to turn the last page. But satisfied, very satisfied. Crooked Heart is, well, heartwarming, heartbreaking and oh,so very good. Heartily recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QH46JTC97Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062364839#wasThisHelpful","R2QH46JTC97Y","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neely Tucker's debut novel, Ways of the Dead, introduced us to reporter Sully Carter. I really enjoyed Tucker's first book and was looking forward to his just released second novel - Murder, D.C.Sully knows there's more to the story when Billy Ellison, son of one of Washington's most wealthy, influential and revered black families, is found dead in a park known for gang and drug activity. Repeatedly warned off by his newspaper, Billy's family and the local gangs, Sully is like a dog with a bone - he won't back down and he won't let go.Which makes for a helluva good read. The plot of Murder, D.C. was inventive, drawing on both fact and fiction. I enjoyed riding along with Sully as he slowly uncovers bits and pieces, ferreting out the truth amongst the lies to arrive at the final reveal. I had my suspicions along the way, but was surprised by many of the turns the book took. (And this is a good thing - I enjoy not being able to predict a plot)The best protagonists for crime books are the walking wounded, the ones who buck authority, the ones who just can't let things be or let justice go unserved. Sully Carter fills the bill on every count. He's battling PTSD, alcohol and anger issues, his bosses and manages to step on toes everywhere he goes. (many times on purpose)  He's also a confidant of the one of DC's most feared crimelords. In this latest book, Tucker continues to fleshy out Sully's character, exposing more of his personal life and the reasons behind his runaway train of a life. Alexis, a photographer, Sully's friend and sometimes lover was a great addition to the story. I loved her attitude and view on life. I hope we see more of her in the future.Both characters have a history as war correspondents. Neely's own background is rich and wide reaching. His experience as a journalist is evident in his writing. (And I wonder how much of Sully is drawn from the author himself)  Neely's descriptions of time and place are vivid and I had strong mental images of the streets, back alleys and underbelly of Washington. These books are set in the late 1990's - when Washington was known as the murder capital of the U.S. (Hence the title)I look forward to Sully's next story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L31YZQFIQAZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016594#wasThisHelpful","R3L31YZQFIQAZ0","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw this new release from Film Movement - Belle and Sebastian - I just knew it was one I had to watch. As with all Film Movement releases, it was a featured film at many festivals and was the Grand Prize Best Film at the New York International Children's Film Festival.My now twenty something son absolutely adored the cartoon series about a boy and his giant white dog. We had a very large white Alaskan Malamute at the time and I know he played out many adventures with Murphy in the backyard.The film takes place in 1943 in the French Alps. Sebastian lives with an old shepherd named Cesar.  The village is worried about a 'beast' who has been attacking the local flocks and have vowed to kill it. Young Sebastian comes across the dog the villagers are seeking and instead, befriends it. The dog becomes Sebastian's protector. For there is danger in the village - the Nazis have occupied it - and the villagers are moving Jewish refugees across the border into Switzerland. You guessed it - Belle and Sebastian are a part of that.This is such a great movie for families. There's danger, adventure and of course a dog who is so very special. Who wouldn't want to imagine themselves as Sebastian? Prepare to have your heartstrings tugged. (For younger viewers, please take not that there are some some animals killed as part of the story.)The movie is worth watching for the scenery alone - the views and vistas of the French Alps are absolutely magnificent. The scenes shot in the snow are real - and just as magnificent.Young Félix Bossuet is such a natural actor. His lines were believable and his facial and body language also spoke volumes. It was easy to believe him as just a boy and his dog. Tchéky Karyo plays 'grandfather' Cesar. I had literally just watched him in the television series The Missing and enjoyed his performance. I thought he did a great job in this film as well. And a review of the actors would not be complete without mentioning the dog - well trained and perfect casting!Families watching with children will likely choose the English dubbing. It seemed a bit off to me in the beginning, but wasn't badly done at all. I did find that of the dialogue could have used a bit more editing before being used  - some of the phrases and language just didn't seem to fit the time and place. I chose to watch with the subtitles instead. There's a 30 minute plus feature included on the making of the film as well.Director Nicolas Vanier did a great job of bringing Cecile Aubry's classic book to the screen and a new audience. And now I'm going to pass my copy on to that twenty-something son....","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29JFJINOIGB6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT9FDU2#wasThisHelpful","R29JFJINOIGB6E","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The opening prologue of Finding Audrey - the newest novel from Sophie Kinsella - had me hooked. We're quickly introduced to the Turner family - as they attempt to dissuade Mum from throwing her son Frank's computer out the upstairs window. Dad and younger son Felix are outside, pleading with her to not do it.  The last family member is Audrey - who is watching from inside the house with her sunglasses on.The novel is told from Audrey's view. Her voice and the reason for the dark glasses are immediately compelling....""The trouble is, depression doesn't come with handy symptoms like spots and a temperature, so you don't realize at first. You keep saying 'I'm fine' to people when you're not fine. You think you should  be fine. You keep saying to yourself: 'Why aren't I fine?'""Kinsella does a fantastic job tackling the issues of anxiety and depression. The exact circumstances that led to Audrey's current situation are never fully detailed - which is perfect. Instead the focus is on Audrey and her progress. And that progress picks up speed when she meets Frank's friend Linus....I loved this book!  I found myself laughing out loud many, many times. And just as many spent on sympathizing with Audrey's plight.The characters are so engaging. It's impossible not to like Audrey. Her brother Frank's strategies and ploys to circumvent Mum's computer ban are epic. Wee Felix has few lines, but his sweetness is tangible. Dad is a bit of a bumbler and Mum is a bit of hard nose. (It was Mum I had the hardest time liking) But what they all share is a love for Audrey and a desire to help her feel better. Each family member is coping and supporting her in their own way. Linus - well, Linus is lovely. And I truly hope there are teen boys like him out there. Audrey's psychiatrist, Dr. Sarah, was also a great addition to the supporting cast. Her quiet advice is full of many truths.Finding Audrey is about Audrey finding herself - and realizing that ""...life is all about climbing up, slipping down, and picking yourself up again. And it doesn't matter if you slip down. As long as you're kind of heading more or less upwards. That's all you can hope for. More or less upwards.""Kinsella injects her humourous style into her first YA novel, but also handles real and serious issues with a realistic eye. Well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWL8CPMGS8NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553536516#wasThisHelpful","RQWL8CPMGS8NM","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Longest Ride, based on the best selling novel by Nicholas Sparks, has just released on Blu-ray from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.Director George Tillman Jr. does a fantastic job of bringing this love story to the screen. (And staying true to the book)Bullrider Luke (Scott Eastwood) is 'back in the saddle' trying to return to the top of his sport after an injury, when he meets Sophia (Britt Robertson) - a college student ready to graduate and pursue her dream job in the art field. When the two meet, sparks fly - but can love overcome dreams and ambitions? What, if any, choices and sacrifices will each be willing to make?What makes The Longest Ride such a wonderful film to watch is the parallel story set in the 1940's. Luke and Sophia rescue Ira (Alan Alda) an older man and his box of letters from a car crash. Sophia continues to meet with Ira and from her letter reading we relive the love story of Ira and his wife Ruth. (Oona Chaplin is fantastic as young Ruth. Jack Huston is young Ira) The two stories mirror each other across the generations, through good and bad, only serving to illustrate that love takes sacrifice and the path to happiness is never smooth.Watching The Longest Ride is going to make you happy though. Who doesn't love a love story? Great sets and scenery, a perfectly cast group of actors, some tastefully done steamy scenes, lots of action in the bull ring and an ending that's just right, all add up to a sweet, satisfying movie night at home. The Longest Ride is perfect to share with that special someone in your life or maybe as a girl's night at the movies. (As one supporting character says early on ""I want a cowboy."" Uh huh.)Tillman took great care with realistically portraying the bull riding. Two of the special features on the disc follow Eastwood's training as well as the real riders. Fascinating stuff. There's also some good interviews with cast members, director and Sparks as well.The title refers to the eight seconds a rider must stay on the bull to score, but The Longest Ride is also a nod to relationships - staying the course through a bumpy ride as well. Well worth watching for this movie lover!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTIWRX7PGIPJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSE0IMM#wasThisHelpful","RTIWRX7PGIPJ4","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5/5  A New Hope is the 8th entry in the Thunder Point series by best selling author Robyn Carr.I don't read a lot of romance, but a co-worker mentioned that she had enjoyed quite a few Robyn Carr titles. I was looking for an easy, feel good read, so A New Hope seemed like a good bet.Ginger Dysart has suffered great personal loss. Still grieving, she moves to the small town of Thunder Point, Oregon, to help out her cousin.  Carr quickly introduces us to the many residents of the town, each with their own story and personality. I must admit to feeling slightly overwhelmed in the beginning, with the sheer number of story lines and connections.Ginger is a likable character, as are most of the players. Thunder Point is that mythical little town, where everyone knows your name (and your business) the neighbours pitch in and help is always just around the corner. Idyllic and a perfect setting.At a local wedding, Ginger is hit on by a drunken Matt Lacoumette, who has also suffered loss. Sober, he comes by to apologize to Ginger and.....well, you can see it coming can't you? No surprise - - their relationship grows from no thanks, to friends and onward. Carr grows this relationship nicely, with more than a few truths and some thoughtful introspection along the way.My only complaint would be the inclusion of what I viewed as somewhat gratuitous sex scenes. No, it's not me being prudish. I just thought they felt forced, or injected into the story as a prerequisite element. I was enjoying the story without these insertions.What I did really enjoy was that caring town and its residents. Carr has included a wide variety of characters, from young to old, each with their own story. It's easy to see why readers get hooked on such series. It's lovely to imagine such a place as Thunder Point might exist.The growing relationship between Ginger and Matt is of course a given, despite the setbacks thrown in their paths. But that's why we read romance isn't it? For that happy ever after. Readers will find that ending in A New Hope.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCW8404K6JSMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317870#wasThisHelpful","RCW8404K6JSMJ","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every so often I need to take a step back from my usual genres and pick up something completely different. Skip Horack's new book, The Other Joseph, offered up a great opportunity to do just that.Roy Joseph has lost most of his life - his beloved older brother Tommy died in the Gulf War, his parents are both dead and he lives within the narrow confines of a life constricted by a felony conviction. He's chosen to live in a remote area with only a dog for company and he works an isolated job on the oil rigs. Roy has exiled himself from life.When a young woman contacts him and say that his brother Tommy was her father, he sees a chance - a chance to reconnect with life again, to redeem himself, to perhaps be happy.Roy's journey physically takes him from Louisiana to San Francisco. He visits locales from their childhood and calls on those who knew his brother along the way. Broken and wounded characters litter the road between Louisiana and San Francisco.Horack's prose are rich and powerful. They are stark and spare, underlining Roy's solitude. I was overwhelmed by Roy's life - his broken, isolated existence. It was just so very, very sad. I wasn't able to read the book straight through - I simply had to read in small doses. I wanted so badly for the the trip to be Roy's redemption. And of course you're asking - was it? It's hard to say - the ending is not what I wanted at all - Horack did surprise me.

"I love old houses and forgotten corners - there are so many stories to be told and remembered.  Kate Riordan's latest book, Fiercombe Manor has one of those stories....1933 England. Young (and naive) Alice Eveleigh has gotten herself into 'trouble' with a married man. Her mother calls upon an old friend to take Alice in until the baby is born. That friend, Mrs. Jelphs, is the housekeeper of a old manor in a forgotten corner of the Gloucestershire countryside. Mrs Jelphs and old gardener Ruck are the only two staff (and residents) of the Stanton estate.All the elements are there for the perfect Gothic mystery - young, curious woman, old retainers, crumbling house with closed off rooms, secrets alluded to, and clues to the past. Riordan seals the deal with a delicious piece of foreshadowing.....""When I think back to the memory, that first glimpse of Fiercombe Manor and the valley it seemed almost entombed in, I cannot recall any sense of unease......It seems amazing in light of what happened, but I can't say I felt any foreboding about the valley at all."" "" I could never have imagined all that would happen in those few short months and how, by the end of them, my life would be irrevocably altered forever.""Riordan's novel is told in a past and present narrative. The past is from thirty years early and is Lady Elizabeth Stanton's story. Old letters that Alice uncovers begin to fill in the past for her, but the reader is privy to more through Elizabeth's voice. I found myself reacting more to Elizabeth's timeline, caught up in the past.""There's an atmosphere, though, as if something of what's gone before is still here, like an echo or a reflection in a dark pool.""Cue delicious tingle.....are there ghosts? Can the past reach out to the present? Is the sad history of Fiercombe Manor going to be repeated?Riordan's setting is wonderfully drawn - I could easily imagine the uneven stone floors, the crumbling outbuildings, the gardens and the dusty rooms. Time is also well done, with the social graces and mores of both time periods captured. Riordan also explores an issue that has a foot firmly in the present. (Sorry, I'm being deliberately oblique so as not to spoil the book for future readers)This novel is fairly lengthy at 400+ plus pages, but I enjoyed the slow unfurling of this novel. Riordan keeps the reader in the dark until the final chapters - and only then reveals the end of Elizabeth's story. Alice's story has a fairytale ending, perfect for this tale. (I have a 'thing' for covers. I loved this one - I wanted to go exploring myself!)Fiercombe Manor is best read in a comfy armchair within a lamp's circle of light with the wind whistling outside at night. Oh, and a pot of tea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1HQPRTMBIRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062332945#wasThisHelpful","R1W1HQPRTMBIRU","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Daughter is Jane Shemilt's debut novel.How's this for a 'grab your attention and keep you reading until you're going to be tired in the morning opening line'....""If only. If only I""d been listening. If only I'd been watching. If only I could start again, exactly one year ago.""Jenny and her husband Ted are parents to teenagers Naomi and twins Theo and Ed. They're both busy physicians and there just never seems to be enough time to keep on top of everything - things get missed. In this case, it's Naomi who goes missing.Shemilt tells the story of this family from the perspective of Jenny then - just before Naomi's disappearance - and now, one year later with Naomi still missing. I loved this dual narrative. A hint or a line from the past or a remembered nuance sparks a segue to the present and back again. With hindsight, Jenny relives the months leading up to Naomi's disappearance. Did she focus on herself too much? What did she miss? How did she not act on the changes she noticed in her daughter? How could she be blind to what was happening in her family?Shemilt's story tells the story of a horrific loss in a seemingly idyllic family - and exposes the secrets and problems beneath that exterior gloss. But the pressing question is what happened to Naomi? Is she still alive? And Jenny comes to realize she didn't really know her daughter at all....The publisher's blurb reads: ""a compelling and clever psychological thriller"". I'm not sure about the thriller label, but The Daughter kept me engrossed from start to finish. I was engaged in Jenny's self recriminations (I did found Jenny difficult to like or feel sympathy for though) and got caught up in the search for Naomi. For me, the book was a slow measured suspense novel, with the focus on the mother rather than the daughter. The ending wasn't quite what I had expected, but as I thought about it, I decided I liked it after all. The Daughter was a good debut and I would pick up the next book from this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N27XR3OZZII6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062320475#wasThisHelpful","R2N27XR3OZZII6","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Dangerous Place is the latest (#11) entry in Jacqueline Winspear's Maisie Dobbs series.The opening first pages of A Dangerous Place were quite jarring - a great tragedy has befallen Maisie. I won't spoil it for you, but this loss devastates her. (And truly this reader as well - I'm saddened  at this turn of events.) So much so,  that she has no desire to return to England - instead she only gets as far as Gibraltar. It's 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is underway.I've always enjoyed the slow building and piecing together of clues on the road to the final reveal in Winspear's novels. The path is never a straight line from A to B which is of course what makes a great mystery. In A Dangerous Place the route to the end is quite roundabout and busy - a bit too much in my opinion. Winspear has grown the series - and Maisie - with new directions taken in the past few books.There is of course a dead body in A Dangerous Place (every mystery needs one!) But, the ensuing investigation is a political cat and mouse game with watchers watching the watched. And sadly, I became tired of it. What I really enjoyed was what I have enjoyed in previous Maisie books - the slow coming to answers with interviews, visits and Maisie's case map. This is still present in A Dangerous Place. But what I didn't like was the political cat and mouse games and the duplicity of almost every character. It was, well, just too much. This may just be my bias - I am not a 'spy novel' fan.Winspear's descriptions of time and place are excellent. Maisie walks the streets of Gibraltar many times - I could vividly picture the old women mending their nets, Mr. Solomon's haberdashery and Mr. Salazar's cafe, as she visits these locations many times. (And it's always fun to see a mention of a place in Canada that I'm familiar with - however brief!)It's always interesting to see why or when a title was chosen for a book. This one has a great quote from Albert Einstein in the epigraph.....""The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.""  And this completely defines Maisie - she is one of the people who 'do'. This quality is one of the main reasons I have come to enjoy this character so much - her determination, her intellect, her compassion, her curiosity and her inability to let injustice go unnoticed.""...he taught me about duty, about doing all in our power to bring a sense of...a sense of rest and calm to those left behind. I was - I am, I suppose - an advocate for the dead.""I found the ending quite satisfying - it was a 'return to roots' for Maisie. I will be very curious to see where Winspear takes her character from here. I will definitely be picking up the next book in the series - this is a character and author that I do quite like.  Readers new to this author will want to start at the beginning to fully come to appreciate this character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANYER8CP3M05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062220551#wasThisHelpful","R3ANYER8CP3M05","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5/5  Deborah Moggach...didn't she write The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel? Yes, she did indeed - I loved that book - and the movie!Moggach's new release, Heartbreak Hotel is just as heartwarming!Retired actor Russell 'Buffy' Buffery has lived a rich full life, but now he finds himself somewhat lonely living in London. He doesn't know his neighbours, its noisy and crowded and his children (and there are many from assorted wives and liaisons!) are busy with their own lives. When an old flame leaves him her bed and breakfast in rural Wales, he decides to move in and run the place himself.""...a new career beckoned. Luxuriantly bearded, his cheeks ruddy with claret, Buffy could take centre stage again, welcoming guests into his charming B and B in the picturesque town of Knockton, wherever that was. Log fires, bonhomie, brass beds made for lusty couplings - adulterers welcome! His Full English Breakfast, all organic of course, would become legendary. Perhaps he could even raise his own pigs.""Uh huh. The B and B isn't quite what he pictured - it needs a little work and the whole running of a B and B might be a bit more work than Buffy had thought.....I loved this character. He's a rascal, but a lovable one. He's got the gift of gab and folks naturally gravitate towards him, spilling their thoughts over a glass of something. Moggach introduces a number of other characters, all unhappy with their relationships - or lack thereof. And Buffy has a revelation - he could run Courses for Divorces! All the skills that newly singles might need - car maintenance, gardening and more. Brilliant! The place will be booked solid! (You can take some of these courses on Deborah's website)Moggach fills her novel and the B and B will a wonderfully quirky cast of characters and situations. Through the ruminations and lives of  Buffy and company, Moggach dissects, explores and celebrates love - of all kinds and of all ages. There are many supporting players, but it was Buffy I enjoyed the most.Me? I'd love to have a little cottage in Knockton and stroll down the pub for a natter. Heartbreak Hotel was a humourous, touching, fun to read novel sure to appeal to those who loved 'Marigold'. Read an excerpt of Heartbreak Hotel.I mentioned I love the movie of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel - and have just discovered The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has just been released. I would love to see Heartbreak Hotel made into a movie as well. I can totally picture Timothy Spall as Buffy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YIOKIWVXNWDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468310577#wasThisHelpful","R2YIOKIWVXNWDH","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5/5  I'm familiar with Rhys Bowen's name - her books have been recommended to me by patrons who know I enjoy mysteries. Bowen's latest book, The Edge of Dreams is the fourteenth entry in the Molly Murphy series - but a first for this reader - and it won't be my last!Molly is the wife of Daniel Sullivan, a New York Police captain at the turn of the century. Even though this book is quite far along in the series, I was able to easily become familiar with the characters and their lives.Daniel has been receiving taunting notes from a serial killer. The pressure is on the police to find him before he kills again. But when Molly is involved in a serious 'accident',  the case may be getting too close to home. Although he is reluctant to bring his work home, he does share his concerns with Molly. Molly has a wonderfully nimble mind. Before her marriage, she worked as a private detective.Bowen captures the time periods and its mores perfectly. Historical events are woven throughout the story.  I loved the detail of time and place as well. Day to day activities, cooking and shopping and more paint a warm picture of days gone by. I quite enjoyed the polite sparring between Molly and her mother-in-law over what 'correct' behavior should entail.Supporting characters 'Gus' and 'Sid' are wonderfully avant garde, living life according to their own rules. Gus has studied with Sigmund Freud exploring his dream theories. This study is called into play with the second plot line of The Edge of Dreams. A young woman's family has died in what initially appears to be a terrible accident. But was it? Why is she unharmed? She can't remember anything but fragments of dreams and nightmares. Can this new method unlock answers?Molly investigates quietly and capably, without drawing attention to herself or stepping on her husband's toes, both personally and professionally. The relationship between Molly and Daniel is particularly well written - kind, loving and believable. I enjoyed the measured pace of the investigations and the 'old fashioned' methods employed to solve the mysteries.Bowen has crafted a pair of good whodunits that were somewhat easy to solve, but it was fun to solve them along with Molly and Daniel. But, for this reader, it is the characters that will have me returning to this historical mystery series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J0Q21JR6O975/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250052025#wasThisHelpful","R2J0Q21JR6O975","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This latest entry finds Lady Emily at a masquerade ball. Another guest seems to mistake her for someone else. There is someone costumed very similarly to Emily, but this woman is passing herself off as a reclusive heiress named Estella. She is caught out by Cecile, a friend of both Estella and Emily. The impostor is later found dead on the grounds of estate. Who was she? Why was she impersonating Estella? Who was the man who approached Emily? And - where is the real Estella? Along with her husband Colin, who handles inquiries for the Queen, friends Cecile and Jeremy, the quartet begins investigating a case that takes them from London to Paris.This was such a fun period piece! Alexander has done her research - I found the detail so interesting - from societal customs and mores, day to day living, but especially the tombs and catacombs. Bookish references (Charles Dickens) are always enjoyed by this reader.Alexander's dialogue is quick, smart and and rapier sharp between all of the main characters. The relationship between Emily and Colin is loving, but saucy!Historical mysteries are always lovely to sit down and savour. The action is slower and the solving of the puzzle more methodical. As readers we are privy to more information that our protagonists have in The Counterfeit Heiress. Estella's story unfolds in chapters alternating the investigation. Midway, I had an idea of what would be the outcome, but I was more than happy to enjoy the journey to the final pages.Definitely recommended for historical fiction fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14O7APTFGPE0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250024692#wasThisHelpful","R14O7APTFGPE0U","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love the Night at the Museum films! Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment has just released the third movie - Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb on Blu-ray.Secret of the Tomb brings back all our favourite characters (the late Robin Williams, Owen Williams, Steve Coogan and more) in their magical roles. But, the magic that brings the museum to life at night is fading....and it's up to Larry (Ben Stiller - I love his deadpan delivery) to save it. And to do that, he has to travel to the British Museum in England. Brits Rebel Wilson, Ricky Gervais and Dan Stevens (a scene stealer as Sir Lancelot) join the cast. Cameos from Mickey Rooney and Dick Van Dyke were touching.Secret of the Tomb is perfect for all viewers - families and adults. I fall into that latter category. My husband and I watched it on the weekend and absolutely enjoyed it. It's just plain fun and totally entertaining. There are some sly jokes that only adults will get, but the fun is for everyone. This cast full of comedians guarantees hilarity. I'm always blown away by the animation. Director Shawn Levy takes things a step further this time and shoots a scene using M.C. Escher's Relativity print that was simply amazing.There's tons of other extras as well - 90 minutes more. We had just as much fun watching how the film was made and the behind the scenes magic! Sadly this is the last entry in this franchise. I was pleasantly surprised when I found a code to download the digital HD version of either the first or second movie free.  Lots of action, adventure and laughs included! I kinda wish there was a magical museum.....until then, I'll happily rewatch these movies. Absolutely recommended to own!

"Oh, did I do a happy dance when I heard there was a new Tess Monoghan book coming from Laura Lippman! Hush Hush is newly released - and was quickly devoured by this Lippman fan.Lippman has written several stand alones in the last few years, but her iconic private investigator Tess is back in the 12th entry in this series - the first since 2008's Girl in the Green Raincoat. Lippman has given us tantalizing glimpses into Tess's life through that last book and a cameo or two in her recent standalones. I was eager to catch up with what's been going on in Tess's life - and follow along with another great mystery.She and partner Crow are the now the parents of three year old Carla Scout. The trials and tribulations of being working parents and the day to day life of a young family are detailed in the personal storyline of Hush Hush. But motherhood and parenthood are also at the heart of the crime of Hush Hush. (And fact mirrors truth in Hush Hush - Lippman is also parent to a young daughter, giving her narrative added depth and insight).Ten years ago, Melisandre was found not guilty by reason of insanity after she let her two month old daughter die in a hot car - as she sat under a shade tree nearby. Having now been pronounced 'fit', she has returned to Baltimore to reconnect with her two older daughters. But she has chosen to make a documentary of her 'return' - ostensibly to help others recognize the dangers of postpartum depression. Although her premise is noble, her intentions may not be. Tess is hired by her lawyer to provide security analysis and support for this venture.Favourite characters return (Crow and Kitty) and new ones are added - I remember wishing Sandy would make further appearances and he has - as Tess's new work partner. Carla Scout's personality and dialogue had me chuckling out loud. Tess's view of the world has changed with the arrival of her child - I very much enjoyed and appreciated Lippman's portrayal of parenthood. All sides are explored - good and bad. ""What a thin line separates good parents from bad parents.""The antagonist of Hush Hush is just as well drawn - but she is so unlikable that it's hard to feel sympathy for her in spite of her past.""The rage she felt at that moment- it was like nothing she had ever known. It wasn't madness, which was the term Melisandre had always preferred for her illness. Unfashionable and imprecise as it was, madness seemed right to her. There had been something vicious inside her, something apart from her, all those years ago.""Hush Hush is told from more than one viewpoint - Tess, Melisandre, her daughters, the transcripts of the film maker and others-  giving the reader much more information than Tess is working with. I had my suspicions nearing the end, but Lippman kept me guessing most of the way.Lippman is a Baltimore native - her descriptions of time and place are so very real. Hush Hush is another fantastic novel from Laura Lippman - again reminding me why she is one of my favourite crime novelists.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYB4V54DK605/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062083422#wasThisHelpful","R3FYB4V54DK605","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5/5  I love 'heist' movies and today's Film on Friday entry falls into that category, with a bit of a twist. Instead of robbery, its kidnapping. And as the title says - Kidnapping Mr. Heineken is indeed the taking of beer magnate Freddy Heineken. What made this a must watch for me is that it's true. All of it. In 1983, a group of friends trying to save their legitimate enterprises needed money desperately. And one of them has the idea to kidnap Freddy Heineken. They do - and  they collect what was the largest ransom ever at that time. But did it solve their problems?Based on crime journalist Peter R. de Vries’s 1987 book, Kidnapping Mr. Heineken takes us from the idea, to the planning, to the execution and -  the aftermath.""There are two ways a man can be rich in this world - he can have a lot of money or he can have a lot of friends - but he cannot have both.""These are the opening lines from Anothony Hopkins (Freddy Heineken). I love Hopkin's voice - it's so rich and sonorous, making you stop and listen with every nuance he injects into his lines. In this case it's quite prophetic. From a tight knit group in the beginning, the relationships and trust between the friends disintegrates. And Alfredson follows the dissolution with his camera.I was fascinated with the story and ended up reading much more about it on the Internet. Truth is stranger than fiction. There's much more the story 'after' but Kidnapping Mr. Heineken does a good job of bringing this fascinating piece of crime history to the screen.I thought the cast was good - Hopkins as always is a standout for me. His character does not act like a victim at all - there were shades of Hannibal in some of his innocent yet loaded comments. The rest of the cast was great but I did have trouble not seeing Ryan Kwanten as his True Blood character. The struggle between between brothers in law Cor (Sturgess) and Willem (Worthington) over direction and leadership was well played. Worthington also never disappoints me. The movie was actually shot in the Netherlands - the settings added much to the overall tone of the film.Kidnapping Mr. Heineken stars Anthony Hopkins, Jim Sturgess, Sam Worthington, Ryan Kwanten, Mark Van Eewen, Thomas Cocquerel and Jemima West. Written by William Brookfield and directed by Daniel Alfredson. Interestingly, another film from the Netherlands was made in 2011 based on this same set of events.Not a 'you must go see', but definitely entertaining. Sit down with a Heineken at home one night and enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q7IICLW0CZ1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYB9W0A#wasThisHelpful","R1Q7IICLW0CZ1V","A2EMIIHBL60K7L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EMIIHBL60K7L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Sopranos was my prior benchmark for brilliance in a dramatic series, but I think Breaking Bad has managed to surpass it.  It was the most intense thing I've ever seen on TV, and I admit there were days when I watched two or three episodes back to back, as well as one weekend day when I watched five episodes.This is basically a Greek tragedy in modern form.  Most of the key characters have flaws in their character - hubris, envy, greed, vengefulness, insecurity, impulsiveness, sociopathy, etc. - and the eventual outcome of these flaws is suffering and sometimes death for them and others, including innocent bystanders.  There was a point in the last season where the tragedy reached such a high level that I felt traumatized and started to regret watching the series.  So I suspect that this series will be just too much for some people, unsuitable for tender souls.  But in the finale, the story is resolved in a way that, for me, there's some sense of justice, along with  a measure of hope going forward for bystanders who are still alive.  And as a testament to the richness and humanness of the characters, I finished the series feeling profound ambivalence towards most of them, including Walter White - he embodies genuine evil, but he's also a victim for whom we can feel real pity.Beyond the powerful and gripping story, the acting is superb (to the point where I almost can't believe that many of the characters aren't real!), and 'genius' may be the right word to describe the creators of this familiar yet unfamiliar world which we visit for more than 50 hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SG067T8EL5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9MS86O#wasThisHelpful","R12SG067T8EL5U","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recommend this course because the topic is fascinating and important, and the presentation is well-organized and clear.  However, because this course is presented from the perspective of one researcher, it inevitably reflects his interpretations, conclusions, and biases.  So anyone interested in this topic would do well to also consult other sources, and the Wikipedia articles on intelligence, IQ, etc. are a good place to start in that regard.  Taking all of that into account, my general conclusions regarding this topic are as follows:• It’s reasonable to posit something we can call 'general intelligence'.  General intelligence can be 'measured' by various psychometric tests, or preferably sets of tests, and the results of these tests tend to be positively correlated with each other, but the variability in results on the tests for a given person can be significant.  So general intelligence is something we can 'measure' only roughly, not precisely like height, weight, physical strength, etc.  Efforts have also been underway to correlate general intelligence with objective measurements of brain structure and function, and the most important findings appear to be that, when performing the same tasks, (a) there’s considerable variability in how brains work, (b) there are significant average differences in how equally-intelligent male and female brains work, and (c) more intelligent brains tend to expend less metabolic energy.• General intelligence involves ability to learn and remember, perform various tasks we face in daily life, perform in various occupations, and do all of these with limited instruction and guidance.  General intelligence is also positively correlated with physical health, mental health, and lifespan.• Topics and activities which are more complex and abstract generally require higher prerequisite general intelligence.  For example, it’s probably impossible for a person with an IQ of 90 to become a university researcher.  Once IQ is above about 120, differences in IQ seem to matter less, though there are some areas (eg, PhD mathematician) where the prerequisite IQ appears to be considerably higher than 120.• On average, males and females have about the same general intelligence, though males tend to be a bit stronger in some abilities, and females in other abilities.  And the variability among males tends to be greater than among females, which means there will be more males at both the top and bottom end of the range (hence more males attaining elite status).• On average, general intelligence appears to be highest for Asians, then Whites, then Hispanics, then Blacks.  But there’s large variability in each group, so each person needs to be treated as an individual rather than member of a 'race' – there will be many Blacks with higher general intelligence than many Asians.• Variation in general intelligence among adults appears to be about 80% due to genetic inheritance and 20% due to environmental influences, with interactions between these factors over the lifespan.  The contribution of environmental influences tends to be greater during childhood, which means that the contribution of environmental influences decreases over the lifespan.  Many genes and brain centers appear to be involved in intelligence.• Some studies suggest that exposure to language at a very young age can increase intelligence somewhat, the worldwide 25-point increase in average performance on IQ tests over the past century ('Flynn effect', based on normalizing to equate the tests over time) shows an increase in intelligence which can’t be explained based on genetic changes, and, again, environmental influences account for about 20% of variability in adult intelligence.  On the other hand, IQ tends to be somewhat stable over the lifespan, and educational efforts to raise IQ haven’t had much success.  My net conclusion is that intelligence *can* be meaningfully increased for an individual, and much of the apparent stability of IQ over the lifespan is due to the fact that IQ ranks people relative to each other (so that mean IQ is 100, and standard deviation is 15), and it’s the *rankings* of people which tend to remain roughly the same (and there are be plenty of exceptions to that).• While the concept of general intelligence has some validity and usefulness, it clearly doesn’t tell the whole story, since people can have high ability in some areas despite not having high general intelligence ('idiot' savants are an extreme example of this).  So there’s clearly some merit to the idea that there are multiple intelligences, and trying to condense them into a single general intelligence may be too simplistic (and unintelligent!).  For example, one scheme defines two kinds of intelligence: (a) fluid intelligence, which is strongly correlated with IQ, involves reasoning, applying knowledge, and solving problems, and peaks at about age 15 then gradually declines, and (b) crystallized intelligence, which involves ability to learn, increases until middle age, and then plateaus.• Achievement - as measured by academic achievement, type of occupation, occupational achievement relative to peers, income, and wealth - is somewhat influenced by intelligence, but is also substantially influenced by education, environment, motivation, personality, etc.  So intelligence (or IQ) is clearly not destiny – many people with ordinary intelligence have achieved a lot, and many people with high intelligence haven’t achieved much.  But it’s probably also fair to say that people with low intelligence will likely be limited in what they can achieve, and people with high intelligence do have higher potential for achievement.  All of this has important implications for social policy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D251TS2OXH05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598039415#wasThisHelpful","R3D251TS2OXH05","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went through this course right after completing Patrick Grim's 'Teaching Company' course on the same topic.  My aim was to deepen my understanding by exploring the ideas again, but with a different tour guide.Comparing the two courses, Grim's course is more broad ranging, I found it more interesting, and I liked it more overall.  Pessin's course is quite good as well (thus deserving of 5 stars), with everything explained clearly, but there's more emphasis on detailed 'technical' arguments in the spirit of analytic philosophy.  I find these sorts of arguments tedious because much effort is often required to follow them, yet the terms are fundamentally *not* well defined, so I think there's often a false sense of precision there, which renders the whole effort akin to spinning wheels.Overall, I come away from this course having reinforced my conclusion that we really don't know what to make of mind, consciousness, etc., and are far from understanding them in anything resembling a 'scientific' framework - if that's even possible (I tend to doubt it).  We have the experiences that come with existence, and various words to try to (vaguely) describe and understand that experience, but that's about it, as far as I can tell.  But if you want to explore the philosophy of mind despite that, this is certainly a credible course with which to do it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SWFF4JZ20REE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00435F8PU#wasThisHelpful","R3SWFF4JZ20REE","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an engineer who has been involved in several award-winning structural designs, I'm pleased to endorse this book.In my opinion, the author is quite correct in his assertion that qualitative and visual understanding of structural behavior, and ability to quickly perform approximate calculations by hand, are essential skills for a competent structural engineer.  And I can attest that over the past 25 years, I've seen a general weakening of these skills among my colleagues, especially when comparing entry-level engineers over the years.  I don't know the reason, but I suspect that over-reliance on software, and using it as a 'black box', are major factors.  This book provides a means to help engineers develop or regain these skills, though of course getting the engineers who *need* to read the book to do so is another matter.The format consists of short chapters, there are abundant illustrations (many in color), and each chapter ends with a nice summary of key points.  Better editing could have improved the writing in some places, but the author is clear enough, so this isn't a big deal.  Overall, the author evidently put a LOT of work into preparing this book.The book also emphasizes buildings rather than other structures, which will of course suit some engineers more than others, but this wasn't a major deterrent for me, despite my doing little work related to buildings.I recommend this book to all structural engineers in early or intermediate phases of their careers, and graying engineers like me are likely to enjoy the return to fundamentals it provides.  The author is my kind of engineer.  :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EGKQ4N255LS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782223169#wasThisHelpful","R3EGKQ4N255LS4","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book provides a decent and fairly extensive catalogue of cognitive biases, somewhat emphasizing their application to politics and social policy.  Each bias is presented in a simple way, typically one bias per page, with limited depth and generally no references to other sources for readers who want to delve further.  It should also be noted that the evidential support for different biases varies, and 'biases' can serve a useful function in some contexts (hence the reason why they're so prevalent), but this book doesn't convey that.

"Let me ask a meta-question: what is a question?  Via many pages and countless examples, this book will remind you that a question is a tool to probe the darkness of ignorance by doing things like:- Revealing our assumptions- Clarifying what we don't know- Identifying and clarifying problems, threats, and opportunities- Learning new things, including connections among things we already know- Placing what we already know in a different context- Reminding us of things- Verifying things- Coming up with creative ideas (eg, solutions to problems), including ways to implement ideas- Raising additional questionsThis is all well and good, but honestly that's about all I got from this book.  The book could have easily been shortened to an article, but the author is a journalist, so he's good at spinning out words and we wind up with a book which doesn't yield much more than an article. I got something out of the book, but it wasn't worth the time invested, and the vast majority of what the author says seems rather obvious, at least to me.  Also, the emphasis of the book is business applications.For a deeper exploration of ways to question and benefits of doing so, I suggest Googling 'the ignorance university'.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGY0TQGU9VBYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620401452#wasThisHelpful","RGY0TQGU9VBYI","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This course has the feel of a half-semester university course on philosophy of mind, and thus reminds me of the enlightening times I had as a university student decades ago.  The subject matter ranges across philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and even robotics.  As a result, strictly speaking, the course is more an interdisciplinary exploration of what 'mind' is, rather than purely a course in the philosophy of mind.In my opinion, the lecturer, Patrick Grim, does an excellent job of covering this broad range of material.  He's fair in presenting the various views, and the arguments for and against them, while also being willing to share his own views without being overbearing.Normally, when writing reviews, I try to list key points in some detail, but I don't think that's the best approach with this course, since the main questions remain unanswered and possibly unanswerable (at least for humans, in this life).  Instead, here are some of the broader conclusions I came away with:(1) When we ask questions in the philosophy of mind, part of the challenge is that it often isn't clear what we're asking - the meanings of the terms in our questions are themselves questions.  So as Wittgenstein advised, we need to be careful about spinning our wheels due to our questions being ill-posed without our realizing it.(2) The mind-body problem remains unresolved.  We still don't know how to connect subjective experience with our various models of an objective physical reality (which includes our own brains).  Diverse ideas have been offered, but they're all speculative, some seem implausible, and none seems widely compelling.  Personally, I take consciousness to be fundamental in some way, and I do think it provides a basis for some freedom of will, but I also believe that there's an objective reality, and it's clear that changes to the brain can lead to changes to the mind, some of which can be very peculiar.  And even with a 'normal' brain, the connection between subjective experience and objective reality clearly isn't 'direct', as evidenced by the many perceptual illusions we're subject to, and the influence of the expectations and models we bring to bear in interpreting objective reality.(3) As machines, computers, robots, etc. become more complex and sophisticated, having diverse interactions with their environments and apparently being able to learn, there's a question of whether they have some form of mind, consciousness, intelligence, and free will.  While Grim doesn't cover it, the same question applies to species other than humans, as well as humans during the process of development from conception to adult (does a zygote have a mind?).  And given that consciousness is experienced subjectively, there's also the solipsistic question of whether other minds besides our own actually exist (though I've yet to meet anyone who doubts it!).(4) There's a question of how mind and consciousness persevere over time as a continuing 'self', given that associated physical systems can continuously change over time with the possibility of eventual total replacement of their constituent matter.  Grim doesn't discuss it, but this opens the door to all sorts of metaphysical and religious conceptions of what the 'self' is (or the idea of its nonexistence and being illusory).(5) Our confusion regarding the nature of mind results in confusion (or at least difficulty) in resolving questions of moral responsibility, psychopathology, blame, reward, punishment, law, etc.I highly recommend this excellent course to anyone interested in the philosophy of mind.  You won't come away with the answers you may be seeking, but you can at least clarify your questions and may wind up asking some new questions.  Such is philosophy, and it may be argued that there's value in 'mapping our ignorance'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XWVQNTK7INJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTO5LQC#wasThisHelpful","R37XWVQNTK7INJ","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have an interest in human encounters with extreme environments (primarily on a voluntary basis), this is a fascinating book.  The book provides a detailed summary of the findings of extensive research into this subject matter, illustrated with plenty of examples.  The thoroughness of the book makes it read more like a scientific literature review than a work of popular science (20 pages of notes, 30 pages of references).  That will reduce the readability and enjoyability of the book for some readers, but it also makes the book more authoritative and comprehensive.  In that regard, I should note that I first listened to the audiobook, and I found it to be information overload despite the excellent narration, so I wound up getting the print book so that I could take notes and better absorb the information.The book covers the personality traits and motivations of people who choose to spend time in extreme environments, the mental and physical effects those environments have on them, and the individual and collective attributes they need to have in order to succeed in those environments.  Each chapter concludes with a brief summary, and here is a summary of those summaries, to show you the tip of the iceberg:- Coping with the stresses of extreme environments is as much a mental as physical challenge.  Extreme environments involve risks, and therefore require meticulous planning and preparation, but they also offer the prospect of rewards which are unavailable in everyday life, and can also improve our ability to cope with the stresses of everyday life.- We can manage fear and be brave by using relaxation techniques, cognitively reappraising situations to make them less daunting, and equipping ourselves with a good repertoire of behavioral responses to choose from.- Hardships such as moderate hunger, thirst, pain, and squalor seem worse than they are, and many of them have evolutionary protective functions.  Rather than fearing them and overestimating their harm, we should instead develop techniques for coping with them.- Inadequate sleep has a range of detrimental mental and physical effects, not unlike alcohol intoxication.  Caffeine is helpful, but napping is even better.- Monotony and tedium have detrimental mental effects.  Effective remedies are little pleasures such as eating, socializing, and playing games.- People vary in their ability to cope with solitude, but to prevent the detrimental effects of feeling lonely, we should use solitude as an opportunity to be reflective and creative.- Social conflict can be very stressful, and being confined with people for long periods greatly increases the potential for such conflict.  To mitigate that, we need to make extra effort to be tolerant and tolerable.- Teams need to have the right mix of personalities and skills, guided by leaders who are competent, trustworthy, and genuinely concerned with the well-being of team members.- Extreme environments require good planning, preparation, judgment, and decision-making.  Experience, deliberate practice, and training can aid developing expertise in these areas, but even experts must contend with various subconscious biases.- Coping with extreme environments requires sustained periods of focus while ignoring distractions, which is not easy, because our minds naturally wander and we're easily distracted.  Meditation is an effective technique for developing ability to focus.  Focus not only may be needed for survival at times, but it also reduces boredom and promotes being in flow.- Stresses can break us, but they can also foster development of resilience.  Other ways to bolster resilience are social support, humor, meditation, and finding meaning in adversity.- People choose to experience extreme environments for various reasons, including aversion to boredom, curiosity, and/or desire to help others.- Ultimately, facing extreme environments and their attendant challenges can enhance our lives in many ways and on multiple levels.I recommend this book to anyone interested in extreme environments, and especially to those who experience such environments or are contemplating doing so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39A8CRPEQ57G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199668582#wasThisHelpful","R39A8CRPEQ57G1","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a long book, perhaps longer than what most people will be looking for on this topic.  And the topic isn't the concept of genius, or the history of geniuses, but rather the history of the concept of genius, primarily in the Western world.We learn that the concept of genius emerged at least as far back as the ancient world, and has continued to evolve since then.  The impetus for the concept has always been trying to account for why some people stand out so much in their superior abilities in various domains, and what the limits of those abilities might be.  Speculations in this regard have elicited a range of thoughts and feelings among the masses: wonder, inspiration, hope, and sometimes also fear when genius was in the domains of politics or warfare (eg, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Lenin, and Hitler).Regarding the source of genius, earlier thinking was that it came from outside the person, from some kind of spiritual or divine source which guided the genius, or even used the genius as a mere vessel.  This itself could elicit fear, since such agencies could be malevolent in some cases (hence the 'evil genius').  As we moved into more modern times through the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romantic period, with spiritual and religious thinking coming more into question, the source of genius became more mysterious for some, and for others became grounded in pantheistic 'Nature' inspiring or acting through the genius.  Then with the rise of biology in the mid 1800s, we saw genius increasingly rooted in the anatomy and then physiology of the brain, with the associated question of nature versus nurture, and eventually a shift towards focusing on a continuum of intelligence levels rather than a distinct category of genius.  And most recently, the idea that there may be multiple kinds of intelligence has become somewhat prominent, and some have taken that further by suggesting that everyone (or nearly everyone) has potential to exhibit one or more kinds of intelligence, possibly even to the genius level.  That democratic promotion of equality dilutes genius to an extent that it nearly vanishes, and creates checks and balances on any individual acquiring too much power, yet we still yearn to believe that there are people around with special powers, even if the source of those powers is perhaps more mysterious than ever (the usual explanations having been largely discredited).The author generally covers all of this fairly well, but as I noted at the outset, the book may be longer than what most people are looking for, and I'm disappointed that the level of detail drops off fairly sharply as we approach contemporary times.  So I found the book quite lacking regarding the history of the concept of genius (and intelligence) during the past few decades, despite much work having been done during this period.  Because the book is quite lopsided in this regard, and therefore left me unsatisfied, I'm deducting two stars, but I still gained much from reading it.  The book is a glass half full.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PFG7DDS77UOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465003257#wasThisHelpful","R2PFG7DDS77UOI","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most recent book written by Erik Hollnagel, a prominent safety researcher with decades of experience in the field.  That alone is sufficient reason for anyone involved in safety to read the book.  I personally found the book to be stimulating and thought-provoking (as expected), but also tantalizingly frustrating.The author describes two frameworks for thinking about safety.  Safety-I aims at preventing failure by reacting to failures via investigating them, identifying their causes, and implementing measures to prevent recurrence of those causes in the future.  Safety-II aims at maximizing success by proactively trying to anticipate how the system may evolve and promoting actions believed to foster success.  There's some merit in this classification, but at some points in the book, the author argues that nearly all modern systems have become so complex that Safety-I is obsolete and we must move towards Safety-II, at other points he suggests that Safety-I may be fine for many systems, and in the end he seems to argue that we need a combination of Safety-I and Safety-II.I agree with the last perspective, but would argue that preventing failure and promoting success are largely two sides of the same coin - I'm not convinced that the distinction is as sharp as he suggests.  And I would go further and argue that, rather than generalizing, we need to look at the specifics of each particular system we're dealing with, including understanding the *modes* of failure and success for the system, as well as possible *degrees* of failure or success in each mode.  For example, with 'passive' systems like bridges and dams, it may be appropriate to focus on preventing failure, whereas in business and investing people clearly have an interest in maximizing success (eg, returns) while still paying some attention to preventing failures for the sake of risk management.I also question whether Safety-I necessarily must be reactive and Safety-II proactive.  I don't see inherent contradictions in proactively trying to prevent failures by doing things like watching for warning signs of failure (one of the traits of 'high-reliability organizations'), or reactively trying to promote success by studying what has lead to both success and failure in the past (which can enable identification of 'best practices'). In general, why not use all the diverse tools at our disposal?  How about aiming to both prevent failure and achieve success (as your particular system warrants), and applying this dual approach both reactively (learning from experience, both good and bad) and proactively (anticipating potential future scenarios and adapting as the actual future unfolds)?In short, I do think this book is worth reading because it will provoke you and get you thinking deeply about what safety is and how to achieve it.  But go into the book knowing that the ideas in the book need to be developed further and warrant doing so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16G4DJYZR1EKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472423089#wasThisHelpful","R16G4DJYZR1EKU","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first book I read on stoicism (which I read recently) is A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William Irvine.  I think that's the place to start for anyone new to stoicism.  Irvine systematically presents the practical ideas of stoicism in a way that enables application to our daily lives today, while also linking these ideas to their historical precursors.This book edited by Patrick Ussher complements Irvine's book by providing further illustrations of how the ideas of stoicism can be interpreted and applied in daily life.  The book consists of many short pieces written by people from diverse walks of life facing diverse circumstances.  Some of the pieces have a relatively broad scope, others are more focused on topics like parenting, death, sports, etc.  Even if some of the pieces don't connect much with you, there are likely to be plenty that will.While I did feel that I was benefitting from the book as I read it, reflecting back on the book now, I have to admit that not much of its content is sticking in my mind.  Perhaps I learn better from more systematic monographs, so that's where I'll be headed next, specifically Stoicism and the Art of Happiness: A Teach Yourself Guide (Teach Yourself: Relationships & Self-Help) by Donald Robertson.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNA8US551E7GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502401924#wasThisHelpful","RNA8US551E7GA","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with some other reviewers that there's a bit too much repetition in this book, and in fact there's considerable repetition across Dekker's numerous books.  But they're good books which have substantially shaped my thinking related to safety, and I enjoy reading them because Dekker probes the issues deeply in an engaging and conversational way.This particular book purports to be a 'field guide', implying that it has a 'how to' orientation.  To some extent it does, but it should be clarified that the focus is *understanding* human error, not investigating it or preventing it (and the book challenges the utility of the concept of 'human error').  As such, the main goal of the book appears to be presenting a theoretical framework for thinking about safety which Dekker, as a member of the safety research community, has developed over the past two decades.  The core elements of this framework might be summarized as follows:(1) Many of the systems we deal with are complex, with interactions of both human and physical factors.(2) Complex systems aren't inherently safe, their natural tendency is to drift towards failure.(3) We don't see more failures than we do because people, generally being well intentioned, are continually making an effort to cope with the pressures they face to achieve various goals, while simultaneously trying to avoid failures and maintain safety.  This usually requires transcending formal rules and procedures in order to adapt to the needs of particular dynamically evolving circumstances.  But sometimes these efforts do fall short, cumulatively over time, hence we have some failures.(4) To understand why people's efforts fall short, both individually and collectively, we need to avoid hindsight bias and instead put ourselves in their shoes, to understand why their decisions and actions made sense to them at the time.  This shifts the meaning of 'human error' to being an act which simply contributed to an undesired outcome, rather than an act resulting from carelessness, complacency, overconfidence, etc.  But ironically and unfortunately, a long record of success *can* foster complacency or overconfidence which increase the risk of failure.(5) Putting ourselves in people's shoes will often reveal problems with the way the organization is operating overall, and those problems are where are efforts for reform should be directed, rather than seeking to simply identify and eliminate bad apples.  More automation will often not be the answer, since it can insulate us from the operational reality of the system and wind up contributing to failures.  By contrast, improving flow of information within the organization will usually be helpful.(6) Much resistance is likely to be encountered when trying to implement such reform and establish a 'safety culture'.  So safety departments should have both independence and sufficient resources, while still having close exposure to the daily operational reality of the organization.I can certainly recommended this book, but again keep in mind that much of the content can be found in Dekker's other books.  Also keep in mind that, while Dekker may be considered essential reading for anyone interested in safety, it's also important to read other authors to hear different perspectives.  I suspect that Dekker himself would agree with that advice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12FXOPV5138UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0754648265#wasThisHelpful","R12FXOPV5138UC","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until this course, I generally shunned studying the topic of negotiation, assuming it was mainly about crass ways to manipulate people in order to get what you want.  But we all routinely need to negotiate things big and small, and I generally trust the quality of courses from The Teaching Company, so I figured I'd try to be open minded and give this course a try.I'm very glad I did!  Having taught negotiation for a couple of decades, and gained plenty of firsthand negotiation experience himself, Seth Freeman does a great job.  He gives us both academic rigor and practical methods, illustrates points with many examples, and is a very clear and engaging communicator.  Most importantly, Freeman shows that negotiation isn't (or shouldn't be) about trying to take advantage of people, it's fundamentally about more effectively collaborating with people so that everyone is better off.My summary of the main points:(1) Do sufficient inquiry and research to understand your goals, the other party's goals, the potential influence and roles of parties outside the negotiation, the factual context of the negotiation (economic and market conditions, laws and regulations, technologies, etc.), and cultural factors.  Make the first offer only if you have good defensible information on which to base it, otherwise let the other party make the first offer.(2) Approach negotiations with an attitude of confidence, humility, fairness, and respect.  Try to negotiate real time and face to face, ask questions, be a good listener, tell stories, build rapport, foster mutual trust (eg, show some vulnerability), expect give and take, enable the other party to save face, and don't be in a hurry to get to the 'bottom line'.  Be 'hard on the problem, easy on the person'.  And if faced with an especially high stakes negotiation and/or difficult negotiating partner, do rehearsals to prepare for the negotiation.(3) Negotiate deals as packages rather than piecemeal issues, and be creative in identifying options which best meet the goals of both parties (these options may be quite different from anything either party initially envisioned).  And when appropriate, broaden your perspective to negotiating a set of related deals with various parties, in a sequence such that each deal builds on the previous ones.(4) Go into negotiations knowing what your fallback options are if an agreement can't be reached.  If agreement does appear to be nearly reached, carefully scrutinize the terms to make sure there are no pitfalls before accepting the deal.  And if it truly appears that an agreement acceptable to you (better than your fallback options) can't be reached, courteously end the negotiation rather than agreeing to an unacceptable offer (the other party may come back later with a better offer).I listened to the audio version of the course, which works well.  However, in order to share this course with my family and others, I've also ordered the DVD version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FDINCLEQBD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2NEINA#wasThisHelpful","R34FDINCLEQBD9","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The criticisms of this book tend to focus on whether it authentically conveys what the Stoic philosophers were teaching, including their associated metaphysical worldview(s).  There may be some merit to those criticisms, but I personally don't care much about those relatively academic debates.I instead approached this book as a work of sophisticated self-help, and in that regard I think it excels.  As the author notes, the various stoic psychological techniques may not be a good fit for everyone, but for many people (including me) they have the potential to be truly life changing in a very positive way.  So I took the trouble to summarize the main ideas and techniques in the book, as follows:* Decide what you really want out of life.  For some people, 'tranquility' will be high on the list, and will in turn be a means to eudaimonia (flourishing).* Tranquility is mainly achieved by decreasing negative emotions (eg, anger, grief, anxiety, and fear) and increasing positive emotions (eg, joy).  Various psychological techniques can and should be used for this purpose.  In general, emphasize changing how you interpret your circumstances, rather than trying to change your circumstances.  This takes discipline, so that your wiser conscious self can override your more 'primitive' subconscious self.* To the extent that you do try to change your circumstances, focus on what you can change with reasonable effort, and don't expend effort or worry on things you can't change.  So, set your goals realistically, and make sure they accord with your real values, rather than values absorbed mindlessly from others (eg, fame and fortune).* Since outcomes will rarely be entirely under your control, orient your goals internally towards process (eg, doing your best) rather than externally toward specific outcomes.  And then accept whatever outcomes are the result.  A nice side effect is that such an orientation towards process will often improve outcomes, since it makes you less self-conscious, less self-judging, and better able to deal with setbacks and rejection, thus helping to bring out the best in yourself.* Learn from the past, but don't dwell on it.  Accept that the past can't be changed - ""what's done is done.""* Enjoy the good things life has to offer, but never cling to them.  Accept that they can go away at any time, and be comfortable with that.  And correspondingly, don't go too far out of your way to attain these things.* Rather than insatiably wanting more and more (we tend to 'hedonically adapt' to what we have), want what you already have.  Do that by 'negatively' visualizing that you don't have it or lost it, so that you appreciate it rather than taking it for granted.  A bit paradoxically, such an exercise will also break your attachment to what you have.  This perspective can be applied to losing loved ones and generalized to your life itself - periodically imagine that this day or this moment could be your last.  So appreciate what you have by comparing it with having nothing, and refuse to even think about what you're lacking as compared to some imagined ideal situation.  And to give this perspective a metaphysical foundation, note that there's no known principle of the universe entitling or guaranteeing that any of us will have anything in particular; as much as we may want to believe otherwise, there's no real basis for claiming that life will necessarily be 'fair'.* Periodically, deliberately deprive yourself of things, especially if you currently have a lot of things.  This will have several benefits: clarification regarding the things you can readily live without, so that you don't unnecessarily pursue things which have little benefit for you; hardening yourself against loss of things, since such loss can occur in the future; reducing your fear of losing things in the future, since you'll have proven to yourself that you can endure such loss; overcoming hedonic adaption, resulting in renewed appreciation of things; preventing or breaking addictions to things; and developing greater self-control, which is a kind of pleasure in itself.  And in general, simplify your life as much as possible.* Regarding grief, remember that the last thing a loved one would want is for you to go on grieving permanently, so grieve for a reasonable amount of time, but then bring it to end and go on with your life, appreciating the time you did have with that loved one.  And when dealing with others who are grieving, sympathize with them, but don't unnecessarily 'catch' their grief, since that would serve no useful purpose.* Since we're all social beings, be a responsible member of your various social groups, but don't let people upset or disappoint you.  Accept that people are what they are (with associated sympathy or even pity), ignore or avoid problematic people when necessary (""out of sight, out of mind""), choose your friends carefully, and laugh rather than getting angry.  Perhaps even sometimes ""pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover your mistakes.""* To deal with 'insults': consider if the insult contains merit, consider whether the insulter is uninformed, be glad that someone you don't respect disapproves of you, pity the insulter, be indifferent to the insulter, respond with self-deprecating humor, and/or ignore the insulter (which can disconcert him).  And to generally avoid giving people too much power over you, thereby reducing your freedom, have some indifference to their opinion of you (which implies not seeking fame).* When things are bothering you, view them in a larger perspective - your whole life or even the cosmos - to appreciate their relative insignificance.  And never view yourself as a victim.* Be an observer of your own thoughts and actions, to evaluate how well you're applying the stoic psychological measures, with the primary indicator being your overall level of tranquility and joy.  We may never reach the ideal state in this regard, but the closer we can get, the better.* Apply stoic techniques on a regular basis, not just when circumstances appear to be getting especially challenging.  And relish opportunities to put your stoicism to the test, so that you can become better at it.  But keep your stoicism 'stealth' unless your intention is to help others by sharing it with them (it will fit some people better than others).* Remain aware of your mortality and the certainty of dying at some point, so that you make the best use of your days rather than squandering them.While some of these techniques may seem counterintuitive - and certainly contrary to the norms in affluent societies today - my experience with them indicates that they can be very effective.  So if you're skeptical about them, my advice is to give them a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UW5BM1MDF8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195374614#wasThisHelpful","R28UW5BM1MDF8Q","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is fairly polarizing, hence a dip in the number of 3-star reviews.  Some people love the book and think Friedman is brilliantly insightful, realistic, and honest.  Others think he's remarkably misguided and morally dubious.  Though I lean more towards the latter group, I'll grant that he makes some valid points which may not be widely appreciated:- US power in the world is somewhat dominating, to the extent that the term 'Empire' isn't unreasonable, though we're far from 'ruling' the entire world.- What our government is willing to do for the sake of US interests is necessarily a lot more ruthless than what the general public realizes, particularly the US public.  There are reasons why millions (or billions) of people around the world hate the US.  But ceaseless violent conflict throughout world history shows that no group can afford to simply be 'good people' and assume that their neighbors are also 'good people'.- We don't have the option of living in an isolationist bubble and disentangling ourselves from foreign affairs.  Our economy would take a big hit if we tried to do that, at least in the short and intermediate term.But there are deep problems with Friedman's perspective and book:- For the sake of preserving the US 'Republic', he says that our government should be willing to be scheming, duplicitous, and ruthless towards the rest of the world, as though those people have no greater inherent value than insects which can be exterminated if it serves our interest.  Well, if Friedman has no regard for humanity in general, why then care about the US Republic, itself of an abstract entity? Why not care about only your own family?  Our just yourself?  Friedman also says very little about what he means by the Republic and why it's worth preserving.- He writes with a clarity and confidence which is apparently convincing to many readers who are less versed in world history and current affairs than he is.  But I would say that he's *overconfident* and lacking appropriate humility.  It's unrealistic for him (or us) to think that he can make reliable detailed predictions about how world history will unfold for the next decade, given that his models evidently leave out so much of the world's nonlinear complexity and associated uncertainty.  And read the book Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? by Philip Tetlock to see the generally poor predictive track record of 'experts' like Friedman (which isn't to say that his predictions may not be more accurate in his narrower specialty area of shorter-term intelligence analysis).- Let's assume for a moment that Friedman is on target with all of his predictions and strategic advice.  Then who is he writing this book for?  The audience should be limited to senior members of the US government, especially the President, and kept secret from everyone else, especially our potential rivals on the world scene who we hope to prevent from becoming too strong.  Why would you tell a rival how you intend to harm their interest? Makes no sense.  So I have the impression that self-promotion or hubris may be the primary motives in writing this book.Overall, I did find this book stimulating because it offered some different perspectives for me to respond to, but ultimately I think the book is both unreliable and lacking a moral foundation, so I hope too many people won't be duped by Friedman's skillful rhetoric.  He assumes, without offering any justification, that we can't adequately serve US interests while also being fair and reasonable towards the rest of the world, based on a sense of shared humanity.  I think he's wrong.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REX1T2GQVGMIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307476391#wasThisHelpful","REX1T2GQVGMIZ","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking at the power law distribution of the ratings of this book, there are apparently some people who don't resonate with the book, but most of us love it.  Don't know what a power law is?  Read the book!But seriously, this is surely among the best math books ever written for the general reader, including those who fear math enough to be predisposed to not like it.  Using a variety of entry points into the world of mathematics, Strogatz is a superb tour guide who has a passion for the subject and patiently explains things to us in a friendly step by step manner, so that we can all follow along if we're willing to pay attention and think a little.  He covers well-known basics, but he also takes us to many of the grander and holier destinations of mathematics and describes them in a way which reveals their remarkable and intriguing multi-faceted beauty (and mystery), so that we can get a sense of why professional mathematicians are attracted to the subject and love their work.No, reading this book won't enable you to 'do' mathematics with any modicum of expertise, just as exploring great works of art won't enable you to become a capable artist.  But becoming familiar with mathematics and developing the ability to appreciate it is still a wonderful thing, just like with art appreciation.  And for those who already have decent mathematical background, take the tour anyway, I assure you that Strogatz has a depth of insight and eloquence of communication which makes it worthwhile!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6A60XQ58A2EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544105850#wasThisHelpful","R6A60XQ58A2EG","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I consider the novel to be utterly brilliant, though deeply disturbing.  I won't comment further on the novel, since countless others have already done so, and the Wikipedia article in particular is quite good.As an adaptation of the novel, the movie is decent, but of course it also leaves a lot out, in this case feeling more like a 'sketch' of the novel.  The primary aim seems to be to create visual images to accompany and amplify the novel.  In that regard, I think the movie succeeds, and the acting is also top notch.But because the movie isn't really self-contained, I do strongly recommend reading the novel first.  The movie will then serve as a chilling reminder of what can happen if too few people acquire too much power (for its own sake), beyond what the masses can counteract.  And lest we think that the masses can't be manipulated to that extent, let's not forget what happened with the Germans during Nazism.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LTW9DEDBLT41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039O8AQK#wasThisHelpful","R3LTW9DEDBLT41","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ignore the reviews which are less than 5 stars.  Seriously.  The title of this book is ""A Few Lessons from Sherlock Holmes,"" not ""Synopsis of the Sherlock Holmes Novels"" or something like that.  Bevelin delivers exactly what he promises, and does it quite well.  If you sensed that the character of Sherlock Holmes displayed judgment and wisdom which can be applied to real life, you're right, and Bevelin extracts it for us, illustrating the insights with quotes from the novels, as well as a few outside sources (Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Pasteur, Claude Bernard, etc.).At less than 100 pages with a largish font, the book is short.  But it's also fairly condensed, so don't try to breeze through it.  Take your time, ponder, re-read as needed, give the insights a chance to sink in and become part of you.  To aid my own absorption, I prepared the following summary of the key insights from the book - a condensation of a condensation:(1) Gathering information and forming hypotheses are iterative processes.  Information alters hypotheses, but hypotheses frame the gathering of information (we tend to `see' what we're looking for).  So don't become prematurely wedded to any hypotheses, and beware of overconfidence and mistakes in perception and reasoning.(2) Sometimes, more than one hypothesis will reasonably fit the available information.  In that case, use judgment to decide which hypothesis has the best fit, or try to gather more information to help decide between hypotheses.(3) In general, favor simpler hypotheses, while accepting the possibility that a more complex hypothesis may turn out to be more accurate, particularly when dealing with systems that are evidently complex.(4) When possible and warranted, physically test hypotheses to judge their accuracy.(5) Observe very carefully, paying attention to details, and noting both what's present and not present - the smallest detail can be of pivotal importance.  But in doing so, don't become preoccupied with obscure details at the expense of ignoring what's obvious.(6) If there's any significant doubt about accuracy of key information that was not obtained firsthand, verify it.(7) Use judgment (which is fallible!) to discern which information is important and which can be ignored.  But recognize that the importance of information may only be apparent when it's viewed in the context of other information, so connect the dots to discern the overall picture.(8) Educate yourself: investigations require substantive knowledge, not just good methodology.  But beware of letting superfluous knowledge crowd out useful knowledge - more isn't always better.(9) To make investigations more effective, draw on diverse perspectives in terms of knowledge and people.(10) Use checklists for investigations, especially in early stages, but don't solely rely upon them.(11) Draw on similarities to previous investigations, but recognize that cases can be more different than they initially appear.(12) Recognize that `strange' cases can often be easier to solve, since their peculiarities can serve as valuable clues.(13) Don't rush investigations.  Be persistent but patient.(14) Give yourself sustained blocks of time to concentrate fully, without distractions, when pondering information and hypotheses.If that all sounds interesting to you, don't delay - spend a few bucks, read the book carefully and repeatedly, and become wiser.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F55YFMRM1BFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMGK97I#wasThisHelpful","R1F55YFMRM1BFG","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This a comprehensive collection of quotations by Einstein, along with some quotations about him, filling almost 600 pages (I read all of them).  The quotations have been carefully selected and authenticated, which makes this collection perhaps the most authoritative available source for Einstein quotations.The topics of course cover physics, but they also range into philosophy, and extend further into religion, politics, and much else.  I think this range of topics shows the dual nature of Einstein, a man who valued solitary investigation into the nature of the universe, but was also willing and able to passionately engage in the social world.I've read a few biographies about Einstein, but hearing him speak in his own words offers a different and valuable perspective which is essential if you really want to get to know what kind of person he was.  I think you'll find confirmation that he was indeed a uniquely profound genius whose towering reputation is entirely warranted, while also being subject to the imperfections and limitations which are inherent in being human.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K3TZ6X3UZMBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691160147#wasThisHelpful","R1K3TZ6X3UZMBX","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It feels a bit self-referentially weird to be writing an Amazon review of a book about Amazon, but c'est la vie.I listened to the unabridged audiobook, which is narrated exceptionally well, and thought it was a great book - informative, fascinating, engaging, even educational.  But then, as I usually do when I finish a book, I read several reviews by others in order to expand my perspective.  And that's when questions arose, since many Amazon insiders challenge the accuracy of the book, to varying degrees.  Not having any firsthand info myself, I did my best to weight the evidence and reached the judgment that the book is probably 'reasonably' accurate with regard to details, and probably a bit too negative in the way it portrays Bezos and the Amazon culture.  That said, I learned a lot from this book.  A few highlights:- Bezos is a genuinely impressive guy, the real deal.  Intellectually brilliant, with both penetrating depth and versatile breadth.  Visionary and inspiring, yet attentive to minute details when necessary.  Incredibly ambitious - I'd like to know what fuels that.  Capable of charm and sincere goodwill, but also ruthlessly competitive, and relentlessly demanding towards employees and suppliers.  Not a guy I'd want to compete with!  Though, maybe one I'd want to work for, in order to learn and grow, but better be willing to work hard to meet his very high standards, and have thick enough skin to persevere when his piercing criticism inevitably comes.- Because of its constant emphasis on growth, Amazon's profit margins have been rather meager, and they've even had substantial losses in some years.  Is this sustainable?  Will Amazon eventually triumph with both big market share and big profit margins?  I don't know, but for now I'm a happy Amazon customer and I hope they continue towards becoming an 'Everything Store'.  I don't like wasting my time running around shopping at physical stores with limited selection and prices which aren't always competitive, so the Amazon model is perfect for me.- The many features of Amazon which set it apart and improve customer experience (and loyalty) - huge selection of products, smart search engines, abundance of reviews, personalized recommendations, free shipping, rapid shipping, Prime, etc. - required enormous efforts to implement, and sometimes a lot of uncertainty and financial risk.  I took them largely for granted until now.  Nothing you see on the Amazon website got there without a lot of consideration behind it.Perhaps the main thing I was reminded of is that enormous things can be achieved in business - even at a fundamentally world-changing level - but tremendous work and risk tolerance are needed for such achievement, and there are indeed a few people around who are able and willing to do that kind of work.  I myself am content to operate on a much smaller scale, but I still admire these high achievers and sometimes draw inspiration from them.So of course I recommend the book, and to a relatively broad audience - frequent Amazon customers, aspiring and current business leaders, IT people, etc.  Just remember to take the details with a grain of salt and consider that the author may be painting too negative a picture much of the time, perhaps in order to sensationalize a bit.  And it that regard, I do think the author displayed questionable ethics in tracking down Bezos' biological father and telling him who his son is; the outcome of doing so was reportedly fine, but what if that hadn't been the case?","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RITCLYKFRWE0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316219282#wasThisHelpful","RITCLYKFRWE0V","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At 112 pages with a large font, this short book can be read in a day.  The value of the book for you will depend on what you already believe and know regarding investing.  For me, I can’t say that I discovered any really new ideas in this book, but I didn’t mind being reminded of some basics, since investing doesn’t interest me much, so I need books like this to motivate me to do a better job of managing my hard-earned savings.And as a professional who’s much more interested in his profession (and other interests) than investing, I picked this particular book because I’m part of the author’s target audience of ‘professionals’ (physicians, attorneys, etc.).  The author notes, I think correctly, that professionals tend to have the following traits, which are counterproductive for investing:• Lack of familiarity with options for tax deferral with investments, since they’re used to paying ordinary income tax.• Lack of appreciation for the importance of compounding investment returns over many years, since they’re used to being paid fees for services on a steady basis.• Despite financial advisors generally having a poor performance record, orientation towards hiring advisors and paying them costly fees, because they themselves are advisors and have confidence in the value such advisors add.• Orientation towards making decisions and taking action on a frequent basis, whereas investing requires patiently looking for ideal buying opportunities and taking action relatively infrequently.Here is a summary of the key advice offered in this book, which aligns with the thinking of people like Buffet, Munger, and Bogle:• Avoid using investment advisors.  They’ll likely cost you a lot of money over time, without improving your investment returns.• Focus on buying low rather than selling high.  This will reduce your risk of losing money and increase your chance of being able to sell at a gain.• Avoid speculation based on market timing, momentum, etc.  Instead, take a long-term investing perspective (eg, 5 years or more).• Never borrow money and invest on margin.  Such leverage can wipe you out if prices move against you in the short or intermediate term.• Historically, inflation has averaged about 3.5%, so at least that much return is needed to break even.  Stock returns have averaged about 8%, leaving a net return of about 4% (pre-tax).• For most professionals, especially if pressed for time, take a ‘passive’ investing approach, which doesn’t require researching particular companies.  This involves regularly buying shares (regardless of whether the market appears to be up or down) in a broad-based US stock market index fund (eg, Vanguard S&P 500 Index fund) which has no load, very low annual fees, and limited turnover of stocks in the fund.  Such funds will tend to outperform actively managed mutual funds in the long run.• If you want to invest more actively, buy stock of good companies at a bargain price, or stock of outstanding companies at a fair price.  And if you find the rare opportunity to buy stock of an outstanding company at a bargain price, invest substantially in it.  Whatever you do, be patient and don’t compromise on these standards.  And invest in just a few of these companies, certainly not more than 10.  In the long run, wise active investing can produce returns significantly higher than passive investing, and the gain in portfolio value can become large due to compounding effects.• The price of a stock should be judged in terms of the discounted cash flow a company will generate, and the associated uncertainties.  This means not investing in companies with no earnings, since that amounts to speculation.  And generally avoid tech companies, since their highly dynamic competitive environment makes predicting future earnings especially difficult.• Maximize investments through tax-deferred retirement accounts.  This will enable taxes to be paid hopefully at a time when tax rates are lower due to reduced income.  It will also avoid the double taxation associated with ordinary income tax initially, followed by capital gains tax upon withdrawal.• The author advises keeping investments mainly in stocks rather than bonds, regardless of your age.  I disagree with that advice, especially if one has already accumulated enough money to retire and no longer needs significant investment returns.  Isn't there such a thing as 'enough'?Since the book didn’t provide me with any profound new insights, I can’t quite give it 5 stars, but I do think it warrants 4 stars for providing generally sound advice and presenting it clearly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVNA8NE6HFPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1425772390#wasThisHelpful","R2JVNA8NE6HFPD","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a bridge engineer (among other things) who has designed several award-winning bridges, I found the vast majority of bridges in this book to be stunning, sometimes to a jaw-dropping extent.  The bridges have mainly been built within the past few years, though a few are not yet constructed and a few will perhaps remain concept-only.The bridges span the globe (pun intended), though it's sad to see that only three of the many bridges are in the US, and two of those are concept-only.  We in the US are evidently not leaders when it comes to applying architectural creativity in order to design bridges as functional works of art which enhance communities on a higher cultural level, rather than simply serving as cost-minimized utilitarian elements of infrastructure.  So I was both inspired by the book and poignantly reminded that the opportunities to practice this level of bridge design are limited in my country.The bridges portrayed in the book are wonderfully diverse in form - a testament to the prowess of human imagination - and the quality of the bridge photos is very high.  Indeed, I sense that the preparation of book was a labor of love by the author, who is an art historian.  But because of his background, a corollary is that the book lacks the kind of technical information a bridge engineer would seek, and in a few cases I was even unable to determine the structural mechanics of particular bridges based on the photos and the limited amount of text which accompanies each bridge.Nevertheless, while this book may not be 'perfect', I believe it still fully warrants 5 stars for what it offers, and I highly recommend it to any enthusiast of bridges, whether professional or layperson.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB8H0LL13HIS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3037681756#wasThisHelpful","RB8H0LL13HIS3","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book mainly because of my interest in mental models, as referenced in the subtitle.  At 73 pages and more than half of it white space, this “book” is more a booklet which can be read in one sitting.The author talks about “mental models” of four “master traders,” namely Munger, Soros, Templeton, and Buffet.  He tells us that by discovering their “hidden knowledge,” he “earned so much money on the stock market” that he “became of afraid of the amount.”  The implication is that you and I can do the same, otherwise if we don’t make this book “part of our lives” we’ll have “missed the boat.”That’s fairly aggressive marketing, and not surprisingly, the book can’t deliver on such grand promises.  But the book does contain some wisdom, and I don’t mind having spent some time (and money) to read it.  Some highlights, generally in the order they appear in the book:• To better understand situations and make better decisions, simultaneously look at situations from different perspectives and angles by using multiple models drawn from different areas of knowledge (economics, psychology, biology, mathematics, etc.), including sometimes zooming out to look at the big picture.• Maintain a thirst for knowledge and never stop learning.  Reading books is a great way to learn, and biographies can be particularly edifying.  More generally, stories are an excellent way to learn and teach.• When analyzing situations, undertake both a formal rational analysis, and an analysis of factors which can’t readily be incorporated into a formal analysis.• Quickly eliminate options which aren’t worthwhile, so that energy can be focused on worthwhile options.• Schedule in quality time for family.•  If you’re going to do something, give it your best, and finish what you start.• As a benchmark, use the best example available.• Readily abandon ideas if they’re no longer valid or effective.• Excellence in a field requires focusing on it, which usually entails some sacrifices.  And this kind of focus will ideally lead to being so in tune with the work that decisions become intuitive.• Work only with top-notch people, and with people whose strengths complement your weaknesses.• To understand an organization, go to the source and talk directly with its people.• To prevent getting burned out, find ways to relax and recharge when you’re not working.• Be patient in looking for great opportunities.  When you find them, have courage and act on them.  Conversely, when mediocre opportunities present themselves, pass on them rather than settling.• Never put all of your money at risk.  Always have some savings so that you can weather difficult periods and stay in the game.  Preferably also have more than one income stream.• Talk to people who have different views from you, to deepen your understanding.• Invest longer term (5+ years) when longer-term uncertainties are less than short- and medium-term uncertainties associated with market volatility, economic cycles, etc.• To beat the crowd, you can’t simply follow the crowd.• “The measure of mental health is in the disposition to find good everywhere.” Related to this, avoid excess worry, which unnecessarily saps energy.• Promptly acknowledge and take responsibility for your mistakes, learn from them, and then move on.• In investing, know your circle of competence and don’t stray outside it.• Focus on buying at a low price, so that it’s easier to sell at a profit.• As an ethical test, assume that your actions will appear on the front page of the newspaper.• Diversify investments reasonably, but don’t spread them too thin.• A company with a durable competitive advantage, with the stock at a good price (based on a few key indicators), is generally a good investment.Of course, most of this is common sense, applying it diligently is easier said than done, and even then success is far from guaranteed.  If the author went into more depth and wrote a longer book, perhaps the book could make it a bigger impact.  But he didn’t …So one star deducted for overselling the book, another deducted for not going into depth.  But still perhaps a book which you might find worth reading if the subject matter interests you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27FYBHMGF2BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0595426247#wasThisHelpful","R27FYBHMGF2BO","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The engineering expertise and practical experience of the authors is quite evident.  While the book covers a large number of failure modes for a large number of components, with accompanying b/w photos, where I find the book a bit lacking is in providing sufficiently detailed guidance for diagnosing the cause(s) of particular failures; for each failure mode, bullet-point lists of ""possible causes"" are provided, but there isn't enough depth to determine which of these possible causes were most likely.

"This book summarizes and applies the findings of a wide array of psychological research to various fields of design, especially design of websites, computer interfaces, etc.  The book is easy to read, and the format of ""100 things"" works well.  The author even applies the lessons from the book to the design of the book itself, with effective use of colors, fonts, summaries, etc.But the reader should be aware that this isn't a breezy read where you pick up a few good ideas and move on.

In other words, I see this book as primarily a handbook or reference book - and a very good one at that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R5OFLDH161ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321767535#wasThisHelpful","R2R5OFLDH161ZR","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I was a teenager, I've had a rather insatiable curiosity and desire to learn, my interests have been broad and sometimes deep, and my personal library has grown rather large as a result.  So this book was pretty much made for me, helping me to understand myself, and reassuring me that my intellectual tendencies are likely a good thing (on balance!).  As a parent and a leader of an engineering firm, there's also much that I can apply from this book to those contexts.The author, Ian Leslie, evidently has a lot of curiosity himself, including his meta-curiosity about the topic of curiosity.  As a result, the thoroughness of his research is very impressive and wide ranging.  Clearly, a lot of effort and thought went into this book, which serves to increase confidence in his conclusions and recommendations.In that regard, here are a few notes from the book:(1) Social trends are creating a 'divide' between the incurious and curious (or less curious and more curious), and this divide applies at all scales - individuals, companies, societies, etc.  The curious have prospered more, as increasingly complex jobs have become the domain of people who can continue to learn throughout their lives, whereas routine jobs have increasingly been handled by automation.(2) Curiosity is stimulated by information gaps - knowing enough to have an increasing sense of what you don't know, which generally makes you want to know more.(3) Curiosity can be measured in various ways, such as the 'Need For Cognition' (NFC) scale, which is based on a questionnaire.(4) We're born with an instinct for curiosity, which generally has a survival benefit.  But curiosity is also like a muscle - use it or lose it.(5) Curiosity is in a sense more important than 'intelligence', and results in an increase in intelligence, both measurable intelligence (eg, IQ) and what we informally think of as 'being smarter'.(6) Two main kinds of curiosity are diversive and epistemic.  Diversive is more short-term, impulsive, and superficial; epistemic is about building deeper knowledge through persistent explorative effort and forming connections among bits of knowledge.(7) A third kind of curiosity is empathic curiosity, which involves taking an interest in putting ourselves in the shoes of others.(8) Curiosity can wane during schooling, partly because of the work involved in learning, and not necessarily because typical teaching methods stifle curiosity.  So we need to foster a willingness to work hard to learn, and parents are important role models in that regard.  Parents also need to continue to engage children in asking and answering questions.  And schooling needs to balance filling students with facts (which *is* important, per the thesis of the book) versus open-ended student-led inquiry.(9) Easy online access to information can hamper curiosity by making us lazy, instead of getting used to persistently making effort, which is necessary for real lasting learning.  Online resources also tend to feed diversive rather than epistemic curiosity.  By contrast, reading continues to be one of the best ways to foster epistemic learning.(10) Curiosity is fostered by building a growing knowledge base, combining specialized and general knowledge (which aids in multidisciplinary collaboration), learning to take an interest in 'ordinary' everyday things, asking big 'Why?' questions, combining both abstract and concrete thinking, and valuing mysteries over more finite and delineated puzzles.(11) Curiosity generally directs your attention externally rather than internally.  Avoiding preoccupation with the self is likely to make you happier, and can even be a remedy for depression.I could go on, but that should be enough to stimulate your curiosity and motivate you to read the book.  Don't delay, you won't regret it.  I can't recommend this important book more highly!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DBP0KSA5DRBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465079962#wasThisHelpful","R1DBP0KSA5DRBK","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Addressing the elephant in the room, politically I'm an independant, and wasn't a fan of the Bush II administration, so by association I wasn't really a fan of Rumsfeld either.  But as I pondered his oft-ridiculed comment about knowns and unknowns, I came to conclude that it was a profound distinction, and it made me think that perhaps he had unappreciated depth.  Having finished the book, I have to say that I'm impressed.  There's indeed much depth, insight, and wisdom here, and the book is written with admirable clarity and elegance, with plenty of well-chosen anecdotes to illustrate the points.  Actually, I enjoyed reading every page of the book, and often it was hard to put down.Does Rumsfeld show biases and present his own take on history when providing his anecdotes?  Surely he does, but that is to be expected of any former senior government leader recounting past events, and I don't think that he takes excessive liberties in this regard.  So look past the politics and the specifics of history - imagine that the author shares your political persuasion and just listen to him with an open mind.  If you do, you may learn some valuable ""leadership lessons in business, politics, war, and life.""  I certainly did, and these lessons ring true with my own decades of leadership experience.  I look forward to reading this book again, and perhaps listening to the audio version also.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VIQQZBX5WU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062272853#wasThisHelpful","R20VIQQZBX5WU8","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a structural engineer myself (among other hats), I've been a fan of David Blockley's work since my college days more than two decades ago.  He's clearly one of the ""deep thinkers"" in the field, albeit coming from the academic side rather than professional practice.  So I felt compelled to read this book to see how he presents my field to the general reader.My conclusion? Being honest, I'm not sure that this book will work well for the general reader.  There's just too much theoretical material which I suspect will go over the heads of most general readers.  Much of that material (eg, virtual work concepts) is challenging even for engineering students to learn, despite being presented in engineering textbooks more systematically, in more detail, and with more illustrations.  And on the practical side, I'm not sure that this book gives a good feel for what we as practicing structural engineers really do either - at least I didn't see myself depicted in the book.So is there a good audience for this book?  If so, who is that audience?  I don't have answers, but perhaps my familiarity with the subject matter prevents me from accurately judging the value of the book for general readers, as well as engineering students and young engineers.  I hope so - this is a case where I hope I'm ""overqualified"" to review a book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFCG15OX9AQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199671931#wasThisHelpful","R1QFCG15OX9AQB","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was disappointed with this book.Not being able to review any preview pages, based on the title, I assumed/hoped that this book provides a broad overview of civil engineering at a technical level somewhere between the general reader and civil engineers.  Such a book would be useful for engineering students, young engineers, experienced engineers aiming to learn the basics of specialties other than their own, motivated general readers, and of course lawyers with an interest in infrastructure and civil engineering.Instead, while the book does contain useful information, the coverage of topics is highly uneven (some major areas of civil engineering practice are neglected entirely), and the level of technical detail is also highly variable (and too light on average).Not being able to think of an audience this book works well for, I can't recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROPPEY2QC2TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161438763X#wasThisHelpful","R3ROPPEY2QC2TH","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this book and think it deserves a full 5 stars for accomplishing its aims.  No, you can't really learn math from this book, the discussions of topics are much too brief for that.  Instead, the book works for two audiences and two associated purposes.First, for those who have limited background in math but a genuine interest in it, the book gives a glimpse of the world of math, covering topics ranging from simple to intermediate to highly advanced.  If you're not sure whether you like math, a survey like this will help you determine that.And the second audience is those who have a substantial background in math (short of being mathematicians) and are interested in doing a quick and fun review of once familiar topics, as well as filling in a few gaps here and there.For me, this isn't a book that I'd use as a reference (not enough depth), nor one that I'd read again in its entirety (more enjoyable to move to a different math book), but certainly one I enjoyed and benefitted from reading once.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7EM1FA7P27XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623650089#wasThisHelpful","R7EM1FA7P27XK","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess I'm not as enamored with this quick read as other reviewers, maybe in part because few of the ideas are new to me.Drawing on modern understandings of complexity, the author recommends that organizations have a relatively decentralized non-hierarchical network structure which is dynamic, so that it can flexibly adapt to and be 'pulled' by changing market conditions, with individual and collective learning being continuous processes.  The emphasis is on social aspects, teams, collaboration, and group/organizational performance, rather than incentivization or evaluation of individuals.  The role of leadership is to foster all of this, along with much attention to helping bring the right people into the organization, rather managing top-down with a heavy hand.This is all fine, but I think the author sometimes pushes these ideas to a radical extreme (eg, no overtime pay or bonuses), without presenting evidence that doing so will work in practice.  And I suspect that the zingy style of the book is also motivated by the author's desire to promote himself as an organizational consultant.So overall, I'd say that the book has good ideas, but somewhat overstated and overhyped.  Read with an open mind, but also take things with a grain of salt. Don't get overexcited and start changing everything tomorrow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXE205XBI0L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991537602#wasThisHelpful","R1YXE205XBI0L4","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high hopes for this book, but came away from it with mixed feelings and a bit disappointed overall.On the positive side, I like the bite-size format of the book.But on the negative side, while the title is ""Fundamentals of Ground Engineering"", much of the material is at grad school level, and not explained in this book with enough depth and patience to enable the reader to understand it unless the reader is already familiar with it from other reading.  Tied with this, I think there's too much emphasis on conveying concepts via mathematics rather than words.  And further in this vein, the content of the book seems better oriented towards academia rather than practice, even though the book lacks sufficient thoroughness for academic use.Unfortunately, I envision putting this book on the shelf and not referring to it much or at all in the future, since better references are available for my needs as a practitioner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIRSWFOCP40EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148220617X#wasThisHelpful","RIRSWFOCP40EC","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Music isn't a sport, so I won't say Guthrie Govan is the *best* guitarist in the world.  But I will say that I can't really think of anyone better.  Simply phenomenal.Marco Minneman is a highly regarded drummer as well, and deservedly so.  There's a reason he nearly got the gig with Dream Theater.  He has chops to spare, but musicality too.  I was intrigued to discover that he's also a decent guitarist.Bryan Beller was new to me, and frankly I wondered if he could hang with these guys.  Yes, I think so.  He's not a flashy bassist, and his chops are never in your face, but his bass covers the bottom end well - always makes sense for the music, and well executed.As a trio, they have real synergy, they're a real band, not just three great musicians.  They each bring different stylistic tendencies and they fuse them well, apparently a result of enjoying composing and performing together.So that means that I do like the music.  If I was forced to pick a category, I'd call it jazz-rock fusion, but I think their spectrum is actually broader than that.  Elements of metal, even country.  Reminds me of The Dregs sometimes, but the music is still uniquely that of The Aristocrats.As far as the DVD production qualities, the Blu-Ray is sharp, and more importantly to me, the sound quality is really good.Bottom line, this performance captured on DVD is a real treat, and is one I'll be returning to on a regular basis.11/8/14 Addendum: Regarding the last sentence of my review above, it was an understatement.  I was pulled in, I kept replaying this DVD for the past 2 months since I got it.  This has never happened to me before with a concert DVD.  The music is just too good, layers of depth and facets of nuance kept emerging as I listened to it more.  And the musicianship is truly superb, sometimes spellbinding.  I'd give this one 10 stars if could!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVDCK9GD0VVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AL0PW48#wasThisHelpful","RSVDCK9GD0VVI","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went into this audiobook somewhat skeptical about the author's motives, but I knew that Zappos was a fairly successful company, and that their culture has something to do with that, so I thought I'd give this book a try and approach it with an open mind.I'm glad I did! I'm convinced that Tony Hsieh and Zappos are the real deal.  Tony is a *very* sharp guy and a quality person, combining inquisitive intellect, analytical ability, humility, creativity, a passion for business which emerged at a young age, and genuine goodwill toward others (desire to ""deliver happiness"").  Correspondingly, Zappos has a culture which reflects who Tony is, involving commitment to customer service (trying to exceed expectations), sincere regard for its employees and even its vendors, and long-term orientation.  The result of this unique culture is that Zappos has grown enormously, and Tony has become quite wealthy (presumably along with other shareholders).  But it was also interesting to see how many times Zappos came close to not making it, and the perseverance and risk tolerance that were needed to get through those tough times.  Success didn't come easy, it was the result of a learning process involving plenty of trials and tribulations.I and my own company share some traits with Tony and Zappos, and reading this book has motivated me to embrace who we are and go further in that direction, so this is certainly an influential book for me.And regarding the skepticism part, yes, the book does serve as a marketing tool for Zappos, but there's nothing inherently wrong with that if Tony is generally speaking truth, which I think he is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BFNN4G4LKR90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QADCNS#wasThisHelpful","R1BFNN4G4LKR90","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bill Simpson is fairly well known in the motorsports world, especially because of his involvement in safety.  I enjoyed reading this autobiography, though, as a safety person myself, I was disappointed that the discussion of safety aspects was fairly superficial, despite Simpson being among the key players during the mid 1960s to mid 1970s when great strides were made with safety.Overall, what I learned is that Simpson isn't atypical among people who become very successful as business founders/owners.He had a rough childhood and, though a bright guy, dropped out of school in the 8th grade (reflecting a degree of nonconformity), probably then starting his working life with a bit of an inferiority complex which he was motivated to overcome.  Related to that motivation, he read books to help fill gaps resulting from his incomplete education, and also had a capacity to work very hard with a single-minded focus, a focus he initially applied to participating in the ""crazy"" worlds of drag racing, then amateur club racing (crashing regularly), and finally pro racing (including Indy 500), where he performed decently, though never truly making it to the top (lack of funds was surely a factor).Through his involvement in racing, he witnessed an appalling amount of injury and death, and ultimately made it his life goal to do something about that by developing products to make racing safer, hence founding the company that bears his name. As a result of lots of R&D trial and error, networking, and marketing, the company did fairly well, though it didn't take off until he quit racing and focused solely on the business - ""Safety was never something I could think about for eight hours a day and then forget about at night.  It was always a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week deal.""  And even then, the success of the company wasn't a steady climb, there were some major ups and downs, including lawsuits and near bankruptcy, and Simpson showed the tenacity to weather these storms and persevere.The business never provided Simpson with the same exhilaration that racing once did, but he didn't regret giving up racing because he recognized that continuing to race without being 100% focused on it was risky.  He likened business to war, and was routinely angered by competitors copycatting his ideas.  He never had timelines for his company, he just wanted to see it continue to grow, which it certainly did, though he acknowledges that lucky timing was a factor, coinciding with both growth of the motorsports business and increasing attention to safety after many racing heroes died.  And though he became wealthy, and appreciated what money can buy, money was always a byproduct rather than the goal itself, the goal being to provide the best safety products available.But Simpson's focus on racing, safety, and his company came at a dear price: ""The personal side of my life has been a total failure.  An absolute, complete and total failure.""  He was married and divorced three times, and accepts most of the blame.  He had two sons, but didn't spend much time with them when they were young, which he clearly regrets.  He also regrets not having had much of a childhood himself, since he started working so early.  Surely a factor in all of this was his sharp temper - perhaps related to his hard-driving and perfectionistic personality - which harmed not only his family relationships, but also his friendships and his business.  And yet, because he's convinced that he saved many lives through his contributions to motorsports safety, he claims that he would do it all over again the same way, if he had a choice; I'm not sure I believe him, and suspect that he's consciously or subconsciously compelled to assuage his regrets, but read the book and judge for yourself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RR77BGQG0RJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892725184#wasThisHelpful","R1RR77BGQG0RJ1","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't make the same mistake I did.  While the average rating for this book is nearly 5 stars because most of the 'reviews' are 5 stars, the 'most helpful' reviews rate the book much lower, and those are the ones to pay attention to.As they note, this book is basically a bunch of rudimentary self-help cliches which are loosely connected to sports via many short anecdotes drawn mainly from baseball, golf, and basketball (and thus not representative of a broad range of sports).  As a result, there's almost nothing in the book which is truly specific to sports and there's no deep insight useful for athletes or coaches.  It's just standard and fairly obvious stuff like work hard, be disciplined, be confident, focus, visualize perfect execution, be persistent, learn from your failures, perform in the moment but take a long-term perspective when training, don't try so hard that it's counterproductive, etc.I came away from the book quite disappointed.

"Strange that I'm the first person to review this book ...Anyway, the title and book description are misleading.  There's very little discussion about what Einstein, Russell, Pauli, and Godel talked about.  In fact, there's debate about whether such meetings even took place at all, at least with all four of them present simultaneously.Instead, the book provides somewhat detailed bios of the four of them, as well as shorter bios of other people they interacted with, such as Bohr, Oppenheimer, Wittgenstein, and many others.  The book also provides a popular history of the early phase of the development of modern physics (with some tolerable inaccuracies), and its application in the development of the atomic bomb.This is certainly stimulating subject matter, I learned some new things, and the book is generally well researched and well written.

"Written by a philosophy professor, this book is wide ranging and probing in its exploration of the topic of happiness (and related topics), but unfortunately I didn't get much out of it.  We get a knowledgeable tour of many trees, but without the benefit of a clear overall map or otherwise getting a sense of the overall forest.  With some effort, the main broad conclusions I was able to draw were:- We'll be most satisfied with our lives if we live them in accordance with our values.- Those values will preferably be aligned with the way the world actually works, as well as our individual, human, and social natures.  So our relationships with other people matter a lot, and 'good' personal attributes like virtue, empathy, integrity, character, responsibility, caring, etc. are important.  We should also choose wisely as far as the people we spend time with.- We need a balance between engaging activity and relaxation.  Stress needs to be managed, and we need to be resilient so that we can handle inevitable tough times.  It also helps to have a connection with nature and a general attitude of appreciation of what life offers (glass half full).- We need enough money and material resources to have basic security, and some freedom and options as far as how we spend our time.  Beyond that, money and material resources are of limited benefit.  So choose your career carefully based on your interests, personality, and abilities, don't simply chase after money and status.Of course, this is all fairly standard wisdom, so this book only reinforced what I already knew, rather than adding to or deepening my understanding.

"This is a useful book overall, and contains a lot of information, but there are three significant areas where it could be better:- While there are many photos of components, there's a lack of diagrams illustrating the layout of suspension systems so that the reader can see how the components fit and work together.  Related to this, the author throws out a lot of terminology without definitions or illustrations of the terms.- There's not much specific guidance on how to choose suspension components (adjustability of shocks, spring rates, etc.) for a given car and application.- The discussion of tires seem rather outdated, and doesn't reflect the modern classification of tires into categories of high-end street tires, DOT R-compound street tires, semi-slick tires, and slicks, with their associated characteristics and applications.Bottom line is that I do recommend this book, but it can't be considered a self-contained resource even at an introductory level, and definitely look elsewhere to learn about tires.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5GLKQ0FN7GV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760339945#wasThisHelpful","R5GLKQ0FN7GV3","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Well made and entertaining, but not life changing.The main themes are honor, patriotism, duty, sacrifice, chain of command, and perseverance, and these themes are portrayed well.

Such a process generates warning signs, and there were plenty of them in this case, but they weren't adequately heeded until it was almost too late.For whatever reasons, I like these 'submarine films', and this is a pretty good one.

I've played guitar for more than three decades and always knew Gary Moore was out there and considered a fine guitarist, but I rarely heard much of his music, and what I did hear didn't have much impact on me.  But lately, with so much concert footage coming out on DVD, including Blu-ray, I've been building up a collection.  It made sense to get something from Moore, and I went with this particular concert because of the strong reviews.  So I didn't come to this as a Moore fan, just a fan of guitar.Verdict?  The positive side is that Moore is definitely a great guitarist, with chops and passion galore.  But the negative side for me (it's subjective) is that I frankly find most of the songs to be rather simple and even boring.  While he was a great guitarist, I don't think he was a great composer, and that might help explain why he didn't achieve the acclaim of people like Hendrix, Page, Van Halen, Beck, etc.In contrast to this, I did find some footage online where Moore plays blues and Hendrix songs, and there he really shines.  So my conclusion is that, while this DVD may be great for Moore fans, people in my category may prefer his performances where he plays the music of others, several of which are apparently available on DVD.  Combining great songs with Moore's playing is definitely potent!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PILDNDYAF57C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FLD3H6#wasThisHelpful","R3PILDNDYAF57C","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have more than two decades of reasonably successful experience as a business owner, and never took any business courses in college.  I'm skeptical about the value of an MBA, but also curious about what it entails and what value it might have that I don't know about.  So when I came across this memoir about a journalist's experience as a student at HBS, perhaps the most elite business school in the world, I had to check it out.I wasn't disappointed, in fact I found it fascinating.  I still can't say what real educational value an HBS education might provide, but it was interesting to discover how intensely motivated and ambitious typical HBS students are, with making money being a high priority, thus many of them going into banking or consulting, despite knowing that the hours will be grueling and the work often soul crushing.In that regard, perhaps one of the major lessons of the book is the importance of balance in life.  Yes, one can make sacrifices in the short and intermediate terms in order to eventually gain financial freedom and balance in the long term, but the question will continue to arise of how much money is enough.  That threshold tends to keep going up, it can take longer than expected to reach that point, and many irreplaceable things (such as time with one's children) are often sacrificed on the path to get there.  The author had the maturity and wisdom to recognize this and not jump on the treadmill, making him somewhat of an atypical 'outsider' at HBS, but his values resonate with mine, so I was glad to hear the HBS experience described from his perspective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UWL0LBIU0G10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014311543X#wasThisHelpful","R2UWL0LBIU0G10","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book provides a big picture overview of big data.  The authors make a convincing case that our modern ability to quickly gather, store, and analyze vast amounts of data (including 'messy' data) opens up new vistas with regard to developing hypotheses and making predictions of how things work in the world.  Yes, the world is indeed changing because of big data, for better and worse, in ways that we can't fully forsee.This doesn't render more traditional scientific and analytical techniques obsolete (study of correlations won't replace study of causation), but does add something valuable to our tool kit.  This is particularly the case when dealing with complex systems which have many factors with nonlinear interactions, such that developing explicit and conceptually clear models of those systems is difficult or impossible, so we may need to be satisfied with knowing what 'works' without knowing 'why' it works.The book also provides many examples of business applications of the big data approach which I found interesting, though apparently other readers found them too repetitive.  And on a more philosophical note, the book also points out some of the perils of big data with regard to personal privacy and equitable functioning of free markets.What the book lacks is a description, even at an introductory level, of how big data analysis is actually performed.  I understand that the book is targeted at the general reader rather than established or would-be practitioners, but a gentle introduction to the basics of big data analysis, with clarification of how it differs from traditional statistical analysis, would have been nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124O30H8710ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3MZDDQ#wasThisHelpful","R124O30H8710ZQ","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The central idea of this book is that multi-millionaires typically become wealthy by focusing on their self-interest, particularly their financial interest, to a degree far greater than the middle class.  This attitude leads to behaviors such as:- Focusing on what they're interested in and good at (rather than trying to become well-rounded by improving areas of weakness)- Delegating what they're not good at to others (rather than trying to do everything themselves)- Having an equity share in their work (rather than strictly being hourly employees)- Doing work with good potential for making money (rather than just doing 'what they love')- Copying the ideas of others and executing them exceptionally well (rather than being a true innovator)- Negotiating for their own interest and letting others fend for themselves, including exploiting weaknesses of others and being prepared to walk away if the terms aren't favorable to them (rather than seeking win-win outcomes and compromising substantially)- Cultivating a small network of people in a good position to help them (rather than a large network of 'ordinary' people)- Using the investment capital of others (rather than putting their own money at risk)- Assertively asking for what they want (rather than just accepting whatever is offered to them)- Being persistent in the face of setbacks and failures (rather than giving up because failure is too painful)The author admits that this is all rather Machiavellian - you'll need to decide whether that bothers you.  Likewise, you'll need to decide how much of a factor wealth is in your definition of 'success', and I can certainly appreciate that a life focused on sincere personal relationships, meaningful work, contributing to society, preserving the natural environment, appreciating beauty, etc. could be more satisfying.  But if attaining wealth is the goal, my impression is that this is a credible book with genuine insights into how people typically attain it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHX6TT4TEFKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062253506#wasThisHelpful","R2LHX6TT4TEFKK","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't actually a huge Frampton fan back in his heyday, but I've rediscovered him in recent years and come to really appreciate him.  In this DVD, he looks like a balding and hunched old man, but his guitar playing is still full of chops, creativity, and soul, and his singing is quite good too.  This is in the context of good songs from start to finish, and a backing band which is tight and solid.  Another nice aspect is that, being an established senior musician, Frampton doesn't take himself too seriously and jokes around quite a bit.I've enjoyed this DVD and can recommend it, without reservations, to fans of Frampton, guitar, and/or classic rock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R232O4DH1RZKQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009DT98RK#wasThisHelpful","R232O4DH1RZKQ2","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of long, detailed, and articulate reviews here, so I'll keep mine short and note a few points:- This Blu-Ray DVD did a particularly good job of making me feel like I was at a concert, with the positive energy of the band and audience coming through really well.  Much of the credit goes to the excellent video and sound quality.- I like the set list and the arrangements.  Even if you have the prior Toto concert DVDs, this one is ""new"" enough and is worth getting.- With the continual changes in Toto's lineup, it seems to me that Steve Lukather is the heart of the band.  You can apparently replace anyone else in the band and it can still be Toto, but not so with Luke.Overall, for me, this is a great DVD, of a great performance, by a great band of great musicians, playing great songs for a great audience.

"This is a profound but somewhat depressing and rambling book on happiness written by clinical psychologist and social critic who has lived and worked in many countries around the world and draws on a variety of historical, intellectual, and scientific perspectives. I believe that the book is reasonably summarized by this paragraph from the preface:""I confess that, when I look around me, I do not see a very happy world.  This is despite the collective preoccupation with happiness, and with anything that can make people happier.  The majority of people still appear to be living in ways that are not conducive to happiness.  Some people will disagree with this view, pointing out that a high percentage of individuals still claim to be happy.  But in my mind, we were meant to be far more social, spiritual, loving, and intellectually engaged than we are being programmed to be by modern consumer culture.  This makes it very difficult to arrive at a meaningful state of happiness.""In other words, there are different kinds of happiness, some are better than others, and our individualistic, competitive, and materialistic Western cultures insidiously promote those which are ultimately less desirable.  The author also makes the related point that perhaps there can be such a thing as 'too much' happiness, reflecting overindulgence, imbalance, maladjustment, and masking underlying psychic turmoil/depression; instead, a sense of play, moderation, and motivation to keep striving may be preferable.I don't necessarily disagree with any of this, but my criticism of the book is that the author offers little in terms of practical suggestions to address this situation.  He doesn't quite claim that no one is genuinely happy at a sufficient level, so can't we learn something from those who've found a way to be appropriately happy in the world we live in today, including those in Western consumer cultures?  I wonder if the author is too oriented towards seeing the ""darkish"" side of things.Bottom line is that I do recommend this book because of its informative, insightful, and wide ranging exploration of the issue - hence 5 stars - but keep in mind that the book falls short with regard to positive suggestions, despite being peppered with ""happiness keys"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBMK1QG7CLLWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0275994562#wasThisHelpful","RBMK1QG7CLLWU","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't even a big Journey fan back in those days, but I was familiar with their music and liked them well enough.  Lately, I've been buying concert DVDs from different eras, including those good ol' days, and it made sense to include Journey, especially since their recent 'rebirth' with Arnel Pineda at center stage has caught my attention.  Well, the verdict is that I really like this DVD, the songs are great and the band performs them with an abundance of energy.  Some things that stood out for me:- The video quality isn't bad, and the sound quality is even better.  Quite acceptable for a concert of this vintage.- The stage show is pleasantly simple and pure, not even much change in lighting.  Just a bunch of great musicians wearing jeans and jumping around with enthusiasm as they play their music for a large live audience.- Steve Perry's voice sounds like it comes from heaven, absolutely soul-stirring.  Yes, Pineda is great too, hat's off to him, but Perry still has an extra something special.- To my ear, from today's vantage point, many of these older Journey songs have a strikingly operatic quality.  And of course, Perry's singing is a big part of that.- I was really impressed with Neal Schon's guitar playing (and I'm a guitarist myself), he's better than I remember.  He makes that guitar sing!Overall, a very enjoyable performance.

"I'll give this book 5 stars for what it is, but I don't suspect it will be a big seller.  The reason is that the book simultaneously aims to be a basic introduction to soil mechanics, while also being fairly sophisticated and delving into concepts and mathematics which you won't find in other introductory books.  That combination worked well for me as an experienced engineer wanting to both review the basics and deepen my understanding, but I think most undergraduates coming to soil mechanics for the first time would be overwhelmed by this treatment and thus better served by simpler books.  In short, this book is best suited for 'thinker' engineers who don't mind dealing with a lot of math - that doesn't describe the typical student or practitioner, but by all means read it if that describes you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127U44AG731KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521741327#wasThisHelpful","R127U44AG731KM","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a Rush fan for about 35 years, and because I grew up with Rush, I gravitate much more towards the older material which connects me to the many powerful memories of my youth.  From that standpoint, this 1984 concert is ideal, and Rush happened to be near their energetic and creative peak back then too.  As a result, I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and would say it's a must for any old-school Rush fan.  The drawbacks, noted by other reviewers, are that this isn't a full concert so it's somewhat short, there's no drum solo, and the camera work and video quality are merely tolerable (though the sound is pretty good), so I'll deduct a star for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R229SCPPD8SRMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MR8SN2#wasThisHelpful","R229SCPPD8SRMM","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though an edited collection of papers, the contributors and editors have done an excellent job of producing a coherent and well-integrated book on the topic of phronesis as professional knowledge.  A lot of effort and care clearly went into this book, it wasn't merely quickly slapped together.It's difficult to say quite what 'phronesis' is, but indeed a primary goal of the book is to explore that question in the context of the professions (medicine, engineering, etc.), and the book does so with relatively profound breadth and depth.  As a result, despite the writing quality being consistently very high, this book isn't an easy read, it will really make you think and reflect - which is a good thing - so come to the book with a (pragmatically) philosophical mindset.I plan to read the whole book again and will update this review with notes from the book after I've done that.

"This is a great book for anyone interested in sports performance.  The science is deep yet clearly explained, the examples are powerfully illustrative, and the book is an enjoyable read.The basic finding is that an individual's performance potential in each sport is largely determined by their particular genes, but not in a simple way.  For each sport, there are genetic predispositions for an individual's untrained performance, motivation to train, response to training, proneness to injury, recovery from injury, tolerance of pain, and maximum performance potential, and these genetic predispositions are partly shaped by evolutionary history and partly random.The practical implications of this are that each person has one or a few sports they'll do best in (find them through trial and error, evaluation of the individual's anatomy and physiology, and possibly genetic testing), will need to customize their training/rest regimen for their body and each sport, and has a relatively fixed upper limit to how well they can perform in each sport.  By definition, only a tiny fraction of the population has the potential to reach elite levels, and such people are more likely to come from some geographic regions as compared to others (and for the vast majority of sports, the best women won't be competitive with the best men).Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNUE1RQQX8UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591845114#wasThisHelpful","R3HNUE1RQQX8UF","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have no prior exposure to behavioral economics, this course provides a decent introduction.  The positives are that Huett is clear and organized, and the course includes most of the main ideas of behavioral economics (bounded rationality, satisificing, heuristics, biases, loss aversion, framing, precommitment, wisdom of diverse crowds, etc.).  But on the negative side, if you've had prior exposure to behavioral economics - as I have - you're likely to find this course somewhat boring and 'low yield' relative to the 12 hours it consumes, more oriented towards info of academic interest rather than focused on practical and interesting applications.

"This isn't the book I expected.  The blurb refers to ""the main way stations on James Reason's 40-year journey in pursuit of the nature and varieties of human error"" and a ""very personal perspective"", so I expected a memoir.  Instead, I'd say the book is about 10% memoir and the rest is a survey of thinking related to safety and failure, beginning with a focus on psychological aspects and gradually broadening out to encompass organizational, social, and systemic aspects.  This sequence happens to follow the chronological progression of Reason's thinking on these matters during his career, which also roughly parallels the thinking of the safety community in general during this period.  At ~125 pages, the book is short, but there's a lot of content packed into it, so it requires concentration and isn't a breezy read - the feel is more like a literature review (though there are few citations to the literature).  As such, I recommend this book primarily to those seeking an introductory overview of safety thinking or a synoptic review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5TY21LNSTZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472418417#wasThisHelpful","R2E5TY21LNSTZC","AW1493ZQTQ2ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1493ZQTQ2ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Season 1 introduced us to the sordid world of management consulting, and was very entertaining, though often implausibly over the top in various ways.  I just finished Season 2 and would say that it's equally entertaining, but it almost feels like a different show altogether, more about the people, less about screwing over clients.  The characters are mostly the same as Season 1, but they develop in different ways, generally becoming deeper, richer, emanating contradictions, more human.  It's good.To be more specific, the first two episodes made me feel like the series was going downhill to the extent that I almost wanted to bail, but episode 3 with Matt Damon is hilarious, and then the series just keeps changing from there, frequently in unpredictable and chaotic ways.  It's as though the writers are searching for something they can't quite put their finger on, so doing a lot of experimenting, but the result is fascinating and gripping.

There is also an AUX input to use as a wired speaker.The sound quality is unsurpassed, it sounds just as good as the big names brands, if not better, just minus the huge price. Higher prices do not always mean better quality, and this speaker proves it.I assumed there was only one speaker, upon further inspection, I found two of them. Also, there is a subwoofer in the middle that pours out the bass. Now I see how this small unit produces rich full sound.If you are looking for great a speaker, this one will impress any audiophile.

"This wireless charger is a great way to charge you phone minus the cord.I do not know about you, but I hate searching for a cord to charge my phone. Having this wireless charger makes charging much easier. This charging method will take more time than a standard wall charger. Most people charge their phones at night time, so this is not a deal breaker.First, you have to make sure your phone is Qi-Compliant (wireless charging capable). There are there options to choose from: your phone comes with wireless installed; you change your back cover to a wireless cover; or get a wireless patch that goes between the back cover and battery. Once you have chosen you wireless charging method, plug up the wireless charger and let the magic happen.Once you phone is placed on the charging pad, try to keep it centered on top of the charger. There is a status LED that will show the charge state, white for standby and a blinking blue for charging. Also, for best results remove the phone from case or it may make it harder to charge.The best part is the raised silicone pad that keeps your phone from moving while charging.I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29QRJ0AN8EG7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015F1L5XO#wasThisHelpful","R29QRJ0AN8EG7R","A18U49406IPPIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U49406IPPIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great way to remove those very noticeable scratches.If you are like me and live in an older house with all hardwood floors you will be have some accidents. Many of these scratches will come from normal wear and tear.After having a Labrador Retriever as family pet we noticed fine white scratches started to pop up throughout the house. When it was treat time he would get excited and dig his nails into the wooden floor to get his tasty treat.After cleaning and waxing the scratches would disappear for a week or so and magically reappear. Since receiving this scratch concealer I will able to break this cycle.Be sure to shake up the concealer before using to ensure everything is mixed up, much like you do with paint. Put a small bead on top of the scratch and rub it with the supplied cloth until the dry. Then open the curtains to allow it to cure in the sunlight, if no window is close by just use a lamp. For best results I used a damp rag to clean the scratch then allow to air dry.Granted this works as advertised to remove the white haze of a scratch and make it unnoticeable, but it will not make a scratch disappear. This magic concealer will fill in the void of the scratch and make it less visible to the naked eye.

Also, they will not chip like granite cubes.While washing them for the first time, I realized they are not solid which meant they would not make my glass much heavier.

After reading the instructions they go on like a piece of cake. Be sure to clean the screen with the supplied ""Wet"" and ""Dry"" wipes for the best results.

"This LED light is great night light for little ones.This light can be used in multiple ways, and definitely not a one trick pony. The LED lights themselves are pure white (bright white) and very crisp. There is opaque cover that allows the light to evenly spread out without blinding your eyes.Do not worry about having to turn the light on/off, there is an automatic motion detector that takes care of that for you. The detector will sense movement within fifteen feet, then the light will turn on. After thirty seconds of no activity it will turn off.Besides working in automatic mode, there is a switch to turn it ""On"". This will make the light stay on continuously. It also can be used as an emergency flashlight if needed.Once you have established a place that will best suit this light. Install four AA batteries (not included) and stick where you want it. There are two methods to mount the light, either velco pads or screws.

After putting the batteries in and turning it on, I saw how it would be quite useful.When out hunting, most if not all hunters will we some kind of camouflage. There are UV enhancers that are put into the fabric to enhance color and look of the garment. The UV puts the hunter at a disadvantage because the deer can see it.The best way to check you hunting gear is to check it with UV light.

"This speaker is big on sound and battery life.The design of the speaker has the standard rectangle shape, but that is where the similarities stop. The entire body has a hard rubber finish, which helps it accidental bumps and nicks. Having an IPX rating gives it the ability to withstand some water and dust.The sound quality is great with ample bass and treble, even sounds good at higher volumes without cracking or becoming distorted. For the small size of this speaker it easily fills a room with sound. This is accomplished with two font facing speakers for true stereo. Also, there is a rear facing subwoofer that pours out the bass.There are other great features such as the phone function, NFC pairing, and AUX port. Also, there is a Micro SD card slot, which comes in handy when you do not have a phone close by. When making phone calls the microphone makes clean crisp calls. The person on the other line could not even tell that I was not holding the phone next to my cheek.The best feature of this speaker is the huge 4000mAh battery. This is large enough to give you sixteen hours of your favorite tunes. Also, you can even charge you phone from the speaker, this is great when you phone is on its last leg of power.Since having this speaker I was able to get rid of all my other Bluetooth speakers.

Using it before the fire was lit it is just as good as the square one. After the food was done and the grill was still blazing hot, this is where the long handled model started to shine.Having a triple head design makes this different than your standard single version. On the up side, it gives you much more surface area to remove the charred meat remains.Since the handle is much longer, this puts more needed distance between you and the hot coals. The brush was much sturdier than expected considering it has eighteen inches of reach.

After paring them with my favorite vodka, it was as if the taste was enhanced due to the absence of water.These balls are just the right size and will accent any glass.

"This is a great way to charge you mobile devices with style of wood.Having five USB ports will give you the ability to charge many devices in one location. This charger uses a power brick, similar to the one used on a laptop.This is not favorable to some, but is a non-issue considering the number of charging ports. I find this to be a plus, it allows the charger to be easily set on a desk or nightstand. Plus being made from walnut wood makes it look great on any table.There are two type of charging ports, three are for mobile accessories or smaller phone. While the last two are power hungry devices like tablets or larger phones.By using this charger, I was able to clear my nightstand of any other. I have plenty of mobile devices like most of you out there, so that meant lots of different chargers next to the bed. Since receiving this charger, those days are over.I use this single charger on my Galaxy Tab 2, Galaxy Note 4, Bluetooth headset, Bluetooth speaker all at the same time, with one port to spare. Now all of my devices are all in one place being charged, which is much easier.This is a must have charger if you have multiple mobile devices!I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCN8LUKSHHUY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2FH49Q#wasThisHelpful","RCN8LUKSHHUY3","A18U49406IPPIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U49406IPPIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case is a great way to protect your iPhone.The design of this case is very straight forward, simplistic, but effective.The case is hard but flexible and made of TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane), which feels like hard plastic. It does a great job protecting the phone from scratches, bumps, and nicks. There are cutouts from the camera to the ringer switch.In the hand, the case is very light almost weightless. Once on the phone, everything is protected except the screen. This is where the supplied screen protect comes in handy. There is also a small raised edge on the front of the case so your phone can be placed faced down without scratching your screen.If you are looking for a case to protect your phone, give these a try.

"This flashlight will put a ton of light on any dark situation.When I received this flashlight, I assumed it would be just another flashlight. After putting the battery in and turning it on, I was blown away.To power the light use the supplied 18650 battery, and you will be good to go. I was able to use the flashlight for a week on the same battery. This flashlight is bright enough turn night into day.In the hand it has a nice solid feel and light weight, due to the aircraft aluminum. The size is just right, it will fit in small or large hands.This light is waterproof due to the o-rings used at all screwed connections. This is great for camping or fixing a leaking kitchen sink.Be warned, ""The Light Is Very Bright"". Please do not make the same mistake I did and look into the light, you will see stars.There are the four light modes: High (Too Bright), Medium (Super Bright), Low (Regular Flashlight), Moonlight (Very Soft).

"This battery pack is perfect for the outdoor type.Having a 5,000mAh battery places this battery pack in the lower range of battery packs. Inside is enough power to charge most cell phones multiple.

"This hard drive docking stations makes data transfer fast and easy.Upon opening the box, I was first surprised by the build quality of the docking station. The unit is made of plastic, but very solid.Since this docking station is USB 3.0, this makes for faster data transfer speeds. The USB 3.0 is backwards compatible with USB 2.0/1.1, just with reduced speeds.When I first went to insert a 3.5 inch hard drive, I thought I would have to remove the door that is used for the 2.5 inch hard drives.

"This is a great way to remove that stubborn salt stains.If you are like me and live where winter is brutal, there is a chance that you will get salt stains on your boots. This is not so bad when your boots are wet but when you go to put them on in the morning you see a white crusty stain.I tried to remove this with some water and a rag. This seemed to solve the problem until later in the day the boots had dried the stain reappeared just not as bad.After receiving this leather cleaner I was unsure this would totally remove the stains. One application with this cleaner all but a few heavily concentrated spots were free salt stain. With a quick second touch up the boots were totally clean.When cleaning your leather there will be some small suds this is normal. This cleaner will open the pores of the leather and remove all the salt and dirt.Since your leather is now cleaned be sure to protect it with a conditioner like Wild Bill's Leather Conditioner.

"This battery case will protect your phone and keep it charged.Having a 3500mAh battery made inside the case is perfect for your iPhone 6. This will keep your pockets free from carrying an external battery pack and save on weight. There is enough power to fully charge your phone with some juice left over.The design is very clean and simple, but very effective. The body is a hard rubber plastic mix which is very sleek, and just big enough to cover the phone. The case fits the phone nice and tight. Some say it is hard to remove the phone from the case, I see this as the case safely protecting the phone. To remove the phone simply pull from the back and front camera at the same time, it will easily slide out.The best part is the top cover that keeps the phone inside the case. Unlike most cases that just snap together and comes apart when dropped. The top cover has two hinged clips that hold it firmly together even is dropped.Since this case has a micro USB charging port, so this might not go over well for some, but not a deal breaker for me. There are four LED lights on the back that represent twenty five percent of battery life each. In order to use the battery, you must press and hold down the power button.

"An amazing list.  Great way to catch up on all the books you missed.  Out of the 25 New York Times Best Sellers I missed 18 which is a lot.  The other 7 contained a bunch of stuff I had missed or that really added to the story.This is a great deal for those looking to get up to date quickly or to get a feel for the book before you buy it.  These are quick and complete summaries but it will still last you a long time since there are so many.  Great value for the money and would recommend.You get a summary of the chapters with added insight as well as a look at major themes, symbols and plot.  The character section offered a great break down for easy reference.  I have a friend that is starting her own book club and this would be a great start to use for discussion questions and reference.

"Very well done and detailed guide.  After reading this great summary for The Devil in the White City I found that I missed a number of things.  I used it in my book club for reference and discussion questions.  I wasn't a huge fan of the original book. I thought Instareads did a better job of telling the story actually. This definitely helped me bring my A game to the book club since I was able to get more out of the book then I originally did.  Great for people wanting to read the book quickly or for book club needs.  I loved the section on symbols and themes.  It made the book much more meaningful. If your a fan of the original this will help you get more out of it for sure.

"Well written.  The story flows so fast and I had a blast reading it.  Ivy is an awesome character and you can feel her struggle and tension throughout the story. The story has some nice twists and turns that kept my interested throughout.  If you are into strong and interesting characters and a thriller/mystery type story-line this is a must read.  I loved the premise of Ivy being an investigator in a paranormal world where she can tell who is paranormal and who isn't.  There are some great sexual scenes that aren't over the top and are just right for my tastes.  The first book of what clearly will be a fantastic series.  I see the author also has another series starting and will be checking that out for sure.

"The Oregon Trail story comes up through life from time to time, but if your like me you don't really know all that much about it.

It gave insight into several things I missed and the symbols and themes section was awesome.  I read the original book as well and sometimes the writing got a bit slow and I was confused between Coates's internal conflict and the meaning.  Great book and I highly recommend it, but you need a companion book like this.There were a few things in the original book I didn't really agree with.

"One of the best books I have read in a long time.  What great insight into the Cold War era and everything going on around it.  Written by someone who was there.  I consider this a must read for anyone that was there, knows someone that was or is interested in the time.  Very informative and interesting.  It held my interest throughout. It's a moving tribute, story and the author makes history come to life.  Well done.

"Well written and poetic. The prose is stunning at times. Take a look at the ""look inside"" feature on Amazon to see. Demi is a dynamic character that you can relate to. Depressing tone but also with that comes hope.I also like the way the author writes. It's dialog heavy and flows fast. It builds the characters and scenes quickly. I really enjoyed it and found it to be one of the best books I have read in a long time. Well worth a read.

"Air Wick Scented Oil Air Freshener Vanilla Passion Refills smell wonderful and are a great value, especially on subscribe and save.I have 3 house dogs (a Dachshund, a Chihuahua, and a French Bulldog), but you would never know it unless you saw them. Air Wick Vanilla Passion Scented Oil Warmers are in large part responsible for that. They give my home a lovely, inviting, warm vanilla scent that is the first thing you smell when open the door. Perfect!I have one in each room of my home. I set the intensity dials at the midway point and they put out a nice fragrance that fills the room and they last about 2 weeks. I would never set mine past the halfway mark because it doesn't seem necessary or economical to do so as they only last about a week and a half at the higher settings. At the lower settings they will last around a month but the fragrance isn't noticeable enough for me at these settings.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE PRODUCT PACKAGING THAT YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:DIRECTIONS: 1. Unplug warmer. Remove empty bottle by gently pulling down from unit. Unscrew top from new bottle. 2. Insert fragrance bottle into warmer by pushing bottle up into device until click can be heard. 3. Plug warmer upright into outlet. Rotate plug if necessary. Unit will leak if plugged in sideways or upside down. When unplugged, keep unit upright. 4. To adjust fragrance intensity, rotate dial on top of warmer unit.

"I take Designs For Health Adrenal Complex for relief of adrenal fatigue and they work really well for me. I have tried various types of adrenal support products (see bottom of review) and I think Designs For Health Adrenal Complex is among the best and least expensive.Adrenal fatigue is caused by the adrenal glands being overworked due to stress, age, menopause, a hysterectomy, or other factors and can be diagnosed by testing a blood sample for inadequate levels of adrenal hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, steroids, cortisone and cortisol (which is known as the ""stress hormone"" because it is used by the body to combat stress). Low cortisol is the most common associated finding in blood testing for adrenal fatigue.I also take 5 mg pregnenolone and 5 mg DHEA (the precursors/parents of all the reproductive hormones including testosterone and estrogen). Pregnenolone and DHEA supplementation is especially important for women after menopause or a hysterectomy, when your adrenals (not your ovaries) become your primary hormone producer. Your ovaries produced not only estrogen and progesterone, but testosterone as well and insurance companies will only pay for women to have estrogen and progesterone replacement, not testosterone, and doctors don't prescribe it. A woman's adrenal glands do produce some testosterone, but they quickly become overworked trying to produce sufficient amounts after menopause or a hysterectomy and this often leads to adrenal fatigue. Both pregnenolone and DHEA can convert into the needed testosterone for women.I take one of each (Designs For Health Adrenal Complex, pregnenolone, and DHEA) Monday through Friday and take a break from them on Saturday and Sunday (known as a ""hormone holiday"") because it keeps the body and adrenal glands from becoming too reliant on these supplements and reduces any risks associated with taking them. Some people take one of each per day for 3 weeks and then take a week off. I also take a good one a day multivitamin and mineral.HERE ARE SOME SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ADRENAL FATIGUE:*Fatigue, lethargy, lack of energy; feeling tired for no reason*Body aches*Mild depression*Unexplained weight loss*Weight gain, especially around the middle, that you are unable to lose*Low blood pressure or Hypoglycemia*Lightheadedness when you get up from lying down*Unexplained hair loss*Reduced sex drive*Decreased ablility to remember things or concentrate*Pain in upper back or neck*Decreased ability to deal with stress*Nervousness, shaking, trembling or palpitations*Feeling better when removed from cause of stress, as when on a vacation*Difficulty getting up in the mornings*Needing coffee or caffeinated beverage to get going in the morning*Low energy in the mornings and in the afternoon between 3 to 5 pm*Feeling better for a short period after a meal*Feeling tired from 9 - 10 pm, but not wanting to go to bed*Craving salty, fatty, and high protein food such as meat and cheese*Craving sweet snacks*Food and or inhalant allergies*Dry and thin skin*Indigestion, constipation or diarrhea*In women, increased symptoms of PMS followed by heavy flow periods that stop, or nearly stop on the 4th day, only to start again on the 5th or 6th day.*Frequent respiratory illnesses (infections, bronchitis, etc.) that last longer than normal.OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO ALONG WITH TAKING Designs For Health Adrenal Complex THAT WILL ALSO HELP WITH ADRENAL FATIGUE:*Go to sleep by 10 p.m. and sleep until 9:00 a.m.*Do things you enjoy and laugh at least twice a day*Avoid coffee and caffeinated beverages*Always eat breakfast and eat early*Drink a glass of water with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt in the morning*Avoid grains/bread*Avoid sweets and sugary fruits*Avoid starchy foods like potatoes*Avoid trans-fats such as french fries*Take vitamin C, pantothenic acid, magnesium, and vitamin E*Take 5mg pregnenolone and 5mg DHEA, as needed. NOTE: High dosages of DHEA and pregnenolone (generally more than 10 mg) can cause heart palpitations (feeling like your heart is racing) and irregular beats in some users.*Avoid over-exerting yourselfCONTINUED FROM TOP OF REVIEW:Adrenal support products that are made from plant extracts/vitamins are the least effective in my experience.Other adrenal support products contain whole adrenal gland extracts OR adrenal cortex extracts (or a combination of both like Designs For Health Adrenal Complex) from cows, pigs, and sheep. Both types work well for me and I often rotate my use of them.Glandular type support products are fewer and farther between than the plant extracts/vitamins type, but  I have found at least 3 glandular type products that I like and that work well for me and I purchase whichever is available with the lowest price at the time of purchase. But read the packaging/product information and make sure that the glandular materials used in these products are freeze dried and were obtained from certified BSE-free (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy a.k.a. Mad Cow Disease) countries. Designs For Health Adrenal Complex meets both of these requirements, and in my opinion, is safe to use.The hormones released by the adrenal cortex (outer part of the adrenal gland) are necessary for life while those released by the adrenal medulla (inner part of the adrenal gland) are not.Five classes of steroid hormones, are produced in the adrenal cortex:1) glucocorticoids (corticosteroids involved in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism, and having anti-inflammatory properties; includes cortisol, corticosterone, cortodoxone, and cortisone)2) mineralocorticoids (corticosteroids that regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in the body; includes aldosterone)3) progestins (progesterone)4) androgens (androstenedione, DHEA or Dehydroepiandrosterone, and testosterone)5) estrogens (includes estradiol, estrone, and estriol)The adrenal medulla (inner part of the adrenal gland) releases the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline which are responsible for the fight or flight response. When we find ourselves in a stressful situation, adrenaline, along with noradrenaline, are largely responsible for the immediate reactions we feel, including increased heart rate, a surge of energy (which you might need to either run away from a dangerous situation, or fend off an attacker) and focused attention.Some people might experience increased heart rate/energy surges while taking adrenal support supplements containing whole gland extracts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJY7KII3166WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JB2I2Y4#wasThisHelpful","RJY7KII3166WH","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have regularly color treated hair that is thick, wavy, and prone to frizziness and I use Hask Argan Oil hair products to keep my hair looking its best. I use the Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and its companion conditioner and then twice a month or more I use this Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Intense Deep Conditioning Hair Treatment in place of the repairing conditioner because it gives an added boost of hydration and strength to dry, damaged, chemically treated or over-processed hair.Here is why I love Hask Argan Oil hair products:1) They are made with Moroccan Argan Oil obtained from the pressed seeds of argan fruit which grows from Moroccan Argan trees. This oil is vitamin and mineral rich and contains an unusually high concentration of Vitamin E and carotenes (a form of Vitamin A), both of which are necessary for healthy skin and hair. It is rapidly absorbed by hair, nourishing it and hydrating it and sealing in moisture by forming a non-evaporating layer around it. This smooths hair and prevents frizziness caused by humid conditions/weather. It also strengthens hair and promotes elasticity, preventing cuticle damage (split ends) and breakage while repairing existing damage.2) They also contain Keratin (the key structural component of hair) and Panthenol (a derivative of vitamin B5) which smooths and straightens hair and adds gloss and shine.3) They are ideal for dry, damaged, or color treated hair and they do a wonderful job of taming and smoothing my thick, wavy, color treated hair that is prone to frizziness and keeping me frizz free even in high humidity. And I can straighten my hair while blow drying it by using a Conair Professional Round Brush to grasp my hair at the root (with the brush underneath the hair and the hair on top of brush) and while carrying the brush through my hair from root to tip, I follow above the hair with my blow dryer. This dries my hair while straightening it at the same time and there is no need to use a flat iron which might further damage my hair. The end result is soft, straight, smooth, shiny, run your fingers through it hair.4) They have a fresh, clean, crisp, citrus scent and contain no sulfates or parabens.5) They are made in the USA which I always appreciate.6) Because Moroccan Argan Oil is one of the rarest oils in the world, most shampoos, conditioners and hair treatments that contain it are costly, but Hask Argan Oil from Morocco hair products are very affordable.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:DIRECTIONS (Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Intense Deep Conditioning Hair Treatment): Apply a generous amount of Argan Oil Intense Deep Conditioning Treatment to clean, wet hair.

In fact, the label says it is “ideal for dry, damaged, or color treated hair.”6) They are made in the USA which I always appreciate.7) Because Moroccan Argan Oil is one of the rarest oils in the world, most shampoos, conditioners and hair treatments that contain it are costly, but Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner are very affordable.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:INGREDIENTS (Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo): Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocomidropropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA, Glycerin, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Argania Spinosa Kernal Oil (Argan Oil), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Hydrolized Keratin, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolized Soy Protein, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Distearate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Decyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Phenxyethanol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7.INGREDIENTS (Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Conditioner): Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Argania Spinosa Kernal Oil (Argan Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Hydrolized Keratin, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolized Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearyl Alcohol, Dimethiconol, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Fragrance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YSD8MYNFAV6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP3VUG4#wasThisHelpful","R2YSD8MYNFAV6T","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I needed a clock with a larger display than the one we were currently using for our living area. We have had good luck with Westclox in the past and this new Westclox LED alarm clock fit the bill perfectly. It was affordable, it is easy to use, and has a large display that can be seen from anywhere in the room. The numbers on the display are about 1 and 3/4 inches tall. They are red in color and they are bright, but not overly bright.The overall dimensions of the clock itself are: 3 and 1/8 inches tall; 3 and 1/8 inches deep from front to back; and 6 and 1/4 inches long from one side to the other.The buttons to set the time and the alarm are conveniently located at the front bottom of the clock. There is a switch on the back to turn the alarm on and off. When the alarm is on there is an indicator light that will be lit on the display. There is also an indicator light for PM that is off in the AM.There is a snooze button on the top of the clock and when pressed it will silence the alarm for 9 minutes and then the alarm will resume. My husband and I had no need for the alarm or snooze feature since we are using the clock in our living area, but for anyone who needs these features, they work well and the alarm is loud enough.We really like the battery back up (one 9 volt alkaline battery, not included) in case of a power outage. The battery compartment is located on the bottom of the clock.The clock comes with a one year limited warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship. You can send the clock  within a year of purchase to the repair center at NYL Holdings LLC in Fort Lauderdale, FL for repair or replacement. You must include a proof of purchase, either the original receipt or a photocopy, your return address, and a check or money order for $6.95 to cover the cost of shipping and handling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBJO5SYSJHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001K1WFII#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBJO5SYSJHS","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just love this cute Boston Terrier and French Bulldog magnet featuring a reproduction of a painting by Louis Agassiz Fuertes. I have it on my my refrigerator. It looks great and the magnet is very strong. It should stay in place on whatever you place it on. It measures 2 and 1/8 inches tall by 3 and 1/8 inches wide. The magnet's artwork has a clear protective covering and it can be wiped/cleaned without damaging the artwork if it is ever necessary.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:About the Artist: Louis Agassiz Fuertes (1874-1927) was an American ornithologist and illustrator. Fuertes decided to concentrate on painting birds as a career after meeting Elliott Coues in 1894 while on a trip to Washington, D.C. with the Cornell University Glee Club. He travelled to many countries in pursuit of birds, including Canada, Mexico, Jamaica and Ethiopia. And, in 1899, he accompanied E. H. Harriman on his famous exploration of the Alaska coastline. He lectured on ornithology at Cornell University from 1923, and the libraries there hold extensive collections of his artwork and personal papers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9OZFTDE95JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009UZ7VKS#wasThisHelpful","R1C9OZFTDE95JM","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a BIG fan of white musk frangrances. Noa, Eau de Toilette, by Cacharel is one of my favorites. It smells divine (more about the scent later) and can be worn for any occasion.

And most importantly for me, my husband loves it on me.You may want to reapply it mid-day (I sometimes do) since it is an Eau de Toilette and is less concentrated/has less fragrance oils than Eau de parfum or perfume.As for the scent, it is a very soft, warm, feminine scent with top notes of white musk, peony, freesia, and peach skin, and middle notes of lily, ylang - ylang, and rose, and a woodsy base with touches of incense and coffee.

"I really like the Zyliss slotted turner, so much so that I bought an extra one. If you are looking for a good turner/spatula, I highly recommend this one.Here are the things that I think make this a great turner/spatula:1) The shape and style of the handle makes it comfortable and easy to hold and use, plus the handle has a hole for hanging the turner near your cook-stove or grill.2) ¾ inch of the edge of the turner is tapered silicone and it slides easily under eggs or whatever you are turning and is heat safe to 500 degrees Fahrenheit so it won't melt.  And it doesn't scratch the non-stick coating on my cookware and doesn't leave anything behind in the food as I have unfortunately experienced with other turners/spatulas that left tiny flakes or pieces of whatever they were made of in my food.3) The remaining length of the Zyliss slotted turner is made of sturdy nylon that can better support the weight of whatever you are turning. The nylon is also heat resistant to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.4) The turner is slotted so that excess liquid or grease can drain off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R345FROCZ3P1BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018I8Q1I#wasThisHelpful","R345FROCZ3P1BT","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own several of these H.B. Smith Tools WDX77 High Pressure Hose Nozzles. They do spray with more pressure than a regular garden hose spray nozzle, but will not turn your garden hose into a pressure washer. But I still love them and here is why:1) They are well constructed and don't leak.2) The handle is wrapped in soft foam, is comfortable to hold, and requires no pressure or squeezing to operate because the water is turned on and off with a handle.3) They do a great job of cleaning off my patios.4) They are great for washing our cars and truck.5) The wide fan spray nozzle is great for watering the garden when held high above it.6) The wand fits nicely inside the entrance holes of my Martin Gourds when cleaning and rinsing out the insides of them.7) I much prefer these to regular garden hose spray nozzles because they function better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R265Y65DV5TQ93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RGN8OS#wasThisHelpful","R265Y65DV5TQ93","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like these stainless steel pet ID tags. For me, the medium size has sufficient room for names and contact information and is also a good size for all of my dogs to wear (2 Dachshunds, a Chihuahua, and a French Bulldog). These tags are superior to others I have ordered in the past because:1) They are made with stainless steel and the hole for hanging the tag is reinforced making them more durable and longer lasting.2) The names and contact info are stamped into the stainless steel with deep die-stamping and then filled in with black enamel which makes the information easier to read if my dogs are ever lost and found by someone. And the deep die-stamping ensures that the names and contact information won't wear off as I have experienced with other tags on which the information was only lightly etched.3) These tags have a reflector on one side which will make my dogs easier to spot for motorists if, God forbid, they should ever be lost at night and end up in or near a roadway.4) They come with a split ring for attachment to the D-ring of my dog's collars.5) They are high quality and yet very affordable.The picture for the listing shows the pet's name on the first line, the owner's name on the second line, street address on the third line, city and state on the fourth line, and phone number on the fifth line.

It does not leach like some plastics and it DOES NOT contain BPA (or Bisphenol A, a synthetic compound used to make certain plastics and epoxy resins that has been proven to cause negative health effects in animal studies). Polypropylene is also used to make baby bottles and medicine bottles and is safe for use with hot liquids because it has a high melting point.The pitcher is 10 "" tall, 6 ½"" in circumference at the top, 5 ½"" at the bottom, and 9"" across from the tip of the pouring spout to the edge of the handle.

They have 1.75"" of room between the glass front and the backboard and I have used them to display the following:*A picture of my Grandmother with a short bio alongside one of her crocheted doilies and her antique ruby and diamond ring.*A picture of my Grandfather with a short bio and a song he often played alongside his banjo pick and antique smoking pipe.*A picture of my Great-Grandmother with a short bio alongside an antique place setting from her silverware and one of her antique monogrammed napkins.*Two of the shadow boxes hold a collection of Native American carvings and bead-work.I did not use the velcro system to secure my treasured items because I did not want to place adhesive velcro on them. Also, for the backgroud, I chose a color and/or pattern of acid free scrapbook paper appropriate for my items and cut it to the same dimensions as the backboard by tracing around the backboard with a pencil on my paper. Then I hot-glued the paper to the existing backboard. To secure the items to the backboard, I used pipe cleaners which are strong, but soft and won't damage my items. If you decide to use pipe cleaners to secure your items, I suggest using colors that are as close to the color of the items or the background as you can find so that the pipe cleaners blend in and don't stand out.HOW I USED PIPE CLEANERS TO SECURE MY TREASURED ITEMS: The pipe cleaners were threaded through from the back of the backboard through holes I pre-drilled and then over and around the items and back down through a hole on the other side of the items and out the back again. I then twisted the two ends together behind the backboard and taped them over with clear packing tape to hold them down flat and keep them secure (these twisted ends get covered/hidden later in the process). Before drilling the holes I first placed the items in the order I wanted them on the backing, then decided where the best areas to secure them were (you may want to fasten down an item in more than one area), and then used a pencil to mark the spots on the paper (on either side of the items) to drill, and then removed the items and drilled the small holes. Once the holes are drilled, put the items back in place and start fastening them down with the pipe cleaners.For the pictures and bios, I used double-sided tape to secure them to an appropriate size piece of foam board and then hot-glued the foam board to the backing so that they would stand off the backing somewhat.I also taped a large envelope across the backside of the shadow box that contained additional information about the items, and in the case of family heirlooms, a family tree which showed the direct line of descent from my earliest known ancestor to my Grandparents to me. This envelope also conceals the twisted together, taped down ends of the pipe cleaners.Once finished, these shadow boxes looked very professional and I have never had an item fall or shift position inside them. Everything is very secure with the pipe cleaners holding them in place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI58A21SJBC9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OCFPAA#wasThisHelpful","RI58A21SJBC9O","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Febreze Noticeables oil warmer was an ingenious idea. It is two oil warmers in one unit and it uses fragrance refills that are two chambered and filled with two similar fragrances side by side.  The warmer alternates between the two fragrances so that when your nose gets used to one fragrance and it becomes less noticeable, the warmer then switches to the other fragrance and you once again notice a pleasant scent coming from the warmer. The Vanilla Starlight & Moonlight Vanilla fragrance refill is my favorite of all the scents. Both vanilla fragrances are very soothing and they have a good throw and fill a space nicely.You can adjust the fragrance intensity from low to high with a switch on the back of the warmer to suit your own tastes. Each fragrance refill lasts 30 days left on high intensity (or longer if left on low). I have mine on high. I use subscribe and save so I get new refills monthly from Amazon. They are delivered to my doorstep with my other subscribe and save items and I get 15% off of the price. I love it.My  warmers stay in my outlets snugly. But for anyone who has a problem with theirs not staying in, you probably need new outlets. If an outlet is worn out, plugs will easily come out of them. You want an outlet with good tension so that your plugs have a snug fit and good connection. GFI's are generally tighter than other outlets.There is actually a tool (Woodhead Receptacle Tension Tester) used to test outlets for proper tension. But if things are falling out of your outlets then it is probably a safe bet that you need new ones and you probably don't need an expensive tool to tell you that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACRE5L39H6G6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048BGUN8#wasThisHelpful","R1ACRE5L39H6G6","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Scotch-Brite No Scratch Scouring Pads are not only great for cleaning non-stick pans, they are also great for cleaning calcium buildup and hard water stains from around faucets and for cleaning soap scum off of shower stalls and bathtubs. Here's how:For cleaning faucets, just dip an appropriate length of coiled cotton in vinegar and then place it around the faucet on top of the buildup. If there is calcium buildup and/or hard water stains in the sink as well, soak paper towels in vinegar and place those in layers over the buildup. Let the soaked cotton and/or paper towels set for at least two hours, but the longer the better. The vinegar loosens and breaks up the buildup. Later,  remove the cotton and/or paper towels and take a Scotch-Brite No Scratch Scouring Pad and use it to remove the loosened buildup. Then just wipe the faucet and/or sink clean with a wet paper towel and dry it with a dry one.For cleaning shower stalls and bathtubs, I first spray on some Kaboom Shower Tub & Tile Cleaner and leave it on for 1 to 3 minutes and although the product directions say ""wipe and rinse"" and repeat as necessary, instead of wiping it I always go over it with a Scotch-Brite No Scratch scouring pad which usually takes the soap scum off easily after only one application. Then I just rinse it all clean. Works like a charm!I always wear latex gloves and cover my mouth and nose when I use Kaboom Shower Tub & Tile Cleaner because it contains Glycolic Acid as a cleaning agent (as well as citric acid). These acidic properties are needed to break up the soap scum but can be irritating to the nose and throat, and also the skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10DHBRMOVFJ4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KYVSGU#wasThisHelpful","R10DHBRMOVFJ4V","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this InterDesign Kitchen Storage Egg Holder and have two of them side by side on the middle shelf of my refrigerator. They are very sturdy and are made of thick PET (a.k.a. polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic resin that is transparent, strong, shatter-resistant, recyclable and SAFE for food storage) that does not contain BPA (a.k.a. Bisphenol A, a synthetic compound used to make certain plastics and epoxy resins that has been proven to cause negative health effects in animal studies). Many food and beverage products are packaged in containers made of PET.It holds 21 eggs. I use mine to store extra large store bought eggs, but they will accommodate Jumbo size eggs, too.The lid on the container is great because you can store things on top of them, unlike the paper or styrofoam cartons from the store. I keep a tub of margarine and some bologna or bacon in a zip lock bag on top of one of my containers so I can just slide the whole thing out and have everything I need for breakfast in the morning. And the handle on the front of the container makes it easy to grab the container and slide it out when needed.HERE IS SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TIPS THAT YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL WITH THIS EGG STORAGE CONTAINER:1) Remember to clean the InterDesign egg storage container (in a sink of warm water and dish detergent to which you can add a teaspoon of bleach to sanitize the container) each time you empty it before refilling it with fresh eggs, or you might contaminate the new eggs. Eggshells are washed and sanitized before being packed in the paper or styrofoam carton that they come packaged in at the supermarket. You should discard any eggs that have become unclean, cracked, broken or are leaking.2) Eggs should be stored in the InterDesign egg storage container with the small end down to keep the air cell stable and also because the eggs are easier to remove from the container when stored this way. What is an air cell? After an egg is laid an air cell forms in the larger end of the egg as the egg cools. As the egg ages, evaporation through the pores of the eggshell causes this air cell to grow larger. In a fresh egg, the air cell is small, not more than 1/8 inch deep. Because of this, when placed intact in a bowl of water, fresh eggs will lay on their sides at the bottom. Once an egg is about a week old it will sit at the bottom of a bowl of water with the larger end bobbing slightly. At about three weeks old, an egg will stand on its small end in the bottom of a bowl of water with its larger end reaching for the top. When an egg floats on the surface of the water it is bad and should not be consumed. Also, when you crack open a bad egg the yolk will be flatter and the egg white will appear runny, almost like water, and you might notice an odor or discoloration.3) Remember to save the expiration date from the original paper or styrofoam egg carton. You can snip it off with a pair of scissors and place it inside the InterDesign egg storage container, or just write the date on a small piece of paper and place that inside the container to give you an idea of the eggs' freshness.4) Store eggs in the main section of the refrigerator to keep them at a steady 35F to 40F; Temperatures in the door of the refrigerator tend to be warmer and eggs should not be stored there. If collected and stored properly, eggs can have a shelf life of about four weeks.5) Never store eggs near or with materials that have an odor (fish, onions, etc.) because eggshells are porous and can absorb odors (and also liquids) and it can affect the taste and smell of the eggs when cooked.6) Eggs should not stand for more than 20 minutes at room temperature before cooking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37FYICMID91NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYUMB4O#wasThisHelpful","R37FYICMID91NC","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mini measuring cup is made in the USA (by Anchor Hocking in Lancaster Ohio), which I always appreciate, and its size and measurement markings make it great for use in making mixed drinks.My only qualm is that the markings will come off the glass without special care. The glass even comes with a sticker on the bottom that reads ""Dishwasher Safe, some detergents may remove the decoration and result in etching of the glass"".I have NEVER put mine through the dishwasher because other reviewers say it drastically shortens the life of the markings and in some cases the markings have been washed away completely after one cycle through the dishwasher. For this reason I only hand wash mine with a mild dish detergent and then rinse it under the kitchen faucet and leave it on a dish towel or in the dish drainer to dry, which is fairly quick and easy to do, BUT I still wish that Anchor Hocking Company would have applied the measurement markings to this glass in the same manner as they do on their regular size measuring cups. I have owned several of those for years and have never had to worry about any special care in order to keep the markings from coming off the glass.This mini measuring cup measures in the following increments:ml: 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 135, 150Tbsp: 1 through 10Tsp/cup: 3, 6, 9,  cup, 15, 18, 21, ½ cup, 27, 30oz.:  .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5I will share with you a few of my favorite single serving drink recipes that I use this Mini Measuring cup for that taste great and also won't break the bank.PERFECT MARGARITA1 oz el Jimador Tequila Blanco (100% agave)½ oz Bols Triple Sec½ oz regular Budweiser Beer¾ oz Frozen Limeade Concentrate (thawed)¼ oz Orange Juice1 ¼ oz waterPour over ice, crushed ice, or shaved ice in a margarita glass and garnish with a lime wedge if desired.

"Moore's Marinade is a family favorite on steaks, hamburgers, and pork tenderloins/chops. The hickory smoke flavor tastes great not only when grilling meat outdoors, but it also makes meat cooked in a skillet indoors taste like it was cooked on the grill outdoors. I love it. AND it contains no MSG (monosodium glutamate; a flavor preservative that many people have or develop allergies to).If time allows, I will marinate meats for 10-30 minutes before cooking, but in a pinch I have just poured some marinade in a shallow bowl and dipped the meats in it saturating both sides and then cooked it. It always tastes great either way.I really appreciate that Moore's Marinade is MADE IN THE USA (by C&M Food Distributing, Inc. in Birmingham, Alabama). It was introduced in Alabama over 40 years ago.TIPS TO GRILL THE PERFECT STEAK USING MOORE'S MARINADE:1) Marinate beef in Moore's Marinade 30 minutes to 1 hour prior to grilling.

I and my family absolutely love this product AND it contains NO MSG (monosodium glutamate; a flavor preservative that many people have or develop allergies to) like many seasonings do.You can use it on hamburgers, pastas, rice and vegetables, HOWEVER, my absolute favorite use for it is for seasoning tilapia fish filets.I just sprinkle it on both sides of the tilapia filets generously and cook them in a skillet with a little olive oil and Voila! Magnific! Family and friends love it and always ask what seasonings I used.I am sure that McCormick has acquired many new customers due to those tilapia filets!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LXTNQZBN45AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NNSCBS#wasThisHelpful","R3LXTNQZBN45AC","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mini measuring glass is perfect for use as a jigger for mixed drinks. Mine did not come with the Sunleaves logo on it like the picture shows, but instead reads Mini Measure. It measures in teaspoons (1 to 6), Tablespoons (½, 1, 1½, 2), Ounces (¼, ½, ¾, 1) and milliliter (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30). It has bold, thick, red lettering that doesn't wash off when hand washed and rinsed. I have not and won't put mine through the dishwasher although it seems that other reviewers have and it hasn't been an issue for them. I personally would rather not take the chance when I can so quickly and easily wash/rinse it under the kitchen faucet.Here are a few of my favorite single serving drink recipes that I use this Mini Measuring cup for that taste great but don't break the bank.PERFECT MARGARITA1 oz el Jimador Tequila Blanco (100% agave)½ oz Bols Triple Sec½ oz regular Budweiser Beer¾ oz Frozen Limeade Concentrate (thawed)¼ oz Orange Juice1 ¼ oz waterPour over ice, crushed ice, or shaved ice in a margarita glass and garnish with a lime wedge if desired. Also, if you are serving guests, you can make a larger batch by changing the oz in the recipe to cup and using a regular sized measuring cup.PINK POTAMUS2 oz Svedka Vodka3 oz Dekuyper Peachtree Peach Schnapps3 oz Cranberry Juice CocktailAdd ingredients to an ice filled cocktail shaker, shake, strain and pour. This cocktail fits perfectly in a Libbey Vina 12 oz Martini Glass and can be garnished with a lime wedge if desired.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YLXX9KLFNMA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087HWA60#wasThisHelpful","R2YLXX9KLFNMA0","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Regular use of flea and tick preventatives is extremely important for dogs and other pets and especially for those with flea allergies, like my Dachshund.Preventative measures for my dogs include treating my yard with these ORTHO Bug-B-Gon MAX Insect Killer for Lawns, granules, in the spring. One treatment lasts throughout the spring and summer months for me (I live in South East USA). Just follow the product directions for pet owners. Spray the yard heavily with a garden hose to soak the granules in and then allow the yard to dry completely before letting your pets on it. This means keeping them off the treated areas for at least a day.I also give my dogs Capstar (Nitenpyram) after they have been anywhere away from home (the park, etc.) to kill any fleas which they might have picked up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DG2EKW0JFP0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KL7458#wasThisHelpful","R2DG2EKW0JFP0M","AS3UM0LHN7L1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS3UM0LHN7L1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
