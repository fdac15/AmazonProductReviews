"Terrific looking black and silver tape measure. Locks automatically. Interesting rounded rubberized body with a thoughtful rubberized bottom so you don't scratch what you're measuring. Surprisingly lightweight, especially considering how robust the return spring strength is. Very comfortable to hold. Overall a very smart tape measure design, very impressive. The big belt clip on the back is a great idea, too. The nicest tape measure design I've seen in a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRI6GT7K7HGVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX4KFX0#wasThisHelpful","RRI6GT7K7HGVY","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After consulting with my teenage granola bar evaluation committee, this isn't much different than the other bars with chocolate and sea salt. Kind of crumbly, more like a  wafer than a granola bar.

"Impossibly strong fruit flavors, like tidal waves. And Heaven help you if you combine two or more flavors in the same handful. INSANELY strong flavors. I actually enjoyed the lemon/grapefruit flavors. Chewy, even moreso than caramel. You'lll give your jaws a workout. The other flavors I could identify included grapefruit, apple and cherry. ALL of them intensely strong, like nothing you've ever tasted before.The downside is that I'm expecting a terrible HFCS stomachache tomorrow morning about three. I hope it doesn't happen, but I'd be surprised if it didn't.Incredibly strong flavors.

"Great tongs -- I noticed today that these are LARGER than the no-name tongs you may find at  your local market, and also the handles are larger, making them much easier to grasp and manipulate (I have large hands).

"Clever and substantial pop-up box made of heavy cardboard covered with a textured plastic on the exterior. The interior is black. There are four metal bosses (?) on each of the bottom corners of the lid. The box I'm looking at is 10.5 x 10.5 x 5, which is fairly large, but not large enough to store piece of standard North American paper. They make other boxes that will hold letter and even legal size documents. Or they suggest you might use this as a reusable gift box. It does look nice and seems like it would last a long time. Not crushable. Tight fitting lid to keep dust out. These boxes can apparently be stacked. Clever storage solution, better than plastic, looks rather regal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234A4DG76O66U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRDN0R0#wasThisHelpful","R234A4DG76O66U","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very good training table tennis balls. Looking back at my purchases of Champion and Stiga three-star balls over the years, the seamless construction is definitely worth looking for, more predictable and repeatable trajectory and no funny bounces like table tennis balls with seams can sometimes produce.  These are apparently meant to be used with an ""iPong"" table tennis practice machine which I hadn't heard of up to today. We have a Kettler indoor table tennis set and use Stiga paddles. A decent table tennis ball makes an enormous difference, and these look pretty good. Very smooth surface, unusually so. Very nice orderly presentation in a wide, flat box with a plastic insert with dimples to hold each ball. We've purchased those 144-ball one-star practice balls in the past and they're just not worth playing with. These aren't particularly cheap, but you get what you pay for, and these are as good as any other three-star balls we've played with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F2DG7CTN2FP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4OO398#wasThisHelpful","R3F2DG7CTN2FP5","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Delightful measuring spoons. Bright colors, nicely designed.

"Easy to assemble, relatively lightweight. The only issues during assembly were some rather murky photographs (their small size didn't help much) and a stubborn piece of tape over a metal tab that cuts the string to length. Reasonably well balanced. I do not miss the feeble but large battery on my old B&D string trimmer! Cordless? Never again!I borrowed a new, long extension cord I'd purchased to use with a leaf blower, got that untangled and headed out to do battle with my newly-overseeded lawn, which was in need of a haircut. WHOA! Lots of power! This is not a cordless trimmer, and the amount of power tells you that right away. This GH900 easily decimated all the edges of my tiny lawn area and trimmed the shoots coming up from the older lawn. Fast and easy. You can make this into an edger by rotating the business end of the device. There's an amusing little WHEEL attached to the GH900 which I gather allows it to roll and trim along sidwalks or walkways.I was done in no time! I hope this thing holds up. It wasn't terribly expensive and it did a great job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ILHNXD31MB2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH4K6RE#wasThisHelpful","R1ILHNXD31MB2T","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful pump containers full of six different fragrances, almond (sophisticated and subtle), blueberry parfait (sweet), cherry blossom (delightful), cherry pie (sweet smelling), mango ice cream (nice) and olive oil.

"Title: Coyote's CutieSeries: Confessions of a Mail Order BrideDesignation: Book Three, Standalone Novella, NO CliffhangerGenre: BBW Paranormal RomanceAuthor: Kate KentReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE HEARTWARMING STARS *****Yowza!! Kate Kent has outdone herself - again! She's really kicked up the heat with Coyote's Cutie, the third novella in her heartwarming new series, Confessions of a Mail Order Bride and it's quite the  sweet treat! The story is delightfully cute, deliciously sweet, completely unique and oh so romantic! The narrative is well written in the first person from our heroine's point of view which stands to reason since this series is entitled Confessions of a Mail Order Bride. The dialogue is smart, well executed and flows effortlessly. And as are all Kate's books, it is well developed, well crafted and well edited. Of course, my favorite part of all Kate's stories is a toss up between the sexy, engaging characters and the special worlds she always creates for us. And in this series, we get a brand new town, Shifter Villages which is filled with special hangouts and a variety of hunky, handsome shifters! Hubba! Hubba! So, I feel sure she'll have several that will tickle your fancy! Buckle up my lovelies! Let's go visit Shifter Villages!Marcie Shore has never had an easy life. Her mother died when she was only six and as a result her father became a bitter, violent alcoholic. At sixteen, she quit school and ran away from home. It's a dangerous world for a teenage girl but the first traveler to offer her a ride was a shifter who thankfully gave her a lift to Shifter Villages, a community of shape shifters where she decided to put down roots, at least for a while. She desperately needed a job so she could save enough money to buy a car but who would hire a young woman without any experience and no education? Mel, owner of the Dixie Diner took a chance on Marcie and five years later, she's still unhappily stuck in Shifter Villages with a dead-end job living a lonely miserable life. Marcie's made a lot of mistakes and the greatest of those has been looking for love with all the wrong men in town which sadly, has earned her an unsavory reputation and the horrible nickname of 'Hardcore Shore'. And after her latest hookup with arrogant, conceited wolf shifter and real estate mogul Brad Stanford, there's no longer any chance of her finding love and happiness in the small town of Shifter Villages. Or is there??? It seems everyone else is signing up for the new Luscious Lads and Ladies Marriage Mates website created by bull-shifter Vic Harris, so why couldn't she give it a whirl? Nope, she can't take the chance of being the brunt of everyone's jokes but it seems fate has decided to step in and make the decision for her. Oh my! Will Marcie ever be able to find the love for which  she so desperately longs???Handsome coyote-shifter and owner of Kane's Bar and Grill, Kane Foster has had his eye on beautiful Marcie Shore for quite some time but has never had the courage to act - until now. Once he sees her ""accidentally posted"" profile on the Luscious Lads and Ladies Marriage Mates website, he knows it's time for him to act and an embarrassing situation provides him with the perfect opportunity! Oh my! Will Kane be able to convince the gun-shy Marcie that he truly cares for her and wants her for more than just her body??? Hmm...I wonder what will Marcie decide? Will she take a chance on love, or now that she no longer has a job, will she be forced to leave town for good??? But the bigger mystery is who seems to be causing all the devastating damage in Shifter Villages and why?  One person has been killed, another seriously injured and multiple businesses have been destroyed including the Dixie Diner. What will happen next and who will be targeted? Will the master manipulator and duplicitous Brad Stanford steal Marcie's last chance at happiness??? Will the selfish Brad ever get what's coming to him? Will Sheriff Dirk Matthews finally discover who is orchestrating all the fires and property damage in Shifter Villages? Will Deputy Bob ever leave poor Max Harris alone? We'll see! No spoilers from me but I will say this.....Young, beautiful human waitress who has a history of looking for love in all the wrong places with all the wrong people and has had more than her share of bad luck-check! Sexy, kindhearted and successful coyote shifter who wants to take a chance on love-check! Selfish, conceited, untrustworthy wolf shifter-check! A cast of wonderful characters including a quite dextrous cat named Elvis-check! Another wedding, another fire and a very unexpected but quite satisfying turn of events-check! Heated attraction and sweet romance-you bet! That and a whole lot more! These books are all fast-paced, entertaining, standalone novellas with each featuring a different couple. I loved it but be forewarned, you better have your box of tissues handy - this one is a real tearjerker!Complimentary copy received in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJE4P9HG5MQ0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017YFKWDI#wasThisHelpful","RJE4P9HG5MQ0F","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: Dead Reaper WalkingSeries: Liberty, OakwoodDesignation: Book Two of Series, Not a StandaloneGenre: Paranormal/Supernatural/Fantasy RomanceAuthor: Mina CarterMy Rating: FIVE SUPER SEXY STARS*****Oh my! Buttons over Biscuits! Talk about wild, hot and seriously sexy....this book has it all! This release is almost twice as long as the first book of the series, The Reaper and the Cop, and Mina has most definitely packed double the fun, action, adventure, romance and steamy sex into this riveting story. And I still loved every single page! Love action-packed adventure? It's included! Prefer something with a paranormal/supernatural kick? Yep, Mina has it covered. Can't live without a little mystery and suspense? You don't have to because it's here. Need great characters? You bet - the hero and the heroine both take charge, kick butt and take no prisoners. Like a generous measure of humor and snark sprinkled in? You got it. Gotta have fiery passion, steamy romance and dreamy sex? Oh, you better believe it's included! And, an extra plus, as is with all Mina's books, it's well crafted, well written and well edited. Although this book contains a good bit of backstory, I do not recommend it as a standalone, but rather a continuation so I do recommend reading Book One, The Reaper and the Cop, first. So far, this is only a two book series and does have a happy ending but Mina also sets the perfect stage for the introduction of more books in the future. Personally, I would love to see Laney and her new cop boyfriend, Troy Regan, continue their adventure together.Laney Larson is a total bada**, and she's a reaper. She even has a Grimm. Yep, it's the family business inherited from her great, great, great, great something grandfather and she's the lucky one chosen from her siblings to pick up the mantel and carry on the family tradition. She's totally got it covered and everything well in hand. At least she did until she cruises into the small backwoods town of Liberty, Oakwood on her sentient, almost-alive(sorta) ride which can change from a custom super bad motorcycle to whatever the heck she needs and meets smokin' hot police detective Troy Regan and now, all bets are off. He's sex on a stick and she wants him for a one night romp. There's a little problem with her scenario of how everything will play out however. He wants her too - like forever! Oh, and he doesn't know she's a reaper - at least not yet and she's only supposed to tell her one true love, at least according to her grandfather. What's a girl to do??? Why tell him, of course! Unfortunately for our two new lovers, there's serious trouble brewing in town and it's headed straight for them! And said trouble just captured her new man! Her job is not to save lives, she takes them - until now! Laney just got promoted from violent deaths to special operations! What the heck?! What's a reaper to do??? Go save her man, of course! Oh my! A reaper's work is never done! So many souls to claim but so little time! No spoilers from me but I will say this.....Handsome, hunky police detective-check! Beautiful, sexy Grimm Reaper who kicks butt, takes names and reaps souls-check! A cast of sexy characters-check! A hell gate and a demon from hell - literally! Action, adventure and suspense-check! Heated attraction, fiery passion and steamy, dreamy, hotter-than-haydees sex-you bet! That and a whole lot more!

"Wow! Like really WOW! Color me impressed! This is my first Kindle so I really had no idea what to expect but now that I have it, I'll never be without a Kindle. It goes with me everywhere I go. It's a tough little bugger because it's home is either in my purse or in my hand and it's still going strong even after a year! I have no qualms at all at recommending this product for people of all ages. It's reliable, easy to operate, navigate and it's perfect for people who like to read at home or on the go. It's perfect for browsing the web, checking your email, keeping up with your friends on Facebook and snapping photos on the go! And it's good for hours and hours of reading pleasure without having to recharge but when you do plug in, it charges quickly and efficiently. It's absolutely perfect and I love it!

"When I ordered my new Kindle Fire HD, I knew that I wanted an exceptional screen covering to protect my investment. After doing much research on several of the products offered on Amazon, I decided on the Moshi iVisor Screen Protector. It was a little more expensive than the majority of the other products offered but believe me when I say, it was worth every single penny I spent. I've now had my Kindle Fire HD for a year with the same Moshi iVisor Screen Protector and it's still in perfect condition. As advertised, it fit perfectly and was easy to install and has NO BUBBLES! Once it's in place, you don't even notice it's there. It's the least obvious screen protector I've ever seen. It's durable and very simple to clean with only a damp cloth and it's right back to its original new condition. I love it so much that this year I'm giving a Kindle as a gift and I intend to add one of these screen protectors as well. There's only one little drawback to this product. Since it cuts down on the glare, it also dials back on the vivid colors of the HD display. Personally, I don't mind so much as long as I know my screen is protected. Hands gown, the best screen protector I've ever purchased! I totally love it and would not be without it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NMUV0O5UWS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNTP36I#wasThisHelpful","R16NMUV0O5UWS6","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! I love my new Fintie Fire HD Case. I carry my Kindle with me everywhere I go so I knew I need a case that would be not only attractive but durable as well. Let's face it, the insude of a woman's handbag is not for the meek of heart and Fintie delivered in spades. I ordered the Leopard Brown and it's simply the cat's meow! People are always interrupting me while I'm reading, asking where did I purchase my adorable case and of course, I always tell them - it's a Fintie and I purchased it from Amazon. It holds my Kindle snugly and safely and also prevents damage if its ever accidentally dropped. I'm sure that's not part of their guarantee but I discovered this little fact first hand when mine took a tumble and lived to tell the tale! It's also durable, very comfortable to hold while reading and doesn't hinder the operation of the front or rear camera.. It's absolutely perfect! I couldn't be happier with my purchase and fully intend to purchase more of these cases for my other devices. I think that's the best compliment I can give.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F50FKBML5WJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OT8O096#wasThisHelpful","R1F50FKBML5WJD","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: A Hero of RealmsSeries: A Shade of VampireDesignation: Book Twenty of a Multi-Novel series, NOT a Standalone ReadAuthor: Bella ForrestGenre: Young Adult Paranormal RomanceReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE MAGNIFICENT STARS *****Wow! Best-selling author Bella Forrest has dazzled her readers yet again with A Hero of Realms, the twentieth release in her spellbinding mega-hit series, A Shade of Vampire and she has totally left me breathless- again! Like thousands of my fellow Shaddicts, I've been hooked from the very first book of the series and now anxiously await each release. I simply can't get enough! I was turning the pages so fast, my Kindle Fire couldn't keep up! Just when I think there's no way this series can get any better - wham - Bella hits us with another knockout! Bella has surprised us all with another riveting adventure that curls our toes, makes our hearts pound and keeps us begging for more! This is a paranormal/supernatural/fantasy/adventure saga so unlike any other I've ever read. It is exciting, well crafted, original, unique, imaginative, thrilling, fast paced, riveting, action packed, mysterious, suspenseful, enchanting, heartbreaking, heartwarming, seductive and oh so romantic. Whew, what a mouthful, but these are only a few of the words that come to mind after reading this incredible chronicle of the Shade, its inhabitants and its enemies. Can you tell that I really love this story? The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with a multitude of alternating points of view. Each chapter is told by one of the characters which I feel gives so much more depth, intensity and perspective to the story and adds to the complexity and understanding of the characters. The dialogue is smart, exceptionally well executed, well edited and flows effortlessly. Although the story is compelling and the dialogue is exceptional, it's truly the magnificent, comprehensive cast of larger than life characters that makes the biggest impact. They are well developed, captivating, intriguing, engaging, endearing and quite literally, out of this world sexy! They explode from the page, grab your imagination, capture your heart and hold you totally enthralled from beginning to end. Forrest skillfully combines these elements to craft a stunningly brilliant masterpiece of paranormal romance filled to the brim with action, adventure, fantasy, mystery, suspense, magic, supernatural beings, love, passion, loyalty, heartbreak, hope and plot twists that will blow your mind.In Book Twenty, our story resumes with Ben Novak now back at the Oasis after pledging himself to Oueen Nuriya of the Nasiri Jinn and true mistress of the Oasis in exchange for freeing his friends and family of The Shade who were being held as prisoners. Rather than join her family, River has chosen to remain with Ben and our two unlikely heroes have finally professed their love for the other, but the Prince of the Shade refuses to allow River to sacrifice her life for him. After learning in Book Nineteen from the Oracle that the evil Elder, Basilius, imprinted upon him as an infant while being held captive by the Hawks, Ben is now convinced that he must seek to rid himself of this curse alone. Despite River's objections, Ben convinces Corrine, who was left behind as a prisoner at the Oasis, to transport River back to the Shade without her consent while she was asleep. Despite Ben's determination to make his journey alone, he finds that he must unfortunately rely on the aid of the Jinn, a Hawk and a newly acquainted vampire to join him in his quest to free not only himself from Basilius but to also save both the human and supernatural realms from the ominous threat of the resurrection and return to power of the malevolent Elders. Tragically, Ben learns too late that some enemies as well as friends should never be trusted. As predicted, Ben finds himself at a fork with the weight of worlds upon his shoulders, where he must choose to become a soldier of shadows and destroyer of worlds, or a hero of realms. Oh my! New characters are introduced and more pieces to the puzzle are slowly revealed only to be replaced by even more perplexing questions. Will Ben discover the answers he so desperately needs before it's too late??? Will Ben ever be able to free himself from the life with which he has now been cursed to live??? Will Jeramiah finally be able to exact his revenge??? We'll see!!! No spoilers from me but I will say this......Handsome, guilt-stricken, newly turned vampire who can't control his bloodlust-check! Beautiful half-blood heroine who gets caught up in what she once thought to be only fantasy and fairy tales-check! A plethora of supernatural characters including vampires, werewolves, witches, dragons, harpys, ogres, hawks, jinn, mermaids, mermen and even a hellhound-you bet! Danger, drama, adventure, suspense, mind blowing plot twists, an unexpected betrayal, an old enemy returns and a dangerous new enemy emerges-you bet! A confession of love between Ben and River-oh yes!!! That and a whole lot more! I love it! I never tire of visiting my friends of 'The Shade'. It always feels like returning home. If you love heart-wrenching young adult paranormal romance, heartbreaking angst, tantalizing magic, out of this world fantasy, spine-tingling suspense, hold your breath action, malevolent enemies, evil machinations, unexpected plot twists and heart-pounding adventure, then you will surely enjoy A Shade of Vampire series. Buckle up my lovelies! It's another wild, wonderful and thrilling ride! Please keep in mind, this is a series - not a stand alone story and the books should be read in order of their release - and it does contain nail biting cliffhangers that will leave you on the edge of your seat panting for more - which I love! Bella always keeps us on our toes but lovingly rewards our patience with each new release. Well done, Bella, very well done! I can hardly wait to read what happens next with Derek, Sophia, Caleb, Rose, Ben, River, Claudia, Yuri, Vivienne, Xavier, Aiden, Corrine, Ibrahim and all the other wonderful residents of the Shade when Ben's adventure continues in Book 21! And a few of our old favorites from the early books even make a return!

Need great characters? You bet - the hero and the heroine both take charge, kick butt and take no prisoners. Like a generous measure of humor and snark sprinkled in? You got it. Gotta have fiery passion, steamy romance and dreamy sex? Oh, you better believe it's included! And, an extra plus, as is with all Mina's books, it's well crafted, well written and well edited. Although this book can be read as a standalone, it is the first in a (so far) two book series and does end in what I would call a happy-for-now. And there is already a second book available entitled Dead Reaper Walking which I fully intend to purchase and read.Laney Larson is a total bada**, and she's a reaper. Yep, it's the family business and she's the lucky one chosen from her siblings to pick up the mantel and carry on the family tradition. She's totally got it covered and everything well in hand until she cruises into the small backwoods town of Liberty, Oakwood and meets smokin' hot police detective Troy Regan and all bets are off. He's sex on a stick and she wants him for a one night romp. There's a little problem with her scenario of how everything will play out however. He wants her too - like forever! Oh, and he doesn't know she's a reaper - at least not yet! Unfortunately for our two lovers, there's serious trouble brewing in town and it's headed straight for them! So many souls to claim but so little time! No spoilers from me but I will say this.....Handsome, hunky police detective-check! Beautiful, sexy Grimm Reaper who kicks butt, takes names and reaps souls-check! Action, adventure and suspense-check! Heated attraction, fiery passion and steamy, dreamy sex-you bet! That and a whole lot more! I loved it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25L5WQ75Z3LQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INE2K58#wasThisHelpful","R25L5WQ75Z3LQK","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: Bump in the NightSeries: Deadly WhispersDesignation: Book One, Standalone, No CliffhangerAuthor: Elianne AdamsMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING STARS*******This story was originally published as part of the Dark Hallows Anthology which is where I read it.This was totally different than anything I've read from Adams. It was so not what I expected but so much more than I imagined. It's listed as the first book in her Deadly Whispers Series and I certainly hope this is true because I would love to read more about this couple and the world Adams has created for them. I fell in love with this couple and their storyline. The narrative was written in the third person with his and her points of view from our female and male protagonists, Libbie McMaster and Jay Connors. Libbie is not only a witch but also a daemon although not a pure blood.(And I had to look that one up and found out a daemon is the equivalent of a demi-god or benevolent demon/fallen angel and very powerful. Wow! Who knew?) And yes, Libbie works for the good guys and her boss, Jordan, is an angel. Our handsome hero, Jay, is a good old fashioned werewolf who can shift into not only his wolf but also the werewolf war form - you know, the really big scary wolf-like creature that walks upright. Yeah, that's the one. Our two lovers are introduced and set up by Libbie's best friend, April, and meet for the first time at a bar called The Witch's Brew. Libbie has placed herself into a self imposed time-out because she failed to rescue an innocent and it has haunted her ever since - until she meets Jay on her first night out with her friend in nine months. Their attraction and chemistry is red hot! I loved it! This is a standalone story that moves at a brisk but comfortable pace and does have a happy ending.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V19YX11O4CQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143I8VUA#wasThisHelpful","R1V19YX11O4CQF","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: Dark HallowsAuthors: Multiple AuthorsDesignation: Collection of Nine Short StoriesReading Platform: Kindle EditionMy Rating: FIVE CAPTIVATING STARS*****Dark Hallows is a diverse and captivating collection of haunting tales from nine very talented writers. Okay, it's no secret that I'm an Ellis Leigh and Elianne Adams fan and in all honesty, I purchased this anthology to read their contributions to the set but I must say, I also enjoyed several of the other stories as well. Let's face it, where else can you buy this many stories for a buck so even if I only enjoy a few of the stories, I figure it's always a win-win for me. But I have to be honest, there were quite a few of the other stories I also enjoyed and even discovered several new authors to add to my favorites list like Deanna Chase and Annie Nicholas, like WOW - where in the world have they been and how the heck have I missed them until now??? So far, I've read four of the stories and loved them all. They are well crafted, well written and well edited with intriguing stories and engaging characters that will capture your heart and your imagination.1) Bump in the Night by Elianne Adams: 5 Stars*****Series: Deadly Whispers, Book OneThis was totally different than anything I've read from Adams. It was so not what I expected but so much more than I imagined. It's listed as the first book in her Deadly Whispers Series and I certainly hope this is true because I would love to read more about this couple and the world she has created for them. I fell in love with this couple and their storyline. The narrative was written in the third person with his and her points of view from our female and male protagonists, Libbie McMaster and Jay Connors. Libbie is not only a witch but also a daemon although not a pure blood.(And I had to look that one up and found out a daemon is the equivalent of a demi-god or benevolent demon/fallen angel and very powerful. Wow! Who knew?) And yes, Libbie works for the good guys and her boss is an angel. Our handsome hero, Jay, is a good old fashioned werewolf who can shift into not only his wolf but also the werewolf war form - you know, the really big scary wolf-like creature that walks upright. Yeah, that's the one. They're introduced and set up by her best friend, April, and meet for the first time at a bar called The Witch's Brew. Libbie has placed herself into a self imposed time out because she failed to rescue an innocent and it has haunted her ever since - until she meets Jay on her first night out with her friend in nine months. Their attraction and chemistry is red hot! I loved it! This is a standalone story that moves at a brisk but comfortable pace and does have a happy ending.4) Ravenous by Annie Nicholas: Five Stars*****Series: Lake City Stories, Book OneThis is the first book in Nicholas' Lake City Stories Series and is not a new story. Although I would consider this to be a ""somewhat"" standalone, it is the beginning of a continuing series and this book does end in only a happy-for-now with the promise of much more to come for our female protagonist, young fledgling succubus, Pia Marie Blyton. I was totally mesmerized by this story and its characters which also includes all manner of supernatural creatures along with a charismatic ancient vampire named Zur-Sin. The story is well crafted, well written and well edited. The narrative is written in the first person as told by Pia. This is one sexy read! I loved it! I'm so glad I found you Annie Nicholas!6) Marked by Temptation by Deanna Chase: Five Stars*****Series: Coven Pointe Series, Book OneJackpot! Where have you been hiding Deanna Chase??? Wow! Another new author to add to my favorites list! I loved this story! It's imaginative, seductive, well crafted, well written and well edited. The dialogue is smart, sexy and flows effortlessly. The narrative is written in the first person with alternating his and her points of view from the two protagonists of the story and believe me when I say, they are absolutely yummy! Beautiful Matisse Ballintine is a sex witch and must have sex in order to replenish her power. She's one of the good guys and in addition to being a college student, she also works for her sister who is head of the Angel Council. Yep, she's a busy girl and always on the lookout for her next victim..umm...willing sex partner. Or she was until she met handsome bounty hunter Vaughn Paxton who also comes from a magical family. Oh my! Sparks fly! Quite literally! The attraction and chemistry between these two is red hot! Does Vaughn have any magical abilities? Well, that's the million dollar question, isn't it? I'll never tell! I will certainly be reading more from Deanna Chase!7) Masterson by Ellis Leigh: Five Stars*****Yowza! What a character! Masterson is a very old vampire who was sired by the Master. Get it? He's the Master's son so he's Masterson. And he is one sexy, dominant vampire! Swoon....This story really surprised me and it was a very pleasant surprise. I'm a diehard Ellis Leigh fan but this was so different than anything I've ever read by Ellis but I LOVED it! This story is well crafted, well written and well edited. The narrative is written in the first person as told by none other than Masterson and each chapter is a day of the week with the entire story unfolding in seven days. The dialogue is smart and effortless. It's bloody brilliant and Masterson is a work of art. He's one scary, creepy dude and I couldn't get enough of him. This story is rich, dark and intense so be forewarned, it's not for the weak of heart. But never fear, it seems that even devilishly devious vampires can fall for the right person, especially if it's the one for whom he's been searching for hundreds of years. And wouldn't you just know it, she just happens to be a necromancer and a medical examiner, and she secretly knows what he is and does lead him on a merry chase. Yep, Masterson has it bad for Dr Vale Theroux or 'Plum' as he likes to call her. Oh my! This is one sinfully seductive read and I loved every minute of it! Another fabulous read Ellis Leigh!Okay, that's all I've read so far but I'm about to start on Ghost-Ordered Bride by Sadie Haller and More Than A Feeling by Cate Dean, two more first time authors for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35J6VQD2XCRW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012C0KQF4#wasThisHelpful","R35J6VQD2XCRW5","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: MiriSeries: Plenty of ShiftDesignation: Book One, Standalone Novella, No CliffhangerAuthor: Carina WilderReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE SUPER SEXY STARS*****Wow! I'm totally smitten with Carina Wilder's new series, Plenty of Shift. The story is cute, sweet, fun, humorous, totally unique and so romantic. It is also well crafted, well written in the third person and absolutely adorable. The dialogue is smart, sexy and flows effortlessly. The characters are captivating, engaging and endearing. I am so in love with Miri, the female protagonist of this story. Miri is a cougar and owner of her very own brand new business venture, Plenty of Shift, a matchmaking agency. No, not that type of cougar - shame on you! She's a real live cougar-shifter and her new agency is for shifters! I love it! As a result of a very lecherous boss, Miri is more than ready to leave her old job behind along with her old life and apartment which included a cheating human boyfriend, or rather, now ex-boyfriend. Miri has always been quite successful in matching up her friends with the perfect guy. Unfortunately, she can't say the same for her own relationships which always seem to end in heartache. So when her best friend, Jenn, suggests she start her own business and match people professionally, Miri is all in but when Jenn wants to return the matchmaking favor and introduces Miri to bear-shifter, Malcolm Byrne, the bartender at The Fox and Hound Bar, aka The Bear Bar, she's more than a little reluctant to act on the instant attraction she feels for the handsome, hunky bear. Besides, she refuses to break her own rule of dating only humans because her mother taught her that shifter males are all violent and cheating players but....he is awfully sexy and so very hot...and he seems to be attracted to her as well. So, what's a girl kitty to do? Will Miri be able to get her new business off the ground and take a chance on love for herself with a sexy bear-shifter??? Will Miri be successful in matching her very first client who turns out to be her new landlord and new friend, Naomi? We'll see! Miri plans to offer her clients a very unique opportunity and a choice? And we, Carina's readers will also have a choice because we get to choose who we want to match with Naomi or maybe we'll choose and read both. I love it! This is so new and different! I can hardly wait although I have to say, I'm really leaning toward Quinn - being made love to on a yacht in the Mediterranean certainly sounds fabulous! Great idea and great story! Fabulous entertainment and an awesome read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WOLFBS17IRHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016L7BY0A#wasThisHelpful","R2WOLFBS17IRHD","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Title: Thrilling WeeksSeries: Alpha Billionaire Romance SeriesDesignation: Book Nine of Multi-Installment Serial, NOT a StandaloneAuthor: Sarah J BrooksReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING STARS *****Love it! Thrilling Weeks is the ninth riveting installment of Sarah J Brooks' seductive new serial and I must say, I'm totally captivated. This is a serialized story so if you haven't read the previous books in the series, PLEASE STOP HERE. Okay, I realize that multi-installment serials may not be for everyone but what can I say, I love them. And Sarah Brooks just got my attention! This is my first time reading anything written by Brooks but I can say with absolute certainty, it won't be my last. I am so hooked on this author and this series! I love the concept of this story:  a strong female lead with BRAINS. She's not only beautiful but intelligent as well and the icing on the cake: she has a mind of her own except when it comes to love, and who of us has not been blinded by love at least once in our life. I know I have! Of course, we all love a handsome alpha male lead and love them all the more when they're sexy, charming and intelligent. And let's not forget - filthy rich! Who can resist that combination??? The story is exciting, sensual, arousing, well crafted, suspenseful and completely grabbed and held my attention. Once I started reading, it was easy to immerse myself in the story and I wanted more. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with his, his and her points of view, which I love. Yep, I said his twice and that wasn't a mistake. There are now two men weighing in with their take on the events as they happen. That's all I can say without giving too much away but what I can say is this - I love it! I believe this adds to the depth and complexity of the story and definitely gives us a better understanding of the characters, their feelings and motivations. The dialogue is smart, snappy, easy to follow and flows effortlessly. And now for the best part, the characters. They are fascinating, captivating, intriguing, engaging and relatable. The chemistry between the three main characters is convincing and at times, quite perplexing but in a good way. Quite simply, it is off the charts sexy and thrilling! Brooks skillfully crafts these elements into a fabulously entertaining contemporary romance  with a twist. What kind of twist, you ask? Well, it's a little too early to tell but I strongly suspect that we will have a little mystery, suspense and betrayal as the story progresses. (And we most certainly do!) And please forgive me for being crass, but we didn't have to wait until halfway through the book for the mind-blowing sex! Oh no, Brooks rewarded us in the very first installment and gave us a little taste of how well suited these characters are for each other. I can hardly wait to read the next installment!Beautiful graduate student Becka Jasper is definitely on her way to a very promising and successful career. She's had to work hard for everything she has and intends to work even harder to get what she wants. When Oliver Weeks, CEO of Neuotova is invited to speak as a guest lecturer by Dr Evans, Becka's professor/advisor/mentor, she is able to snag an interview for an internship with Oliver Weeks, CEO of Neuotova, a major food research corporation. But Becka is immediately thrown off her game when she first sets eyes on Oliver Weeks and is more than just a little attracted to him. She immediately feels the chemistry between them and is conflicted over her decision to seek a job with the handsome, charismatic CEO. And it seems Oliver Weeks may be attracted to her as well.  Oh my!Billionaire Oliver Weeks has worked long and hard to achieve his success. The only area in which he hasn't been successful is his personal life. He works hard but plays little and very seldom has time for a relationship with the fairer sex. Most of his dates are arranged by his personal assistant and never the same woman. He has no interest in love or developing feelings for anyone - until now. One look at Becka Jasper is all it takes for alpha male Oliver to know that he wants her and not just as an intern in his lab. She's not only beautiful but she's also brilliant. He wants her in his life as well as his bed and he's not accustomed to being told no. Oliver Weeks always gets what he wants and he wants Becka. Oh my! Will Oliver be able to convince Becka to accept his offer - both of them??? Hmm...I wonder???Book Two:Becka has accepted Oliver's requests for several dates and their chemistry is off the charts but she's still conflicted over accepting an internship with his company while having a personal relationship with the handsome CEO. She has little time to consider her dilemma when she's broadsided with some devastating news. Becka and Dr Evans have spent countless time and much effort on a special research project for Protame, a healthy replacement for the artificial sweetener Aspartame. Becka has worked tirelessly on this project and has also chosen it as the subject as her dissertation. The university has suffered budget cutbacks and as a result, they have lost funding for their project. Oh no! What will she do? Maybe she should tell Oliver. Will Oliver be able to help??? Oliver is more determined than ever to have the beautiful Becka in his bed and in his lab. And he's not above a little scheming and manipulation to get what he wants. But let's not forget, Becka has a mind of her own and may have a few surprises in store for the wealthy determined billionaire! It's a battle of wills and both are determined to get what they want but will it be each other??? Or are there other secrets and motivations at play? Hmm... I wonder???Book Three:Oliver weeks did indeed help the lovely Becka and donated the money anonymously to the University to fund her Protame project and of course he has his own selfish reasons. He wants Becka and if that means making her feel somewhat indebted to him, then so be it. He's certainly not above using every dirty trick in the book to get what he wants but he certainly never expected her proclamation of never mixing business with pleasure. She's refused to sleep with him if she accepts the position at Neuotova! Huh? Oh yes, she definitely laid the law down to him. But when had he ever allowed a little thing like an emphatic no to ever stop him from getting what he wants? Never! He'll do whatever it takes; he's determined to have the beautiful, intelligent Becka?Becka knows it was Oliver that donated the money but does finally agrees to accept the internship with Neuotova, but she has a caveat of her own. If she accepts the internship as a paid position, she will be unable continue her personal relationship with Oliver. What? Nope, her conscience won't allow it. She will not allow a personal relationship to compromise her work ethics. Or will she? While doing some research on Oliver and his company, Becka uncovers some very disturbing allegations against Oliver and his company Neuotova, allegations charging animal cruelty by the use use of animals in their research, experimentation and testing. Huh? Becka is a researcher after all so who better to investigate? Becka is invited by her advisor Dr Evans to teach a Food Science Ethics class and at her very first class she meets student Ethan Hernandez who makes some serious charges regarding the use of animal testing against Neuotova. But are they true or simply conjecture and who is Ethan Hernandez? There's only one way to discover the truth and if it means more research into company files, then that's a chance she's willing to take. She just hadn't expected a perfect opportunity to fall into her lap when Oliver offers her a job as his assistant and a two week working vacation to Italy. Huh? Oh my! Can she work so closely with him and still be objective? I think not!Book Four:Apparently, Becka can't remain objective, not when Oliver insists on whisking her away to Italy for a working vacation with lots of shopping, romantic dinners and lots and lots of dreamy sex. Oh my! But nothing can last forever and so they must return home to their lives which for Becka includes discovering the truth about Oliver. Becka has received an email from Ethan promising absolute proof of his accusations against Oliver. Becka  reveals this information to Oliver but she now must decide whether to meet with Ethan. But Ethan has decided to turn up the heat, not only in his effort to turn Becka against Oliver but also to pursue her for himself as well. What? Becka is now caught in the middle of the two powerful men and has no idea which one to believe. And the latest revelation from Oliver about Ethan has her even more confused! Talk about dropping a bomb! Oh my glory! I never saw that one coming! So, what's a girl to do when two handsome, wealthy men are both supposedly vying for her affection? Sleep with one and kiss the other??? Oh my!Book Five:After agreeing to a meeting with Ethan and sharing a mind-blowing kiss with him, Becka comes to the sudden realization that she's actually attracted to both handsome men but how is that even possible? How can she be attracted to both Oliver and Ethan when obviously one of the men is lying to her? But who is lying and who is telling the truth? If she's to believe the documents Ethan has shown her, then Oliver is paying Ethan to guarantee his silence, therefore Oliver is not being honest. Or Ethan is blackmailing Oliver and extorting money but for what reason? Documents can be forged, right? Oliver has become an important part of her life but just what is her relationship with him? Does he truly care about her and her welfare? Is she is his girlfriend or merely flavor of the month? And to further complicate the situation, it now seems that Ethan wants Becka for himself and intends to steal her away from Oliver. Oh my! Ethan doesn't give Becka long to contemplate her questions. The morning after their impromptu kiss, Ethan unexpectedly arrives at Neuotova demanding to see Oliver and then..... immediately envelops her in his arms and crushes her with a hot smoldering kiss just as Oliver is opening his office door! OMG! Oliver goes ballistic and Ethan retaliates. Allegations, threats and insults are hurled by each and it seems they may come to blows. What a nightmare! (Or is it? Hmm...What woman doesn't want two hot as heck billionaires fighting over her? But is it really her they're fighting over?) Apparently both men have been less than forthright with Becka. Each has lied to her and kept a shocking secret. But Oliver just let the cat out of the bag! Oh my goodness! Oliver is determined to keep Becka no matter the cost but that Ethan is such a devilishly naughty boy! After all, what's a little deceit, betrayal, blackmail and extortion among ......I'll still never tell!Book Six:After discovering the secret of Oliver and Ethan's relationship, Becka is determined to leave her troubles behind, at least for the weekend. She needs time to think and that means time away from both Oliver and Ethan.

After a wild night partying, Becka tries to contact Oliver but his phone is answered by none other than Ethan! Ethan? Oh my goodness! And when Becka demands to know what's going on, Ethan refuses to explain, insisting that if she wants to know, she must immediately come to Oliver's home. What the heck? Why is Ethan at Oliver's home and where is Oliver?Book Seven:Ethan is in full seduction mode and plans to have Becka in his arms and in his bed. Well, actually it would be Oliver's bed since it's in his house but at this point, he doesn't really care. Oliver's not here but he is and he wants Becka. He's never wanted a woman so much in his entire life. So what if he had to tell a little lie to get her here! All's fair in love and war!Becka finds herself succumbing to Ethan's charm but who could blame her? He's smokin' hot and for some reason, she feels inexplicably drawn to both men. Oliver has disappeared again without even a goodbye much less an explanation so why should she feel guilty about being with Ethan in Oliver's home? Maybe she's misjudged Ethan after all or so she thinks until she finds blood in the wine cellar. It must be Oliver's blood. Is Oliver still alive and if so, where is he? Oh my! Surely Ethan would never harm Oliver, would he? After all, they are former business partners and ....... Nope, I'll still never tell! But I will say this....Ethan has certainly stepped up his game! But will Becka fall for it???Book Eight:Oliver is indeed, very much alive and makes a surprise appearance At Becka's apartment only to unexpectedly disappear - again. But this time, he may have gone too far and his actions may be unforgivable. Someone has stolen every single page of Becka's research on Neuotva, Oliver and Ethan and unfortunately, all the evidence points to Oliver as being the thief. And this time, his actions have not only jeopardized her career but also destroyed her entire life and future as well. With the media closing in on her after information from the stolen files is leaked to the press, Becka has now become the focus of their attention and just like before, Oliver has completely deserted her refusing to even answer her calls, yet again leaving her to fend for herself in an impossible situation. More secrets and lies are revealed as the suspense continues to build! Who should Becka trust???Book Nine:Becka has lost everything because of Oliver and Ethan. She has been suspended from school, her dissertation and research project for Protame have been destroyed, the press is camped out at her door and Oliver is not taking her calls. She's finally had enough. She's determined to confront Oliver once and for all. She convinces her roommate to sneak her out of their apartment and take her to Oliver's home and fortunately, he's at home. Oliver promises to handle everything. Throughout it all, Becka comes to the chilling realization that she truly loves Oliver and doesn't want to live her life without him. He convinces Becka to stay with him and pleads with her to  trust him - again. Mistake??? We'll see! No spoilers from me but I will say this....Buckle up and hang on! It's one heck of a great ride!

I can hardly wait for Book Two!My Rating: Five Super Sexy Stars*****2) Title: Found: Mate of the Cave Bear by Harmony RainesFound: Mate of the Cave Bear, The Dualis Book OneOh My! Harmony Raines has done it again! And just what has she done, you ask? She has published an amazing new serial called The Dualis. Yes, I said serial which means multiple books and dare I say it - cliffhangers! Yikes! But don't despair folks! Although the serial does consist of three separate installments, fortunately for us, Raines released all three on the same day! Woohoo - no waiting! I settled in and decided to read all three in one sitting so I'm writing only one review for the entire series and will post it for each book. Never fear, there will be NO spoilers!  Harmony Raines has always exhibited exceptional talent and imagination in her writing but in this series, she has far exceeded my expectation of her skill in creating something new, fresh and original that encompasses not one genre, but several. She has skillfully combined paranormal romance with science fiction and fantasy to create a fascinating and intriguing world of the past and future, filled to the brim with action, adventure, suspense, love and hope. The story is original, exciting, suspenseful, thrilling, heartbreaking, heartwarming, sweet, romantic and sensual. These are only a few of the words that came to mind while I was reading this story. The dialogue is clean, smart and flows well. The characters are intriguing, captivating and engaging. This is a romance and does include some sex scenes, however, they don't overpopulate the book. Raines has dared to venture outside the box with this story and I love it! Now, let's talk about the basics of the story itself.The premise of the story:It is now the twenty second century and through the use of research and technology, scientists have learned how to manipulate and alter human DNA. For too many years, children have been genetically engineered by doctors and scientists allowing parents to choose eye color, body type and even gender. These developments have contaminated the gene pool and brought evolution to a halt. The world is now in desperate need of new blood, or rather uncontaminated blood from the past with new stem cells.Now for the plot of the story:Tworn Corporation has developed a time machine which can create a worm hole enabling a person to travel through the time. It is their intention to send a young woman 30,000 years into the past to find a primitive man, become pregnant with his child and then return through the wormhole by means of a tether, to the future. Her child would be used for the benefit of mankind and become the savior of the world. Huh? No pressure - right? Jenna is chosen to be that woman because she met several vital and important requirements. She has no fillings in her teeth, he's never had any broken bones or surgical procedures and most importantly, she's a virgin meaning she nor her DNA has ever been tainted by a male from her time. She considers herself to be unattractive and unremarkable. Obviously Tworn Corporation agrees and believes there is absolutely nothing to distinguish her as being from the twenty second century. Although some may see this opportunity as a great honor, Jenna is not doing this for recognition nor the advancement of mankind. She's simply doing it for the money. Now don't start thinking badly of Jenna just yet. She wants the money for purely unselfish motives - her mother became terminally ill and as a result, Jenna inherited the astronomical debt for the medical bills after her mother's death. She's from a very poor family and could never live long enough to pay off the debt, so here she is, about to travel back in time. She's given six months of training to prepare her for her journey but Jenna soon suspects there is much more to this mission than Mr. Trimble with Tworn Corporation is telling her but she has no idea what it could be. She begins to have her doubts but fears for her safety if she doesn't complete her mission. But they never prepare her for the entry into the land of the past and I mean that quite literally because she tumbles from the wormhole high above the ground with nothing to help to break her fall. She plummets into a heavily forested area and is seriously injured. She is found by Haran who is a Dualis, a primitive, a ""cave bear"", who reluctantly and begrudgingly nurses her back to health. This is how Haran refers to himself - a cave bear, a Dualis, meaning of two natures, man and beast. Haran is a primitive bear shifter and lives alone in a cave. After the heartbreaking loss of his parents at a young age, he has chosen to be alone and never take a mate. But Haran soon discovers that fate can never be denied. The attraction he feels for the strange young woman proves to be too strong to resist and he quickly falls in love with the beautiful, curvaceous Masu that falls from the sky. She should be his enemy, not his mate. Huh? He only kills for food but the Masu hunt and kill for the pleasure they draw from cruelty and fear. She is Masu and not to be trusted! Nope, never going to happen - he will resist! He will??? Jenna has no clue that she looks like the Masu, his enemy. Heck, she doesn't even know who they are but one thing she does know, she's incredibly attracted to Haran and she wants him - in her arms and in her bed, or should I say her furs. Jenna now realizes that quite possibly, she may never want to give up her child if she becomes pregnant nor return to her own time! What? Will Jenna survive her injuries? Will she become pregnant? Will she ever return to her time? Can Haran protect her from his enemies? Or will Haran perish in his fight with the Masu? Are there other shifters in this time and if so, where are they and will they help? Oh my! No spoilers here but I will say this......Beautiful, virtuous heroine-check! Sexy, primitive but intelligent bear shifter-check! Large cast of fascinating characters including other types of shifters-check! Oops! Uh-oh! I may have just let a little spoiler slip out! Danger, drama, suspense, action, heinous enemies and evil machinations-check! Heated attraction, sweet romance, heartbreaking angst and some  heartwarming, arousing sex-you bet! That and a whole lot more!Execution of the story:My personal opinion - Well done! I'm not a science/tech geek so I don't require a detailed scientific or technical explanation on how the time travel was actually accomplished, but I was totally captivated by the true essence and message of this story - love can prevail.  Remember folks, this is fiction and fantasy, so keep an open mind.  If you want to try something original and a little different yet quite refreshing, then this is the book for you. Deliciously sweet, completely captivating and delightfully entertaining!My Rating: Five Delightfully Entertaining Stars*****3) Her Two Bears by Catherine ValeWow! I absolutely loved it! Catherine Vale's amazing talent, incredible skill and unique style shine brightly in her latest release, Her Two Bears. Vale never fails to excite, tantalize and entertain her readers while always leaving us satisfied, warm and all fuzzy inside. I love a great paranormal, romantic happily ever after story and Vale is definitely a master at giving her readers just that, in spades! The story is exciting, compelling, romantic, sweet, arousing, sensual and steamy. The dialog is smart and well written. The characters are captivating, engaging, endearing and sexy. Beautiful curvy Sadie is pretty much fed up with the dating scene. She's certainly had more than her fair share of bad encounters and terrible relationships. Her best friend Peyton, seeing Sadie's unhappiness, sets her up on a blind date with not one, but two gorgeous guys - at the same time! Huh? A little unorthodox- maybe - but Sadie decides to go with the flow and live on the wild side, even if it's just for one date. And Sadie doesn't regret it, not for one minute, because her dates, Dane and Jackson, are the two hottest guys she's ever seen! Wowza! Dane and Jackson are both instantly attracted to the sexy Sadie and they want her, badly, and at the same time! What? Yep, they are co-alphas of their clan and they want her as their mate. Now all they have to do is convince her to mate them both --- and tell her that they are both bear shifters! Huh? What the heck? Sparks fly! Attraction builds! Desires burn! Passion ignites! Oh my!

"Title: The Vampire's Mail Order BrideSeries: Nocturne Falls, Book OneDesignation: Standalone Novel, NO CliffhangerAuthor: Kristen PainterReading Platform: Kindle EditionMy Rating: FIVE DIVINELY ENTERTAINING STARS*****Wow! I absolutely love it! The Vampire's Mail Order Bride is the  first release in the delightfully entertaining new series, Nocturne Falls, by Kristen Painter and it is delectably delicious. (Pun intended) The series is a paranormal romance based on all manner of supernatural beings who live and work among humans in a town named Nocturne Falls where it's  Halloween every day of the year.  And they celebrate it big time since it's the town's main source of income. How could you not love it with names like The Scream Shop, Hallowed Bean, Howlers and Insomnia and that's only a few.  And did I mention it's located in Georgia. Oh yes, and I live in Georgia which makes me love it even more, not that I need another reason because there are plenty of reasons to love this book solely on its own merit. It's exceptionally well crafted, well executed, well edited and well developed. The characters are engaging, endearing and at times, laugh at loud funny.  It's sweet, exciting, humorous and romantic with just the right amount of danger, intrigue and suspense. And of course, it wouldn't be complete without a large dollop of angst. This is my first time reading Kristen Painter's work but it certainly won't be my last! This is a standalone novel and does include a deliciously sweet happy ending. I don't want to give anything away but I will say that it does include vampires, witches, werewolves, gargoyles, fae and all manner of creatures we all know and love including humans, a very spoiled Maine Coon(cat) and a meddling grandmother. I also must warn you - it does contain a feisty, brave, beautiful, straight-shooter, human heroine who just happens to be a chocolate lover and a self proclaimed confectionery artist with a mind of her own and a handsome, hunky, wealthy, protective male vampire hero who is determined to never fall in love again.  So don't say I didn't warn you, because when determined Delaney and stubborn Hugh meet, well, let's just say that sparks fly, chocolate melts and Nocturne Falls may never be the same again. Hugh never even knew what hit him! Oh my!  Did I say that I loved it? I may have mentioned it but just in case, I love it! I'm ready for Book Two in this enchanting series. This book does NOT contain hardcore profanity nor explicit sex,  however, the sex is inferred and is totally dreamy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3774EUK3PSBSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDME5O8#wasThisHelpful","R3774EUK3PSBSA","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: Enslaved by the Alpha: Part FourSeries: Shifters of NunavutDesignation: Part Four of an Multi-Installment Serial,  Not a Standalone, Does Include CliffhangerAuthor: Viola RivardReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE SUPER SEXY STARS*****Yowza! New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Viola Rivard has knocked it out of the park - again! Enslaved by the Alpha is a multi-installment serial and first release in her captivating new series, Shifters of Nunavut and folks, it's a real firecracker! And it just keeps getting better and better! The story is exciting, edgy, thrilling, imaginative, humorous, arousing, romantic and seductive. Oh, and did I mention hot? Oh yes, it's definitely hot! The narrative is exceptionally well written in the third person with alternating his and her points of view. The dialogue is well executed and flows effortlessly. And the characters... well, they're always the best part of Viola's stories. Don't get me wrong, Viola's books are always fast paced, well crafted, well developed and well edited and truly, a pleasure to read but it's her characters that I fall in love with every single time. Her characters are always unique, captivating, engaging, endearing and at times, laugh out loud funny but above all else, Viola creates, hands down, the  most grumpy, growly, quite possibly irredeemable and certainly the most arrogant male antiheroes of anyone I know. You know, the kind we love to hate but secretly love, and of course, are always devilishly handsome.(Swoon....) And the male protagonist in this story is no exception. The interaction and banter between male and female protagonist is delightful and often hilarious and their sexual  chemistry is almost palpable. Viola skillfully combines all of these elements to craft a delightfully entertaining paranormal tale filled to the brim with heart-pounding danger, heartbreaking drama, heart-stopping action, spine-tingling adventure, side-splitting humor and let's not forget, steamy, dreamy romance. When I read a Viola Rivard story, I'm always reminded of the Carly Simon song, Nobody Does It Better. The words replay in my mind: Nobody does it better, Makes me feel sad for the rest, Nobody does it half as good as you, Baby you're the best. And Viola definitely is the best! Buckle up my lovelies! It's another wild ride! And this time, we travel to the tundra of the Arctic for our story.Book One:Twenty-eight year old Astrid Castello is very much out of her element. As a native Floridian, the climate of the Arctic tundra definitely does not agree with her and it's all her younger sister Ginnifer's fault. Months ago, her sister had traveled to the Arctic to film a documentary on the way of life of werewolf packs living in the area and after finishing her film, she returned to the Siluit Pack and Zane, their alpha, is holding her prisoner.If her sister isn't already dead and Astrid can somehow manage to rescue her, then she's going to kill her for this. She doesn't even really like her sister but here she is, neck deep in trouble in the Arctic, trying to rescue her sister for her parents' sake. Yes, it's for them because she doesn't want to tell them that their favored daughter has traveled back to Nunuvat to live with the Siluit werewolf pack. And it has cost her everything including all her money! Well, technically the twelve thousand dollars she paid for her guides was actually Ginnifer's money since she withdrew(stole) it from Ginnifer's bank account but she wouldn't have had to do it if Ginnifer had stayed at home instead of traipsing all over the globe as a freelance documentary filmmaker. And now, she finds herself in the middle of nowhere with a group of men who started out as her very kind guides but had now turned into a group of opportunists who were only interested in poaching the furs of werewolves and probably murdering her. Her plan was to travel to the location of the Amarok Pack and try to make a deal with their Alpha, Erik, to enlist his help in recovering her sister from the rival Siluit Pack where her sister is being held. Unfortunately, her meeting with the Amarok Pack did not go as planned. She has seriously underestimated the sheer and savagery of the werewolves because the wolves of the Amarok pack have just slaughtered all of her very questionable guides, leaving only her alive. Oh my! Erik is a handsome, arrogant, ruthless and very selfish wolf who is determined to have things his way and unfortunately, there's only one deal the Alpha is willing to accept - her. Huh? Oh yes, Erik demands that she give herself willingly to him in exchange for him helping to rescue her sister. Oh my goodness! What's a girl to do? Why, make a deal, of course! Sadly, Astrid soon realizes that she has truly sacrificed everything to rescue her sister from the clutches of a demon and in the process, has ended up selling her own soul to the devil. Oh my!  Will Astrid somehow manage to save her sister and herself or will she be Erik's new plaything until he grows tired of her and gives her to another wolf???Book Two:The story continues with Astrid struggling to find her place in the pack while learning exactly what being owned by Erik entails. At the same time, Erik is desperately struggling to control his wolf, something he has never had a problem with before. Apparently his beast believes that Astrid is his mate and is determined to have her and only her.Oh my! Will Erik be able to maintain his control or will he lose the battle to his wolf??? Will Astrid be able to convince Erik to rescue her sister from the Siluit Pack???Book Three:The story continues with Erik finally agreeing to send a group of wolves to the Siluit Pack to rescue Ginnifer but after Astrid reveals a possible relationship between Ginnifer and the Alpha, Zane, Erik changes his plans and decides to make the journey himself and use Astrid as a bargaining chip to gain access to the Siluit Pack's hunting grounds. Their dangerous journey results in changes in the relationship between the two unlikely lovers and Erik begins to see Astrid in a new light. Maybe his wolf wasn't so wrong after all. But will they be able to rescue Ginnifer from Zane or does she even need saving???Book Four: Astrid learns that her sister Ginnifer is now mated to Zane. What? Oh yes! And they truly love each other and are expecting their first child. She has sacrificed her life for nothing. Well, maybe nothing is stretching the truth since Erik now seems determined to make her his mate. Huh? Oh my! Originally, Erik had planned to just take her until he tired of her and then give her to another member of his pack but he has quickly come to the sudden realization that he wants no one else to even touch her - ever! Oh my goodness! He wants her to become his mate in every since of the word including giving her a pup - his pup! Erik discovers that he truly likes the idea and having her as his mate and having a pup of his own to teach and to one day become alpha of his pack. He likes it a lot but Astrid doesn't appear to be enthusiastic about the idea. She knows she become pregnant and have a child - she's already tried. That's what broke up her marriage. So, she convinces Erik to accept a bargain - if she's not pregnant by spring, he will allow her to leave and go back home to Florida. Hmmm....But is leaving Erik what she really wants??? Has Erik's harsh and abrasive personality turned Astrid against him for good or could she be developing real feelings for the handsome, aggressive alpha??? Unfortunately, there are members of the Amarok pack who oppose their mating for reasons of their own and Astrid's life may be at risk. Can Astrid ever be truly safe with the Erik's pack??? I guess we'll have to wait and see. No spoilers from me but I will say this......Arrogant, ruthless, dominant Alpha wolf who takes what he wants regardless of the consequences and may just be irredeemable-check! Curvaceous, naive heroine who is on a mission to save her sister and may just talk the alpha wolf to death-check! A sister who is 'supposedly' being held captive by a rival werewolf pack-check!

It is NOT a standalone story and does include cliffhangers. I realize this may not be everyone's cup of tea but personally, I enjoy the shorter installments as long as they're published regularly and Hannah's books are generally released once or twice a month. They are absolutely perfect for a quick lunch time read or a relaxing break between heavy, full-length novels. These installments are the equivalent of only a few chapters but Hannah always delivers quite the punch with each. I know that there have been some reviewers who are unhappy about the length and cost of each installment but I subscribe to the Amazon Kindle Unlimited Program which allows me to borrow and read an unlimited number of book each month for only ten dollars a month. Despite Amazon's recent policy and payment changes which resulted in many authors removing their books from Kindle Unlimited, Hannah has kept her books available through  program which I do appreciate.Wow! I am in love with this series! What He Wants is a sinfully seductive multi-installment serial by Hannah Ford and it totally rocked my world! Each successive release becomes more exciting, exhilarating and suspenseful. The story is well crafted, exciting, thrilling, compelling, powerful, mysterious, suspenseful, enticing, addictive, romantic, arousing, sensual and steamy.

Julia Mills has knocked it out of the park again with her latest release, Vidalia: A 'Not Quite' Vampire Love Story.  I absolutely loved it! I became a loyal reader and Julia Mills fan last year after reading the first book in her best-selling Dragon Guard Series and now 10 releases later, I'm still a die-hard fan. All of her stories are exceptional but this fast-paced, fun-filled, laugh-out-loud funny, supernatural romantic suspense/comedy is absolutely extraordinary. Yes, I do sometimes make up words because I just really like how they sound.  Don't you just love the way fanglessly sounds??? So, sue me. No, please don't, I was just kidding. The story has everything you need to make a great read. Like what, you ask? Well, it has excitement, suspense, danger, drama and lots and lots of snark, sass and humor. Oh, and did I mention romance? Oh yes, it has that too, in spades along with dreamy sex. It's well crafted, well written and well edited. The narrative is written in the first person from the point of view of the female protagonist. Always a big plus in my book. The characters are well developed, engaging, endearing and will steal your heart. So, what do you get when you combine a sassy, fangless, not quite dead, family cursed vampire named Vidalia Fitzsimmons who is the medical examiner in Atlanta and also happens to be the heiress to the Georgia Onion Empire with a  handsome, smexy Buckhead Police Department detective, add a healthy measure of super hot romance and then throw in a spine-tingling whodunit?

What a divinely entertaining box set of completely new, standalone, spellbinding novellas from seventeen of the best-known and best-selling authors in paranormal romance! And of course, it's also a phenomenal value! First, I would like to emphasize that the books offered in this bundle are NOT teasers, excerpts, nor first installments but complete standalone stories. Although they may be part of a previously published series, reading the other books of that series is not required to follow, understand and enjoy these stories. So, your only requirement is to snuggle into your favorite jammies with your favorite beverage, then simply read and enjoy! Oh and there are NO cliffhangers! Woo-Hoo! I truly enjoy purchasing these bundles. It's not only a chance to read the authors I know and love but it's also a wonderful opportunity to sample new authors without breaking the bank. And that's always a win-win in my book! I've already read quite a few of the stories so far and they have all been well crafted, well written and well edited. Each and every one of the stories included in this compilation are original, unique, exciting, riveting, romantic and sinfully seductive. They have all been fascinating and completely captivating with wonderfully engaging characters who have captured not only my imagination but also my heart. This collection is filled to the brim with heart-pounding  adventure, magic and heartwarming, albeit sometimes heartbreaking, romance. If you love paranormal/supernatural romance, it's in this bundle. Or, if you're a science fiction fan, you're covered. Prefer magic and fantasy - it's also included. Love adventure - something for you too! There's most definitely a little ""someum-someum"" for everyone! If you're anything like me, once you pick it up and begin reading, you won't be able to put it down until the last page is read. As far back as I can remember, I have always loved to read. Even as a small child, reading was always my most cherished pastime and to this very day, it still remains my favorite. Through the wonder of books, I've escaped my life and explored countless, incredible worlds filled with magnificent settings and remarkable characters. I've read an incalculable number of books in my time and a large number of those have been multi-author bundles and I can say with absolute certainty, this is one of the best, if not the best, that I have read to date. As a matter of fact, once I started reading, it was almost impossible for me to stop. Below are a few of my thoughts on the stories I've finished.1) Carina Wilder is one of my all-time favorite authors. Her offering is Hunted, a riveting and very imaginative spin on the mythological character, Herne the Hunter, God of the Wild Hunt. Carina takes a tale of myth and legend and brings it to life and in the process, has restored my belief in the power of love. Ella traveled from Manhattan to England to find a reprieve from her down-spiraling life but found so much more than she ever expected. By taking a chance and a leap of faith, love and happiness can truly be found only a myth and festival away. It's just so dreamy. Sigh.....I loved it! Totally enthralling!2) Renee George is another of my favorite authors. Her offering, A Door to Midnight, is a story based on her Midnight Shift World Series. This was one of the sweetest stories in the collection and is also based on a character from fantasy, myth and lore - a chimera. Marcus Tsavaras is more than just a reclusive, mysterious and wealthy businessman. He's also a creature born from death, forced to live under an eternal curse but is finally able to find a life of peace and acceptance through a powerful gift of unselfish love. The story reinforces my belief that true love can defeat the greatest foe and can truly conquer all. Absolutely enchanting!3) Kilt in Space (Space Grit Series) by Ella Drake is one of the cutest stories in the collection. It is a delightful science fiction bursting with adventure, humor and sexy romance. Ella was a new author for me and this was my first time reading any of her work but it certainly won't be my last. This story reminds me that beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder and what some would perceive as a monster, may also be something which is so much more. I absolutely loved it! A deliciously sexy and quite humorous Sci-Fi Delight!4) Prince of Flight by Mandy Roth is a deliciously sexy tale and part of her King of Prey Series. Keonae is a not only a man of high birth, position and power but also a prince of the royal hawks. Scarred and disheartened after a devastating loss and betrayal, Keon leads a solitary and unhappy existence, all the while mourning the life he lost. His life is now one of self imposed exile in the human realm, refusing to love or be loved - until her - Lark. When fate steps in, Keon is forced to accept his destiny and a love he thought he would never have. Absolutely spell-binding! Mandy Roth is another of my all time favorite authors!5) Stranded with a Cajun by Michelle Pillow is a delightfully entertaining story based  on her Captured by a Dragon Shifter Series. Michelle became one of my favorite authors when I began following her books about the shifters of the planet Qurillixen several years ago and since, I've tried to read every book in the series. Each and every one of Michelle's stories are always exceptionally well crafted and written. This is a combination of paranormal and science fiction since the dragon shifters in the story, although believed to be originally from earth, are now from a planet called Qurillixen and travel to earth through a portal connecting the two planets (the equivalent of a worm hole) controlled by the royal families. Drake, also known as Dimosthenis, is not of royal blood and thereby forbidden to use the portal to travel to Earth to find a human female for a mate. Oh, did I forget to mention the entire planet suffers a shortage of women and very few females are even born on their world. Oh my! They need females and Drake is the last of his line and is in need of a mate. When did a little thing like permission and punishment ever stop a man when he's in need of a woman??? A fun-filled drago-licious adventure!6) Alien Disruption, part of the Captured by Aliens Series, by Jaide Fox is another delightful surprise in this collection. Jaide is another first time author for me but I will definitely be reading more of her work in the future. I had no idea when I started reading this story that it takes place near the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia. I live near the Okefenokee Swamp and have taken the tour many times. I wonder how many space ships I missed seeing during the tour!??! Or how many Big-Foot Aliens!?!? A delightful new spin on Big Foot! I loved it! Deliciously cute and sexy!7) A Damned Deed, part of The Deed Brothers Series, is a story by another of my favorite authors, Michele Bardsley. She has a delightfully devilish sense of humor that compares to no other author I know. And she definitely puts it to good use in every one of her books and this one was no exception. Athena Davis is one capable but very tough cookie. She lives for her job and her one-eyed pit bull, Max, who just happens to be female. Athena is a hired gun(basically an assassin) who takes no prisoners and makes no apologies - ever. After a devastating loss of her family, she has survived by refusing to love or be loved. She lives her life on the road, moving from job to job and place to place by driving her Demon(her car) with her beloved pittie along for the adventure - until her current target, Adam Deed, turns out to be more than she could have ever imagined. But what can you expect from a devilishly handsome, half angel and half demon hybrid who acts like he could eat you up and enjoy every morsel! Oh my! Let's not forget about all of his supernatural brothers and sisters who insist on joining the party! Oh, and their seriously creepy and very evil dad! Oh my goodness! Seriously sexy and delectably entertaining!Well, that's enough from me. I think you get the picture. I love everything so far and I seriously need to get back to my reading. I highly recommend this bundle and I feel sure, you will find several stories you will enjoy. Fabulous entertainment and a monster of a deal!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QRL7GV9ZYDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149F9VV0#wasThisHelpful","R21QRL7GV9ZYDR","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: Because He Breaks MeSeries: Because He Owns MeDesignation: Book Five, An Alpha Billionaire Multi-Installment Serial, NOT a Standalone Story, Does include CliffhangerAuthor: Hannah FordReading Edition: Kindle UnlimitedHeat Level: Scorching HotMy Rating: FIVE DIVINELY ENTERTAINING STARS *****Yowza! Because He Breaks Me is the fifth riveting installment in the sinfully seductive new serial, Because He Owns Me, by Hannah Ford and may I just say - WOW! Like really, really WOW! Please be aware, as I stated previously, this is an ongoing serial and there will be multiple installments. If you haven't read Books One thru Four of the series, PLEASE STOP HERE. I began reading Ford's work a few months ago when I discovered her What He Wants Series. She seems to specialize  in serialized multi-installment novels with each release being the equivalent of one or two chapters totaling 35 to 50 pages each. I find that I actually enjoy this concept very much as long as the books are released weekly or bi-monthly and hers generally are. Each book is a quick enjoyable read and perfect for what I like to call a palette cleanser - something to stop sensory overload, relax my mind and enjoy in between heavy, full-length novels. Ms Ford is exceptionally talented in crafting realistic stories with complex characters and suspenseful plot twists. She also excels at maintaining the momentum of the story throughout the entire book without having to use empty filler dialogue to pace the continuation of the plot. If it's there, you better believe it means something and will be important to the story at some point. Her stories are fast paced and always filled with unexpected, suspenseful and surprising twists at every turn. She keeps us guessing and on our toes, wondering what will happen next. She has quickly become one of my favorite authors. The story is exciting, enchanting, romantic, seductive and arousing. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with alternating his and her points of view although the main POV seems to come from Adriana O'Connor aka ""Lemon"", the female lead of the story. The dialogue is smart, snappy, raw and compelling. The characters are powerful, captivating, complex, engaging, intriguing and sexy as sin. Ford skillfully crafts these elements into an enticingly sweet cocktail of adult romance with a dash of mystery, suspense and a very erotic twist of BDSM. This story grabbed me from the beginning and won't let go! I can't seem to get enough of Callum and Lemon! It's absolutely captivating! Ford keeps us guessing and on our toes - again!Book One: This story features recent college graduate Adriana O'Connor who has recently moved from Michigan to New York City to find a job, hopefully in a publishing house and start her new life. Although not unfamiliar with the ways of the world, she is quite naive. And apparently, she is also quite submissive as is quickly discovered by handsome, charismatic billionaire Callum Wilder, CEO and Founder of Wilder Holdings, LLC. Adriana has agreed to meet Nathan, whom she met on a dating app, for a blind date at Whipped, a club located in Midtown Manhattan. Nathan is a no-show and leaves the lovely Adriana waiting alone. Adriana is totally unaware that whipped is a BDSM Light Club and is caught totally off guard when she catches the eye of someone else... someone dark, handsome and much more experienced...someone who wants to dominate and own her...for only one night. What? One night??? Handsome billionaire  Callum Wilder is immediately taken with the innocent young beauty sitting alone in the bar but Callum does not date nor does he do relationships. So what does he want with the lovely, innocent Adriana??? Well. he wants one night only of complete possession and mind-blowing sex! What??? Yep, one night and what arrogant and self assured Callum Wilder wants, he pursues and conquers - for one night only, of course! Oh my! But will he be able to conquer and claim the guileless inexperienced Adriana??? Or will she turn down his unabashed invitation???Book Two: Callum Wilder is a man on a mission and that mission is to possess the fair skin beauty Adriana, ""Lemon"" as he likes to call her, for one night. She ran away from him at the club and tried to put the entire incident out of her mind. But apparently it was never out of Callum's mind because somehow he finds her the very next day and all but demands that she join him for lunch. Of course it's not a lunch date because the arrogant Callum Wilder doesn't do dates. Riigghhtt.......not a date then!!! He's determined to have her and still wants her to submit to him for one night. Can he convince her to reconsider and accompany him on a business trip to Florida where he intends to have his wicked way with her - for only one night, of course!  Nope, she refuses his offer until........Well, I'll never tell! Yep, the unworldly Adriana is definitely in way over her head with the sophisticated, charming and very dominant Callum Wilder and if she isn't careful, she may just find herself swimming with a shark! Oh my gracious!  This is the one we've been waiting for.....Does she or doesn't she??? And who is Rose??? I'm dying to know!Book Three: Well, I'll go ahead and let the cat out of the bag! In Book Two we did learn that yes, she did accompany him on his private jet to his luxurious home in Florida for his ""business"" meeting. And yes she agreed to finally have sex with him, but....are you sitting down? Before he would touch her at all, she had to sign a privacy and a nondisclosure statement and an ironclad contract agreeing that it would be for ONLY one night; she was to never disclose any details, she could never tell anyone and she could never, ever contact him for any reason - no exceptions! And if by chance they ever meet again, she was to act as if she doesn't even know him at all? What the heck? And if that isn't enough, she also had to agree to be his submissive for the night, completely submit to his every command and to do anything and everything he wanted! Oh my! Surely, Adriana told him to take a long walk off a short pier, right? Wrong! And once their one night was over, he flew her back home to NYC without barely a word and dropped her like yesterday's garbage. Adriana is hurt, humiliated and brokenhearted. And just when she thinks her life is going down the toilet, she receives a call inviting her to a job interview at Archway Publishing. Did she even apply there? She's completed so many applications, she can't even remember but Adriana has a strong feeling that Callum may have had something to do with her job offer. And guess what? He did! What will Adriana do now? Will she or won't she accept the job?  Since returning from Florida after his one night with Adriana, Callum  is haunted by the her. Thoughts of making love to her consume his every waking moment. He can't concentrate on his work and that has never happened to him before - ever. He knows he can never be with her again. He simply can't loose control and break his one night only rule but damn, thoughts of her and her beautiful body are driving him insane? So, what's a handsome billionaire to do?  I'll never tell!Book Four: Adriana now has a new boss and a new job at Archway publishing, all thanks to Callum's recommendation. There's only one little problem - she isn't allowed to have a personal relationship with any of Archway's clients and Callum is definitely a client. Well, maybe there are actually two problems; the second one being that Callum won't leave her alone despite the contract he made her sign stating that she would never see or contact again. It seems Callum can't and won't abide by his own rules. Trying to conceal her past and current relationship from her boss, Kriesten, is becoming increasingly more difficult when Callum seems intent on breaking her resolve to not see him. And when she does see him, she simply can't resist him. What's a girl to do??? Why be literally kidnapped from a work related party by the handsome billionaire, of course!!!Callum Wilder has become a man possessed. He can't stop thinking about the beautiful luscious Lemon. He can't stand seeing another man touch his Lemon. He's breaking his own rules and doing the one thing he vowed to never do. But he's determined to not only possess her but own her as well - whether she likes it or not. Callum Wilder always gets what he wants and he wants Adriana - no matter the cost. No cost is too great for his lovely sweet Lemon. But will Lemon ever agree to his terms once he confesses the truth??? We'll see! Oh my goodness!Book Five:After another wonderful night with Callum, he has once again deserted Adriana after a night of wild sex leaving her alone at his apartment after quite literally kidnapping her from an Archway party. When Rose shows up the next morning and lets herself into the apartment with her own key, Adriana suddenly realizes the truth - this is not his actual residence but only an apartment he maintains apparently for sex. Huh? But before she can make a hasty retreat, Rose takes a drug overdose. Adriana is forced to call 911 and becomes swept up in the drama with Rose resulting in a confrontation with Callum at the hospital where she walks away from him determined to end their relationship for good - again. After refusing to accept his calls throughout the day, Callum breaks into Adriana's apartment that evening where she succumbs to his sexual advances and her feelings for him - again. After a wonderful night with Callum filled with surprising, first-time ""vanilla sex"", he finally confesses the true nature of his past and current relationship with Rose and makes Adriana a proposition - one in which she must sign another contract but in this one, he will own her - totally and completely - and control every aspect of her life. Unfortunately, the conditions will not be reciprocated; she will have no claim on him at all. What will Adriana decide? Will she once again be swept away by his charm and the feelings she has for him? Will she accept or refuse the terms of this relationship with Callum? And why is Jason, Callum's neighbor from Florida suddenly in New York and is he following Adriana??? We'll see!!!Buckle up my lovelies! Here we go again! I can hardly wait for the next installment!

"Book: Protected by HimSeries: Chosen by HimDesignation: Book Eight of a Multi-Installment Serial, NOT a Standalone StoryAuthor: Ellie DanesReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedHeat Level: MildMy Rating Five StarsWow! Ellie Danes has done it again! And just what has she done, you ask? She has released another spellbinding installment in her Chosen by Him series. Oh my! Protected by Him is the eighth book of the serial and is filled to the brim with deceit, lies, blackmail, betrayal, lust, love and consequences. And yes, I said series as in serial which means multiple installments and dare I say it, cliffhangers. Yikes! Each installment is relatively short and is perfect for a quick break or lunchtime read. So be forewarned, if you haven't read the first seven books of the series, please stop here. Although I recognize this may not be everyone's cup of tea, I personally love the excitement and anticipation of a great serial and look forward to those nail biting, what will happen next endings. And Danes delivers in spades! The story is fresh, modern, exciting, believable, riveting, romantic, arousing, seductive and sensual. This is not erotica but does contain some adult material including some very tasteful sex scenes. The dialogue is smart and flows well. The characters are the most important component in this story as seems to be the case in most of Danes books. They take center stage and as the story unfolds and Danes does an exceptional job of the development of her two main players. The book is written in the first person with his and her alternating points of view from the two primary players. However, all the characters are captivating, intriguing, engaging and realistic. She expertly combines these elements to craft a deliciously romantic and delightfully entertaining read. Twenty four year old MBA student, Summer Farris, is beautiful, intelligent and hard working and wants nothing more to excel and become successful in her field. Her current goal is to win a business internship with her professor, handsome, billionaire Chase Kerns but when she is passed over for one of the five coveted slots, she is beyond devastated. She and her roommate, Alyssa, decide to drown their mutual disappointment at a local bar just off campus where she sees Professor Kerns with one of his colleagues. After several drinks of liquid courage, Summer makes a fool of herself by confronting her professor and leaves the bar, embarrassed and quite a bit tipsy. She decides to walk home but is conveniently offered a ride by her professor. Hmmm.......I wonder if the handsome Professor Kerns is as attracted to the lovely Summer as she is to him. It seems he is! Oh my! Sparks Fly! This could be the recipe to either an exciting, loving relationship or a perfectly horrible disaster once Summer's ex-boyfriend, Brandon Porter enters the equation with intentions to blackmail sweet Summer. He needs money and his price to go away has risen from $10,000 to $500,000. He demands that Summer help him fleece Chase Kerns or else he will use his hacking skills to destroy not only Summer's life but also the people she cares about - again! What the heck? I wonder what Summer will decide??? Will she allow herself to be manipulated by Brandon or will she confess everything to Chase before it's too late? Or will Brandon succeed in his scheme of blackmail, fraud and extortion??? Oh my! Will love prevail or will Chase be hurt, used and betrayed - again??? Hmm....I wonder? No spoilers from me but I will say this......Beautiful, intelligent grad student who is hardworking, independent, career-minded, ambitious and very competitive-check! Handsome, charismatic billionaire who owns his own business but is also a college professor and is head over heels in lust with one of his students-check!

An Unexpected Affair is the fabulous debut novella by up and coming new paranormal author Lorlei Moone and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. I would never have guessed that this was Moone's very first release. Although this release is the first book in Moone's Scottish Werebear Series, it is a standalone read and the couple do get their very sweet happy ending. No spoilers from me but I have a feeling that we'll see more of Clarice and Derek in the second book. The story is fast-paced but comfortable, well crafted and held my attention. The narrative is well written in the third person with alternating his and her points of view. The dialogue is smart, well executed and flows beautifully. The entire book is exceptionally well constructed, formatted and edited. It is always such a pleasure to read a book that is so well done. I found the characters to be very engaging and was able to connect with them immediately. Moone skillfully combines these elements into a captivating, easy to follow paranormal tale filled with adventure, heartbreaking angst and a large helping of sweet romance. I loved everything about this story and would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves paranormal romance. I very much look forward to reading the second book in this series.Beautiful, curvaceous Clarice Adler is fighting the clock and losing the battle. She's trying to recover from a painful breakup with her cheating, now ex-boyfriend and seems to have lost her muse somewhere along the way. Her deadline is looming and she's under tremendous pressure from her editor. She's lost faith in the whole idea of love and the complete irony of the situation is Clarice is a romance novelist. It's actually her job to write about love but the words refuse to come. So, how does a romance novelist write about love when she's completely stopped believing in it herself? What's an author to do??? Well, she rents a cabin at the secluded Scottish Isle of Hope for her very own private writer's retreat, of course. And does she find her muse??? Oh yes, she finds it...um...him, all right, and a whole lot more than even she could ever have imagined....or ever be able to write about!

He does rent a few holiday cabins on his property to the occasional tourist for additional income but has never encountered any problems - until now. When his beautiful new tenant, Clarice Adler, shows up, his whole life changes in an instant. No matter how hard he tries to deny it, his bear instantly recognizes his mate but there's just one little problem. Well, maybe a few little problems. First, she's not a bear; she's human. Oh my!

There's Snow Escape is the seventh release in her bestselling, mega-hit Paranormal Dating Agency Series and Taiden has knocked it out of the park - again! The story is original, well crafted, imaginative, exciting, cute, sweet, humorous, romantic, sensual and arousing. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the third person with alternating his, her and his points of view.

I say paranormal but it's really a cross between paranormal, science fiction and a little bit of rock and roll. Just kidding! There is no rock and roll but it does rock! The dialogue is smart, sassy, amusing, well executed and flows beautifully. Taiden's books are always formatted professionally, well edited and the covers are beautiful. But my favorite element of this series is the characters. They are always well developed, captivating, engaging, endearing, sexy and at times, laugh out loud funny. Taiden's characters capture my heart and I immediately connect with them. Her heroines are always intelligent, big, bold and beautiful women with sassy attitudes and kind hearts. These girls are definitely the women you would choose to be your best friends. And her heroes....Oh my! They are strong, handsome, sexy alpha males who know what they want and have no problem going after it. You know, the kind of man every girl dreams of marrying. Sigh.....

"Title: Dangerous WeeksSeries: Alpha Billionaire Romance SeriesDesignation: Book Seven of Multi-Installment Serial, NOT a StandaloneAuthor: Sarah J BrooksReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING STARS *****Love it! Dangerous Weeks is the seventh riveting installment of Sarah J Brooks' seductive new serial and I must say, I'm totally captivated. This is a serialized story so if you haven't read the previous books in the series, PLEASE STOP HERE. Okay, I realize that multi-installment serials may not be for everyone but what can I say, I love them. And Sarah Brooks just got my attention! This is my first time reading anything written by Brooks but I can say with absolute certainty, it won't be my last. I am so hooked on this series! I love the concept of this story:  a strong female lead with BRAINS. She's not only beautiful but intelligent as well and the icing on the cake: she has a mind of her own. Of course, we all love a handsome alpha male lead and love them all the more when they're charming and intelligent. And let's not forget - filthy rich! Who can resist that combination??? The story is exciting, sensual, arousing, well crafted, suspenseful and completely held my attention. Once I started reading, it was easy to immerse myself in the story and I wanted more. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with his, his and her points of view, which I love. Yep, I said his twice and that wasn't a mistake. There are now two men weighing in with their take on the events as they happen. That's all I can say without giving too much away but what I can say is this - I love it! I believe this adds to the depth and complexity of the story and definitely gives us a better understanding of the characters, their feelings and motivations. The dialogue is smart, snappy, easy to follow and flows effortlessly. And now for the best part, the characters. They are fascinating, captivating, intriguing, engaging and relatable. The chemistry between the three main characters is convincing and at times, quite perplexing but in a good way. Quite simply, it is off the charts sexy and thrilling! Brooks skillfully crafts these elements into a fabulously entertaining contemporary romance  with a twist. What kind of twist, you ask? Well, it's a little too early to tell but I strongly suspect that we will have a little mystery and suspense in the near future. (And we most definitely do!) And please forgive me for being crass, but we didn't have to wait until halfway through the book for the mind-blowing sex! Oh no, Brooks rewarded us in the very first installment and gave us a little taste of how well suited these characters are for each other. I can hardly wait to read the next installment!Beautiful graduate student Becka Jasper is definitely on her way to a very promising and successful career. She's had to work hard for everything she has and intends to work even harder to get what she wants. When Oliver Weeks, CEO of Neuotova is invited to speak as a guest lecturer by Dr Evans, Becka's professor/advisor/mentor, she is able to snag an interview for an internship with Oliver Weeks, CEO of Neuotova, a major food research corporation. But Becka is immediately thrown off her game when she first sets eyes on Oliver Weeks and is more than just a little attracted to him. She immediately feels the chemistry between them and is conflicted over her decision to seek a job with the handsome, charismatic CEO. And it seems Oliver Weeks may be attracted to her as well.  Oh my!Billionaire Oliver Weeks has worked long and hard to achieve his success. The only area in which he hasn't been successful is his personal life. He works hard but plays little and very seldom has time for a relationship with the fairer sex. Most of his dates are arranged by his personal assistant and never the same woman. He has no interest in love or developing feelings for anyone - until now. One look at Becka Jasper is all it takes for alpha male Oliver to know that he wants her and not just as an intern in his lab. She's not only beautiful but she's also brilliant. He wants her in his life as well as his bed and he's not accustomed to being told no. Oliver Weeks always gets what he wants and he wants Becka. Oh my! Will Oliver be able to convince Becka to accept his offer - both of them??? Hmm...I wonder???Book Two:Becka has accepted Oliver's requests for several dates and their chemistry is off the charts but she's still conflicted over accepting an internship with his company while having a personal relationship with the handsome CEO. She has little time to consider her dilemma when she's broadsided with some devastating news. Becka and Dr Evans have spent countless time and much effort on a special research project for Protame, a healthy replacement for the artificial sweetener Aspartame. Becka has worked tirelessly on this project and has also chosen it as the subject as her dissertation. The university has suffered budget cutbacks and as a result, they have lost funding for their project. Oh no! What will she do? Maybe she should tell Oliver. Will Oliver be able to help??? Oliver is more determined than ever to have the beautiful Becka in his bed and in his lab. And he's not above a little scheming and manipulation to get what he wants. But let's not forget, Becka has a mind of her own and may have a few surprises in store for the wealthy determined billionaire! It's a battle of wills and both are determined to get what they want but will it be each other??? Or are there other secrets and motivations at play? Hmm... I wonder???Book Three:Oliver weeks did indeed help the lovely Becka and donated the money anonymously to the University to fund her Protame project and of course he has his own selfish reasons. He wants Becka and if that means making her feel somewhat indebted to him, then so be it. He's certainly not above using every dirty trick in the book to get what he wants but he certainly never expected her proclamation of never mixing business with pleasure. She's refused to sleep with him if she accepts the position at Neuotova! Huh? Oh yes, she definitely laid the law down to him. But when had he ever allowed a little thing like an emphatic no to ever stop him from getting what he wants? Never! He'll do whatever it takes; he's determined to have the beautiful, intelligent Becka?Becka knows it was Oliver that donated the money but does finally agrees to accept the internship with Neuotova, but she has a caveat of her own. If she accepts the internship as a paid position, she will be unable continue her personal relationship with Oliver. What? Nope, her conscience won't allow it. She will not allow a personal relationship to compromise her work ethics. Or will she? While doing some research on Oliver and his company, Becka uncovers some very disturbing allegations against Oliver and his company Neuotova, allegations charging animal cruelty by the use use of animals in their research, experimentation and testing. Huh? Becka is a researcher after all so who better to investigate? Becka is invited by her advisor Dr Evans to teach a Food Science Ethics class and at her very first class she meets student Ethan Hernandez who makes some serious charges regarding the use of animal testing against Neuotova. But are they true or simply conjecture and who is Ethan Hernandez? There's only one way to discover the truth and if it means more research into company files, then that's a chance she's willing to take. She just hadn't expected a perfect opportunity to fall into her lap when Oliver offers her a job as his assistant and a two week working vacation to Italy. Huh? Oh my! Can she work so closely with him and still be objective? I think not!Book Four:Apparently, Becka can't remain objective, not when Oliver insists on whisking her away to Italy for a working vacation with lots of shopping, romantic dinners and lots and lots of dreamy sex. Oh my! But nothing can last forever and so they must return home to their lives which for Becka includes discovering the truth about Oliver. Becka has received an email from Ethan promising absolute proof of his accusations against Oliver. Becka  reveals this information to Oliver but she now must decide whether to meet with Ethan. But Ethan has decided to turn up the heat, not only in his effort to turn Becka against Oliver but also to pursue her for himself as well. What? Becka is now caught in the middle of the two powerful men and has no idea which one to believe. And the latest revelation from Oliver about Ethan has her even more confused! Talk about dropping a bomb! Oh my glory! I never saw that one coming! So, what's a girl to do when two handsome, wealthy men are both supposedly vying for her affection? Sleep with one and kiss the other??? Oh my!Book Five:After agreeing to a meeting with Ethan and sharing a mind-blowing kiss with him, Becka comes to the sudden realization that she's actually attracted to both handsome men but how is that even possible? How can she be attracted to both Oliver and Ethan when obviously one of the men is lying to her? But who is lying and who is telling the truth? If she's to believe the documents Ethan has shown her, then Oliver is paying Ethan to guarantee his silence, therefore Oliver is not being honest. Or Ethan is blackmailing Oliver and extorting money but for what reason? Documents can be forged, right? Oliver has become an important part of her life but just what is her relationship with him? Does he truly care about her and her welfare? Is she is his girlfriend or merely flavor of the month? And to further complicate the situation, it now seems that Ethan wants Becka for himself and intends to steal her away from Oliver. Oh my! Ethan doesn't give Becka long to contemplate her questions. The morning after their impromptu kiss, Ethan unexpectedly arrives at Neuotova demanding to see Oliver and then..... immediately envelops her in his arms and crushes her with a hot smoldering kiss just as Oliver is opening his office door! OMG! Oliver goes ballistic and Ethan retaliates. Allegations, threats and insults are hurled by each and it seems they may come to blows. What a nightmare! (Or is it? Hmm...What woman doesn't want two hot as heck billionaires fighting over her? But is it really her they're fighting over?) Apparently both men have been less than forthright with Becka. Each has lied to her and kept a shocking secret. But Oliver just let the cat out of the bag! Oh my goodness! Oliver is determined to keep Becka no matter the cost but that Ethan is such a devilishly naughty boy! After all, what's a little deceit, betrayal, blackmail and extortion among ......I'll still never tell!Book Six:After discovering the secret of Oliver and Ethan's relationship, Becka is determined to leave her troubles behind, at least for the weekend. She needs time to think and that means time away from both Oliver and Ethan.

After a wild night partying, Becka tries to contact Oliver but his phone is answered by none other than Ethan! Ethan? Oh my goodness! And when Becka demands to know what's going on, Ethan refuses to explain, insisting that if she wants to know, she must immediately come to Oliver's home. What the heck? Why is Ethan at Oliver's home and where is Oliver?Book Seven:Ethan is in full seduction mode and plans to have Becka in his arms and in his bed. Well, actually it would be Oliver's bed since it's in his house but at this point, he doesn't really care. Oliver's not here but he is and he wants Becka. He's never wanted a woman so much in his entire life. So what if he had to tell a little lie to get her here! All's fair in love and war!Becka finds herself succumbing to Ethan's charm but who could blame her? He's smokin' hot and for some reason, she feels inexplicably drawn to both men. Oliver has disappeared again without even as much as a goodbye much less an explanation so why should she feel guilty about being with Ethan in Oliver's home? Maybe she's misjudged Ethan after all or so she thinks until she finds blood in the wine cellar. It must be Oliver's blood. Is Oliver still alive and if so, where is he? Oh my! Surely Ethan would never harm Oliver, would he? After all, they are former business partners and ....... Nope, I'll still never tell! But I will say this....Ethan has certainly stepped up his game! But will Becka fall for it??? Secrets and lies are revealed as the suspense continues to build! Who should Becka trust??? No spoilers from me but I will say this....Buckle up and hang on!

I originally read this story when it was first released in the Shifters Gone Alpha Bundle several months ago. In fact, I loved it so much that I wanted to share my thoughts on this story with you, and NO, I did NOT receive a free copy of this book in exchange for my review. I just love Mills' work, so I read them using the Kindle Unlimited program. These books can be read as standalone novellas but in order to gain maximum enjoyment from the story, I would highly recommend reading the books in order. You will never regret it!

"Title: Secrets and LiesSeries: The Diamond ClubDesignation: Book Five of a Multi-Installment Serial, NOT a Standalone,Author: Ellie Danes and Lily KnightReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE SEXY STARS *****The Diamond Club: Secrets and Lies is the latest fabulous series from two of my favorite new authors, Ellie Danes and Lily Knight. This is my first time reading a collaboration between these two very gifted authors but mixing their unique blend of talents makes this series even more appealing. Please be advised, this is a five part multi-installment serial and NOT a standalone read. Each installment contains 30 to 40 pages and the first four do end with a cliffhanger. This is the fifth and final installment so if you haven't read the previous four books in the series, PLEASE STOP HERE. I realize this may not be everyone's cup of tea, but what can I say - I love a great serial. They're always a quick read and I get lots of variety since it enables me to read more stories; plus, I do love a great cliffhanger! The story is original, unique, realistic, fast-paced, exciting and seductive. The narrative is well written in the first person with his and her points of view. The dialogue is smart, snappy, well executed and flows naturally. The characters are captivating, intriguing, engaging, sexy and relatable. I immediately fell in love with the male and female protagonist of the story and quickly became completely vested in the lives of both characters. I found the book to be well developed, well written, well edited, moves at a quick but comfortable pace and is very pleasurable to read. This is multi-installment serial and NOT a standalone read. If you haven't read the previous books in the series, please STOP here.Book One:Twenty-six year old waitress and aspiring author, Alicia Valerio is having a typical day working at Afternoon Delight, a local, upscale, beach side bistro and neighborhood landmark - or was until handsome, charismatic, billionaire Ryan Jensen walks in and is seated in her section. Now it seems she's all thumbs and has two left feet. So, Alicia is more than just a little surprised when he introduces himself and after only a short conversation, a few choice curse words and a very unpleasant accident resulting in Ryan being soaked with his own beer, he asks her for a date - for today. That's right! He wants her to take off work and be his date for a small party on his boat which turns out to be a yacht! Oh my! And, the icing on the cake - he offers to pay her a thousand dollars for her to be his plus one. Huh? Surely, this handsome guy can get anyone he wants. If there is a catch, Alicia doesn't care as long as she gets paid! She's had her degree for three years but still working at Afternoon Delight while waiting for her writing career to take-off so she can publish her great debut novel. Nothing wrong with dreaming, right? Needless to say, she can use all the money she can get at this point. It takes everything she makes just to survive living on her own. What's a girl to do? Why accept, of course!Billionaire Bachelor Ryan Jensen has it all. Wealth, charm and good looks. Well, he almost has it all. What he doesn't have is a date for the party he's hosting this afternoon and evening on his yacht. The blind date arranged by his business partner just called and cancelled. That is so not cool! He hasn't had a steady girlfriend since he had been dumped a few years ago by Isabella for one of his business competitors. Apparently his friends had never really liked her and had seen her for the opportunist she really was. So, what's a handsome billionaire to do when he needs a date for his own party? Why ask his beautiful, smokin' hot waitress of course! Yeah, that one - the one that just spilled beer in his lap. But, will she be his plus one and agree to keep their payment terms a secret? We'll see!Book Two:Yes, Alicia does agree to be Ryan's plus one for the party on his yacht for $1000.00. The party went well and his date with Alicia after everyone returns to his home was spectacular. Ryan has never been as attracted to a women as he is to Alicia. Even his friends seemed to really like her and that is a must if he wants to be involved with her. Unfortunately, a drunken Reena, one of the members of his group, let the cat out of the bag about their ""club"" and now Alicia wants to know what the ""club"" is all about. While in college, Ryan, Justin, Roger and Dylan formed their own exclusive, secret club. They called it the Diamond Club. Originally, it was just the guys seeking more than just simple fun; they wanted to experience wild, heart-pounding adventure with thrills, chills and life-threatening, death-defying activities. It gave them a high like nothing else. They had become adrenaline junkies in need of extreme danger for a fix. But as time passed, the guys eventually agreed to add their girlfriends, Tammy, Lori and Reena. Fortunately, Ryan's former girlfriend, Isabella, had never been invited to join the club. Apparently everyone but Ryan had seen her for the opportunist she turned out to be. The guys all contribute equally to the club for their trips and expenses and the women have to have their own money to kick in for their entertainment and shopping which has never been a problem until now - until Alicia. Everyone else has money to burn and the rule is that the guys cannot pay for their girlfriends, but obviously Alicia doesn't have the kind of money needed to be a member of The Diamond Club. It was only supposed to be a one and done deal with Alicia but he can't stop thinking about her. Everything reminds him of Alicia and his thoughts seems to always somehow revert back to her. And with a very drunk Reena having let it slip about their club, he will either have to continue to lie to Alicia if he wants to continue seeing her or he could tell her the truth and still risk losing her. She may be just a waitress he met randomly but he really likes her. Everything about her appeals to him - not just her hot body but also her personality, her style and her confidence. She's the whole package and totally unlike anyone he's ever dated. But liking her isn't the problem. It's how well she can get along with his friends in the club, especially the women. There's also the little fact that she doesn't have access to the funds required to be a member of the club. And of course, the little matter of offering to pay her for their first date is something he would never want his friends to discover. What would they think of her then? Could she fit in with his friends? Would she even want to once he tells her the truth? What's a guy do do?Alicia dreams of becoming a successful author but her agent has shot down every suggestion she's submitted for publication and her first two book attempts were rejected by every publisher she contacted. She's completely run out of ideas but while updating the blog she started online five years ago, Waiting In My Tower, she suddenly has a thought. What if she writes an article for her blog about her surreal experience meeting Ryan and his friends. It could be essentially a blog within a blog and she could name it The Diamond Club Diaries. If by some chance they continue to see each other, she could do a weekly update all about the lives of the rich and famous and how they spend their money and their time. She would change all the names, of course, but still, it just might attract more readers and traffic to her blog which in turn would generate enough attention that may lead to a legitimate job offer as a writer. Besides, Ryan and his friends would never read her blog, would they? Hmm... Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen to me! So, with her decision made, she would continue to see Ryan but only if he reveals the truth about the club. But will he want to continue to see her? After all, she's not wealthy; she's just an ordinary, everyday waitress. Hmm...I wonder?Book Three:Yes, it seems Ryan does want the lovely Alicia. In fact, he wants her so much that he's willing to reveal all the juicy details about the Diamond Club. He's even invited her to go with the group on a white water rafting trip this weekend but Alicia has her doubts about wanting to belong to this group of billionaire boys with their toys and their ""mean girl"" wealthy girlfriends. How could a girl who waits tables ever fit in with Ryan and his friends? But she really likes Ryan and decides to give a try. Besides, if it doesn't work out, she will at least have some extra cash and a great story out of the deal. No harm, no foul, right? But is that all Alicia really wants? Unfortunately, Ryan's friends don't make it easy for Alicia and the girls bring out the claws, especially one in particular. For some reason, Tammy seems to know more than she pretends and is determined to turn everyone against Alicia and destroy any hope of her having a relationship with Ryan. What is this girl's problem? The outcome of the weekend may very well determine whether Ryan and Alicia have any hope of a future together but Ryan finally begins to see just how dysfunctional he and his friends have become but is it too little, too late? Will his realization come in time to save his possible future with Alicia?Book Four:Although the whitewater rafting weekend outing may have been a failure for Alicia's relationship with the women of the club, it seems to be very much a success for the relationship developing between her and Ryan. Alicia has continued her blog posts for her Diamond Club Diaries and it has begun to generate a lot of attention. More and more people have begun to leave positive comments and her shares have been growing exponentially with even her agent weighing in with glowing feedback. With a little luck, she just may become the latest blogging phenomenon! And that could very well mean job offers as a writer and possibly even a book deal! That would be a good thing, right? It could very well jump-start her career. Oh my! But it may also destroy her relationship with Ryan! Oh no! But she never used real names in her blog so no one would ever know the truth, right? Unless Tammy discovers her blog.....but that could never happen, right??? Wrong! What's a girl to do???After a group date turns into a disaster at a local club as a result of Justin trying to force his attentions on Alicia, Ryan comes to the realization that somewhere during the pretense with Alicia, he has begun to have real feelings for her. When he discovered Justin trying to seduce Alicia, it made him see red! He wanted to kill Justin! He loves Alicia but does she care for him as well? Or is she only dating him for the money? After Tammy's recent declaration that she knows Ryan is paying Alicia to be his girlfriend just like he did in college, Ryan has become even more concerned that someone may discover the truth and if this were to ever become public, it would surely destroy him and his company, Solas Enterprises. In a few weeks, he's hosting a huge gala to hopefully attract more investors and possibly another business partner. He can't afford any bad press, especially concerning the Diamond Club and his personal life with Alicia. Obviously, no woman would ever want to be publicly outed as a prostitute so Ryan feels safe in assuming that Alicia would never disclose their secret. Would she??? Oh my goodness!Book Five:During a disastrous group date at a local nightclub where Justin quite literally tries to rape Alicia, the crap totally hits the fan! Alicia's blog has not only been discovered but has also been revealed by Justin's girlfriend, rich-bitch Tammy. Ryan now knows that Alicia has been secretly chronicling the activities of the Diamond Club with a running commentary on her blog and as a result, his reputation and company may now be at risk. So, what's a slightly immature and reckless billionaire to do??? Why confront the woman he loves and end their relationship, of course! Oh no! oh yes! But after a near brush with death, Ryan finally realizes there are some things in life that money can't buy and one of those things is the love of a good women. But will his self discovery be too little too late??? Will Alicia finally realize there are more important things in life than becoming successful as a writer??? I wonder??? No spoilers from me but I will say this....Beautiful aspiring writer working as a waitress-check! Handsome billionaire in need of a date-check! A yacht, a party, a secret club, a blog, a mean girl, betrayal, a few secrets and lies-check! Instant attraction, explosive chemistry and seductive romance-you bet! That and a whole lot more!

She is no longer the social butterfly of her wild youth but is instead, somewhat of a recluse. Having witnessed the strange world of the paranormal and experienced the danger and death first hand, she no longer desires the exposure to anything supernatural. So when an unexpected package mysteriously appears at her door from the wealthy entrepreneur, Brandon Drake, she is more than a little puzzled. Inside the package is a dress and a note telling her that he's waiting for her downstairs in his limo. She's never even met the man and certainly has no intention of getting into his limo or ever dating him. What the heck? But never say never! Because as it turns out, it wasn't Brandan, it was his psychotic twin brother, Brendan and they are both vampires! Huh? And to make matters worse, Brendan has just kidnapped Dara - AGAIN! What the heck? Dara has been taken to Castle Drake on a secluded island where she is stripped naked and chained in a dank basement by the twins' sister, Madeline Drake. What? Dara soon discovers that there are other girls on the island and they are here to compete against each other to become the wife of Brandan and Brendan Drake! What the holy heck? But the situation gets even worse when Brandan is mortally wounded by his own brother and sister and then kicked off the roof of Drake Castle. His own twin has tried to kill him! What? Talk about an evil twin! Will Dara manage another escape? Will Brandan survive his injuries? I will give you one little tidbit. Guess who shows up to lend a gun-toting hand? Why Dara's old flame, Dennis Whiley, of course! I know ya'll remember Dennis from Bolter's Worshiped by the Bear Kings Series and he also had a small part in Shared by the Dragon Clan Series. And now, Dara is Jasmine and Jasmine is Dara. Huh? How in the name of the goddess did that happen? Brandon survived his injuries and is working with Brendan again but who will the brothers believe??? The woman who looks like Dara or the one who looks Jasmine??? And to add even more spice to this explosive cocktail, Brandon is Brendan, no that's not right - Brandan is pretending to be Brendan - again! Great Caesar's ghost, what a cluster fluster! I bet you thought I was going to say something else, didn't you! Can Dara somehow convince the brothers that she's not Jasmine? Will Brandan kill his love Dara, thinking she's really Jasmine? And talk about the mother of all cliffhanger endings! What a heart pounding plot twist! I never saw that one coming! OMG! I almost fell out of my chair! And what in the world has happened to Jasmine Whiley aka Countess Madeline aka who in the world knows who else she is? How in the world did Jasmine and the Bear Kings get involved in this? Is Jasmine really doing all these terrible things or could someone be impersonating Jasmine as well? And what is the connection between the vampire twins and Jet Strongarm? And now, Master Synrith has mysteriously reappeared along with Hades of the Destair, sisters Cheryl and Sophie Thames, evil witch/vampiress Hylee Chandra, lion-shifter Lynette Thistle, panther-shifter Gaspar Travis, Quraal, Professor Hess the Mage, Jasmine's brother Jake and Lady Glowshark with her time portal! And what in the world is Dennis up to??? What the heck? Who is the real puppet master in this dark and evil cabal? Well, it's always darkest before the dawn but the sun is peeking above the horizon. In Book Nine we finally received a glimpse behind the veil shrouding the puzzling change in behavior of Jasmine Whiley! Jasmine/Hylee has been desperately trying to set right her own timeline by manipulating past and future people and events, and apparently doesn't care who gets hurt in the process! But at least we finally discover who is initially responsible for Jasmine's sudden change from good to evil and why. And poor Dara! She's also traveled to the past and is trying to correct her timeline to save her brother Jake. She's like a cat with nine lives but keeps losing every one of them!  Even with a head start and a case filled with money, Dara just can't seem to save herself or anyone else! Hylee/Jasmine/Madeline who is now wearing the face of Dara may finally have her revenge. After all, revenge is always best served cold and her heart is absolutely frigid! She is determined to make the Drake twins suffer for the pain they inflicted upon her and her....??? I'll never tell! But having the twins murder their sweet Dara is a great start! Oh my lordy! Buckle up my lovelies! This is one heck of a ride! The story is exciting, intriguing, complex, suspenseful, original and imaginative. The characters are fascinating and captivating. I was hooked from page one and I'm still hooked! No spoilers from me but I will say this.... Handsome, sexy twin vampires-check! Beautiful human heroine-check! Danger, spellbinding drama, edge of your seat suspense, heinous enemies with unknown agendas, time travel and plot twists galore-you bet! There are so many mind-blowing, head-spinning plot twists that I'm suffering from whiplash!  Great balls of fire! There are a few problems but overall, good job! If you want a complex plot driven story with unexpected twists at every turn, then this is the series for you! One thing is certain - Rosette Bolter does have one heck of an imagination! Don't blink and don't doze! You don't want to miss anything! This book will definitely keep you on your toes! My only criticism is it's becoming somewhat repetitive so hopefully the end will come soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRERI1YRCSGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Q4W2N2#wasThisHelpful","R3HRERI1YRCSGG","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Can you tell that I really love this story? The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with a multitude of alternating points of view. Each chapter is told by one of the characters which I feel gives so much more depth, intensity and perspective to the story and adds to the complexity and understanding of the characters. The dialogue is smart, exceptionally well executed, well edited and flows effortlessly. Although the story is compelling and the dialogue is exceptional, it's truly the magnificent, comprehensive cast of larger than life characters that makes the biggest impact.

Ben and River grow much closer as they struggle to make their arduous and danger-filled journey to Ben's island home. But as our two unlikely lovers and heroes struggle to survive, the residents of the Shade are also facing new enemies and new problems of their own. Simultaneously, Jeremiah is also learning Joseph's true identity as Ben Novak and surprisingly, this information comes from an unlikely and very unexpected source. There's a new player in town and her name is Queen Nuriya Nasiri. Oh my goodness! Important pieces to the puzzle are slowly revealed only to be replaced by even more perplexing questions. Oh my!

"Title: Strife Part SixSeries: The Strife SeriesDesignation: Book Six of a Multi-Installment Serial, Not A StandaloneAuthor: Sky CorganMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFULLY WICKED STARS *****Yowza! Sky Corgan has gone and done it again! And just what has she done, you ask? She's dazzled her readers with yet another riveting serial and what a sparkler it is! Strife is her latest offering and will be released in multiple installments so please be aware, there will be cliffhangers. Each book is a relatively quick read with only approximately 40 to 45 pages which makes it perfect for a quick break or lunchtime treat. Personally, I love the excitement and anticipation of a well written serial with a great oh my god cliffhanger and Sky Corgan is a master of her trade. She knows exactly how to tease, tantalize and titillate her reader for maximum effect in order to create the pinnacle of a wonderfully entertaining experience. Strife is an extremely well written dark and compelling romance with complex characters but what is most surprising in this story is the underlying element of humor which I find that I very much enjoy. The story is told in the first person by the two primary characters, Pepper Kimbrough and Dmitri Strife, with alternating his and her points of view by chapter which just happens to be my favorite style of storytelling. Although the story is classified as a dark romance, it's anything but gloomy. It's exciting, fast-paced, appealing, realistic, romantic and seductive. The characters as always shine brightly in Sky Corgan's work and these are no exception. They are fascinating, captivating, engaging, relatable, sexy as sin and sometimes quite humorous. Corgan skillfully combines these elements into an enticing and divinely entertaining experience for her readers.Book One: Pepper Kimbrough came to Hollywood to fulfill her dream of becoming an actress. That was Plan A. Unfortunately, Plan A hasn't worked out so well. Of course, neither has her life but she's managed to survive, albeit by the skin of her teeth. She may not be innocent and vulnerable but she's definitely desperate. And hence, her current predicament - down on her knees with her head in James Sumner's lap with her mouth on his.... well, you know where her mouth is. Yep, this is now her life and this is what loosely passes for a somewhat questionable interview for a job - or at least she hopes. No, life certainly isn't beautiful, not for people like her - at least not yet. Sometimes, it's as ugly as your own worst nightmares and this is definitely one of those times. The only question: Is Pepper strong enough to survive it??? The memories of her past say no but her determination and inner strength say yes. Now it's time for Plan B: Please this jerkwad Sumner, get the job as a call girl making $500.00 an hour, save her money, go to college, then become rich and famous. But is she really willing to sell her body as well as her soul to accomplish her dream and yet somehow, still hang on to her sanity? Or ultimately risk her sanity to fulfill her dream? She's been through worse and it's not forever, right? Right!? She can do this and stay sane; she could be a escort/call girl, couldn't she? It's actually rather ironic since she had actually grown up rich and now she's only one breath away from homeless and starving. This is all worth it, isn't it? With only $9.03 left to her name, it has to be. She no longer has a choice. Or does she???Rock Star Dmitri Strife has conquered the musical stage and now he's ready to conquer the big screen stage in Hollywood with his first starring role as Brodie Grant in the upcoming new movie, Master of Payback. He's just arrived and it's his first night in ""tinsel town"". His friend John is surprising him with a night on the town and it does turn out to be quite the shock. Instead of going to a club, John is taking him to a private brothel with beautiful babes galore, all willing to submit to his every desire. Oh my! But Dmitri has had his fill of endless nights of booze, never ending parties and meaningless sex with women always looking to use him as a means for fame and fortune. He doesn't wanted to be caught up in that nightmare again and almost leaves - until he sees her - the beautiful, blonde that wanders onto the balcony where he's hidden in the shadows. She looks so innocent and so sad. He can't help himself; he needs to know her name. But surprisingly when he approaches her, she doesn't seem to recognize him. He just won't tell her who he really is so he tells her his name is Brodie Grant, the name of his movie character, instead. This night may work out after all. Hmmm.... I wonder?????Book Two:Pepper, who has been given the moniker of Alexis by her boss James Sumner, spent her first night as an escort talking with Brodie/Dmitri and NOT having sex. Huh? Nope, no sex. During their night together, Pepper/Alexis confesses to Dmitri/Brodie that she was adopted but the day after graduating from high school, her parents kicked her out with only $700 and said they never wanted to see her again. What the heck? Pepper feels like a complete failure after not being able to seduce Dmitri/Brodie and begins to have serious doubts as to whether she can actually continue this job but unfortunately she's out of options so it's this or starve. But Pepper soon realizes that she may be in way over her head. Thirty five year old Dmitri Strife is very much looking forward to meeting his co-star, Marie Overton. It has long been his dream to meet and woo the beautiful sophisticated movie star and knows this is the perfect opportunity. Apparently she doesn't feel the same since she didn't even bother to show up for the cast luncheon so there will be no date tonight with Marie Overton. So, what's a handsome, successful heartthrob to do??? Request another night with Alexis/Pepper, of course!!! Oh my! And still, no sex! But strangely, Dmitri finds that he enjoys being with Alexis/Pepper and is drawn to beauty and her innocence and is somewhat puzzled by his feelings toward Alexis. He knows an association with her could be dangerous for his career but he can't seem to stop himself. He convinces himself that it's just the easy camaraderie he experiences with Alexis and nothing more.Book Three:Dmitri has started filming and finally meets his co-star but at first, Marie seems mildly interested in him. She leaves before he can ask her out. But is he still interested in her? Or would he rather spend time  with Pepper? Hmm...Is his interest due to sympathy for Pepper's plight or possibly or is it real friendship he feels for the lovely young Pepper? Or could it be something more??? But the feelings Pepper/Alexis feel for Dmitri are far from friendly. Pepper/Alexis enjoys her time spent with Dmitri and more than a little attracted to him. She hopes to see him again and a small thread of hope is born that maybe, he may just feel something for her other than physical desire. James informs her that Dmitri has indeed requested her company again for the night.  I wonder if Pepper/Alexis will be able to seduce Dmitri this time???  And yes, Pepper/Alexis now knows that Brodie lied to her about his identity and is really Dmitri Strife! Oh my goodness!Book Four:Dmitri finally has the chance to ask Marie Overton for a date - and she accepts. But the long awaited date falls short of his actual expectations. Despite their great on screen chemistry, Dmitri is just not feeling a real connection with Marie. It seems, all Dmitri can think about is Pepper. Yep, his thoughts are filled with everything Pepper. It's only been one night since they were last together but he wants to see her again. And it also seems that Dmitri may have finally realized that he wants to do so much more than just see her and be her friend. He wants the beautiful young Pepper but will she still be the same innocent escort? Or did she have a client last night? Dmitri doesn't want anyone else to have Pepper and he's shocked at his own self revelation. He wants to be the only man to touch her beautiful body. What's a rock star to do? Request another night with Pepper, of course! No matter the cost!  This is their third night together, so will they or won't they?Book Five:They will and they do! Oh my! And it was fabulous -  or at least it was until Pepper surrendering to temptation, took a sneak peek at Dmitri's phone and saw the text message from Marie Overton. Oh no! Oh yes! Another brittle piece of Pepper's already fragile heart shatters in her chest as she realizes that Dmitri is like all the other men she's ever known, a liar, a user, a player and never to be trusted. And her conclusion about Dmitri is certainly reinforced when she sees Dmitri and Marie Overton together at a club on the same night he has already arranged with James to have her for the evening but fails to show but leaves her a note feigning a business engagement. What? And the final nail in Dmitri's coffin is Marie kissing Dmitri - on the mouth! Oh no! Oh yes! What will Pepper do now? Will Pepper still want Dmitri after becoming aware of his relationship with Marie Overton? More importantly, what will Dmitri do now that he realizes he may not want Marie Overton after all. Marie Overton is certainly not the person he imagined her to be?Book Six:As Dmitri witnesses the look of betrayal and pain on Pepper's beautiful face as a result of Marie's possessive kiss, he realizes that Pepper cares so much more for him than she claims. And surprisingly, that fact pleases him but along with that revelation also comes the realization that he wants Pepper, not Marie Overton. He now also must admit that he is falling in love with the escort, Pepper Kimbrough. Pepper may refuse to admit the truth, but it's obvious that she needs him; but even worse, he needs her just as much if not more. Oh my! The publicity of being seen with an escort could destroy his career. Unfortunately, that doesn't discourage his need for Pepper. He just needs to talk this over with someone but who can he trust? His old friend, John, of course. You remember, the one who was responsible for him meeting Pepper. Oh no! That may not have been the best idea. And just why was that such a bad idea? Because after John encourages him to break things off with Pepper, he calls and books Pepper for himself! Oh my! What now Dmitri? How will he ever get Pepper to trust him again?After a confrontation with Dmitri, Pepper arrives at her job the next night only to discover from James that Dmitri has not requested her for another night but he has recommended her to John who has requested her services for the night. What? Oh my goodness! She is sickened by the thoughts of being with another man but everything Dmitri told her were lies! Just when she's ready to change her life, he betrays her - again! Can she continue to be an escort? Does she even want to???It seems Dmitri and Pepper both have a decision to make - an important one that will affect their careers, their lives and their futures. What does each truly want? Whom does each truly want? What will they decide?

"Title: Fearful WeeksSeries: Alpha Billionaire Romance SeriesDesignation: Book Six of Multi-Installment Serial, NOT a StandaloneAuthor: Sarah J BrooksReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING STARS *****Love it! Fearful Weeks is the sixth riveting installment of Sarah J Brooks' seductive new serial and I must say, I'm totally captivated. This is a serialized story so if you haven't read the previous books in the series, PLEASE STOP HERE. Okay, I realize that multi-installment serials may not be for everyone but what can I say, I love them. And Sarah Brooks just got my attention! This is my first time reading anything written by Brooks but I can say with absolute certainty, it won't be my last. I am so hooked on this series! I love the concept of this story:  a strong female lead with BRAINS. She's not only beautiful but intelligent as well and the icing on the cake: she has a mind of her own. Of course, we all love a handsome alpha male lead and love them all the more when they're charming and intelligent. And let's not forget - filthy rich! Who can resist that combination??? The story is exciting, sensual, arousing, well crafted, suspenseful and completely held my attention. Once I started reading, it was easy to immerse myself in the story and I wanted more. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with his, his and her points of view, which I love. Yep, I said his twice and that wasn't a mistake. There are now two men weighing in with their take on the events as they happen. That's all I can say without giving too much away but what I can say is this - I love it! I believe this adds to the depth and complexity of the story and definitely gives us a better understanding of the characters, their feelings and motivations. The dialogue is smart, snappy, easy to follow and flows effortlessly. And now for the best part, the characters. They are fascinating, captivating, intriguing, engaging and relatable. The chemistry between the three main characters is convincing and at times, quite perplexing but in a good way. Quite simply, it is off the charts sexy and thrilling! Brooks skillfully crafts these elements into a fabulously entertaining contemporary romance  with a twist. What kind of twist, you ask? Well, it's a little too early to tell but I strongly suspect that we will have a little mystery and suspense in the near future. (And we most definitely do!) And please forgive me for being crass, but we didn't have to wait until halfway through the book for the mind-blowing sex! Oh no, Brooks rewarded us in the very first installment and gave us a little taste of how well suited these characters are for each other. I can hardly wait to read the next installment!Beautiful graduate student Becka Jasper is definitely on her way to a very promising and successful career. She's had to work hard for everything she has and intends to work even harder to get what she wants. When Oliver Weeks, CEO of Neuotova is invited to speak as a guest lecturer by Dr Evans, Becka's professor/advisor/mentor, she is able to snag an interview for an internship with Oliver Weeks, CEO of Neuotova, a major food research corporation. But Becka is immediately thrown off her game when she first sets eyes on Oliver Weeks and is more than just a little attracted to him. She immediately feels the chemistry between them and is conflicted over her decision to seek a job with the handsome, charismatic CEO. And it seems Oliver Weeks may be attracted to her as well.  Oh my!Billionaire Oliver Weeks has worked long and hard to achieve his success. The only area in which he hasn't been successful is his personal life. He works hard but plays little and very seldom has time for a relationship with the fairer sex. Most of his dates are arranged by his personal assistant and never the same woman. He has no interest in love or developing feelings for anyone - until now. One look at Becka Jasper is all it takes for alpha male Oliver to know that he wants her and not just as an intern in his lab. She's not only beautiful but she's also brilliant. He wants her in his life as well as his bed and he's not accustomed to being told no. Oliver Weeks always gets what he wants and he wants Becka. Oh my! Will Oliver be able to convince Becka to accept his offer - both of them??? Hmm...I wonder???Book Two:Becka has accepted Oliver's requests for several dates and their chemistry is off the charts but she's still conflicted over accepting an internship with his company while having a personal relationship with the handsome CEO. She has little time to consider her dilemma when she's broadsided with some devastating news. Becka and Dr Evans have spent countless time and much effort on a special research project for Protame, a healthy replacement for the artificial sweetener Aspartame. Becka has worked tirelessly on this project and has also chosen it as the subject as her dissertation. The university has suffered budget cutbacks and as a result, they have lost funding for their project. Oh no! What will she do? Maybe she should tell Oliver. Will Oliver be able to help??? Oliver is more determined than ever to have the beautiful Becka in his bed and in his lab. And he's not above a little scheming and manipulation to get what he wants. But let's not forget, Becka has a mind of her own and may have a few surprises in store for the wealthy determined billionaire! It's a battle of wills and both are determined to get what they want but will it be each other??? Or are there other secrets and motivations at play? Hmm... I wonder???Book Three:Oliver weeks did indeed help the lovely Becka and donated the money anonymously to the University to fund her Protame project and of course he has his own selfish reasons. He wants Becka and if that means making her feel somewhat indebted to him, then so be it. He's certainly not above using every dirty trick in the book to get what he wants but he certainly never expected her proclamation of never mixing business with pleasure. She's refused to sleep with him if she accepts the position at Neuotova! Huh? Oh yes, she definitely laid the law down to him. But when had he ever allowed a little thing like an emphatic no to ever stop him from getting what he wants? Never! He'll do whatever it takes; he's determined to have the beautiful, intelligent Becka?Becka knows it was Oliver that donated the money but does finally agrees to accept the internship with Neuotova, but she has a caveat of her own. If she accepts the internship as a paid position, she will be unable continue her personal relationship with Oliver. What? Nope, her conscience won't allow it. She will not allow a personal relationship to compromise her work ethics. Or will she? While doing some research on Oliver and his company, Becka uncovers some very disturbing allegations against Oliver and his company Neuotova, allegations charging animal cruelty by the use use of animals in their research, experimentation and testing. Huh? Becka is a researcher after all so who better to investigate? Becka is invited by her advisor Dr Evans to teach a Food Science Ethics class and at her very first class she meets student Ethan Hernandez who makes some serious charges regarding the use of animal testing against Neuotova. But are they true or simply conjecture and who is Ethan Hernandez? There's only one way to discover the truth and if it means more research into company files, then that's a chance she's willing to take. She just hadn't expected a perfect opportunity to fall into her lap when Oliver offers her a job as his assistant and a two week working vacation to Italy. Huh? Oh my! Can she work so closely with him and still be objective? I think not!Book Four:Apparently, Becka can't remain objective, not when Oliver insists on whisking her away to Italy for a working vacation with lots of shopping, romantic dinners and lots and lots of dreamy sex. Oh my! But nothing can last forever and so they must return home to their lives which for Becka includes discovering the truth about Oliver. Becka has received an email from Ethan promising absolute proof of his accusations against Oliver. Becka  reveals this information to Oliver but she now must decide whether to meet with Ethan. But Ethan has decided to turn up the heat, not only in his effort to turn Becka against Oliver but also to pursue her for himself as well. What? Becka is now caught in the middle of the two powerful men and has no idea which one to believe. And the latest revelation from Oliver about Ethan has her even more confused! Talk about dropping a bomb! Oh my glory! I never saw that one coming! So, what's a girl to do when two handsome, wealthy men are both supposedly vying for her affection? Sleep with one and kiss the other??? Oh my!Book Five:After agreeing to a meeting with Ethan and sharing a mind-blowing kiss with him, Becka comes to the sudden realization that she's actually attracted to both handsome men but how is that even possible? How can she be attracted to both Oliver and Ethan when obviously one of the men is lying to her? But who is lying and who is telling the truth? If she's to believe the documents Ethan has shown her, then Oliver is paying Ethan to guarantee his silence, therefore Oliver is not being honest. Or Ethan is blackmailing Oliver and extorting money but for what reason? Documents can be forged, right? Oliver has become an important part of her life but just what is her relationship with him? Does he truly care about her and her welfare? Is she is his girlfriend or merely flavor of the month? And to further complicate the situation, it now seems that Ethan wants Becka for himself and intends to steal her away from Oliver. Oh my! Ethan doesn't give Becka long to contemplate her questions. The morning after their impromptu kiss, Ethan unexpectedly arrives at Neuotova demanding to see Oliver and then..... immediately envelops her in his arms and crushes her with a hot smoldering kiss just as Oliver is opening his office door! OMG! Oliver goes ballistic and Ethan retaliates. Allegations, threats and insults are hurled by each and it seems they may come to blows. What a nightmare! (Or is it? Hmm...What woman doesn't want two hot as heck billionaires fighting over her? But is it really her they're fighting over?) Apparently both men have been less than forthright with Becka. Each has lied to her and kept a shocking secret. But Oliver just let the cat out of the bag! Oh my goodness! Oliver is determined to keep Becka no matter the cost but that Ethan is such a devilishly naughty boy! After all, what's a little deceit, betrayal, blackmail and extortion among ......I'll still never tell!Book Six:After discovering the secret of Oliver and Ethan's relationship, Becka is determined to leave her troubles behind, at least for the weekend. She needs time to think and that means time away from both Oliver and Ethan. She and Lisa, her best friend and roommate, take a break to have a little fun but Becka's merrymaking is constantly interrupted by thoughts of Oliver. After a wild night partying, Becka tries to contact Oliver but his phone is answered by none other than Ethan! Ethan? Oh my goodness! And when Becka demands to know what's going on, Ethan refuses to explain, insisting that if she wants to know, she must immediately come to Oliver's home. What the heck? Why is Ethan at Oliver's home and where is Oliver? Surely Ethan would never harm Oliver, would he? After all, they are former business partners and ....... Nope, I'll still never tell!

"Title: Knights Protectors Volume One (Nibbled by the Vamp and Big Bad Vamp)Series: Knight ProtectorsDesignation: Volume One Bundle consisting of Standalone Novellas One and TwoAuthor: Celia KyleMy Rating: FIVE HOT ROCKIN' STARSCelia Kyle has dazzled her readers yet again with another spectacular fun-filled new series, The Knight Protectors. The Volume One compilation includes Nibbled by the Vamp and Big Bad Vamp, the first two books of the series. In this remarkable modern day parody of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, the knights are actually vampires protecting the city of Atlanta from evil supernatural forces including pixies and dark demi-gods. Yep, I said pixies. And they are not so cutesy and definitely not nice. Each individual story is a well written short standalone novella featuring a different vamp protector and his ""fire"" with its very own happy for now ending. Each story is filled to the brim with danger, drama, action, adventure, suspense, humor and romance. And did I mention dreamy sex?  Oh yeah, totally has that as well! Does anyone remember the Carly Simon golden oldie, Nobody does It Better? You know, the one that was a theme song for one of the James Bond movies? Well, as I was reading this book, that song kept replaying in my mind because believe me when I say, nobody does it better than Celia Kyle! These stories are fast-paced, easy to follow, outrageously funny, exceptionally well written, well edited and include a fabulous cast of hilariously engaging characters. The men are handsome, strong, protective alpha males or should I say vamps,  and their women are big, bold, brave and beautiful with a generous side of sass and snark. These stories have it all! I love it! Fabulous entertainment and a rollicking good time for all! Rock on Celia Kyle!

"ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL !!!Title: VultureAuthor: Emilia BeaumontDesignation: A Stepbrother Romance Standalone NovelMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFUL STARS*****Wow! Emilia Beaumont has dazzled us yet again with another deeply emotional and truly moving stepbrother romance. After reading the title and blurb for the book, I expected a very rough and tumble story with characters you love to hate but what I read was something completely different and totally unexpected. I was utterly captivated from page one all the way to the very last page. I admit, I almost had a heart attack when I read ""The End"" and thought the book had ended a little prematurely but was happily rewarded when I turned the page and found the epilogue. Whew! That was a relief! We did get our happy ending! The story is powerful, emotional, compelling and romantic. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with alternating his and her points of view. The dialogue is smart, easy, natural, well executed and flows effortlessly. But the true stars of this novel are the remarkable characters. They are captivating, intriguing, engaging, well crafted and are quite simply, the very heart and soul of the entire story. I immediately fell in love with all the characters and became completely vested in their futures and their quest for happiness. Even the ""bad guys"" of the story were noteworthy. If an author can make me forget that I'm reading fiction and convince me to hate a character in their book, then they've done an exceptional job. Maybe hate is a strong word but believe me when I say, I strongly disliked Sara's husband, Eric Chambers and her twin sister Anita. Beaumont skillfully combines all these elements into a deeply meaningful and delightfully entertaining contemporary stepbrother romance with a twist. I absolutely loved the interaction between Sara and Harvey. It was so much fun to watch the building of a real friendship between the two protagonists. It was an absolute delight to watch their gradual blossoming love for each other with each of them being afraid to venture into unknown territory and risk their heart. This novel begins as a slow sensual burn and gradually builds to a roaring red hot blaze! This book also contains a few unexpected developments along the way and some very pleasant surprises as well! I love it!Thirty two year old Sara Chambers is completely crushed when her husband Eric is killed in an automobile accident. Her feelings stem not so much from his death but from her fear of being alone and having to suddenly fend for herself. Her actual feeling over his death could only be described as one of relief - she is relieved knowing the physical and emotional abuse she has suffered for the  three years of their marriage had come to an end. Her nightmare is finally over. Never during the entire three years  had Eric ever allowed her to have a life other than one caring for him and their home. He wanted to be the sole breadwinner and he felt her place was at home waiting for him yet Eric never seemed happy or satisfied with her or anything she did. After their wedding, Eric changed from a loving, caring fiance to a hateful, volatile tyrant. Sara became completely and totally isolated from her family and friends. So now, she has no idea what to do and has no one to whom she can turn for guidance - until her handsome stepbrother, Harvey Guyer, barrels into her life and comes to her rescue. After her mother dies unexpectedly a few months later, Sara literally shuts down from the emotional stress and shock of losing another family member but Harvey seems even more determined to help her through her grief. In addition to being her stepbrother, Harvey has also become her best friend but Sara is having very inappropriate thoughts about her stepbrother. This is so not good! Her totally hot stepbrother would never want a plain-jane like her - would he??? Could her life get any worse??? Oh, yes it can!Successful, charismatic businessman, Harvey Guyer has the reputation for being quite the ladies' man. He could have any woman he desires but he's looking for the perfect woman - a woman like his perfectly imperfect stepsister, Sara Chambers. And fortunately for Harvey, she's now a widow and even more fortunate - she's technically no longer his stepsister! Game on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDRYXP2YNHYT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015L7XLO8#wasThisHelpful","RDRYXP2YNHYT3","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: Secrets and LiesSeries: The Diamond ClubDesignation: Book Four of a Multi-Installment Serial, NOT a Standalone,Author: Ellie Danes and Lily KnightReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FOUR SEXY STARS *****The Diamond Club: Secrets and Lies is the latest fabulous series from two of my favorite new authors, Ellie Danes and Lily Knight. This is my first time reading a collaboration between these two very gifted authors but mixing their unique blend of talents makes this series even more appealing. Please be advised, this is multi-installment serial and NOT a standalone read. Each installment contains 30 to 40 pages and does end with a cliffhanger. If you haven't read the previous books in the series, PLEASE STOP HERE. I realize this may not be everyone's cup of tea, but what can I say - I love a great serial. They're always a quick read and I get lots of variety since it enables me to read more stories; plus, I do love a great cliffhanger! The story is original, unique, realistic, fast-paced, exciting and seductive. The narrative is well written in the first person with his and her points of view. The dialogue is smart, snappy, well executed and flows naturally. The characters are captivating, intriguing, engaging, sexy and relatable. I immediately fell in love with the male and female protagonist of the story and quickly became completely vested in the lives of both characters. However, there was one little thing that subverted my attention from the story. After reading the blurb on both Amazon and Goodreads, the lead characters were introduced as Ryan Jensen and Alicia Brennan. The female protagonist of the story introduced herself as Alicia Valerio. At no point in the story could I find a reference to Alicia Brennan. That's a big turn-off for me personally. Therefore, I felt it necessary to subtract a star from the rating. Other than that, I found the book to be well developed, well written, well edited, moves at a quick but comfortable pace and is very pleasurable to read. This is multi-installment serial and NOT a standalone read. If you haven't read the previous books in the series, please STOP here.Book One:Twenty-six year old waitress and aspiring author, Alicia Valerio is having a typical day working at Afternoon Delight, a local, upscale, beach side bistro and neighborhood landmark - or was until handsome, charismatic, billionaire Ryan Jensen walks in and is seated in her section. Now it seems she's all thumbs and has two left feet. So, Alicia is more than just a little surprised when he introduces himself and after only a short conversation, a few choice curse words and a very unpleasant accident resulting in Ryan being soaked with his own beer, he asks her for a date - for today. That's right! He wants her to take off work and be his date for a small party on his boat which turns out to be a yacht! Oh my! And, the icing on the cake - he offers to pay her a thousand dollars for her to be his plus one. Huh? Surely, this handsome guy can get anyone he wants. If there is a catch, Alicia doesn't care as long as she gets paid! She's had her degree for three years but still working at Afternoon Delight while waiting for her writing career to take-off so she can publish her great debut novel. Nothing wrong with dreaming, right? Needless to say, she can use all the money she can get at this point. It takes everything she makes just to survive living on her own. What's a girl to do? Why accept, of course!Billionaire Bachelor Ryan Jensen has it all. Wealth, charm and good looks. Well, he almost has it all. What he doesn't have is a date for the party he's hosting this afternoon and evening on his yacht. The blind date arranged by his business partner just called and cancelled. That is so not cool! He hasn't had a steady girlfriend since he had been dumped a few years ago by Isabella for one of his business competitors. Apparently his friends had never really liked her and had seen her for the opportunist she really was. So, what's a handsome billionaire to do when he needs a date for his own party? Why ask his beautiful, smokin' hot waitress of course! Yeah, that one - the one that just spilled beer in his lap. But, will she be his plus one and agree to keep their payment terms a secret? We'll see!Book Two:Yes, Alicia does agree to be Ryan's plus one for the party on his yacht for $1000.00. The party went well and his date with Alicia after everyone returns to his home was spectacular. Ryan has never been as attracted to a women as he is to Alicia. Even his friends seemed to really like her and that is a must if he wants to be involved with her. Unfortunately, a drunken Reena, one of the members of his group, let the cat out of the bag about their ""club"" and now Alicia wants to know what the ""club"" is all about. While in college, Ryan, Justin, Roger and Dylan formed their own exclusive, secret club. They called it the Diamond Club. Originally, it was just the guys seeking more than just simple fun; they wanted to experience wild, heart-pounding adventure with thrills, chills and life-threatening, death-defying activities. It gave them a high like nothing else. They had become adrenaline junkies in need of extreme danger for a fix. But as time passed, the guys eventually agreed to add their girlfriends, Tammy, Lori and Reena. Fortunately, Ryan's former girlfriend, Isabella, had never been invited to join the club. Apparently everyone but Ryan had seen her for the opportunist she turned out to be. The guys all contribute equally to the club for their trips and expenses and the women have to have their own money to kick in for their entertainment and shopping which has never been a problem until now - until Alicia. Everyone else has money to burn and the rule is that the guys cannot pay for their girlfriends, but obviously Alicia doesn't have the kind of money needed to be a member of The Diamond Club. It was only supposed to be a one and done deal with Alicia but he can't stop thinking about her. Everything reminds him of Alicia and his thoughts seems to always somehow revert back to her. And with a very drunk Reena having let it slip about their club, he will either have to continue to lie to Alicia if he wants to continue seeing her or he could tell her the truth and still risk losing her. She may be just a waitress he met randomly but he really likes her. Everything about her appeals to him - not just her hot body but also her personality, her style and her confidence. She's the whole package and totally unlike anyone he's ever dated. But liking her isn't the problem. It's how well she can get along with his friends in the club, especially the women. There's also the little fact that she doesn't have access to the funds required to be a member of the club. And of course, the little matter of offering to pay her for their first date is something he would never want his friends to discover. What would they think of her then? Could she fit in with his friends? Would she even want to once he tells her the truth? What's a guy do do?Alicia dreams of becoming a successful author but her agent has shot down every suggestion she's submitted for publication and her first two book attempts were rejected by every publisher she contacted. She's completely run out of ideas but while updating the blog she started online five years ago, Waiting In My Tower, she suddenly has a thought. What if she writes an article for her blog about her surreal experience meeting Ryan and his friends. It could be essentially a blog within a blog and she could name it The Diamond Club Diaries. If by some chance they continue to see each other, she could do a weekly update all about the lives of the rich and famous and how they spend their money and their time. She would change all the names, of course, but still, it just might attract more readers and traffic to her blog which in turn would generate enough attention that may lead to a legitimate job offer as a writer. Besides, Ryan and his friends would never read her blog, would they? Hmm... Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen to me! So, with her decision made, she would continue to see Ryan but only if he reveals the truth about the club. But will he want to continue to see her? After all, she's not wealthy; she's just an ordinary, everyday waitress. Hmm...I wonder?Book Three:Yes, it seems Ryan does want the lovely Alicia. In fact, he wants her so much that he's willing to reveal all the juicy details about the Diamond Club. He's even invited her to go with the group on a white water rafting trip this weekend but Alicia has her doubts about wanting to belong to this group of billionaire boys with their toys and their ""mean girl"" wealthy girlfriends. How could a girl who waits tables ever fit in with Ryan and his friends? But she really likes Ryan and decides to give a try. Besides, if it doesn't work out, she will at least have some extra cash and a great story out of the deal. No harm, no foul, right? But is that all Alicia really wants? Unfortunately, Ryan's friends don't make it easy for Alicia and the girls bring out the claws, especially one in particular. For some reason, Tammy seems to know more than she pretends and is determined to turn everyone against Alicia and destroy any hope of her having a relationship with Ryan. What is this girl's problem? The outcome of the weekend may very well determine whether Ryan and Alicia have any hope of a future together but Ryan finally begins to see just how dysfunctional he and his friends have become but is it too little, too late? Will his realization come in time to save his possible future with Alicia?Book Four:Although the whitewater rafting weekend outing may have been a failure for Alicia's relationship with the women of the club, it seems to be very much a success for the relationship developing between her and Ryan. Alicia has continued her blog posts for her Diamond Club Diaries and it has begun to generate a lot of attention. More and more people have begun to leave positive comments and her shares have been growing exponentially with even her agent weighing in with glowing feedback. With a little luck, she just may become the latest blogging phenomenon! And that could very well mean job offers as a writer and possibly even a book deal! That would be a good thing, right? It could very well jump-start her career. Oh my! But it may also destroy her relationship with Ryan! Oh no! But she never used real names in her blog so no one would ever know the truth, right? Unless Tammy discovers her blog.....but that could never happen, right??? Wrong! What's a girl to do???After a group date turns into a disaster at a local club as a result of Justin trying to force his attentions on Alicia, Ryan comes to the realization that somewhere during the pretense with Alicia, he has begun to have real feelings for her. When he discovered Justin trying to seduce Alicia, it made him see red! He wanted to kill Justin! He loves Alicia but does she care for him as well? Or is she only dating him for the money? After Tammy's recent declaration that she knows Ryan is paying Alicia to be his girlfriend just like he did in college, Ryan has become even more concerned that someone may discover the truth and if this were to ever become public, it would surely destroy him and his company, Solas Enterprises. In a few weeks, he's hosting a huge gala to hopefully attract more investors and possibly another business partner. He can't afford any bad press, especially concerning the Diamond Club and his personal life with Alicia. Obviously, no woman would ever want to be publicly outed as a prostitute so Ryan feels safe in assuming that Alicia would never disclose their secret. Would she??? Oh my goodness! The crap just hit the fan!Beautiful aspiring writer working as a waitress-check! Handsome billionaire in need of a date-check!

When I started reading this book last night, I had no idea what to expect but I can honestly say that I never dreamed it would be so completely captivating.

"Title: Beauty and the Beast (The Erotic Tale)Designation: Adult Fairy Tale Romance  Standalone NovellaAuthor: Bailey CrissmanReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: THREE PROMISING STARSTo begin, I would like to say up front, if you're attempting to rewrite a great classic story and give it your own spin, then at least make sure that your book has been well edited before it's published. I will admit, I did like the general concept the author had for this book. It was an interesting new take on a very old tale but that's where my enjoyment stopped. The grammar was fair but the sentence structure, punctuation and formatting were atrocious and could easily have been corrected with a good edit. At times the story was disjointed and confusing with points of view sometimes changing in the same paragraph. The narrative was written in the third person but it was often difficult to ascertain who was speaking or thinking. I was constantly backtracking and rereading while trying to understand the story. Had I not already been familiar with the basic premise of the story, I probably would have stopped reading midway through the book. However, it did hold my interest; I was actually curious to see how the tale would play out and how it would actually end. And to the author's credit, she did a decent job of entertaining me despite the editing errors and actually treated me to a pleasant surprise at the end. I also liked the progression of character development for Belle, the female protagonist of the story. Her transformation from helpless maiden to kick-ass heroine was truly inspired. Would I recommend this book to a friend? Probably not but I would recommend an edit and then it would most likely be a great read. In this case, I don't think I need to explain to anyone what this story is about but I will say that the author did a fair job of putting her own unique signature twist on this age old classic. I would also like to mention that if any readers object to explicit violence and sex that starts out as non consensual, then this may not be the book for you. After all, this is an erotic fairy tale. I am not a reviewer that enjoys author bashing but instead, I always try to give recognition due to a writer for their imagination, effort and hard work.

"Title: SinnedDesignation: A Priest Romance Standalone Novella, NO CliffhangerAuthor: Veronica DayeMy Rating: FIVE DIVINE STARS*****WOW! This is my very first time reading Veronica Daye's work but it certainly won't be my last!  Veronica Daye seems to certainly be ""blessed"" with an extraordinary gift as a master storyteller and in her latest sexy release, Sinned, she has demonstrated that she not only has an abundance of talent but knows how to use it and do it exceptionally well! I love it! This is a a very relaxing, enjoyable and easy to follow standalone novella which does include a wonderfully written happily-ever-after ending. The story is sweet, tender, sensual, arousing, captivating and totally held my attention. Once I started reading, I quickly became completely immersed in the story and I wanted more. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with alternating his and her points of view given by the two protagonists of the story which I believe adds to the depth and complexity of the story and definitely gives us a better understanding of the characters, their feelings and motivations. The story is exceptionally well crafted with the reader being given an introduction to the present in the first chapter and then flashing back to six years earlier giving the complete sequence of events as they unfold which gently leads the reader back to the current events as they are now happening. The dialogue is smart, well executed, easy to follow and flows effortlessly. And now for the best part, the characters. They are captivating, intriguing, engaging, relatable, at times humorous and sexy as sin. The chemistry between the two lead characters is convincing and almost palpable. Quite simply, it is off the charts hot! I found myself actually cheering for these two unlikely lovers. Daye skillfully crafts these elements into a divinely entertaining contemporary romance with a twist. I would like to add, if you object to mature subject matter and explicit sexual situations then this is probably not the book for you, but if you love an exquisitely written forbidden romance with a sharp edge filled to the brim with passion, raw emotion, powerful characters, heartbreaking angst, steamy dreamy sex and a wonderfully written, heartwarming, happily-ever-after ending, then this is definitely the read for you!Twenty eight year old Charlie McArthur has devoted the last nine years of his life into becoming the man he is today - Father Charles McArthur - and the last five of which he has been completely celibate. He left temptation behind once he graduated college and has chosen to love all mankind and to serve only God and the Church. He is no longer tempted by the pleasures of the flesh. He has taken his vows and has not once regretted his decision - until now.  After traveling to work in a remote area in Peru, Father Charles finally discovers how it truly feels to love another as much as he loves the church. But will his faith be strong enough to resist the beautiful Ava Abrams? Does he even want to resist?Twenty five year old Ava Abrams is a doctor working in a remote area of Peru with Doctors Without Borders. She was home schooled throughout her entire childhood and as a result, has found it difficult to make friends or maintain any sort of personal relationships. She's never really felt the need nor the desire until now - until she meets Charles McArthur, the charming young priest who has just arrived in the village where her clinic is located. Ava was raised a Catholic but has never been particularly religious herself. She knows the thoughts and feelings she has for Father Charles are definitely sinful. Oh my! He is one delicious hottie with gorgeous blue eyes and a body to die for - not literally, of course. But her sinful thoughts don't stop her from developing a friendship with the handsome young cleric. The problem only begins when she finds herself wanting so much more than just a casual friendship and the real dilemma begins when Father Charles appears to want more from her as well. Should she succumb to her desires and enjoy more than just a friendship with Father Charles? Will it just be a wonderful few months and nothing else? Or will the love felt by two lonely souls destroy both their lives and leave a permanent painful reminder in their hearts of how it feels to love, to have love and then lose love forever?

"Title: Secrets and LiesSeries: The Diamond ClubDesignation: Book Three of a Multi-Installment Serial, Not a Standalone,Author: Ellie Danes and Lily KnightReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FOUR SEXY STARS *****The Diamond Club: Secrets and Lies is the latest fabulous series from two of my favorite new authors, Ellie Danes and Lily Knight. This is my first time reading a collaboration between these two very gifted authors but mixing their unique blend of talents makes this series even more appealing. Please be advised, this is multi-installment serial and NOT a standalone read. Each installment contains 30 to 40 pages and does end with a cliffhanger. If you haven't read the previous books in the series, please STOP here. I realize this may not be everyone's cup of tea, but what can I say - I love a great serial. They're always a quick read and I get lots of variety since it enables me to read more stories; plus, I do love a great cliffhanger! The story is original, unique, realistic, fast-paced, exciting and seductive. The narrative is well written in the first person with his and her points of view. The dialogue is smart, snappy, well executed and flows naturally. The characters are captivating, intriguing, engaging, sexy and relatable. Unfortunately, there was one little thing that subverted my attention from the story. After reading the blurb on both Amazon and Goodreads, the lead characters were introduced as Ryan Jensen and Alicia Brennan. The female protagonist of the story introduced herself as Alicia Valerio. At no point in the story could I find a reference to Alicia Brennan. That's a big turn-off for me personally. Therefore, I felt it necessary to subtract a star from the rating. Other than that, I found the book to be well developed, well written, well edited, moves at a quick but comfortable pace and is very pleasurable to read. This is multi-installment serial and NOT a standalone read. If you haven't read the previous books in the series, please STOP here.Book One:Twenty-six year old waitress and aspiring author, Alicia Valerio is having a typical day working at Afternoon Delight, a local, upscale, beach side bistro and neighborhood landmark - or was until handsome, charismatic, billionaire Ryan Jensen walks in and is seated in her section. Now it seems she's all thumbs and has two left feet. So, Alicia is more than just a little surprised when he introduces himself and after only a short conversation, a few choice curse words and a very unpleasant accident resulting in Ryan being soaked with his own beer, he asks her for a date - for today. That's right! He wants her to take off work and be his date for a small party on his boat which turns out to be a yacht! Oh my! And, the icing on the cake - he offers to pay her a thousand dollars for her to be his plus one. Huh? Surely, this handsome guy can get anyone he wants. If there is a catch, Alicia doesn't care as long as she gets paid! She's had her degree for three years but still working at Afternoon Delight while waiting for her writing career to take-off so she can publish her great debut novel. Nothing wrong with dreaming, right? Needless to say, she can use all the money she can get at this point. It takes everything she makes just to survive living on her own. What's a girl to do? Why accept, of course!Billionaire Bachelor Ryan Jensen has it all. Wealth, charm and good looks. Well, he almost has it all. What he doesn't have is a date for the party he's hosting this afternoon and evening on his yacht. The blind date arranged by his business partner just called and cancelled. That is so not cool! He hasn't had a steady girlfriend since he had been dumped a few years ago by Isabella for one of his business competitors. Apparently his friends had never really liked her and had seen her for the opportunist she really was. So, what's a handsome billionaire to do when he needs a date for his own party? Why ask his beautiful, smokin' hot waitress of course! Yeah, that one - the one that just spilled beer in his lap. But, will she be his plus one and agree to keep their payment terms a secret? We'll see!Book Two:Yes, Alicia does agree to be Ryan's plus one for the party on his yacht for $1000.00. The party went well and his date with Alicia after everyone returns to his home was spectacular. Ryan has never been as attracted to a women as he is to Alicia. Even his friends seemed to really like her and that is a must if he wants to be involved with her. Unfortunately, a drunken Reena, one of the members of his group, let the cat out of the bag about their ""club"" and now Alicia wants to know what the ""club"" is all about. While in college, Ryan, Justin, Roger and Dylan formed their own exclusive, secret club. They called it the Diamond Club. Originally, it was just the guys seeking more than just simple fun; they wanted to experience wild, heart-pounding adventure with thrills, chills and life-threatening, death-defying activities. It gave them a high like nothing else. They had become adrenaline junkies in need of extreme danger for a fix. But as time passed, the guys eventually agreed to add their girlfriends, Tammy, Lori and Reena. Fortunately, Ryan's former girlfriend, Isabella, had never been invited to join the club. Apparently everyone but Ryan had seen her for the opportunist she turned out to be. The guys all contribute equally to the club for their trips and expenses and the women have to have their own money to kick in for their entertainment and shopping which has never been a problem until now - until Alicia. Everyone else has money to burn and the rule is that the guys cannot pay for their girlfriends, but obviously Alicia doesn't have the kind of money needed to be a member of The Diamond Club. It was only supposed to be a one and done deal with Alicia but he can't stop thinking about her. Everything reminds him of Alicia and his thoughts seems to always somehow revert back to her. And with a very drunk Reena having let it slip about their club, he will either have to continue to lie to Alicia if he wants to continue seeing her or he could tell her the truth and still risk losing her. She may be just a waitress he met randomly but he really likes her. Everything about her appeals to him - not just her hot body but also her personality, her style and her confidence. She's the whole package and totally unlike anyone he's ever dated. But liking her isn't the problem. It's how well she can get along with his friends in the club, especially the women. There's also the little fact that she doesn't have access to the funds required to be a member of the club. And of course, the little matter of offering to pay her for their first date is something he would never want his friends to discover. What would they think of her then? Could she fit in with his friends? Would she even want to once he tells her the truth? What's a guy do do?Alicia dreams of becoming a successful author but her agent has shot down every suggestion she's submitted for publication and her first two book attempts were rejected by every publisher she contacted. She's completely run out of ideas but while updating the blog she started online five years ago, Waiting In My Tower, she suddenly has a thought. What if she writes an article for her blog about her surreal experience meeting Ryan and his friends. It could be essentially a blog within a blog and she could name it The Diamond Club Diaries. If by some chance they continue to see each other, she could do a weekly update all about the lives of the rich and famous and how they spend their money and their time. She would change all the names, of course, but still, it just might attract more readers and traffic to her blog which in turn would generate enough attention that may lead to a legitimate job offer as a writer. Besides, Ryan and his friends would never read her blog, would they? Hmm... Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen to me! So, with her decision made, she would continue to see Ryan but only if he reveals the truth about the club. But will he want to continue to see her? After all, she's not wealthy; she's just an ordinary, everyday waitress. Hmm...I wonder?Book Three:Yes, it seems Ryan does want the lovely Alicia. In fact, he wants her so much that he's willing to reveal all the juicy details about the Diamond Club. He's even invited her to go with the group on a white water rafting trip this weekend but Alicia has her doubts about wanting to belong to this group of billionaire boys with their toys and their ""mean girl"" wealthy girlfriends. How could a girl who waits tables ever fit in with Ryan and his friends? But she really likes Ryan and decides to give a try. Besides, if it doesn't work out, she will at least have some extra cash and a great story out of the deal. No harm, no foul, right? But is that all Alicia really wants? Unfortunately, Ryan's friends don't make it easy for Alicia and the girls bring out the claws, especially one in particular. For some reason, Tammy seems to know more than she pretends and is determined to turn everyone against Alicia and destroy any hope of her having a relationship with Ryan. What is this girl's problem? The outcome of the weekend may very well determine whether Ryan and Alicia have any hope of a future together but Ryan finally begins to see just how dysfunctional he and his friends have become but is it too little, too late? Will his realization come in time to save his possible future with Alicia?  Beautiful aspiring writer working as a waitress-check! Handsome billionaire in need of a date-check! A yacht, a party, a secret club, a blog, a mean girl and a few secrets and lies-check! Instant attraction, explosive chemistry and seductive romance-you bet! That and a whole lot more!

"Title: Mate of the DragonSeries: Her Dragon's BaneDesignation: Book 6, Can Be Read As A Standalone, NO CliffhangerAuthor: Harmony RainesReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING STARS*****I have been in love with the Her Dragon's Bane Series since Harmony Raines introduced the very first book, Soul of the Dragon. I have followed the series faithfully and have now read all six books and I can honestly say that I have loved each and every one. But, who doesn't love handsome, sexy dragons, right? We met Tara the Witch very early in the series and I have always been fascinated by her character. I'm just so excited because we finally get to read Tara's story and it was definitely worth the wait! Harmony Raines has saved the best for last; so buckle up my lovelies, it's a wild ride - literally! The story is exciting, original, well developed, romantic and full of suspense. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the third person with alternating his and her points of view which, in my opinion, always adds to the understanding of not only the story but the characters as well. The dialogue is well executed and flows effortlessly. Harmony Raines is a master storyteller and a true professional and as such, her books are always well crafted and well edited. The characters are fascinating, captivating, engaging and will capture your heart. Raines skillfully combines these elements into a delightfully entertaining paranormal tale filled to the brim with danger, adventure, suspense, magic, fantasy, romance and a generous measure of heartbreaking angst. This story proves once again why Harmony Raines is a true master of her trade.Dragon Lord Domhnall may very well be the greatest dragon to ever live but Tara is the most powerful witch in Spellholm, at least in her opinion. Yet she still is unable to get Domhnall to trust and accept her as his mate, They were fated to be together but Domhnall refuses to acknowlege her or their fate to be together and Tara is beginning to tire of his behavior. Maybe she should turn him into a toad! It would serve him right! But no, she would never do that no matter how tempting the thought. If she could truly become the most powerful witch, then she would certainly be considered a worthy mate and Domhnall would have to accept her. And that would take knowledge because knowledge is power. Tara may be a powerful Seer but unfortunately can never see her own future and no amount of power could ever help her to see her own destiny. She's so tired of being taken for granted. She would trade her very soul to win the love and respect of the great Dragon Lord. Of course, she may be partly to blame for his reluctance. She doesn't have the most congenial personality and at times, could be considered abrasive. She's just pathetic! She doesn't even like herself so how could anyone else. For now she would continue to be at Domhnall's beck and call and continue to only dream of spending her nights in the arms of the handsome Dragon Lord.Domhnall finds it hard to trust anyone, especially a witch after one stole his heart stone several centuries ago. Logically, he knows that Tara had nothing to do with the deception by the other witch but he still finds it hard to accept that she is is true mate. He may not trust her but that doesn't stop him from wanting her and he knows that she wants him as well.  The temptation to throw caution to the wind and take the beautiful witch is almost overpowering. He had succumbed to taking a kiss only once but could still remember her taste on his lips. It was glorious. But he could resist, couldn't he? But when faced with an opportunity to walk away from love and his mate, what will he choose? Can fate find a way to finally bring these two stubborn souls together? Hmm....I wonder??? Handsome, stubborn Dragon Lord-check! Beautiful, powerful and very independent witch-check! Fate, destiny and a little push from an outside force-check! Heated attraction, fiery passion, spicy romance and dreamy sex-you bet! That and a whole lot more! Fabulous entertainment and an awesome read! I believe this story can be read as a standalone although I would highly recommend reading the entire series. This story does include a wonderfully written happy ending. Woo-Hoo for Tara!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3UL72ABQ06S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153KWZUE#wasThisHelpful","RY3UL72ABQ06S","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING !!!Title: To Win A Mate: Somewhere. TexasSeries: VonBrandt FamilyDesignation: Book Three of Series, Standalone Novella, NO CliffhangerAuthor: Krystal ShannanMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING STARS *****Krystal Shannan never fails to entertain her readers and her latest release is certainly no exception. To Win a Mate is the third story in her amazingly popular VonBrandt Series and as with the previous two books, it is a total page-turner. It captured my attention right out of the gate and held my interest until the very last page. What can I say? I'm a real sucker for a cowboy werewolf, especially when they're handsome and charming! And did I mention rich? Oh yes, all the VonBrandts are rolling in oil, lots and lots of ""Texas Black Gold."" Shannan is a wonderfully gifted storyteller who has woven an enthralling paranormal tale filled with adventure, fantasy, magic and romance. This release is quite a bit shorter than the other books in the series but is quite enjoyable nonetheless. It still packs quite a punch and you most definitely get your money's worth. The story is exciting, sweet, romantic, passionate and seductive. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the third person with his and her points of view. The dialogue is smart, well executed and flows seamlessly. The plot of this short story is primarily character driven with the hero and heroine taking center stage with a little assistance from a few new and familiar faces. And of course, we have a worthy antagonist whom everyone will love to hate. All of our primary characters are captivating, engaging, endearing and sexy. The male protagonist was both strong and sensitive while the heroine began somewhat timid but quickly found her courage and her voice which I liked very much. Shannan expertly combined these elements to craft an sweet, exciting, fun and fast-paced paranormal romance that will tug on your heartstrings. What didn't I like about this story? Not a darn thing!  However, having said that, I would have loved to have known so much more about each of our lead characters, especially Elise Blanchard and how she came to be an orphan. Hopefully, Ms Shannan will grace us with additional information in a future story.Werewolf Jared VonBrandt has a business degree from the Somewhere, Texas local college which could have gotten him a job anywhere in the world, especially with his family connections. Jared is only thirty-two, still young, yet he still prefers the solitude of the ranch and the woods - he is a werewolf after all - and of course, his job running the promotional department of VonBrandt Oil which at least gives him something to do occasionally. He loves being a werewolf. Being a wolf is as much a part of him as being human. His dream and only desire is to stay on the ranch, eventually find a mate and hopefully one day have a family. Unfortunately has has never experienced the pull of a true mate and no woman has ever even as much  piqued his or his wolf's interest - until now. But she lives in New Orleans! What's a wolf to do?Elise Blanchard has no clue as to what she really is. Once a month she turns into a wolf and doesn't understand why. In her twenty-seven years of life, she's never even met another person like herself or at least she doesn't think she has. How would she even know if she had? She has no clue about her parentage or ancestry. She was found as a baby and grew up in foster care, Now as an adult, she tries to hide in plain sight among the residents of New Orleans. But hiding isn't an option with her lecherous boss, Pier Nelson. Elise is an administrative assistant at TechCorp Industries and she has just been volunteered by her boss to participate in a charity auction as one of the prizes. She knows it's a setup by her boss and will probably turn out to be a huge disaster - until she senses someone - someone like her. And he's bidding on her! Oh my! Could it be possible that after twenty-seven years she has finally found someone like her - another person who could turn into a wolf ? She has so many questions but would he have the answers? She has long wished to know what she is, where she came from, anything about her family or her history. Could she trust this handsome, enigmatic stranger? Unfortunately, he would have to save her from her own boss before she could hope to discover any answers. Would he help her? Hmm...I wonder???

"Title: Once A CheetahSeries: Safari ShiftersDesignation: Book Four, Paranormal Shape Shifter Romance Standalone NovellaAuthor: Lola KiddReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE ROCKIN' SAFARI STARS *****Yowza! Once A Cheetah is the fourth release in Lola Kidd's charming new Safari Shifters Series and it is a breath of fresh air for lovers of paranormal shifter romance! I totally love it! The story is imaginative, original, fresh, exciting, romantic and sinfully sexy. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the third person with alternating his and her points of view. The dialogue is smart, playful, well executed and flows effortlessly. The characters are well crafted, unique, captivating, engaging and sexy as sin. Kidd skillfully combines these elements into a sweet, fast-paced, fun-filled adventure brimming with easy lighthearted humor, seductive romance and a totally new twist on sexy shifters. What didn't I like about this story? Not a darn thing! So, are you ready? Buckle up my lovelies! Let's go on safari!Shifter Island is located in the South Atlantic off the coast of Africa and just happens to be the hottest vacation destination around. The resort is a large island park which includes a safari-themed amusement park, an actual safari tour, a five-star beach resort, a new nightclub, a romantic honeymoon resort and Safari Town where the staff live. With names like Wild Eats, Club Safari, Wild Resort, Blue Sky Honeymoon Resort, how can you not love it? And it's owned and operated by shifters. Hubba! Hubba! Safari Island is the only place on earth you can go on a safari where the lions could stroll over and turn out to be one of the tour guides??!! Oh my! An island full of hot, hunky shifters of every species imaginable - Sign me up!Beautiful Clementine Blue is definitely the newest media darling. Now that she's won So You Think You Can Cook, a popular reality TV cooking competition, her career is white hot. Sadly her personal life is so not! But things are looking up. She's been invited to audition to cater a wedding on Safari Island which just happens to be the most popular tourist destination in the world. Her Mom, Bunny Blue, who is also her manager and agent, thinks it could result in her being invited to be the head chef of their upcoming new restaurant, Blue Ridge, set to open this winter. This trip to the island for the audition and to cater the wedding could be a real boost to her career along with lots of free publicity and it could also be a working vacation, especially since the couple have agreed to pay all her expenses. Besides, the couple had specifically asked for her, so surely she already has this in the bag. What could go wrong? It would be a win-win, right? She could just relax and concentrate on cooking. She could always worry about her personal life and a relationship once she was on track with her career. She wouldn't even think about flirting or finding a guy; she would just let nature takes its course. Really???Parker Travers is a world renowned vegetarian chef who just happens to also be a cheetah shifter. Vegetarian cheetah chef? Huh? His latest restaurant, Not Your Average Cheetah, in Beverly Hills is turning out to be a big flop while he's busy as the head chef at Wild Eats on Safari Island. His latest girlfriend, Jasminda, who is an occasional performer on Safari Island, is not his true mate and things are not going well with them at all. She's just another name on a long list of failed relationships. Heck, maybe he would never even be able to recognize his true mate. Everyone had always said there had to be something wrong with him anyway. Who had ever heard of a cheetah who is a vegetarian? Crazy, right? It's bad enough being a professional failure; he didn't want to fail in his personal life as well. Maybe it's time to cut his losses and be celibate for a while, concentrate on getting his career back on track. And a good place to start would be catering the upcoming wedding for Branch Dunkin and Maura Trebel on the island. That could get him lots of free publicity and really get his name back out there. There was only one little problem and her name is Clementine Blue and what a beautiful problem she is! Nope, not going there. Never going to happen! She's his competition and he wants to win this job to cater the wedding. He's a famous chef with restaurants all over the world. He could easily win this competition and keep his paws off the lovely Clementine Blue, right? Hmm....I wonder??? No spoilers from me but I will say this....Handsome vegetarian cheetah-shifter who is also a world renowned chef-check! Beautiful celebrity chef who is the latest media darling-check! A no holds barred competition to cater a media event wedding on Safari Island-check! Heated attraction and sweet romance-you bet! That and a whole lot more! It's nice to see the heroine go after the hot guy for a change even if it is for one night - or more! Hubba! Hubba! Deliciously cute and sinfully sweet! I can hardly wait for Ward Langston's story next! Although this is the fourth book of the series, it is a standalone novella and does NOT have a cliffhanger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JG3OFSPA2RJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156YTYKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JG3OFSPA2RJ6","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: Bearly In Time: Connor and RebeccaSeries: Werebears of New HampshireDesignation: Fourth and FInal Book of the Series, NO CliffhangerAuthor: Kim FoxReading Platform: Kindle UnlimitedMy Rating: FIVE DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING STARS *****Wow! Kim Fox has dazzled her readers yet again with Bearly in Time, the fourth and final release in her fun-filled Werebears of New Hampshire Series and I absolutely love it! It is quite simply a brilliant conclusion for an absolutely amazing series. These are just the cutest, sweetest, funniest, sexiest and most heartwarming stories ever! But be forewarned - they will tickle your funny bone and tug at your heartstrings and you'll be a fan for life! The narrative is exceptionally well written in the third person with alternating his and her points of view from the hero and heroine of the book. The dialogue is smart, snappy and flows effortlessly. The characters are fascinating, engaging, endearing and simply fabulous. I found myself completely enthralled by this group of hilariously captivating characters. Although this story is a bit more of a tear-jerker than the previous three tales, Kim still manages to squeeze in quite a few chuckles and giggles for her readers. I began sniffing on the first page and by the time I reached the end of the first chapter, I couldn't hold back my tears. What can I say? I'm a very emotional reader! My heart broke for both Connor and Rebecca and I sobbed through most of the book, that is, when I wasn't shaking my fist in anger. But never fear, Kim never lets us down and always finishes her story with a wonderful happy ending. I love it when a great book like this one invokes so many different emotions and I think I experienced them all while reading this book. This story has a perfect combination of drama, humor, heartbreaking angst, heartwarming romance and of course, good old fashioned bear bonding and dreamy sex! And Kim even sneaks in another great life lesson in this story, one that my Father also taught me: Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see - looks can sometimes be very deceiving.  Although this story can be read as a standalone novella, I would highly recommend reading the previous three books in the series but if you can't, at least read the first book in the series, Bearly Breathing, which is where we're introduced to this wonderful cast of characters and of course, where we first meet werebear Connor Jacoby and beautiful kindergarten teacher Rebecca Sanderson.It had been a little over two months since Rebecca Sanderson won a free weekend kayaking getaway from Brooke Excursions located in the beautiful mountains of New Hampshire. Becka had invited her two best friends, Angie Hawkins and Grace Briggs along on the trip and all three set out for the adventure of a lifetime. Their exciting getaway at Brookes Excursions quickly turned into a nightmare when their outing was interrupted by a dangerous kayaking accident and a violent storm resulting in the girls each being separated and then stranded overnight with one of their handsome guides. Oh no! And each of their guides were hunky werebears! Oh yes! So, naturally they hooked up! Oh my! Rebecca had been rescued by hunky grizzly bear-shifter Connor Jacoby who also happens to be the owner of Brooke Excursions. Rebecca was immediately attracted to handsome Connor and Connor seemed to be quite taken with Rebecca as well. A week later, Rebecca finds herself once again making the trip from Manhattan to New Hampshire to see her new beau Connor. She had decided to surprise Connor by arriving a day early which in hindsight may have been a mistake because what she saw broke her heart. She ended up being the one surprised. Seeing Connor with another woman had hurt so much more than when she discovered her fiance, Mark, had been having an affair. She was completely devastated with nowhere to go except back to the apartment she had once shared with Mark. Now, here she sits, back in Manhattan and only five more days until she marries her cheating fiance who claims it had all been just a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding? Not! But why did she ever think a handsome bear-shifter like Connor could ever love her? She isn't smart like Angie or beautiful like Grace. She's just a plain old kindergarten teacher in her thirties whose fiance even thought he could do better and cheated on her. Why would Connor be any different? It was all an act; Connor had been a player all along and she fell for it - hook, line and sinker! He probably gives all the women who come for kayaking the same spiel. How in the world had she wound up in love with one man (well, bear-shifter) and soon to be married to another? Now, she's probably making an even bigger mistake by marrying Mark. Does she even love Mark? Or does she love Connor? She had run away that day without even as much as talking to Connor so maybe she should give him a chance to explain. Or not - especially after she sees him with the same woman again! What the heck? What's a girl to do?Connor Jacoby can't believe that Rebecca has blocked his calls and refuses to talk with him. He's in love with her and he and his bear both have bonded with her. She is his mate and he wanted them to start a future together. He thought she loved him as well. What in the world happened to make her go back to her cheating fiance. He has no idea and Rebecca refuses to tell Grace or Angie why she changed her mind. Connor is a broken man. He would spend the rest of his life in misery mourning the loss of his mate but he has to at least see her one more time. Maybe if he sees her in her wedding dress and happy, it could at least give him and his bear some closure. Oh my! Poor Connor! What a mess! Will Connor and Becka find their way back to each other or will Becka marry Mark? No spoilers from me but I will say this....Handsome grizzly bear-shifter with a broken heart-check! Beautiful kindergarten teacher who should never believe what she thinks she sees-check! A cheating fiance and a very unhappy scheduled wedding-check! Heartbreaking angst and an unfortunate misunderstanding-check! Sweet romance, a few bundles of joy, several happy endings and some good old fashioned bear bonding-you bet!

"Title: A Mate for YorkSeries: The ProgramDesignation: Book One of Series, Standalone Novella, NO CliffhangerGenre: Paranormal RomanceAuthor: Charlene HartnadyMy Rating: FIVE DELICIOUSLY SEXY STARS*****Yowza! Charlene Hartnady has obviously been hard at work and her phenomenal creativity and imagination have definitely been working overtime as demonstrated by A Mate for York, the first release in her brand new series, The Program. And may I just say WOW! I love it! The story is original, unique, well crafted, cute, fun, romantic and seductive. Heck, I'm 63 and even I wanted to apply for ""The Program."" The narrative is exceptionally well written in the third person with alternating his and her points of view. The dialogue is smart, snappy, well executed and flows seamlessly. The entire book is extremely well edited which is always a big plus for me. The characters shine as brightly as the beacon of a lighthouse. They are captivating, fascinating, engaging, endearing, sexy as sin and at times, laugh out loud funny. Another big plus for me is the recurring appearance of characters from Charlene's previously released books which reinforces not only the validity and believability of the series but also the familiarity of the world in which the book has been written. It is always such a treat to see how our favorite characters are doing. Charlene skillfully combines all these elements into a delicious tale filled to the brim with a little light humor, fun-filled adventure, a dollop of suspense, a generous measure of a romping good time and loads of dreamy romance! Where can I sign up for ""The Program?""Kings Zane and Brant are now proud papas of a bouncing baby boy named Sam and when they aren't trying to keep Queen Tanya happy and satisfied, they're both busy implementing their new ""Breeding Program"" also known as ""The Program."" What? Breeding Program? Oh yes, I said breeding program. Zane and Brant have learned through Ward, Stephany's new alpha wolf mate, that humans are, in fact, strong enough to survive a mating with shifters and vampires other than the kings. It seems the shifters have been doing it for years, in secret of course. The Kings have finally embraced this new idea and have been hard at work drawing up the contracts with the humans and finalizing the arrangements. Their hard work has finally paid off and they're launching the first stage of ""The Program"" by advertising for women to volunteer to date a vampire. Huh? Yep, the initial trial will be called ""The Dating Program."" Wait - what? What's the difference? Well, I'm glad you asked. The difference is that there will be no mating and no sex with the participants of the initial trial. It will be blood-drinking only. What? Oh, did I forget to mention that part? This trial is for three days only and is strictly to determine if the chosen vampire males can drink blood from the human women without experiencing bloodlust. Oh my! Unfortunately, quite a few vampires suffer from the affliction which can turn calm, disciplined vampires into blood crazed maniacs who can drain a human of all their blood within minutes. Oh no! And, there's no way to tell who will succumb to bloodlust until they actually drink from a human. Yep, that's right! It can be a bit risky. But the human women have been carefully screened and those chosen for the trial will be paid $45,000.00 a day for every day they complete the program so at the end of the three day trial, they could receive as much as $135,000.00. That is, if they survive. Just a minor little problem but all precautions and security measures have been taken. Unfortunately, all of this has become a necessary risk since vampires are becoming extinct. Although it's dangerous for human women to give birth to vampire babies, most female vampires cannot safely birth children at all and have to be sterilized. Sadly, the births resulting from vampire/human unions have been only male children. As a result, there's a shortage of viable women thereby creating the problem - they need human women. Unfortunately, not everyone is happy about this newest little development and have already made an attempt on King Zane's life. So now it seems that the vampires and everyone involved with The Program may be at risk. Oh my goodness!But no matter the danger or how insurmountable it may seem, nothing  will stop York. Most of the vampire guards had decided to participant in the combat competition in order to win a position in the new breeding program - the chance to have their own female - a soft, beautiful, curvy, human female. Who wouldn't fight for that, right? It had long been York's dream to have a mate and a family. Most vampire males never do. Only the Kings had been allowed to mate humans - until now. But that was all about to change and York had already been promised a slot in the program in exchange for a favor he granted Brant's brother, Xavier, but nonetheless, York wanted to fight and earn his position. He is the Captain of the Elite Guard after all and he doesn't want to be accused of receiving favorable treatment. He is the biggest, baddest and best of all the vampire warriors. And of course, as usual, he succeeds again just as he will be successful at proving that he would never succumb to bloodlust. Piece of cake, right? Wrong! Human females are, indeed, very hard to resist, especially the ones with beautiful green eyes like Cassidy, the first female candidate he meets. And she tastes even better than she looks! He would have his female and he wants this one - rules and contracts be damned!Cassidy is almost thirty and still has absolutely nothing to show for her life other than a death certificate for a no good selfish husband and an unexpected mountain of debt, which of course, was all because of his gambling and his weekly trips to ""The Kitty's Paw"", an escort agency. She had hoped by this point she would be settled into a wonderful life with the man of her dreams and two or three children but all she has is painful memories, heartache, a crappy job with a lecherous boss, a pile of debt and a zero bank balance. But, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. If she can only be approved to participate in the vampire ""Dating Program"", she could make enough money to pay off her debt and have enough left over to start a new life - somewhere else. She could make it through three days, right? She just has to let them drink a little blood. Easy Peasy, right? Not when her very first vampire is hot, handsome, sex-on-a-stick York! Buckle up my ladies! We're in for another wild ride! No spoilers from me but I will say this....Beautiful human widow with gorgeous green eyes and lush curves-check! Handsome Elite Vampire Guard determined to have his human female, rules be damned-check! A large cast of wonderful characters-check! Two exasperated Kings-check!

"Title: Strife Part FiveSeries: The Strife SeriesDesignation: Book Five of a Multi-Installment Serial, Not A StandaloneAuthor: Sky CorganMy Rating: FIVE DELICIOUSLY ENTERTAINING STARS *****Yowza! Sky Corgan has gone and done it again! And just what has she done, you ask? She's dazzled her readers with yet another riveting serial and what a sparkler it is! Strife is her latest offering and will be released in multiple installments so be forewarned, there will be cliffhangers. Each book is a relatively quick read with only approximately 40 to 45 pages which makes it perfect for a quick break or lunchtime treat. Personally, I love the excitement and anticipation of a well written serial with a great oh my god cliffhanger and Sky Corgan is a master of her trade. She knows exactly how to tease, tantalize and titillate her reader for maximum effect in order to create the pinnacle of a wonderfully entertaining experience. Strife is an extremely well written dark and compelling romance with complex characters but what is most surprising in this story is the underlying element of humor which I find that I very much enjoy. The story is told in the first person by the two primary characters, Pepper Kimbrough and Dmitri Strife, with alternating his and her points of view by chapter which just happens to be my favorite style of storytelling. Although the story is classified as a dark romance, it's anything but gloomy. It's exciting, fast-paced, appealing, realistic, romantic and seductive. The characters as always shine brightly in Sky Corgan's work and these are no exception. They are fascinating, captivating, engaging, relatable, sexy as sin and sometimes quite humorous. Corgan skillfully combines these elements into an enticing and divinely entertaining experience for her readers.Book One: Pepper Kimbrough came to Hollywood to fulfill her dream of becoming an actress. That was Plan A. Unfortunately, Plan A hasn't worked out so well. Of course, neither has her life but she's managed to survive, albeit by the skin of her teeth. She may not be innocent and vulnerable but she's definitely desperate. And hence, her current predicament - down on her knees with her head in James Sumner's lap with her mouth on his.... well, you know where her mouth is. Yep, this is now her life and this is what loosely passes for a somewhat questionable interview for a job - or at least she hopes. No, life certainly isn't beautiful, not for people like her - at least not yet. Sometimes, it's as ugly as your own worst nightmares and this is definitely one of those times. The only question: Is Pepper strong enough to survive it??? The memories of her past say no but her determination and inner strength say yes. Now it's time for Plan B: Please this jerkwad Sumner, get the job as a call girl making $500.00 an hour, save her money, go to college, then become rich and famous. But is she really willing to sell her body as well as her soul to accomplish her dream and yet somehow, still hang on to her sanity? Or ultimately risk her sanity to fulfill her dream? She's been through worse and it's not forever, right? Right!? She can do this and stay sane; she could be a escort/call girl, couldn't she? It's actually rather ironic since she had actually grown up rich and now she's only one breath away from homeless and starving. This is all worth it, isn't it? With only $9.03 left to her name, it has to be. She no longer has a choice. Or does she???Rock Star Dmitri Strife has conquered the musical stage and now he's ready to conquer the big screen stage in Hollywood with his first starring role as Brodie Grant in the upcoming new movie, Master of Payback. He's just arrived and it's his first night in ""tinsel town"". His friend John is surprising him with a night on the town and it does turn out to be quite the shock. Instead of going to a club, John is taking him to a private brothel with beautiful babes galore, all willing to submit to his every desire. Oh my! But Dmitri has had his fill of endless nights of booze, never ending parties and meaningless sex with women always looking to use him as a means for fame and fortune. He doesn't wanted to be caught up in that nightmare again and almost leaves - until he sees her - the beautiful, blonde that wanders onto the balcony where he's hidden in the shadows. She looks so innocent and so sad. He can't help himself; he needs to know her name. But surprisingly when he approaches her, she doesn't seem to recognize him. He just won't tell her who he really is so he tells her his name is Brodie Grant, the name of his movie character, instead. This night may work out after all. Hmmm.... I wonder?????Book Two:Pepper, who has been given the moniker of Alexis by her boss James Sumner, spent her first night as an escort talking with Brodie/Dmitri and NOT having sex. Huh? Nope, no sex. During their night together, Pepper/Alexis confesses to Dmitri/Brodie that she was adopted but the day after graduating from high school, her parents kicked her out with only $700 and said they never wanted to see her again. What the heck? Pepper feels like a complete failure after not being able to seduce Dmitri/Brodie and begins to have serious doubts as to whether she can actually continue this job but unfortunately she's out of options so it's this or starve. But Pepper soon realizes that she may be in way over her head. Thirty five year old Dmitri Strife is very much looking forward to meeting his co-star, Marie Overton. It has long been his dream to meet and woo the beautiful sophisticated movie star and knows this is the perfect opportunity. Apparently she doesn't feel the same since she didn't even bother to show up for the cast luncheon so there will be no date tonight with Marie Overton. So, what's a handsome, successful heartthrob to do??? Request another night with Alexis/Pepper, of course!!! Oh my! And still, no sex! But strangely, Dmitri finds that he enjoys being with Alexis/Pepper and is drawn to beauty and her innocence and is somewhat puzzled by his feelings toward Alexis. He knows an association with her could be dangerous for his career but he can't seem to stop himself. He convinces himself that it's just the easy camaraderie he experiences with Alexis and nothing more.Book Three:Dmitri has started filming and finally meets his co-star but at first, Marie seems mildly interested in him. She leaves before he can ask her out. But is he still interested in her? Or would he rather spend time  with Pepper? Hmm...Is his interest due to sympathy for Pepper's plight or possibly or is it real friendship he feels for the lovely young Pepper? Or could it be something more??? But the feelings Pepper/Alexis feel for Dmitri are far from friendly. Pepper/Alexis enjoys her time spent with Dmitri and more than a little attracted to him. She hopes to see him again and a small thread of hope is born that maybe, he may just feel something for her other than physical desire. James informs her that Dmitri has indeed requested her company again for the night.  I wonder if Pepper/Alexis will be able to seduce Dmitri this time???  And yes, Pepper/Alexis now knows that Brodie lied to her about his identity and is really Dmitri Strife! Oh my goodness!Book Four: Dmitri finally has the chance to ask Marie Overton for a date - and she accepts. But the long awaited date falls short of his actual expectations. Despite their great on screen chemistry, Dmitri is just not feeling a real connection with Marie. It seems, all Dmitri can think about is Pepper. Yep, his thoughts are filled with everything Pepper. It's only been one night since they were last together but he wants to see her again. And it also seems that Dmitri may have finally realized that he wants to do so much more than just see her and be her friend. He wants the beautiful young Pepper but will she still be the same innocent escort? Or did she have a client last night? Dmitri doesn't want anyone else to have Pepper and he's shocked at his own self revelation. He wants to be the only man to touch her beautiful body. What's a rock star to do? Request another night with Pepper, of course! No matter the cost!  This is their third night together, so will they or won't they?Book Five:They will and they do! Oh my! And it was fabulous -  or at least it was until Pepper surrendering to temptation, took a sneak peek at Dmitri's phone and saw the text message from Marie Overton. Oh no! Oh yes! Another brittle piece of Pepper's already fragile heart shatters in her chest as she realizes that Dmitri is like all the other men she's ever known, a liar, a user, a player and never to be trusted. And her conclusion about Dmitri is certainly reinforced when she sees Dmitri and Marie Overton together at a club on the same night he has already arranged with James to have her for the evening but fails to show feigning a business engagement. What? And the final nail in Dmitri's coffin is Marie kissing Dmitri - on the mouth! Oh no! Oh yes! What will Pepper do now? Will Pepper still want Dmitri after becoming aware of his relationship with Marie Overton? More importantly, what will Dmitri do now that he realizes he may not want Marie Overton after all. Marie Overton is certainly not the person he imagined her to be? It seems that Dmitri Strife has a decision to make - an important one that could affect his career, his life and his future. What does Dmitri truly want? Whom does he truly want? What will he decide? No spoilers from me but I will say this...Beautiful young woman who came to Hollywood to fulfill her dream of becoming an actress but has fallen on hard times and is now broke and almost homeless-check! Handsome rock star who is tired of his life as a famous musician and has come to Hollywood for his first starring role in a movie-check! An unexpected meeting of two lost souls-check!

"Title: Reawakening the Dragon: Part FourSeries: Stonefire DragonsDesignation: Part Four of Four, Multi-Installment Series, Not A Standalone  Book Seventeen of Stonefire Dragons SeriesAuthor: Jessie DonovanMy Rating: FIVE DRAGO-LICIOUS STARS *****Oh my glory! Jessie Donovan has done it again! And what has she done, you ask? She's just released another astounding installment of Reawakening the Dragon, a continuation of her stunning mega-hit series, Stonefire Dragons and may I just say - WOW! This release is the fourth and final installment of Reawakening the Dragon but never fear, it's not the end of Jessie's dragon tales. Jessie never fails to tease, tantalize and titillate her readers with her amazing talent, incredible skill, unlimited imagination and entertaining repartee. I love it! The story is original, imaginative, fresh, novel, exciting, suspenseful, fast-paced, romantic, arousing and let's not forget well developed and hilarious. The dialogue is exceptionally well written in the third person with multiple points of view. It is also well edited, smart, witty, seductive and flows effortlessly. The characters are fascinating, intriguing, engaging, endearing, sexy as sin and at times, hysterically funny. Donovan is a true master of her trade and expertly combines these elements into a deliciously entertaining paranormal romance filled to the brim with heart-pounding danger, thrilling adventure, spine-tingling suspense, laugh out loud humor and passionate romance. What more could you ask from a great book? Not a darn thing! So, are you ready for another wild ride??!! Buckle up my lovelies! Here we go again!!!Part One:BBC reporter Jane Hartley desperately longs to be more than just a pretty face on camera. She wants to be taken seriously - to be a respected investigative reporter and is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve her goal including placing her own life in imminent danger. In order to write the story that could change the course of her career, she knows she must find the new location of the dragon hunters. She has gleaned information from every possible source and finally has a lead on the possible location for the Carlisle hunters. If she can pull this off, not only will she have the story of the year but she could also help sway public opinion even more in favor of the dragon-shifters. After working closely with the Stonefire Dragon Clan, she now knows they are not the monsters the Dragon Hunters and the Dragon Knights have portrayed them to be. Well, maybe none except head protector Kai Sutherland. Investigating this story and becoming acquainted with the people from Stonefire has reignited her desire to discover the truth and she's determined to find the hunters, expose them for the monsters they are and have her story - even if it kills her. Unfortunately, it just might since no human has ever revealed the inner workings of the dragon hunters but that's exactly what she intends to do. And she was doing just fine until Stonefire's head protector, Kai Sutherland showed up and threw a monkey wrench in her well laid plans. Who does he think he is anyway??? She will never allow the sexy Stonefire dragon-shifter to interfere with her investigation! Or would she??!! No, she will not! At least not until she's finished her story and secured her reputation as a truly respected investigative reporter. Visions of sugarplums and Kai naked will just have to wait! Or will they??!! Nope, she can't afford to sleep with the handsome protector, especially if she doesn't want her story to be labeled as biased. That would only serve to destroy her credibility and her reputation. It'll be torture but she can most assuredly resist the growly dragon-shifter. Can't she??After the capture, torture and death of Stonefire's first female protector, ex-army dragon-shifter Kai Sutherland has only one objective - protect his clan by locating and taking down Simon Bourne, leader of the Carlisle dragon hunters. And in the process, he can also seek retribution and revenge for his brethren. And his plans are going well until he finds BBC reporter Jane Hartley right smack in the middle of a group of Carlisle hunters in a pub in Newcastle. What the heck? He will not allow his dragon's lust for the beautiful female reporter to disrupt his mission and he will never, ever share information and work with her! Nope, never! He will never allow himself to be distracted by a female ever again! Or would he??? What in the world is wrong with his dragon? Eleven years ago, he had been rejected by his true mate, dragonwoman Maggie Jones of Snowridge Clan,  but for the first time since his heartbreak, he has finally been able to forget the female who should have been his mate - just by listening to Jane's voice. Oh my! But he doesn't have time for a human nor any female for that matter, so her voice is all he could allow himself to have. Now, if he could only get his dragon to shut the hell up!Part Two: Stonefire Head Protector Kai Sutherland has finally agreed to work with BBC reporter Jane Hartley on finding the location of Simon Bourne and the Carlisle Dragon Hunters. Unfortunately, they are unaware that the Dragon Knights have posted a 5000 pounds bounty on Jane's pretty head.  As they begin their mission, Jane is betrayed by her contact, a man referred by her brother Rafe Hartley who is a member of The UK Special Forces. Uh oh! An attempt is made on Jane's life and Kai is injured trying to protect her. Fortunately, the pair is rescued by another protector, dragonwoman Nikki Gray, and returned to Stonefire where Kai can receive treatment for his gunshot wound. Kai may be injured but that hasn't curbed his dragon's lust for the lovely reporter - not one little bit. His dragon is driving him insane! After two mind-blowing kisses, Kai can no longer deny his attraction for the sassy reporter and discovers that he may desire Jane just as much as his dragon. With Jane now in charge of Kai's care  and living in his home back on Stonefire, it just got a whole lot harder for the stubborn pair to resist each other and if Kai's dragon has any say in the matter, Kai may just have a new mate - that is if he can keep her alive and away from the Dragon Knights as well as the Dragon Hunters. Oh my! And he still can't get his dragon to shut the hell up! It may not be possible for a dragon to have more than one true mate but Kai's dragon is sure determined to have Jane! Now that a bounty has been placed on her head, Jane is in even more danger than before. She doesn't want more people getting hurt because of her story. For her own protection, Bram insists she must stay on Stonefire land and as a result, she's afraid her credibility may now be compromised. That in itself may not be so bad but she's still determined to help sway public opinion in favor of the dragon-shifters and possibly with the aid of her big brother Rafe, she still may be able to help. But is Jane willing to sacrifice her story, her credibility and her reputation to have Kai? It would be hard for any woman to be objective around handsome dragonman Kai but judging from her body's reaction to his two kisses, it may well be worth it! Will she be able to resist Kai - that is if his dragon can convince him to make a move???Part Three: Kai is now recovering from his injury under the watchful eye and care of his new houseguest. Yep, you guessed it - Jane Hartley. And Kai's very randy,  rambunctious dragon seems to have developed a one track mind and Jane Hartley is the only car on the track! Oh my! After Kai opens up to Jane about his past and the events that followed his true mate's rejection, Jane is more determined than ever to have a relationship with the handsome dragonman. She wants him and has made up her mind to give him a chance and once Jane Hartley makes a decision, she gives up all doubt and embraces her choice and she's definitely ready to be embraced by Kai Sutherland. And it seems that Kai as well as his dragon desire their lovely houseguest. They both want her - now! Unfortunately for Jane and Kai, there are other pressing issues at hand. Namely, Jane's brother, Rafe Hartley of the UK special forces who has just arrived to lend a helping hand to Stonefire, albeit begrudgingly. And he doesn't like the fact that his sister is now living with a dragon-shifter. Oh my goodness! Nope, not one little bit! But maybe Stonefire Protector Nikola Gray can change his mind or just give Rafe a much needed attitude adjustment like a swift kick in the pants. Oh no! Oh yes! Nikki and her young dragon are both very much attracted to Rafe Hartley and have been ever since she saw him while serving in the military. He's the only man, human or dragon, to whom she's ever been attracted. And in the words of Nikki's dragon, ""Young dragons need sex and kisses. Find me some!"" I love Nikki's dragon! But Nikki has to be careful. She's tired of only being known as the first born from a human sacrifice. She wants to earn the respect of her clan and helping Kai take down the dragon hunters would be a great way to start. Besides, humans are too complicated and fragile, something she certainly doesn't have time for right now not to mention the fact that it's not allowed. What? It's been four years since she's seen Rafe and her dragon is still driving her crazy about him. Female dragon shifters can rarely recognize their true mates until they kiss the male and her dragon is determined for Nikki to manipulate Rafe into kissing her! Oh my goodness! According to their laws, it's Nikki's duty to mate with another dragon in order to produce a dragon-shifter child. Rafe and Nikki can never be together, could they?  Not with his attitude! It looks like love is in the air at Stonefire! It's a war of wills at Stonefire and I can hardly wait to see who wins.Part Four: Kai has finally recovered from his injuries and has been cleared for duty by Dr Sid. She has also cleared him for certain other activities as well. Umm.... I'm sure you get the picture as to what the ""other activities"" are. It seems both Kai and his dragon are totally enthralled with the beautiful Jane and are determined to have her in their home, their heart and in their bed. Oh my! And Jane definitely wants not only Kai but she also wants his dragon on board as well. The risk of seeing Maggie and succumbing to the pull of his true mate worries Jane. It would break her heart if she gives up everything for Kai only to be left holding an empty bag and broken heart. As their physical relationship explodes into one of fiery passion, their  understanding and trust between them also grows into something much more substantial and lasting than just heated attraction and lust. After both reveal their past shortcomings, heartaches and hurdles, they each realize how deeply they each feel for their family, their clan and each other. And yes, it is definitely now Jane's clan as well. But will it be enough to cement their future together?  In the meantime, there are more serious matters to consider - like surviving their enemies. And as always, Jane has a plan for luring the Dragon Knights into revealing themselves and hopefully being captured by the DDA. Oh yes, when does Jane not have a plan? But will it be good enough that Bram will give the go ahead and will they be able to stop the Dragon Knights for good? Will Jane be willing to trust Kai and his dragon and take a chance on a future at Stonefire? Can Kai's dragon find happiness with Jane? Will Jane give up her career and come to live permanently at Stonefire with Kai? Will the DDA ever allow it? Will Kai be able to protect Jane and his clan from the dragon hunters and the Dragon Knights? Does Rafe remember Nikki and is he even attracted to the beautiful, courageous Stonefire Protector? Will Rafe be able to help Stonefire and protect his sister from harm? Hmmm...I wonder??? No spoilers from me but I will say this....Beautiful determined reporter-check!

"Title: You've Got TailSeries: Peculiar MysteriesDesignation: Book One, Standalone Novel, NO CliffhangerAuthor: Renee GeorgeGenre: Paranormal Romance/Comedy/MysteryMy Rating: FIVE DIVINELY ENTERTAINING STARS*****YOWZA!!! Renee George hit the ground running with You've Got Tail, the first fabulous, fun-filled novel in her spectacular new series, Peculiar Mysteries. Yes siree! This isn't my first rodeo with Renee George so I know to expect the unexpected but I must say, she even surprised me with this one. George exploded out of the starting gate, put the pedal to the metal and screamed down the straightaway all the way to the finish line. I was completely out of breath by the time I reached the end. I laughed, giggled, chuckled, snorted, sniffled, snickered, snuffled, sobbed, sniveled, howled, hiccuped and guffawed through the entire book without even the first hint of boredom, apathy, impassivity or dissatisfaction. By the end of the book, I was bawling like a six year old who had just dropped my ice cream cone. Yep, it was that good! And who in the world said paranormal romance couldn't be funny and mysterious? Well, whoever it was didn't send Renee George the memo because You've Got Tale is not only romantic, sweet, sexy and passionate, it's also hilarious and a magnificent whodunit! Move over Melinda Gordon, there's a new ghost whisperer in town and her name is Sunny Haddock! The story is exciting, original, well crafted, humorous, suspenseful, romantic and sweeter than honey. And did I say hot? Oh yeah! It has lots of action, in and out of the sheets! Hubba! Hubba! The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with the story being told by none other than the fabulously funny protagonist, Sunny Haddock. The dialogue is smart, sassy, snarky, snappy, witty, hilarious, well executed and flows effortlessly. Personally, I think Sunny would also make a phenomenal stand-up comedian, if she could take time off from giving psychic readings to all her new friends in Peculiar. And speaking of friends, the characters in this lively tale are simply magnificent! They are fascinating, captivating, engaging, endearing and laugh-out-loud funny. By the end of the book, I felt as if I personally knew every single character and Sunny, well, she was  glorious; she literally sparkled. Heck, I even fell in love with the ghosts! I may have had the slightest girl crush on Judah. Okay, it was more than a little girl crush but in my defense, he was completely adorable. George skillfully combines these elements into a divinely entertaining paranormal tale filled to the brim with danger, drama, suspense, mystery, murder, kidnapping, comedy and romance. Oh, and did I mention sex? Yep, it has a little of that too. What didn't I like about this book? Not a darn thing!With a name like Ambrosia Sunshine Haddock, Sunny never had a chance at a normal life. No siree! So, it didn't come as much of a surprise when Sunny realized she was a psychic, more or less. Well, mostly less, that is until she arrived in Peculiar, Missouri searching for her former roommate, best friend and future business partner, Chevvah ""Chav"" Trimmel. Chav had left the shores of sunny California and made the trip to Peculiar two years prior when her younger brother, Judah disappeared. Chav had fallen in love with Peculiar and its town folk. In fact,  she invited Sunny to join her in opening a vegetarian restaurant in the small town. Chav had even named it Sunny's Outlook. How sweet! Two weeks prior to her scheduled moving date, Sunny receives a mysterious text from her bestie Chav simply stating ""Sunny. I need u."" Oh my! And now, Chav has disappeared too! Oh no! Yep, gone without a single trace. Well, get ready Peculiar, 'cause here comes animal-loving, strictly vegetarian, squeamish-at-the-sight-of-blood, not-so-sunny, Sunny Haddock and she's loaded for bear! And squirrel and coyote and werewolf and raccoon and deer and anything else that gets in her way. She's hell-bent on finding her friend and she will not rest until she does. She has no time for distractions from Chev's hot, handsome younger brother, Babel ""Babe"" Trimmel, who seems determined to either wrestle her into bed or run her out of town! Huh? Whatever! Babe may be more irresistible than crack on a cupcake but she refuses to buckle under pressure! Except, in bed of course. Oh, and all the other wonderful town folk want her gone too! What the heck? Well, she may faint at the sight of blood, especially her own, but never let it be said that Sunny Haddock is meek of heart or short on courage. She's staying! And they can't make her go! Can they ?!? Can Sunny solve the missing persons mystery and will she be able to find Chav before it's too late? I'll never tell! No spoilers from me but I will say this...Beautiful, sassy human psychic-check! Handsome, determined werecoyote-check! Large cast of unforgettable characters including the ghosts-check! An adorable ghost coyote-check! Danger, drama, murder, suspense, puzzling disappearances, heinous villains and a mystery only Sunny can solve-check! Fun, laughter and quite a few giggles-check! Heated attraction, fiery passion and a blazing hot romance between an older psychic and a younger man/coyote-you bet! That and a whole lot more! Deliciously cute, fabulously funny, seriously sexy, completely captivating and divinely entertaining!!! Hands down, one of the best books I've read this year! This is a standalone novel with NO cliffhanger with a wonderfully written happy for now ending and by that I mean, George leaves the door wide open for future adventures for psychic, not-so-sunny Sunny with her younger man at her side and in her bed!Complimentary copy received in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDJN1NF2CJSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KHT7GM#wasThisHelpful","R3NDJN1NF2CJSS","AH5HD9FHUFT9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH5HD9FHUFT9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is a sweet, sexy, feel-good romance that will warm your heart and make you smile.We first met wolf shifter Kurt as the villain in Snowbound With The Bear. In order to gain rank within the pack, he made a selfish bid for power by offering his cousin Fiona up as a trade to an unscrupulous tiger shifter seeking a virgin mate. Unfortunately, his plan didn't work out so well and as a result, he became trapped in a snowstorm in the mountains and in order to survive, he had to remain in his wolf form. When Kurt was finally rescued, he was too weak to shift and became locked in his wolf form which can easily happen when a shifter remains too long as their animal. It can also affect their mental stability and Kurt had to be hospitalized. His only hope for recovery lies in the hands of one beautiful woman who seems to work miracles for patients with this special problem. His sanity now rests on a woman whose face and scent has haunted him for months. He knows she must be real - she has to be and he doesn't even know her name. The only thing he knows for sure is she ran from him but he must find her, and soon, or he may just lose his mind - again. He nor his wolf may be able to survive without her because she is his true mate. Oh my! Obviously, a human doctor could be of no use at all but nurse Nadine Dury isn't strictly human. Huh? Oh no, Nadine is fully aware that she isn't fully human and desperately feels the pull of the mating call. She is undeniably drawn to Kurt and the pull is getting stronger every day but for his sake, she must remain strong and stay away from him. She's an imposter. How could he ever love someone like her? Or something like her? She doesn't even know what she is and she can never allow anyone to learn her secret. But will Nadine be able to deny her fate? I'll never tell.

I'm in love with this series! In fact, I love it so much that I wanted to share my review for the first three books in Hannah Ford's seductively dark serial, What He Wants. Oh yes, I did say serial which means multiple installments and dare I say it - cliffhangers. Yikes! Personally, I love a great white-knuckle, hold-your-breath cliffhanger but to each his own, right? For me, it's  like watching my favorite weekly television drama but don't let that discourage you. Hannah never leaves us hanging. She releases a riveting new installment once or twice a month like clockwork. Originally, I read each installment as it was released under the Kindle Unlimited program but you don't have to wait. Ford has released sixteen books in the series to date and the icing on the cake, they're all available under the Kindle Unlimited program! Woo Hoo! This collection is the compilation of the first three books in the series, What He Wants, What He Craves and What He Demands. It's the perfect way to dip your toe and test the water. This series totally rocked my world and I'm sure you'll love it as well! It has a little bit of everything to suit almost everyone! Each successive release becomes more interesting, exhilarating and enticing. The story is exciting, thrilling, compelling, powerful, mysterious, suspenseful, intense, romantic, arousing, sensual and steamy. Whew! That's a real mouthful but those are only a few of the words that came to mind while reading this story. The narrative is exceptionally well written in the first person with alternating his and her points of view. Yum  - my favorite! The dialogue is smart, snappy, well executed and flows effortlessly.

"Strong bags - that's what you get with the Hefty Ultra Flex.If there is one thing I would like different from this one is more bags in the box. 14 is a strange number - maybe it's so you can use one per day and get through two weeks, but I don't go through that much trash.Aside from that, these bags are perfect for a variety of needs - but two specifically that I've been really pleased with.First, recycling. We tend to have more recycle than trash, because we're pretty picky about making sure trash is actual trash and has no possibility of recycling. That's mostly food waste that doesn't get composted, or things that are clearly not going to be recycled. That means we have a TON of plastic, paper, and metal that needs to get stored for two weeks before the recycle bin gets picked up. The hefty ultra flex provides a HUGE amount of storage room for these things, and it does tear even when we put in cardboard boxes or metal cat food cans with sharp lids. It's easy to tie up and then easy to throw into the recycle bin. And it has TONS of stretching room - you can really fill it up.Second, yard waste gathering. If you live in an area that requires you to put yard waste in a bin, that can sometimes be a pain especially if you have lots of leaves or small branches to gather up. These bags are perfect and reusable to scoop up yard waste, dump it in the bin, then go back for more. The reusability of bags without them tearing apart is great - and you'll find that several trips can be made using the same bag - then use the bag for regular trash or recycle and you're good to go. I hate having a bunch of waste and we try to reuse things as much as we can - so why not your ""trash"" bag?Overall a solid 5 star product which is strong, durable, flexible, reusable, and is now on my subscribe and save list every single month.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NG2PMT42FGYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028LQ4U4#wasThisHelpful","R1NG2PMT42FGYG","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you get: a KIND Healthy Grains popped dark chocolate with sea salt snack bar, which is gluten free, non-GMO, and contains 6 super grains.The product is called a ""granola bar"" but don't expect it to be as thick as your typical granola bar. This one is pretty flat and more square shaped, which personally I think helps make it easier to chew than a granola bar. The taste is pretty mild actually - it doesn't overwhelm with chocolate or sea salt. It doesn't taste like it's filled with sugar (good - in fact sugar is way down on the ingredient list), and it's got a nice texture. I ate the entire bar in one sitting (it's only 1.2 oz so it's not like you're eating a meal).Since I'm regularly looking for gluten-free snack options - this one actually works quite well. For an afternoon snack when I'm feeling peckish but don't want to be overwhelmed with sweet - this works. I would like a bit more of a bold chocolate and sea salt flavour, but it does seem to go well with all the whole grains and doesn't make me feel like I'm eating candy.I will give this a solid 4 stars - and would purchase it for regular healthy snack use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19MMTOV69EJR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVRD6S4#wasThisHelpful","R19MMTOV69EJR0","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you get in the box:Carrier top (including top access door) & bottomFront gated door12 screws and nuts (you will only use 6 in the assembly)Instruction papersLots of plastic and tapeA note on shipping: On my particular order it took one month to arrive. Generally I don't see amazon products taking this long - so it has taken me some time to get the product and prepare a review.The product seems well-tooled. The top and bottom sections fit into each other with only minimal effort, and the instructions are easy to follow to get them connected. Putting the front door on is easy to do and the mechanism has gentle moving springs that allow for one handed front-door operation (I point this out because nothing else on this carrier can be done with just one hand).After fitting the top into the bottom and connecting the front door, you'll fold down the four plastic flaps on the sides and lock them into place. This seems to be an unnecessary component to the product, as you will next be screwing the top into the bottom with six provided screws and nuts. In essence this gives you six screw-based locks and four plastic locks. Completely unnecessary and time consuming - and for those of you who want to take the carrier apart for easier storage, the screw-based locking is a showstopper.You will also see from the attached pictures that the screws are ridiculously hard to install - you have to push the nut into the bottom and hold it in place with a finger while you screw the screw in from the top side, making sure the nut doesn't fall out in the process. There are six of these to do - three on each side, however, you're provided 12 of them in the shipment, so I guess you can find another reason to use screws somewhere else.If you want the ability to remove the top from the bottom for easy storage DO NOT install the screws, otherwise you'll have to unscrew 6 of them just to dismantle the box for cleaning or storage. Based on what I've seen, using the four plastic locking tabs is sufficient for a medium or small cat to stay secure inside the box.Moving on to the top entrance door - this was a selling feature on the carrier so that you can load the pet in from the top or front. Problem is that it takes multiple hands and is not easy to open. On the top you'll see two spring-based levers that you have to pull forward. They do fit well into the recessed area, but unless you have tiny fingers they are not easy to get back out again. If you open one side then it opens like a door (vs. removing it completely from the top) which is nice, but the door doesn't stay open (keeps falling back closed) so you'll have to hold that open while trying to get your pet inside. This is a neat design in concept, but in actual use it's easier said than done.The front-loading door is what you would expect from a pet carrier. Works every time and opens and closes smoothly. I haven't had any issues getting a cat into and out of the front. On the top I find it easier to completely remove the top door vs. opening it from one side only.It's plastic so it's easy to wash out if your pet has a mess inside (which happens more often than not at our house). There are plenty of air vents all around the sides and top so your pet gets good air flow while traveling, but also some privacy. I generally put a small towel in the bottom of the carrier just to give them more comfort on a quick trip.So overall I'm taking two stars away for the product being very difficult to assemble, having unnecessary locking elements on the sides, being unable to very quickly take it apart for cleaning, and for the top door being difficult to manage whether removing completely or lifting a single side.I think there was some real possibility here for a clever product that allows flexibility in pet loading...but it seems overthought and overworked. I will continue to use it without the screw-based locking, and rarely using the top access door.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK05SJDFV0ARB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP6SMCI#wasThisHelpful","RK05SJDFV0ARB","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you get: two ""floral design"" lace curtains.Opening the package is very easy. Unzip the top and pull the curtains out. They are wrapped around a long piece of folded cardboard and are easy to remove.As you are unwrapping them from the cardboard, the first thing you're going to notice is how insubstantial they are. It's basically white fishnet with a floral pattern. The scalloped edges are poorly cut/tooled and mine were already quite frayed right out of the package. The work appears sloppy. I assume it is done by machine...but it looks like the knives must have been dull the day that mine went through the factory. Bits of fabric on the sides and bottom are completely uneven and look a mess.The material has a bit of a waxy feel to it, but otherwise feels sort of like 1-ply toilet paper. The stitching around the edges is uneven, sloppy, and sad.Since they are lace - do not expect ANY amount of light coverage from these. They are barely there and will not provide any darkness for your room if that's what you're interested in. As for privacy, they don't offer privacy either.The curtain rod sleeve at the top is uneven and poorly stitched. I took a ruler and measured the width in random places across the top and found up to a 1/4th in variance back and forth all the way across. This is less noticeable once you put the curtains up - but given the other quality issues I'm not sure you're going to leave them up for very long.If you are looking for a cheap, poorly constructed, floral lace accent curtain then this might work for you. If you want quality, light coverage, privacy, or something that actual looks nice...move on to something else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PU9YAX2NUDST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDXEI#wasThisHelpful","R1PU9YAX2NUDST","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's something very specific about this toothpaste that really sold it for me.That's usually hard to say - because it's toothpaste. After this many decades of products you really don't differentiate on anything other than texture and taste. They _all_ whiten your teeth. They _all_ are designed to remove plaque and stains. So companies seem to be almost desperate to switch things up so you'll buy a new product. Look, we all use toothpaste (well hopefully) and as long as you're using something consistently and seeing a dentist you should be fine.But...there is something that has always irritated me about many toothpastes and that is the texture and how it ""holds up"" to brushing. Frankly I don't care much about taste - mint is fine, coolness is fine, whatever is fine. But when I put the toothpaste on my toothbrush I want it to stay there and I want it to hold its consistency during the course of brushing and cleaning. That's where this product from Colgate shines for me.The product has a translucent white colour, with a texture unlike other pastes I've tried. This not only helps with brushing, but also with making the tube itself more clean. I haven't noticed any glops of toothpaste clinging to the dispenser. Every other toothpaste in a squeeze tube is a MESS - but this one isn't. The consistency of the paste keeps it from sticking and glopping to the container - and that's winning for me.When I put it in my mouth it doesn't immediately break up and fall out into the sink. It holds together and clings to my teeth for brushing. Again, winning. I feel like I'm wasting less of this product to the sink, and keeping more of it in my mouth for brushing.I do realize that differentiating a toothpaste seems a bit strange these days - but this is a product I can actually say I would get again for no other reason than the texture/consistency of the product. Yes it has a great (and light) minty coolness - but the selling point for me is that translucent white solid texture, which means less mess, and better mouthfeel for brushing.This one gets a full five stars from me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G4Y6VYITS5WO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2JPLRS#wasThisHelpful","R2G4Y6VYITS5WO","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do you get?A large tablecloth that will fit many sizes of table but is designed for a larger one since it's 70x84 inches.I put this on a smaller 4x3 tall table and it draped pretty far down the sides. That's great when you are using it for serving with guests over, but for sitting at the table for normal dining it's a bit too large and lays on your lap while you sit. That's not the fault of the tablecloth, it's just something to be aware of if you don't use this on a table large enough to accommodate 70x84 inches of fabric.The most important thing for me is easy cleanup with a variety of spills. That could be random bits of food, oil from a salad dressing, or the always enjoyable wine spill. These things do happen, and getting a moist cloth to quickly wipe it up is generally good for this tablecloth. It also holds up well in the washer.After several cycles, it has always come out with minimal wrinkles (I don't like using fabric softener with a tablecloth since it's going to be right where my food is), and I have not noticed any pulling or stretching of the fabric. Doesn't seem to be shrinking in the wash (I always wash on cold), and even with a colour-safe non-chlorine bleach it holds the colour (which in this case is a sort of shiny blue patterned look).The best use for this particular tablecloth, for me, is in outdoor use on a 6 foot table. It provides good coverage and looks nice in the spring because of the bright blue. You can then just shake it off (if you haven't spilled anything major on it) and fold it up for the next time.Overall a solid product, so I'm giving it 4 stars for looks, ability to do quick cleanup, and its durability in the washing machine and dryer over the course of several cycles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LUDDUEXBWY49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R68JMH6#wasThisHelpful","R2LUDDUEXBWY49","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's what you get: 4 delightful, crystal clear glasses for daily use and entertainment.Here's what I think: They work!The Food and Wine for Gorham glasses are a nice, elegant, sophisticated touch for your daily use or for having guests over to enjoy a tall glass of lemonade or tea. With a sturdy base, and solid glass construction, the glasses fit well in the hand and hold a nice dinner-sized glass of liquid. In terms of stability they sit well on a table and with the bottom portion slightly wider than the top I have not had any concerns about accidentally tipping over and spilling on the table.Washing these in the top rack of the dishwasher presents no problem, and they clean nicely to a sparkle finish. After repeated use and repeated washing I haven't noticed any loss of luster or transparency in the glass, nor have I seen any scratching or marring of the finish.Overall a solid 4 stars for these glasses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RETB8NF0O5ZH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWNTMW4#wasThisHelpful","RETB8NF0O5ZH0","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Freshness abounds in the Irish Spring Signature Exfoliating Bar Soap (try typing that three times fast).What do you get?A pack of three large soap bars which are described as ""man sized"" - which basically means they are hearty.What do they smell like?Irish Spring.Yep - the product smells just like the wonderful green version of soap - it's a crisp scent that takes you back to the waterfalls of Ireland (are there waterfalls in Ireland?) and with a peppery man-scent aftertaste. But seriously, there's really no scent like Irish Spring - it's been one of my fav scents of soap since Lava soap of years gone by.And speaking of Lava soap...what differentiates this Irish Spring product from the rest is the ""exfoliating scrub"" element - oak that gives your skin a light abrasive cleaning and really gets those dead skin cells off and down the drain. It feels good going on and isn't rough on the skin - but still feels manly, whatever that means.After using the soap (if I can get practical for just a moment) I noticed that the pleasing scent lingers for a while after showering. It sort of doubles as body spray / cologne but in a much nicer way. Personally I like the fresh smell that lasts through the first part of my day. It's kind of a just-showered smell...and it's especially nice to use if you shower just before bed, because you're going to crawl under the sheets and drift off into a pleasant waterfall-like dream-state as you're transported to the Emerald Isle...I'm getting carried away here.Overall a solid product from Irish Spring and I will definitely be buying MORE of this great soap. Solid 4 stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QWNJR78PAJUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOXI584#wasThisHelpful","R1QWNJR78PAJUM","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you get:Numi tea K-cups in the flavour of Moroccan MintThe positive:Aroma - the tea smells wonderful during brewing and as you're enjoying the product. The minty smell is pleasing while not overpowering. I've had mint tea before that can double as a decongestant - this tea doesn't. It's mild and pleasing but not overwhelming or what I would describe as ""powerful mint"" scent.What concerns me:There's a lot of plastic waste in these cups. Inside the translucent cup you'll see the small tea bag. If you look at some of the better coffee pods for Keurig style machines you'll find some that do not use a plastic cup at all - it's just the coffee inside a mesh filter. There is no real practical reason for these cups to have the plastic ""shell"" - they only need the tea bag style interior and your results will be identical. That's because the water isn't hanging out inside the cup steeping...it's being pressurized right through it into your tea cup or mug. So to me, there's a lot of waste here because most people won't take the time to follow the printed instructions to remove the foil top and recycle the plastic. People are going to just grab it and toss it.I also have to agree with many other reviewers that the tea is VERY weak. I've tried it on small, medium, and large and the taste is just above flavoured water. Now, I don't always have to have strong tea, but you can get the same quality by putting a few fresh mint leaves in hot water and steeping them. There doesn't seem to be much added value in this product beyond what you can do yourself with a fresh sprig of mint and water.If you're looking for a bold tea, this isn't it. If you're looking for a very mild mint-ish tea, then this will work fine for you. I'm giving this product a middle of the road rating not because of the strength of the tea (because YOU might prefer the more mild style) but for the product waste as the primary detractor of one star.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLJJ2LILD1Q8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFFMUQQ#wasThisHelpful","RLJJ2LILD1Q8Q","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you get:3 products in one package: Acne deep scrub, Spot/Blemish control, and a ""Mattifier""The deep scrub is meant for daily cleansing for your entire face / neck; the spot zinger is to put specifically on a blemish; the mattifier is a lotion-like product designed to minimize visible pores.Let's start with the packaging - it's not frustration-free.Each of the containers inside the box is attached and held in place by a 1""x1"" sticky piece of foam. The products are difficult to remove from the box and get away from the stick foam, and in the case of the mattifier container I was left with foam still stuck to the bottom of the product when I finally got it out of the box. I'm not sure that I've ever seen product packaging this unfriendly. The packaging doesn't impact the function of the product, but it's important to note that you will not have an easy time removing them from the box.Product 1 - Acne Hater Deep ScrubThis is a greenish gel product that smells sort of like fruit cocktail with mint. You get your warm water going, and massage it all over your face and neck. I've done this both in the shower and at the sink. The product smells very nice and goes on easily. The abrasives in the gel are just the right texture so as to provide the scrubbing power, but not feel like you're scratching your face. It was easy to work up into a light lather and then wash off in warm water. My preference is to do this in the shower so that I can completely wash it off my face. At the sink it took a lot more time.After finishing, the scent remained and was pleasant, and my face had a cooling sensation.Product 2 - Spot ZingerThis is a white thick cream in a small tube that you put directly onto blemishes. It's go salicylic acid just like every other acne or pimple treatment out there. It goes on clean and massages in without an oily residue. In terms of product performance I always compare these things to Burt's Bees Blemish Stick, which is a product that I have a constant stock of because it's just that darn good. Burt's Bees will get rid of a blemish is less than 24-hours in most cases. This product does seem to work well but took a little longer to clear up a spot I had on my face as compared to my preferred product. It didn't fail...it just wasn't as fast or effective. It didn't have a negative smell - but I guess smelled like many other acne creams on the market.Product 3 - Swirled MattifierI've never heard this term before. Basically what it's supposed to do is reduce redness and pores so that your skin looks smoother and shiny and whatever the heck mattifier really means. My nose has some visible pores so that's where I started. This is a pump bottle with a thick white cream that is the consistency of a typical face / skin lotion. It went on smoothly (and it's recommended you use it directly after using the cleaner and spot zinger - thus the 1-2-3 system). I didn't notice an immediate decrease in my pores but I guess they were a bit less visible. It wasn't significant enough for me to say there was immediate effectiveness. I will say that my skin remained smooth and the product was not oily or greasy. From the lotion perspective it went on easily and didn't make me feel like I was caked in product. That's good.Overall I would say this is a solid product line. My favourite product of the 3 is the deep scrub because of the very pleasant and not overpowering scent, the ease of use and removal, and the way my skin tingled when it was done. In terms of the blemish fighting components - they work...but so do most other acne products on the market so I'm not sure how to differentiate those from the rest.I suppose that as a ""system"" these work well together in a 1-2-3 format. You can do it in less than five minutes and be on your way without anyone knowing that you have a bunch of product on your face. High marks for staying non-greasy and non-oily, and for the light scent that actually seems to work well.I give these products a solid 4 stars (but the packaging gets a fail).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXJO0RPWKIGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKD61GA#wasThisHelpful","R1BXJO0RPWKIGD","A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will start off by saying that the web slinging in this game is great. Instead of just magically grabing the sky it actually has to connect with a building. The triggers correspond to the hand that spider-man slings with. Some of the alternate suits looked pretty cool as well. I really dig the 2099 costume look in this game.Unfortunately everything else about the game is average at best. The faces of all of the characters look nothing like the movie or comic book characters. There are side missions that you can do, but they are pretty much all repeats of the same 6 missions or so. This is kind of disappointing because it makes the city exploring between missions feel really empty. You can't interact with the civilians on the ground and there are no things like thiefs or thugs to interact with outside of a mission.The different suits you unlock level up and have different perks. This means you will probably find one that you like and stick with it for a majority of the game (symbiot suit for me). One minor annoyance with this is that you have to go to Peters house to change, and the way to get there is to land on a moving subway which is not always available. So if you unlock a new suit and want to see it's stats right away you have to try it on, then go home and change back if you don't like it.The fighting is ok, nothing great, nothing terrible. The usually hit attack over and over then hit parry when your spider senses tingle.One of the biggest disappointments is that there are a lot few villians/cameos than I was expected. I was hoping to see a lot more.Over all I've played worse, but this definitely could have been better.Pros:-Great webslingingCons:-Crashed on me a couple times-Empty bland city-Needed more super villains-Same 6 missions types repeated over and over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRYHKJGWES07M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU9O05S#wasThisHelpful","RRYHKJGWES07M","AGYBSEOZESADQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGYBSEOZESADQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a huge fan of Reynolds and his use of actual science within his novels. I got the Audible version and think that John Lee does a great job of narrating the series. In the beginning it may seem a little hard to follow along since the story jumps between characters and time periods, but after a while you get used to it, and the stories eventually merge into one larger story.

"Lately it had been getting cold at night so my wife and I were looking for a decent price heated blanket. We have been using this every night for approximately 3 months and we love it. Like most heated blankets you can feel the cords runnign through it, but it is not a huge deal. We tend to put it on top of the sheet, and turn it on a few minutes before going to bed, then turning it off when in bed in order to preheat it for us. If you fall asleep with it on, you might get alittle too hot even at lower settings.It has 10 settings, but in general you pretty much only feel the difference  between the highest and the middle setting. Over all, we are very pleased.Update: 11/25/14 After about a year, this thing does not heat up nearly has warm as it used to. It still warms up a little but barely.

"[Like another reviewer, Ive had an older review of this book buried by Amazon, and Im re-posting a revised version of that older review, on a page which shows up when searched, so that the curious reader has some real chance of finding it.]There seem to be currently available four complete English translations of Wolfram von Eschenbachs Middle High German Parzival, an early, and slightly eccentric, version of the Grail Quest. Wolfram, both a knight (according to most scholars) and a (slightly eccentric) poet from thirteenth-century southern Germany, is the author of this long Arthurian romance, of a long Carolingian epic, Willehalm, and of a fragmentary Arthurian romance, Titurel, and either eight or nine lyrics (depending on the attribution of some of them). His complaints about rival poets, and their replies to him, have turned out to be clues to relative dating of their works. On this and external evidence, Wolframs poetic career has been dated between about 1195 and 1225; with the almost 25,000 lines of Parzival being composed between about 1200 and 1210.The oldest of these translations is Jessie L. Westons nineteenth-century verse rendering, Parzival: A Knightly Epic (1894, with some later reprintings), although I hesitate to recommend it. Nabu Press (among others) has issued it in paperback, as well as out-of-copyright Middle High German text editions and Modern German translations. Many of these, and others, can be also be found at archive.org (the Library of Congress website, Internet Archive), although the two volumes of Westons translation must be searched for as Parzival, and not under the translators name. (Archive.org also makes available the 1891 fifth edition of Karl Lachmanns enduring edition of Wolframs works; Edwards, Hatto, and Mustard and Passage, the prose translators, mainly used the 1926 revised sixth edition, or later revised printings.)Jessie L. Weston is probably best known as the author of From Ritual to Romance, propounding a (now discarded) theory of the origins of the Holy Grail story, but she was also an enthusiastic Wagnerian -- which introduced her, by way of the opera Parsifal, to Wolframs Parzival. She also produced some interesting studies of the larger Perceval tradition and of Sir Lancelot (both as found in French), and a string of translations of Arthurian material not represented in Malory (i.e., not in Le Morte DArthur, the great English compendium of medieval Arthuriana).There are Project Gutenberg editions of a number of Westons works, including Parzival, some of them available in Kindle format, among other versions. In fact there are three or four Kindle editions of her Parzival currently (November 2015) available; some observing the original two-volume hardcover arrangement in its now digital format, for which I cant see any necessity (as I noted in my reviews).Westons translation suffers, in a present-day perspective, from its basis in nineteenth-century linguistic and historical studies, and for many readers (certainly not all) its rhymed couplets will become tedious before very long. And, of course, Wolframs precise meaning is sometimes sacrificed to the demands of English verse.The most recent translation, in prose, is Cyril Edwards Parzival: With Titurel and the Love Lyrics (2004).  It includes a fragmentary related work, and Wolframs contributions to the Minnesaenger (love poetry) tradition, which makes it attractive. The price of the original hardcover edition is against starting with it! A more reasonably-priced paperback, aimed at the student market and the ordinary reader, is now (from 2006) available in a shorter format as Parzival and Titurel in the Oxford Worlds Classics series; I have reviewed it separately, based on its Kindle edition. In brief Edwards translation may be more faithful to Wolframs style, but some readers find it difficult going. (Also, although the OWC edition has some excellent notes, I preferred the fuller version, which Ive only consulted in a library.)Of the other two prose translations, the older is Parzival: A Romance of the Middle Ages (usually cited without the subtitle, in my experience), translated by Helen M. Mustard and Charles E. Passage, and published by Vintage Books (Random House), in 1961. Provided as it is with an engaging Introduction, occasional clarifying footnotes, Additional Notes, an Index of Persons, and a Genealogical Table, I found it an attractive entrance to Wolfram-studies, and Middle High German literature beyond the Nibelungenlied. (There is also a schematic map showing the disposition of forces in one of Wolframs more confusing descriptions of a siege). The language of the translation is relatively colloquial, and has been criticized as both inexact in its use of hunting and heraldic terms, and perhaps too American in language(!).A more valid criticism, in my opinion, pointed out that a good deal of the introduction is spent discussing discarded theories floated by Jessie L. Weston in her translation. Since Westons version was the one most likely to be familiar to Mustard and Passages original readers (if they knew anything about Wolfram at all), this made a certain amount of sense, but they might have mentioned that her views were no longer taken very seriously.The cover art (designed by Fritz Kredel) is a genuinely medieval portrait of the armored Wolfram, faceless under his knightly helmet; the red cloth worn by the knight  and his horse  alludes to the Red Knight and his gear in the text of Parzival, but there seems to have been no traditional conception of Wolframs appearance, or his coat of arms (assuming he had one).Almost twenty years later, A.T. Hatto (on whose sometimes intemperate review of the Vintage translation I have been drawing) produced his own version, in the Penguin Classics (1980); the cover art, which has changed from time to time, has so far used manuscript illuminations of scenes from the poem.Like Hattos earlier Nibelungenlied translation for Penguin, it is in prose, and has, instead of an extended discussion before reading, an appended Introduction to a Second Reading, along with a Glossary of Personal Names, and a List of Works in English for Further Reading. The critical discussion is excellent, and postponing it until a reader has a chance to form an opinion is an interesting idea. At least the student wont be quite so tempted to substitute reading the editorial commentary for a reading of the text, if one has to look for it. On the downside, Hatto is a bit reticent when it comes to distinguishing his (interesting and worthwhile) opinions from the scholarly consensus.Hattos English is a bit obviously British (not that this should matter, *either*); and some of his corrected readings (in terms of his objections to Mustard and Passage) are actually more difficult to follow, unless you are already familiar with the technical languages of hunting and blazonry. Otherwise, for example, the Mustard and Passage translation of a pair of birds is going to be clearer than Hattos a brace of them. This was not the case with Hattos translation of the Tristan of Wolframs rival, Gottfried von Strassburg (also from Penguin). The Tristan tradition makes a great point of how its hero uses the correct  meaning fashionable  hunting language, and Hatto was there, obviously, correct to reproduce the impression of mastery of an esoteric art.Either version is enjoyable, although Hatto (obviously) seems a bit more concerned with precision, and Mustard and Passage a little more with immediate appeal to readers. Edwards, with earlier translations offering relatively easy access to the poem, goes in for technical accuracy rather than immediate clarity; Wolfram is notorious for obscure imagery and riddling passages. I enjoy it now, but I have to wonder whether it would have won me over to Wolfram as the Mustard and Passage translation did, years ago. (Ive bought several copies of their version over the years, as replacement for a worn-out one, or as gifts.)Wolfram himself was translating, in his own fashion, Chretien de Troyes unfinished Perceval, or, The Story of the Grail  although he himself claims to have an additional source, the mysterious Kyot, who had a better, truer, version. Since Chretien himself claimed to have been working from a source provided by a patron, this has at times sent scholars searching in many directions. Jessie Westons theory, emphasizing Wolframs references to Anjou and the Angevins, whose dynasty of Counts had come to rule England (see Henry II), was as plausible as most, and just as much a blind alley.Wolfram mostly used his imagination quite freely, but It looks to me as if he had some sort of additional material, even if he freely embroidered on what it was. There is an odd resemblances to Moriaen, an apparent interpolation in the medieval Dutch metrical translation of the French Lancelot-Grail romances, for example. This story of Sir Perceval's ""Moorish"" kinsman was also translated by Jessie Weston, this time in prose, under the title ""Morien""  (there are several Kindle editions of this, as well as hard-copy reprints; and a Project Gutenberg rendition).Turning back to ""Parzival"" itself, we find an entire opening section, unique to Wolfram, with the heros father, Gahmuret the Anschevin, having adventures in a vaguely-conceived Near East and North Africa, where he leaves a pagan wife and son, the latter, the multi-colored Feirefiz, crossing paths with Wolframs main hero years later. (It is worth noting that, although Wolfram is a snob, and is fascinated by physical differences between human beings, he is in no sense a racist; color is no bar to aristocracy.)This chivalric adventuring is followed by Gahmurets second marriage, return to war in the East, and death, and, following Chretien at last, the birth and upbringing in forest isolation of Parzival himself, his fateful encounter with Arthurs knights, Parzival's ignorant blunders as he seeks to become one of them, and the splitting of the story to include the exploits of Sir Gawain (recognizable under German renderings, variously handled by translators over the years), and Parzivals first adventure at the Grail Castle. As usual, Parzival misinterprets some of the wise advice he has been given, with serious results.This much is derived from Chretiens account of Perceval and Gauvain, all retold in Wolframs quirky style. Then Wolfram returns to what seems to be new material, writing his own conclusion to both sets of adventures. (Eric Rohmers film version of Perceval is a splendid visualization of Chretiens version, and works almost equally well for the relevant parts of Wolframs retelling, too.)As in other versions, Chretiens very mysterious graal (a kind of serving dish) is drawn into a Christian conception of the universe. But Wolfram explains the ""Grl"" as a sort of magic stone that fell to earth during the War in Heaven, not a relic of the Last Supper, and certainly not the familiar drinking vessel. That more explicitly Christianized version seems to belong to the Old French cycle of Joseph of Arimathea, Merlin and Perceval, attributed to Robert de Boron, and was later picked up and amplified in the Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian romances (centering on Lancelot, and introducing Galahad as the Quest hero, alongside Perceval), the version known in English through Malory, and, so far as the Chalice interpretation, also used by Wagner.Wagner plundered Wolfram for names and a certain German quality for his Grail opera, Parsifal, besides using another version of a story Wolfram alludes to in Lohengrin, and the poets name for a character in Tannhauser. Personally, I suggest tossing aside all Wagnerian preconceptions, if any, and allowing Wolframs real personality to have a chance. Sarcastic (especially about competitors), sentimental (especially about wives and children), full of pride in the knightly caste (a new phenomenon, which its members wanted to be very old), arrogantly announcing that he is completely illiterate in the company of poets who boasted they could read anything ever written, he is both annoying and lovable. A living personality, in fact, appearing in a time more used to anonymous authors.For those who find Parzival a pleasure, or who would like to try a more military, rather than chivalric, work, there are also translations of his Willehalm, based on the Old French *chanson de geste* of William Curt-Nose, or Guillaume lOrange, one of the heroes of the legends of Charlemagne and his descendants. I am familiar with two, both into prose. One, by Marion E. Gibbs and Sidney M. Johnson, was published by Penguin Classics in 1984, and is currently in print, as Wolfram von Eschenbach: Willehalm. Charles E. Passage, one of the co-translators of Parzival, had earlier translated it as The Middle High German Poem of Willehalm by Wolfram von Eschenbach, published by Frederick Ungar in 1977. Although it is out of print, used copies of the trade paperback edition seem to be available. Mustard also translated the fragments of Titurel for Ungar (not seen).Curiously, the supposedly illiterate Wolfram seems unusually aware of the idea (if not the facts) of history. The Pagan Saracens of his French source are connected by him with the Romans (as descended from the followers of Pompey, rather than of Caesar, and heirs of an old feud), and also with the extra-European characters he had already invented for Parzival. He rather neatly brings into the correct sequence his versions of Arthurian and Carolingian Europe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RICX378HAHIJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBYAN2G#wasThisHelpful","RICX378HAHIJY","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just in case Amazon software jumbles up reviews of different editions, I am here reviewing the Kindle edition of an SPQR Study Guide, edited by Paul Hudson, Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum: Latin + English + Vocabulary, by St. Bede (second edition, 2013).The Study Guide consists of a Latin text (source edition unspecified), an English translation (by A.M. Sellars; in the public domain, since it dates from 1907, and was itself a revision of a revision), and vocabulary lists. These lists follow each chapter, which are presented first in Latin and then in English, so those trying to use the Latin text dont have to go far for help. (This is the standard format for Hudsons SPQR Study Guides, and is also used for Greek, rather than Latin, texts.)The Latin and the English translation, but not the vocabulary lists, are included, with much other Latin literature, in the expanded edition of Hudsons app SPQR, which is available for iOS (Apple) and, more recently, for Android.What may be the same Latin text, and is certainly the same translation, can also be found in another Kindle edition, Complete Historical Works of the Venerable Bede (Illustrated), in the Delphi Ancient Classics series (Book 45). This Delphi collection also contains translations of a few of Bedes shorter works, and some whose attribution is dubious, perhaps justifying ""The Comple"" part of their title, but it does not include the year-by-year Chronicles he attached to some of his other works (on reckoning dates and times). It does not contain anything dedicated to assisting the reader with the Latin text, beyond presenting it by itself and in a chapter-by-chapter dual-text arrangement (much like Hudsons).Hudsons edition is, therefore, probably the best inexpensive choice, in digital format, for those who actually want to try Bedes Latin (generally considered excellent, and very clear), or who need to have a Latin text available to check references.For those studying Latin, and not interested in Bede as an historian, another alternative is F.W. Garforth's 2004 collection of excerpts from the Latin text, as ""Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica."")The 1930 Loeb Classical Library bilingual edition, available in many libraries, uses as the base text of its translation an early Elizabethan rendering [!]. This translation, admittedly, sounds great, but often is harder to follow than necessary.Fluent Latinists, and cautious students, will certainly want to check Charles Plummers classic 1896 edition, the much more recent Oxford Medieval Texts edition by Bertrand Colgrave and R.A.B. Mynors (1969, with corrections 1992; this also includes a translation), and Michael Lapidges edition of 2005 (not seen).For those who just want to read the book in English, I will give some alternatives at the end.The author is named on the cover as St. Bede. Now, Bede (or Beda, c. 672-735) is, technically, recognized as a Saint, but he never had much of a following in that role. (He is also the only Englishman to be an official Doctor of the Church.) He is most commonly, and recognizably, referred to in historical literature as the Venerable Bede (Latin Beda Venerabilis), also an honorific Christian title, if less theologically-charged. And, of course, he is often cited simply as Bede, on the assumption that everyone will know who is meant.So the attribution to St. Bede of the present edition of the Latin text plus English translation (and, of course, that helpful chapter-by-chapter Latin vocabulary) of his most famous work may cause some confusion for the uninitiated, but is not wrong.Of course, St. Bede may have been the safest choice, given the ways Amazon (and other) listings of his works have treated the combination of name and title, such as ""Bede the Venerable"" or Bede, Venerable, the (with other variations, including, as is all too frequently the case, jumbling the authors name with that of an editor or translator).(Search software, including Amazons, sometimes has trouble with the name, since Bede is, albeit rarely, used as a modern Christian name, and false hits come up on searches; fortunately, not as often as for some other names.)In Bedes own time, and somewhat later, he was probably best known among other clerics for his scriptural commentaries and his works on computing the date of Easter (a difficult mathematical problem, complicated by disputes over the basic rules). Eventually, of course, other commentaries came along, and the Easter Controversy became a thing of the past. He is best known to moderns simply as the author of the work presented here, Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, or Ecclesiastical History of the English People. (Some have rendered it, for the sake of clarity, as History of the English Church and People).The title reveals that Bede, is concerned with political history mainly as a background to the growth and establishment of Christianity among the heathen English, and the establishment of Papal authority (beginning with the Roman date for Easter) in all of Britain, and Ireland. In this, Bede shows the influence of the early Christian historian Eusebius, a contemporary of the Emperor Constantine, with his account of the the Christianization of the Roman Empire.Despite some attention to the Roman occupation of Britain (beginning with Julius Caesar in Bedes account), and the early post-Roman period (derived at least in part from the opaque writings of Gildas), Bede is mostly concerned with his own people, the Angles, Saxons and Jutes (although exactly whom he meant by the latter is disputed). His main concern is their conversion to Christianity, and other inhabitants of the island are often graded according to their contribution to it.(The British  meaning the Welsh  dont come off very well, since they seem to have been more concerned with getting rid of the Anglo-Saxon invaders than saving their souls. However, Bede had to admit that there were English Christians before the Roman Church took a hand in missionary endeavors, and a general acknowledgement of the role of the Irish Church may not account for it. Especially because Bede also slides over the role of the British, such as St. Patrick, in converting the ""pagan"" Irish to the True Faith.)Bedes book was written in the early eighth century (and completed about 731). It was recognized as important from an early date  as witnessed by copies sent to or made on the Continent, as well as in Britain  and survives from the early Middle Ages in an impressive number of manuscripts; enough to warrant a Wikipedia article listing them (and later ones, too: quite apart from the article on Bede himself, another specifically on the Ecclesiastical History, and an article on Bedes works in general.)As a mark of the increasing importance given to the work in England, there was in the late ninth century an abridged translation into Old English (Anglo-Saxon)  which scholars used to associate with Alfred the Great, although this connection is now discounted.As for straight translations, which I promised to discuss, there are inexpensive digital editions of some nineteenth-century translations (and more expensive hard-copy reprints of them), none of which I can recommend with any confidence. The one most likely to be used is by an industrious Victorian, J.A. Giles, who was revising an earlier translation by John Stevens. Giles also edited the Latin text, but (besides problems with the translation itself) his work rests on an insecure base, as the problems (and solutions) of dealing with the many Bede manuscripts had yet to be fully recognized.A.M. Sellars had the advantage of working with Charles Plummers exemplary text edition, which, although it is now seen as having some shortcomings, was clearly superior to anything that had gone before. Selalrs' reworking of Giles/Stevens is certainly passable. However, it is, to my mind, rather stodgy reading, and its nineteenth-century assumptions about the Medieval past sometimes show through. If you are going to read his version, it might as well be with the Latin text as a back-up  so the SPQR or Delphi versions are indicated.So far as I can tell, for almost half of the twentieth century the translation most likely to be used by the student was the Penguin Classics rendering by Leo Sherley-Price, initially as The History of the English Church and People. This has been expanded with additional material translated by D.H. Farmer, and with Sherley-Prices translation and notes revised, with the title being changed along the way to the more literal Ecclesiastical History of the English People. Despite the original translators somewhat obtrusive concern that his readers come down on the right (orthodox) side of the theological disputes Bede mentions, it has considerable merits as a piece of engaging writing (in my opinion, anyway). It originally appeared in 1955, was reprinted with revisions in 1965, revised again in 1968, and revised and expanded in 1990. The 1990 edition, frequently reprinted, is currently available in Kindle as well as paperback; and hardcover reprints of an earlier edition are sometimes available from dealers. In the expanded editions it appears as Ecclesiastical History of the English People: With Bedes Letter to Egbert and Cuthberts Letter on the Death of Bede.Penguin also offers a volume of translations of other works, under the title of ""The Age of Bede"" (originally published in shorter form as ""Lives of the Saints,"" and expanded and revised several times), which contains Bede's ""Life of St. Cuthbert"" and his ""Lives of the Abbots"" (of his home monastery), besides other early documents. I have reviewed ""The Age of Bede"" (and also the ""Lives of the Saints"" edition) separately. Again, this is available in Kindle format.Slightly more recent than the last revision of the Penguin ""Ecclesiastical History,"" and also with supplementary material, some of it additional to the later Penguin editions, is the Oxford Worlds Classics revision of the translation by Bertrand Colgrave and R.A.B. Mynors in their 1969 Oxford Medieval Texts edition. The OWC version was edited by Judith McClure and Roger Collins, appearing in 1994, under the title of ""The Ecclesiastical History of the English People: The Greater Chronicle: Bede's Letter to Egbert."" As the title indicates, it is supplemented by a translation of Bedes Greater Chronicle (from one of his works on time-keeping and dating), and of his Letter to Egbert concerning the condition of society and the Church in Bedes later years. It was originally under the ""World's Classics"" label, and was reissued in the renamed series in 1999. Although it is not mentioned in the title, this volume also contains ""Cuthbert's Letter on the Death of Bede."" It too is available in both paperback and Kindle editions.Annoyingly, although the Oxford World's Classics is my favorite translation (as a translation), I have to report that the conversion to Kindle format was not very thorough. There are no separate Table of Contents links to the five ""books"" of the History, let alone to the individual chapters in each. Cross-references in the notes are given by pages -- which are not evident in the digital form -- with no hyperlinks provided. The same is true of the excellent index, so the reader has to use the Search function (which is inconvenient at best). The map of Bede's England is included, but treated as an image, so that the lettering in the most crowded portions seems (to me, at least) to blur together.On the other hand, the Kindle edition of the Penguin translation (which is also quite good as a translation) is quite thoroughly hyperlinked, including the chapter titles and the index, The maps and genealogical trees of various dynasties of Anglo-Saxon rulers are legible, although for some reason these do not appear if you are using the Cloud Reader. (Amazon lists this as a 2003 edition, but the copyright page indicates no revisions after 1990; presumably the reference is to one of the reprintings, as it is too early to be the Kindle release itself.)Of course, both the paperback and Kindle editions of the Penguin and Oxford translations are considerably more expensive than the SPQR Study Guide, not to mention the various antiquated public-domain versions available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZ0WKO6ZKY12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESMMU5O#wasThisHelpful","R3OZ0WKO6ZKY12","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given the way Amazon software jumbles together review of different editions and translations, I want to make it clear that this review is of G. N.

The edition from its first publisher is out of print, but hardcover, paperback, and digital editions of it are available from Pomona Press, and are listed on Amazon, and elsewhere. (A few years ago I favorably reviewed the digital edition from its iBook rendering, but I assume that the Kindle version is equally good.)Garmonsways mid-twentieth-century translation was by an excellent scholar, working with still-current editions of the texts. There are a number of reprint and digital editions (Kindle, iBook, etc.) of other translations available. Except for Michael Swantons translation  which was intended as a replacement for Garmonsways in the publishers list, these are public-domain versions of nineteenth-century renderings.Those used for Kindle editions (and other platforms) include the 1823 translation by James Ingram, which was based on inadequate editions, and, in some cases Anne Gurneys occasionally wildly inaccurate translation of 1819.

Dent chose to reprint it, in spite of its considerable shortcomings in little things like accuracy, because the lay-out of their significantly better 1909 translation had been ruled in violation of the copyright of the text edition on which it was based (Earle and Plummer, Two of the Saxon Chronicles, which actually included more texts than the title indicated.The various editions of Gurney, Ingram, and Giles now have little value, except perhaps for finding out what a Victorian (or very late Regency) gentleman might know about his own countrys past!The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (which I have sometimes seen cited as The Old English Chronicle) is the collective name for a whole set of chronicles, in manuscripts originally scattered across England. Arranged mainly year-by-year, with some longer stories, they mostly contain contemporary, or purportedly contemporary, accounts of important events: wars, the deaths of kings, bishops, and popes, and some interesting poems about such events. Some copies have descriptive prefaces, some begin with Julius Caesars invasion of Britain (slightly misdated at 60 B.C.) Some manuscripts also contain the charters, or alleged charters, of this or that monastery or church, normally indicating where it was copied.The different forms are clearly derived from a single original, but show considerable variation, due to different scribal practices and where and when they were copied and continued. Information in one copy can often be supplemented or corrected from another, allowing a better glimpse of Dark Age England.

(The fact that chronicles were *not* kept in Latin was unusual, and suggests that King Alfred was right about the poor state of learning in Viking-assaulted England.)It has been recognized since Elizabethan times as an important work, and one or another manuscript served as the basis of series of translations into English since the nineteenth century. Eventually, efforts were made to present two or more manuscripts together, producing a new round of translations.This translation was originally published by J.M. Dent in 1953, as part of the Everymans Library. It is the well-regarded, and often disliked, work of Norman Garmonsway(As noted earlier, it was replaced in the Dent list in 1996 by a translation by Michael Swanton, which I reviewed in early 2004.)Garmonsways version was well-regarded because it was very accurate, and because (like its withdrawn predecessor), the printed book followed the layout of a standard text edition going back to 1892 (which displayed some of the considerable variety among the manuscripts), as I mentioned earlier.This inconvenient-looking layout allowed the student referring to a copy of Earle and Plummers 1892 Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel edition to find the appropriate passage in the original language with little effort (and, of course, vice-versa)Both volumes of Earle-revised-by Plummer are among the editions available at archive.org.

However, that translation, although not tied to any Old English editions lay-out, does show the major variants in separate columns (minor ones are reserved for footnotes), and at times is harder to follow than Garmonsway/Swanton. In some cases it indicates in footnotes that it is suppressing irrelevant material  which may be exactly what the reader is looking for.To take one example, one of the two major manuscripts, the Peterborough Chronicle (otherwise E) contains a long passage about the founding of the monastery where it was copied, and the lands and privileges granted by the royal donors. The property list is suspect, and there is no way to check the story of the royal conference; but in Garmonsway and Swanton (scrupulously following the Earle and Plummer presentation), one can read it, and find what a tenth-century Englishman clearly thought was the correct form by which illiterate royals and nobles publicly affirmed a grant of land.I cant predict which of the editions of Garmonsways translation (original or revised, without or without expanded bibliography) is being offered by a given dealer, of course.

"[Note: My rating here is for the translation of ""Egil's Saga"" itself, not the basic work (which is superb of its kind), nor of the Kindle Edition. The review covers considerably more than the translation (by Green) used in the TIMELESS WISDOM edition. Amazon software usually, but not uniformly, links reviews of any translation of a book to other translations, making it hard to know what version the reviewer is talking about. This has happened with my other reviews of translations of ""Egil's Saga,"" and I've expanded them to cover all translations. This is the version I have posted here, since Amazon doesn't seem to have yet got around to it.]The story of Egil son of Grim the Bald (Skalla-Grim) is one of the prose works from medieval Iceland known as sagas, and of the major sagas it probably most closely approximates the image popularly associated with the word. The story is multi-generational. It features Viking adventures, and its primary hero is a devotee of Odin, god of kings, warriors, and poets. The hero's grandfather is rumored to be a werewolf, and the hero, himself both warrior and skald (poet), has thrilling encounters with berserkers and outlaws, and engages in a feud with a king, Eric Bloodaxe, whose wife (later the Queen-Mother) is a sorceress.Anyone expecting the hero to be a handsome Norseman from a storybook is going to be in for a shock, though. There are several such, including Egil's beloved brother, but, like some of his relatives, Egil himself is outstandingly ugly. (An explanation has been proposed recently, pointing out stray details in the verse and prose that suggest a now-recognizable medical disorder, possibly genetic.)The work-a-day life of medieval Iceland, with law-suits arising from it, central to the majority of the Sagas of the Icelanders, shows up only at intervals, as the action ranges from the Arctic Circle to England, and the central North Atlantic to the eastern Baltic.""Egil's Saga"" is thought by some to be the earliest of the ""Sagas of the Icelanders,"" and is in some ways a good, although atypical, introduction to them. Egil's circle of friends, enemies (especially Queen-Mother Gunnhild), and family members (most notably his equally formidable, if much more attractive, daughter, Thorgerd) show up in other sagas, especially ""Njal's Saga' and ""Laxdaela Saga.""Egil was counted as an ancestor by Snorri Sturluson, the author of the ""Prose Edda,"" an explanation of myths, heroic legends and traditional verse forms, and of the ""Heimskringla,"" a massive history of Norway through biographies of its kings. Snorri is one of the few Icelandic authors of the period whose name and attributed works both survive. The temptation to assign this saga to him is understandable, and has been championed by distinguished scholars. It doesn't seem to have been shared by the medieval scribes who transmitted the text.The theory was accepted by the first English translator of ""Egil's Saga,"" W.C. Green, whose version of 1893 was based on an obsolete edition of the text, and rendered it in a rather stuffy and prudish English. It has the advantage of being out of copyright, and various versions are available on-line, including at least one which claims to have been revised to bring it closer to the Icelandic original, not least by restoring some passages omitted to avoid giving offense to Victorian sensibilities. (In Reverend Green's world, men don't need to ""go outside"" after drinking all night for any *specified* reason...) [Note: as mentioned above, this translation is the one used in the TIMELESS WISDOM edition.]Green's translation also had some annoying minor features. He followed the dubious practice of tacking on vowels to names, to make sure his readers could tell the boys from the girls. So Gunnhildr -- everyone else's Queen Gunnhild -- shows up as Gunnhilda, and the lady Hildirid (Old Icelandic Hildiridhr) becomes Hildirida. Perhaps Reverend Green should have remembered that Gunnhild was reported to be a sorceress, and known to be spiteful (a prominent factor in this saga, and several others, including the great ""Njal's Saga"") before meddling with her name!Anyone reading Green's translation, even an ""improved"" version, should remember that it is NOT a perfect introduction to the sagas in general, or to this one in particular. And the saga has been fortunate in its twentieth-century translators.Green's version was followed, over a generation later, in 1930, by this careful, elaborately annotated, translation by E.R. Eddison, whose fantasy novel ""The Worm Ouroboros"" and historical novel of Viking-Age Sweden, ""Styrbiorn the Strong,"" both had been published in the 1920s.Eddison's version, originally issued by Cambridge University Press, is not for everyone, but has many merits. Although that original printing is hard to find, and expensive, it was reprinted by Greenwood in 1968, and that version is sometimes available. A new, reasonably priced, reprinting is much to be desired. Given the prices usually asked for it, my advice to the curious would be to try a library. (I count myself fortunate to have acquired a copy in the 1970s.)[Note, November 2015: In 2014, HarperCollins announced paperback and Kindle editions of Eddison's translation, along with his fiction. It appeared after some delays, and I have been using the Kindle edition, which seems to have been well-executed so far as the main text is concerned. (However, I find that, on re-reading Eddison's prefatory material, I should have said that he had the *advice* of the *editor* -- Sigurdur Nordal -- of the then-latest critical edition, not a copy of that edition itself.) Unfortunately, there are some shortcomings in the Kindle edition's handling of the Notes and the Index. The Notes contain frequent cross-references by page number, and these numbers are not indicated in the Kindle transfer, nor are there hyperlinks to such passages. The (voluminous and detailed) Index likewise gives only page numbers, not hyperlinks. ]Now, as far as the quality of the translation goes, views are mixed. It helped that Eddison was able to use an advance text of what was then the latest scholarly edition, published in 1933, which was still the standard for the next three translations. [See Note, above.].However, Eddison's attempt to approximate the sounds and syntax of Old Norse with an English style using as many related words as possible, instead of more familiar equivalents derived from French or Latin, takes getting used to; and some people never do. Eddison is, of course, rather scornful of Green, both for his Victorian English and his prudishness.On the whole, this translation is the sort of delicacy -- the caviar, if you will -- that some people love, and others never get a taste for, and wouldn't even if it should be readily available.Now the sagas themselves are notable for an unadorned prose, so the very concept of Eddison's translation was criticized by scholars who reviewed it at the time -- although they added that they found that the result was better than Eddison's theory.It undoubtedly helped that they had large English vocabularies, and were used to old Germanic syntax -- but, back in the 1960s, I managed to enjoy it without their advantages, although it took a couple of renewals before I finished the library volume.They did not complain that Eddison's versions of Egil's major poems (which are extremely impressive) are carefully annotated because they badly need the explanations. The language of the skalds (the high-class poets of the medieval Scandinavian world) was esoteric and convoluted in its own time, Egil was renowned for impressively ""hard"" poems, and Eddison's choice of language and style is unquestionably appropriate for the verse, if not the prose.As for alternatives:A much more colloquial translation by Gwyn Jones, for the American-Scandinavian Foundation, was published in 1960, and reprinted in 1970. Jones' version is less ""full-bodied"" than Eddison's, but still an impressive rendering of the saga's lean prose. (Although I can't agree with Christine Fell's view that his was ""the first readable English version."" After all, I read and enjoyed Eddison's!) Jones' treatment of Egil's poems is lucid, but hardly even attempts to emulate Eddison's feat of producing verse in something like the original meters. It too, unfortunately, is out of print, but, unlike the 1930 edition of Eddison's translation, Jones' is sometimes available at comparatively reasonable prices. It too could do with a reprinting!This leaves three more recent versions. The translation, as ""Egils' Saga,"" by Christine Fell, with the poems translated by John Lucas (a sensible division of labor), was published in the old Everyman's Library in 1975. It was included in Everyman Paperbacks in 1985, with some revisions, and reprinted in 1993 with additional bibliography, but seems to be out of print. It may be picked up in the current Everyman Paperback Classics series. I certainly hope so, since it is very readable, although I at first found the prose a little flat after long familiarity with Eddison. The notes and indexes are the closest approximation to Eddison's in a translation, and the scholarship is obviously much more up-to-date than 1930.(For those who are truly serious students, the Viking Society for Northern Research has announced a new (2003) edition of the Icelandic text, as ""Egils Saga,"" edited by Bjarni Einarsson, with annotations in English, available through Cornell University Press [not seen]. This should supersede the commentary in any existing English translation. [Note, November 2015; this edition was ultimately issued by the Viking Society, and is currently listed on Amazon (where I reviewed it). See http://www.amazon.com/Egils-Saga-Bjarni-Einarsson/dp/0903521547/ref=cm_cr-mr-title ]The Fell / Lucas translation was followed immediately by a Penguin Classics version by Hermann Palsson and Paul Edwards (1976), which is quite enjoyable. The Glossary of Proper Names is a fairly good index of the characters, and the maps are usable. Footnotes provide translations of some place-names, and a few other details, but the legal issues at stake in various parts of the saga, and the major historical problems whenever Egil brushes up with documented events, cry out for annotation.The five-volume translation series of ""The Complete Saga of the Icelanders,"" published in 1997, includes Bernard Scudder's version of ""Egil's Saga."" His translation takes the lead place in a recent (2000) Penguin Classics volume, ""The Sagas of the Icelanders,"" a massive trade paperback based on ""The Complete Sagas."" It is there one of ten sagas, and seven shorter tales.It was also announced as a separate volume in the Penguin Classics for Spring 2005 (as ""Egil's Saga,"" of course), which I have not yet examined. Scudder's version is similar in style to the Jones, Fell, and Palsson and Edwards translation, and his rendering of the poems aims at the meaning more than the style, following Jones and Palsson and Edwards, rather than Eddison or (the less extreme) Lucas in trying to give an impression of the artistry of the verse.In practical terms, for most people this comes down to Green, in one an on-line or other digital version, and a translation from Penguin; probably Scudder's, if it is the only one Penguin keeps in their catalogue.Reprintings of Eddison, Jones, and Fell would all be welcome.I would NOT advise relying on any version of Green exclusively, but it might be consulted if convenient -- and its electronic forms may be searchable, which can be handy.For those interested in a modern fiction writer's view of Egil and his associates, the late Poul Anderson's ""Mother of Kings"" is an interesting quasi-historical novel in which Egil is a major character. (I call it quasi-historical because, as Anderson warns, the story adopts attractive medieval legends about Gunnhild on some key points, instead of following the historical evidence; and a fantasy interpretation, although not required, is not ruled out.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N9EV0IZ6AUUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPXIVPE#wasThisHelpful","R2N9EV0IZ6AUUF","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In case reviews of entirely different editions start to appear together (again), at Amazon softwares whim: this is a review of the Delphi Classics Complete Works of Sir Thomas Malory (a Kindle book, 2014). It contains two versions, one in modernized spelling, of the late fifteenth-century work best known as Le Morte DArthur (or Darthur), by (of course) Thomas Malory, who translated or adapted his material from older French and Middle English accounts of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. As will be explained at greater length, one text is derived from the first printed edition, the other from what is known as the Winchester Manuscript.Despite the somewhat unexpected title of Complete Works (a standard Delphi title, some of the implications of which I will explain below), instead of mentioning King Arthur, the edition is extremely handy. However, it contains contradictory statements, carelessly left in place due to reprinting old editorial notes from one of its sources alongside more up-to-date information. Unfortunately, too, it shares with many other Delphi Classics editions the failure to give full (or even partial) information about the sources of its texts, except by seeming inadvertence.For those not already familiar with the subject, Le Morte DArthur (i.e. The Death of Arthur, or, in proper Parisian Medieval French, La Mort Artu), or The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table, is written in what can be considered very late Middle English or very early Modern English. It is pretty much the fountainhead of later English-language Arthurian literature, whether poetry, drama, or prose fiction. (With some few exceptions, which turned to Welsh, Old French, or Middle High German sources, or went back to Geoffrey of Monmouths Latin History of the Kings of Britain, plus attempts to reconstruct an historical fifth-century Arthur. And even the last of these show a lot of influence from Malory.)It is also fascinating reading, or at least for those with the patience to adapt to its very medieval view of what is interesting, such as, from time to time, (seemingly interminable) details of who fought whom, and for how long. (Although such passages can usually be safely skimmed, it may help to think of them as sports reporting.)Why two versions? Not just to have the text in both the original spelling for the serious student and an early twentieth-century adaptation for the ordinary reader (offered in that order), but because there are two authoritative sources for the text, with thousands of major and minor differences between them. One section, Arthur's war with the Romans -- which is mostly forgotten in popular versions of the story -- is about twice as long in the Winchester MS as it is in Caxton's text -- someone, possibly Malory himself, possibly a scribe,and possibly Caxton, did a very good job of editing it down to a more manageable size, incidentally erasing some of the evidence of its origin in a Middle English poem along the way.One source is the first printed edition, issued in 1485 by the pioneering English printer William Caxton, here represented by A.W. Pollards edition (Macmillan, 1903; including his bibliographic and biographical notes, and an accompanying glossary, but not his useful index of characters). This has been widely reprinted (it was once offered, as unexpurgated, by Book-of-the-Month Club, if memory serves), and is available free from Project Gutenberg (minus the character index), and in iBook, and Kindle editions (and perhaps other digital formats, like Nook and Kobo  I havent tried to analyze their Arthurian offerings). It is divided into twenty-one books, and further divided into a total of 507 (mostly) titled chapters. (To which Delphi has provided a hyperlinked table of contents within the file, in addition to the Kindle app side-bar menu -- at least on my Mac.)The Pollard text was fairly recently used commercially by the (American) Modern Library (hardcover and paperback, in an edition with an introduction by Elizabeth J. Bryan), and by the (British) Wordsworth Classics (a paperback edition, with an introduction by Helen Cooper).Pollards is not my favorite modernized treatment of the Caxton text (I prefer Janet Cowans 1969 edition for Penguin), but is a solid rendering, based on H. Oskar Sommers diplomatic (exact) edition of 1889-1891, the first to use the two surviving copies of Caxtons edition as the sole authority, instead of one or another of its later reprintings. (Sommer also provided an important  although now obsolete  discussion of Malorys sources.) His text is available on-line, and the full edition is available as pdf files from Archive.org, a site hosted by the Library of Congress (which also offers the volumes of Sommers important edition of the French Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian romances, one of Malorys sources).Delphi presents this text second, although it is easier reading, and much more welcoming to the novice than the text from the other source, which the Complete Works offers first.This other source is what is known as the Winchester Manuscript, which was discovered in 1934 in a safe at Winchester College, where it had been catalogued under the title of a (rather corrupt) seventeenth-century reprinting of Caxtons version. It has been in the British Library since 1976, as Add MS 59678 (and there is a digitized facsimile available on-line). It was first published in 1947, in three elaborately presented volumes edited by Eugene Vinaver, and there have been several scholarly or popular editions in the years since. So far as I can tell, however, there is no digital version of the transcribed text available on-line, and Delphi is typically cryptic (or silent) about where it was obtained. And, for that matter, it is necessarily equally uninformative about the rights to the transcription, which presumably is still under copyright protection.I initially guessed that the old-spelling text was in fact Sommers and that an editorial mistake had assigned it to the Winchester MS  but a cross check of several diagnostic passages (for names and spellings of words) showed that it was indeed the Winchester text, although not without some noticeable errors (such as Qur for our and -l! for a final -ll  given the size of the project, I have not scrutinized the text for actual original misspellings of the archaic English).It is very nice to have a searchable text of the Winchester MS. However, it may be more of a frustration than a help to the uninitiated reader  that is, one without a fair background in reading old-spelling Middle English (like Chaucer) or Elizabethan English (like Shakespeare) texts. To add to the obstacles of sometimes unfamiliar grammatical constructions (and Malory is very occasionally un-construable in any form of English, as he tries to imitate Medieval French rhetoric), a fair amount of the vocabulary is either entirely obsolete, or has shifted in meaning since the 1460s. Pollards glossary is useful, but it is not comprehensive  for the Winchester MS, and in any case represents a normalized and modernized spelling.To add to the confusion, there is no guide to match up the Winchester MS divisions to the more elaborate Book and Chapter divisions introduced by Caxton. The introductory material does explain that Vinaver analyzed the Winchester text into eight Books or Tales, which are mostly logical divisions of the narratives. (There is some controversy over Vinavers handling of the manuscript evidence for these divisions, and their possible relationship to what may have been in another manuscript copy used by Caxton.) Arguing that it was Caxton who introduced the idea of a Whole Book, Vinaver titled his edition The Works, from which Delphi seems to have taken the hint to call its edition The Complete Works (again, this is the Delphi ""house style"" for titles anyway). A later one-volume Oxford Standard Authors edition of Vinaver's text (still available in paperback) was titled simply Malory: Works. The latter still contains marginal indications of the Book and Chapter divisions in the Caxton text, a practice also followed in, for example, the Norton Critical Edition as Le Morte Darthur, edited by Stephen H.A. Shepherd (2004; I have reviewed this version, as well as the two volumes of the Penguin edition, and include some additional bibliography in those reviews).However, a lot of subsequent scholarship has argued that Malory, who was reducing originally disparate texts, did in fact intend them to fit together as a unified work. In this view, the occasional reappearance of a knight who was killed in an earlier book, and the like, is simply a discrepancy Malory failed to clean up in what was probably a years-long project, carried out under difficult circumstances. (He was a prisoner during at least part of the time he was working on the materials.) To those who agree that Malory intended a unified Whole Book  and I lean in that direction  the Complete Works title is at least slightly misleading, not to mention an obstacle for those searching Amazon (and elsewhere) under the familiar title, instead of Malorys name.To sum up: this is an inexpensive way to get a good, if somewhat dated, modernization of Malory's text, as it was known until the mid-twentieth century, and with it the old-spelling text (presented with some errors) of the more recently discovered manuscript of a longer version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Y11WGOX1JA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVCP7C6#wasThisHelpful","R3Y11WGOX1JA9","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tros of Samothrace is a massive historical novel, which, together with two sequels, Queen Cleopatra and The Purple Pirate, was awkwardly handled by hardcover publishers, and treated even worse in certain paperback editions (see the Wikipedia article on Tros for some of the problems).This new Kindle edition of the *complete* series, as The Tros Stories (or The Tros Trilogy, if you prefer the cover title to that on the product page) is more than welcome. The text appears to be in good condition (I no longer have a print copy with which to compare it), and a Kindle-navigable table of contents makes it easy to find one's way through the three novels in the series (unlike an earlier digital incarnation).Besides making some splendid fiction available again (and at a very low price), it neatly clears away a lot of the confusion generated by some print publishers decisions on how to handle the material, making finding the set a breeze for anyone using a Kindle, or Kindle App (for PCs, Macs, etc.), instead of an ordeal of sorting through dealers listings.The Tros Trilogy in effect replaces an earlier Complete Tros of Samothrace Kindle book from another publisher, which appeared and disappeared (along with other titles from the same publisher) back in 2013; I gave it a glowing review at the time, although by the time it disappeared from Amazon I had become frustrated with its lack of aides to navigation.. After some consideration, and a shorter review I posted immediately after noticing this edition's, I am making available an edited version of the extended review (with some bibliographic details) I created for that earlier Kindle edition, itself based on my reviews of (now) out-of-print paperbacks.Those interested in reviews by others (and my own earlier ones) can now find them gathered by Amazon for a CreateSpace edition of Tros of Samothrace (only).The mystifications of some of the mass-market paperback incarnations were unintentional, but perhaps ironically appropriate, given the authors dubious career in British India and Africa, and also his later occult interests. Mr. Talbot Mundy has been the subject of two biographies in recent decades, with more still being uncovered about his real past. A good overview is provided on-line in Talbot Mundy: Master of Mystical Adventure, by R. T. Gault. (Duane Spurlock has re-posted Gaults bibliographic information, and in several cases I have deferred to their dates, rather than sticking with what I had found in older reference works. Materials Toward a Bibliography of the Works of Talbot Mundy by Bradford M. Day is available from Project Gutenberg; very good, but not easy to use in its plain-text form.)Tros and some of Mundys other stories also have striking resemblances to later fantasy and science fiction adventure stories, not surprising given that Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber were among Mundys early readers. More recent fans included Marion Zimmer Bradley, who openly acknowledged his direct influence on one of her Darkover novels (although not the Tros stories in particular).The rather mysterious Talbot Mundy (William Lancaster Gribbon 1879-1940), whose yarns about his own (often shady) past may have been the prototype for much of his adventure fiction, seems to have written Tros of Samothrace almost as a detour. He had been asked by the publisher Bobbs-Merrill to write a novel about Cleopatra. It seemed to them like a sure-fire bestseller, something to out-do the sales of his popular King  of the Khyber Rifles, which they had published in 1916.It would, after all, be on a more sensational topic than his Kipling-esque tales of British soldiers keeping stiff upper lips in India and Afghanistan. (Mundy, who had legally changed his name to his most popular pseudonym while becoming a U.S. citizen in 1916, seems to have either exaggerated the time he spent in India, or else returned there under other names when he was hiding from the law, unhappy wives, etc. But he wrote about it more frequently than Africa, where he had spent considerable time; of course, he had also *served* time there. In any case, he often offers a skeptical view of the British Empire.)Mundy eventually got around to a Cleopatra novel for Bobbs-Merrill, but not before spinning out the adventures, mostly during Julius Caesars invasion of Britain, of a supposed minor character in the planned novel. The resulting story of Tros of Samothrace ran for a year (Feb. 1925-Feb. 1926) in the then highly-regarded fiction magazine Adventure.Tros was broken into seven separately titled stories, published in nine installments, which gave the magazine a chance to back out, and probably avoided protests from readers about a serial that never seemed to end, but Mundy seems to have had the greater commercial potential of a novel in mind. They consisted of: #1 Tros of Samothrace (Feb. 10, 1925); #2 The Enemy of Rome (April 10); #3 Prisoners of War (June 10); #4 Hostages to Luck: (Aug. 20); #5 Admiral of Caesars Fleet (Oct. 10); #6 The Dancing Girl of Gades (Dec. 10); and, as #7, #8, and #9 the three-part Messenger of Destiny (Feb. 10, 20, and 28, 1926)To my mind, Tros is one of the great early twentieth century adventure novels; and the hints of occult powers and secret wisdom add flavor without getting in the way. Mundy had just then become active in a splinter branch of the Theosophical Society; the same influences are evident in his Om: The Secret of Ahbor Valley, written the previous year, and much of his later fiction hovers on the edge of fantasy  at least in the eyes of non-believers.The editor of Adventure (Arthur Sullivan Hoffmann) seems to have realized that almost anyone who had struggled in school with Caesars Commentaries (The Gallic Wars) was sure to smile at the idea of the story as seen from the other side  or, rather, from a third side. (One Caesar somehow forgot to mention in his propaganda dispatches home!) And in those days, having struggled with Caesar was a pretty common experience for middle-class readers, so the subject, if not quite as glamorous as the Serpent of the Nile, was hardly obscure.Bobbs-Merrill didnt agree, or was put off by the ensuing controversy over Mundys portrait of Caesar as a budding dictator cultivating his image at the expense of the barbarians.According to Mundy, Initiates from the Mysteries of Samothrace ran afoul of Caesar while on a mission to their fellow-mystics in Gaul from their Aegean island sanctuary, and were blackmailed into spying on the mysterious Land of Britain. (A good classical dictionary would confirm the existence of the island of Samothrace and its Mysteries; although hardly Mundys Theosophical exposition of its beliefs, and wide-ranging connections to other mystical orders.)But was even the wily and ruthless Caesar a match for a man like Tros, who scrupulously honored his word? Honored it precisely and literally, that is, without regard for what Caesar, or anyone else, might have intended when he exacted the promise by threatening to kill his prisoners, including Tros father, Perseus.The story of Tros and his personal war with Julius Caesar was later extended in another two substantial, but shorter, novels. Queen Cleopatra had no magazine publication, but appeared (at last!) directly from Bobbs-Merrill in 1929 (426 pages). Instead of the Antony and Cleopatra story, it deals in part with her escape from Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar, an obscure episode in which it turns out Tros (of course) had a role. Mundy and Bobbs-Merrill later permanently parted ways (after fifteen years), with the Tros stories and the delayed Cleopatra novel apparently among the simmering issues.His new publisher, Century, soon merged with D. Appleton, further complicating the bibliographic record. Tros of Samothrace finally appeared in a revised form from by D. Appleton-Century, with a British edition from Hutchinson, in 1934. The Purple Pirate, a sequel to Tros and Queen Cleopatra then appeared as four stories in Adventure and immediately thereafter as a book from Appleton-Century (367 pages), also with a British edition, all in 1935.The complete Tros alone ran to a whopping 949 pages (960 in the British printing), even without the sequels. It was a work of historical fiction more on the scale of War and Peace than anything Bobbs-Merrill had planned, or, with Gone With the Wind still in the future (1936), perhaps considered practical. Tros, didnt become a blockbuster bestseller, but it seems to have sold well enough for Appleton-Century to take on one of the sequels.And the book was fondly remembered by those who read it. Who could forget a character who combined mysticism and heroics, nobility and practicality, exactly as appropriate? So he wouldnt kill prisoners, but didnt feel it was his responsibility to find out if he could swim before cutting their bonds and tossing them overboard And a more than slightly unlikely, but attractive, supporting cast of friendly Theosophical Druids, Victorian-style Ancient Britons (By Lud of Lunden!), and proto-Vikings? Or even the rather Hinduized Pythagoreanism that seems to underlie all the talk of Secret Wisdom? By this time, too, Mundys mostly hostile portrait of Caesar could be seen as a foreshadowing of Fascism.Tros was revived in complete hardcover editions by the science fiction and fantasy publisher Gnome Press in 1958 (along with The Purple Pirate), and, most recently by Buccaneer Books in 1995. The trade paperback edition of Tros from Black Mask was issued in 2005, and was more than welcome. (There was another hardcover  I think  reprinting of The Purple Pirate. from Amereon, in 1991.)There was also a mass-market paperback version of the whole saga, in six volumes, published in the later 1960s (see below for details), and for me they came at just the right time  I was reading Caesar in Latin, and was amused when Tros gave him a concise, accurate, and completely misleading, report on his adventures in Britain, in exactly Caesars own compressed style. And was praised for it.Oh yes  dont be confused about Mundys novel Caesar Dies. It is an unrelated story about the Emperor Commodus, not the Dictator Julius, and Tros isnt involved. (Unless I failed to notice his reincarnation, of course.)This new Kindle edition bundles together all of this material (except, of course, Caesar Dies). If you have a Kindle, or a Kindle app on your PC or Mac (etc., etc.), and think this sounds interesting, I urge you to treat yourself.Those are the main points.For those who might go looking for print copies, however, Ive included some bibliographic information. There are some unpleasant surprises awaiting the unwary. Unfortunately, print copies, especially of Tros, have to be sorted out from among the fractionalized paperback reprints. For the mass-market paperback editions present a much more complicated picture. (One which also impinges on one of the Kindle editions.) There are a couple of points which may be relevant in this context, however.Perhaps vindicating Bobbs-Merrills original proposal, Queen Cleopatra appeared from Ace in 1962, with a cover Gault describes as obviously redrawn from a publicity still of Elizabeth Taylor. Beyond the desire to cash in on the publicity, there is no special connection between the book and the motion picture (ultimately released in 1963), let alone the associated scandals; just the use of some of the same historical personages. (Lud, and perhaps fear of lawsuits, be thanked, Burton wasnt added to the cover.)In 1967, Avon Books put Tros of Samothrace into paperback in four volumes, as Tros: The First Book of Tros of Samothrace (= #1-2); Helma: The Second Book (= #3-4); Liafail: The Third Book (#5-6); and Helene: The Fourth Book (#7-9). All of them had lovely covers by Douglas Rosa. (Helma and Helene are two of the women in Tros life. Liafail, the Irish Stone of Destiny, is here the name of a ship. Not the most appropriate name, one would think, besides being from the wrong branch of the Celtic languages, but philology wasnt Mundys strong point.)The four volumes were followed by Avon in 1969 with Queen Cleopatra and in 1970 with The Purple Pirate, identified as Tros of Samothrace #5 and #6, respectively, on the uncredited covers (which look to me and others like the work of Jeff Jones, but seem to be attributed by some to Frank Frazetta.)Avon also issued some of Mundys occult / espionage / adventure stories set in modern India and Tibet, including Om, at about the same time  another tangle of titles we wont get into.There was also a more recent complete print edition of the Tros series, published in 2009 in the UK and United States US: Leonaur Books, paperback & hardback as 6 books, corresponding to the Avon divisions (but not titles), which were Mundys own: Wolves of the Tiber; Dragons of the North; Serpent of the Waves; City of the Eagles; Queen Cleopatra; and Purple Pirate. (I dont know where the NEW titles of the first four volumes came from, but they are excellent.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FOD52UE24RHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y17PE22#wasThisHelpful","R2FOD52UE24RHA","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note, February, 2015: This review was originally posted in 2003 with Martin L. West's translation in the Oxford World's Classics series, but, as noted in the first paragraph, its reviews were mixed with reviews of another translation. At some point in the intervening years, Amazon ""corrected"" the problem by assigning the whole set of reviews to the other Penguin Classics translation, and that translation only. Now that I have (at last) noticed this, I have decided to repost on the page originally intended. I have made a few revisions in order to make the review more up-to-date, but have not otherwise tampered with it.]Some of the other reviews offered with M.L. West's translation of Hesiod's ""Theogony"" and ""Works and Days"" for the Oxford World's Classics actually refer [or referred] to Dorothea Wender's verse translation of the same works, plus a charming version of the collection of lyrics attributed to Theognis, published in the Penguin Classics. That is a worthwhile version -- although the joining of the peasant-oriented Boeotian Hesiod to the mainly aristocratic, and partly Athenian, ""Theognis"" corpus of songs and aphorisms is a little odd.West's version of the two main Hesiodic poems is, however, in prose, and offers the latest in textual and historical scholarship -- although this is not very obviously on display. West, who has edited much (perhaps by now all) of the ""Hesiodic"" corpus, with substantial technical commentaries (along with a good deal of Homer and the ""Homeric Hymns""), offers here his best reading of the two long poems which seem most firmly attributed Hesiod. (Although some, including Wender, would prefer two poets, in addition to the problem of interpolations).West's commentary, although useful, is surprisingly sparse, given what he could have offered; a lot of detailed argument has been converted into the translation itself.""Theogony,"" for those not familiar with the work even by reputation, is the story of the origins and struggles of the gods of Classical Greece. Although the meter and basic style are those of the Homeric epics, and the gods are mainly the same, many details are different (Zeus is a younger son, not the eldest, for example), and the struggles between various generations are the foreground story, not a long-concluded background to the reign of Zeus. We meet Heaven, and his sons and daughters, culminating in the rebellion of the Titans, then the Olympians, who wage war against their father and his fellow-Titans, and so on. It is an extremely violent story, full of abusive parents, mutilations inflicted by rebellious offspring, divine cannibalism, and a whole succession of other behaviors the Greeks themselves considered repellent. The philosophers had real problems with this work -- one can understand from it why Plato wanted to ban poets from the ideal state.Interspersed through the action are a number of catalogues of nature-deities, which are variously regarded by critics as interpolations or key structural elements. Many readers simply find them boring; it helps if you are using a translation which interprets the Greek names, which are usually charmingly appropriate for the natural element being personified.""Works and Days"" contains several important mythological passages, expanding and altering ""Theogony,"" but is in the main a sort of sermon on how to be prosperous and righteous. It is packed with details of daily life, which readers will find either fascinating or tedious. and are sometimes rather opaque. West does a good job in making readable this combination of a sort of pagan equivalent of an Old Testament prophet with an Iron Age Farmer's Almanac, and his notes do help with some of the knottier passages. (Note that there is one recent translation-with-commentary of the ""Works"" by Tandy and Neale, which is dedicated almost entirely to making detailed agricultural and ethnographic sense of it; West clearly offers a more literary approach.)The latter part of the twentieth century has seen a number of translations of the main Hesiodic poems, by Apostolos N. Athanassakis, R.M. Frazer, Richmond Lattimore, and, as noted above, Dorothea Wender (Penguin Classics), to join the old Evelyn-White bilingual edition for the Loeb Classical Library edition, with numerous attributed fragments. (New Loeb editions of the Hesiodic material have appeared.) There are also translations of single poems, by Norman O. Brown and by Richard S. Caldwell (both of the ""Theogony"") and Tandy and Neale (""Works and Days""). West offers a substantial alternative to the others, based on an exceptionally close knowledge of the textual problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UG7Y6WFM59YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019953831X#wasThisHelpful","R2UG7Y6WFM59YE","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note, January 2015: Amazon (or, rather, its software) has lumped together reviews of some of the assorted Kindle editions of Freeman's ""Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers,"" together with the print edition, but has not extended this to all of the Kindle versions. As a guide to potential readers, I re-post here my 2004 review (unaltered) of a paperback edition -- which apparently is still in print, by the way. My star rating is of the base text, as I have not examined this particular Kindle edition to determine the reliability of the transfer to digital form. I hope that the information it provides will continue to be found useful.][Note also that one of the Kindle editions -- which is retitled ""PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS - Classic Greek Mythology (Annotated. The Pursuit of Inner Wisdom from Plato to Aristotle)"" -- apparently contains supplementary material NOT by, or authorized by, Kathleen Freeman, the original translator. (Not to mention that the series title and sub-title are largely or completely irrelevant to the book's actual topic) The available Look Inside preview of this edition suggests that a disturbing number of the Greek names contain misprints (e.g., Pherecvdes for Pherecydes), indicating carelessness in converting from a print format.]Back in 1948, Kathleen Freeman's ""Ancilla to Pre-Socratic Philosophers"" was a genuine gift to English-speakers interested in the early Greek thinkers, but not at home in Greek, Latin, and German. In this ""handmaiden"" she translated the ""fragments"" -- actually quotations in texts by other, later, writers, although a few physical fragments have turned up on papyri -- as they were presented in the then most-recent edition of a classic of scholarship, the fifth edition of H. Diels' ""Fragmente der Vorsokratiker."" (Which, for those who haven't guessed, was one of the monuments of late-nineteenth-century German classical studies.)The translation was severely plain, and seems to have pretty much avoided any but the most basic interpretation -- that of vocabulary and grammar (which can get pretty controversial for this material!). She was not the first to translate most of these passages in one place (Burnet's 1892 ""Early Greek Philosophy,"" and its revisions, included a great many), but her work was both exceptionally comprehensive, and when published, up-to-date; the title of ""Ancilla"" (servant) indicated, to those familiar with the word, that it was intended to assist.The book was originally published as part of a set, along with ""The Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A Companion to Diels, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker,"" which is now out of print. It was obviously intended as a supplemental reader, to be used with one of the many books on the history of Greek philosophy (not necessarily Freeman's ""Companion."") There is not even a clear statement of the rationale for segregating this extremely diverse group as all characterized by being predecessors to Socrates. (Although, in fact, some seem to have been his younger contemporaries....) Nietzsche, who, early in his short career as a classical philologist, did an important study of one of the major late-classical sources, suggested calling them ""Pre-Platonic."" This is actually more helpful; what they most clearly have in common is that Plato's works are the first such to survive ""in bulk,"" and their writings reach us only in snippets. Traditional usage prevailed, with Diels, with Freeman, and everyone else.The ""Ancilla"" was restricted to Diels' ""B"" texts, those he regarded as certainly or likely to be the actual words of the men to whom they were attributed. The much more voluminous ""A"" texts, the biographical, descriptive, and anecdotal ""Testimonies,"" were excluded (Freeman dealt with them in ""Companion""). Freeman's was a modest-looking but difficult project, carried out to the satisfaction of many classicists -- although every specialist, of course, found something to object to in the treatment of his or her favored Pre-Socratic.Since the book was largely aimed at people finding their way through the literature, Freeman thoughtfully provided a table to find fifth-edition Diels texts as numbered in the fourth edition, which was cited in much of the older secondary literature in English.Naturally, the sixth (by some complex reckonings, also reprinted as the tenth) edition of Diels, as revised by W. Kranz (hence DK), appeared shortly thereafter, in 1952. Scholarship since has relied on this version, known as Diels-Kranz, citing texts by their 1952 DK numbers. Unhappily, neither Harvard University Press nor, apparently, the British publisher, Blackwell, saw fit to issue a new edition of the ""Ancilla,"" reflecting any changes, or even adding a note making clear whether, and where, the standard numbering had changed in the Diels / DK transition, let alone any differences in the German translation.In fact, it was not until 1983 that the ""Ancilla"" even appeared in paperback (from Harvard); in the meantime, competing volumes, such as Philip Wheelwright's ""The Presocratics"" (1966; still in print) had become available, with fewer fragments, but many ""Testimonies,"" and some sort of running commentary.This delay is somewhat puzzling. The post-war years saw a considerable increase in publications concerning the Pre-Socratics, and a less expensive version would presumably have been a textbook of choice in a variety of courses, not just Greek philosophy. Most notably, the German philosophers Heidegger and Jaspers freely interpreted them, if rarely to the satisfaction of a classicist. (More recently, David L. Hall and Roger T. Ames made considerable use of the Pre-Socratics in a trilogy of studies comparing ancient Chinese and early western thought, ""Thinking Through Confucius,"" ""Anticipating China,"" and ""Thinking From the Han."" I have found these comparisons illuminating.)But at least it is available. And the ""Ancilla"" still has considerable value, besides its still nearly-complete coverage. Since it had no burden of citations of secondary literature, and no explicit interpretation, there was little to become hopelessly out of date as the pace of publication picked up, and continued to accelerate. In 2002, Gregory Hays cited it, in a new translation of Marcus Aurelius [Modern Library], as ""a good starting point"" for ""Heraclitus and other early philosophers who appear in the *Meditations*.""So the ""Ancilla"" remains a fine piece of work, endlessly useful to the student. It is just the book to have at hand while reading someone's Greek-laden exposition of, say, Parmenides or Empedocles, or to check a translation that seems too good, or too convenient for an argument, to be taken at face value.In any other situation, however, it is also likely to be endlessly frustrating. Not so much because it doesn't answer questions, but because it gives no guidance in finding answers (you just have to look elsewhere), and doesn't even suggest what questions would be appropriate.Fortunately, when you reach this stage, there are some excellent, and very recent, volumes of translations, currently in print, which cover much of the same ground, but with much more information. Two of them, which should be readily available, also rely mainly on the ""B"" texts. Jonathan Barnes' volume for the Penguin Classics, ""Early Greek Philosophy"" (1987) is in its second edition (2002), which now includes the most spectacular addition to our knowledge of the Pre-Socratics, the ""Strasbourg Papyrus"" of Empedocles. Barnes provides an interpretive introduction, and useful bibliographies, but only brief head notes to the translations.The Penguin Classics volume is in competition with Robin Waterfield's more extensive translation of ""The First Philosophers: The Presocratics and The Sophists"" in the Oxford World's Classics series (2000), which includes many ""A"" texts, and the ""Strasbourg Papyrus,"" has both explanatory and textual notes, and generally is well-provided with aides to the reader (although it lacks Barnes' helpful Subject Index). It is unusual in including the surviving passages of the interesting figures known as Sophists, whom Plato had rejected as not being ""real"" Philosophers. (The Penguin Classics issued its own ""The Greek Sophists,"" translated by John Dillon and Tania Gergel, in 2003).Still, Freeman's book is far handier as a quick reference; the virtue of its limitations.For those interested in the actual Greek (and some Latin) texts, including a lot of the ""A"" Testimonies, and some (usually) not-too-technical discussions of textual problems and philosophical issues, the first place to go used to be G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven, ""The Presocratic Philosophers: A Critical History with a Selection of Texts"" (Cambridge University Press, 1957; in paperback in 1971). Like the ""Ancilla,"" it aged fairly quickly in a period of intense interest in the Pre-Socratics; the more so because it covered historical and philosophical problems. Unlike the ""Ancilla,"" however, this edition of the book was replaced by the extensively revised Second Edition, by Kirk, Raven, and M. Schofield, in 1983 (quickly issued in paperback, and reissued with a bibliographic update in 1995); for which the publisher as well as the editors/translators deserve gratitude. It remains the first place to go. (In the Second Edition, the translations, previously relegated to italics at the foot of the page, were moved into the main text in roman type; a great convenience to new Greekless readers, a distraction at first to those, like me, who had become accustomed to jumping back and forth on the page.) It included a section from the ""Derveni Papyrus,"" the first closely datable ""Orphic"" text with philosophical content. (A carbonized-during-cremation papyrus was discovered in 1962 in an undisturbed tomb; the long-promised ""full edition"" of this discovery is, at this writing, still to be published sometime ""soon."" Gabor Betegh's 2004 volume ""The Derveni Papyrus: Cosmology, Theology and Interpretation"" contains another preliminary text and translation, with references to the already extensive literature.)However, despite my admiration for Kirk-Raven-Schofield, there are places where it becomes very technical indeed; enough to make this reader turn back to the simplicity of Freeman with relief, for at least a while.[Addendum, September 2015: Having recently had a chance to consult it at some length, I would now add to the list of additional, or alternative, readings, the 500-some pages of The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy, edited by A.A. Long (Cambridge University Press, 1999). This is currently available in paperback and Kindle editions (and see also Cambridge Companions Online). It contains some not-too-technical surveys of the evidence, and its problems, as well as studies of individual philosophers, and groups of philosophers, including a discussion of related topics, such as rationalism in early Greek historical and medical literature.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3LRKDZJ64ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NA7L5W2#wasThisHelpful","RY3LRKDZJ64ET","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I reviewed two translations of Wolfram von Eschenbach's ""Parzival"" in January 2005, there were three complete English translations available of the Middle High German poem, an early, and slightly eccentric, version of the Grail Quest, composed between about 1200 and 1210 by a knight and (slightly eccentric) poet from southern Germany.All three translations (to which I gave five stars) were in prose, unlike Jessie L. Weston's two-volume pioneering, and then-out-of-print (I think), ""Parzival: A Knightly Epic,"" originally published in 1894, and the primary subject of the present review. Jessie L. Weston was an industrious translator of medieval Arthurian (and some other medieval) literature, and a lot of her out-of-copyright books have been picked up and re-issued. She was also a Wagner enthusiast (her ""Parzival"" is dedicated to him). The most famous of her books is ""From Ritual to Romance,"" a highly-speculative, but fascinating, study of the Holy Grail traditions, which she tried to connect to a variety of religious traditions; this is available in a number of formats (although it has been a good many years since Arthurian scholars took her thesis seriously). Her views on the Grail story in any case are based on the French versions of the story, and do not directly involve Wolfram's decidedly atypical treatment of the subject.I will deal with the more modern competition first. It should be made clear that I think these later translations are more readable, although the three (at the moment) Kindle editions of Weston's translation are less expensive than either of the Kindle (or paperback) editions of two of the three two prose translations. I will include as well some general observations on Wolfram and his major works, before returning to Weston's version.The first of the prose translations was Helen M. Mustard and Charles E. Passage's Vintage paperback (Random House, 1961), Parzival: A Romance of the Middle Ages,"" which is (apparently) now out of print. It was followed a couple of decades later by A. T. Hatto's ""Parzival"" (A Penguin Classic, 1980). The third was ""Parzival: With Titurel and the Love Lyrics,"" translated by Cyril Edwards (""Arthurian Studies"" series, D.S. Brewer, 2004). In 2006, Edwards' volume was reduced in scope to ""Parzival and Titurel"" as an Oxford World's Classics paperback, which also omitted the original introduction, and some technical apparatus. Some of us miss having them. (Well, I certainly do!) It now has a competent and readable new introduction by Richard Barber, focusing on the Arthurian context, which is relatively well-known, and less about thirteenth-century German literature. The narratives, however, are complete.Thanks to Edward's decision to reproduce Wolfram's stylistic oddities as much as possible, his translation is less welcoming than the two earlier prose translations, but also more intriguing for those who are willing to take it slowly.Thanks to the difference in title, its reviews have not been lumped together with other translations, as befell the Mustard-Passage and Hatto translations -- which is why I initially reviewed those two together, and constantly compared them.Both Edwards' ""Parzival and Titurel"" and Hatto's ""Parzival"" are now available in Kindle formats. When I eventually reviewed Edwards' translation, I did so from the Kindle edition, without immediate reference to the full-length library copy in which I first encountered it several years before.Those interested in trying Jessie Weston's nineteenth-century rendering can sample her verse style by using the ""Look Inside"" or ""Sample"" functions of the Kindle editions. Some readers may enjoy it (I don't). It should be pointed out that the nineteenth-century edition of this Middle High German text from which she worked is quite obsolete, as is the translation into modern German (by Simrock) to which she also referred.Beside ""Parzival,"" a long Arthurian (and Grail) romance, and the fragments of ""Titurel,"" which picks up stories and characters from ""Parzival,"" Wolfram composed a long Carolingian epic, ""Willehalm,"" based on a French chanson de geste, and some charming lyrics.Wolfram's complaints about rival poets, and their complaints about him, have turned out to be clues to relative dating of their works. From this, and some external evidence, Wolfram's poetic career has been dated between about 1195 and 1225; with the almost 25,000 lines of ""Parzival"" being composed between about 1200 and 1210.Wolfram seems to have had the last laugh on his critics; ""Parzival"" apparently was far-and-away the most popular German work of the thirteenth through the fifteenth centuries, with something like ninety known manuscripts, and a 1477 print edition. Perhaps inevitably, the fragments of ""Titurel"" were ""completed"" in another long romance, long thought to be Wolfram's own work, but now called the ""Juengere"" (Follower's) ""Titurel.""In ""Parzival,"" Wolfram himself was translating, in his own wayward fashion, Chretien de Troyes' unfinished ""Perceval, or, The Story of the Grail"" -- although he himself claims to have an additional source, the mysterious ""Kyot,"" who had a better, truer, version. Since Chretien himself claimed to have been working from a source provided by a patron, this has at times sent scholars searching in many directions. In his introduction to the Oxford World Classics volume, Richard Barber argues that the ""better source"" was entirely a creation of Wolfram's fertile imagination, and scraps of irrelevant but interesting ideas. He is probably right about the back-story Wolfram creates for it.A Preface introduces the reader (or listener) to Wolfram's moral concerns, and also to his sometimes-maddening use of riddles and metaphors. We then have an entire opening section with the hero's father, Gahmuret the Anschevin [i.e., Angevin], having adventures in a vaguely-conceived Near East and North Africa, where he leaves a ""pagan"" wife and son: the latter, the multi-colored Feirefiz, crosses paths with his younger brother, the main hero, years later. (It is worth noting that, although Wolfram is a snob, and is fascinated by physical differences between human beings, he is in no sense a racist; color is no bar to aristocracy.)(To me, it looks very much as if Wolfram had some sort of additional material -- there are odd resemblances to ""Morien,"" an apparent interpolation in the medieval Dutch translation of the Lancelot-Grail romances, featuring Perceval's ""Moorish"" nephew -- but to have used his imagination quite freely in accounting for it. A prose translation of ""The Romance of Morien"" by Jessie Weston is available in various Kindle editions, one rather randomly illustrated from medieval manuscripts, and as an on-line PDF -- see Weston's Wikipedia biography for a link.)Gahmuret's story is somewhat filled out in the first fragment of ""Titurel,"" but why Wolfram made him an Angevin is unclear; it perhaps has something to do with the accession of a Count of Anjou's son to the throne of England (Henry II), but so far more detailed explanations -- including those by Jessie Weston -- have trailed off into unprovable speculation. (In England, the family became better known as the Plantagenets.)This material is followed by Gahmuret's second marriage, and death, and, joining up with Chretien's narrative, the birth and upbringing in forest isolation of Parzival himself (the idea being to keep him from dying in battle like his father). There follows the ignorant boy's fateful encounter with some of Arthur's knights, his attempts at chivalry, and the splitting of the story to include the exploits of Sir Gawain (recognizable under German renderings, variously handled by translators over the years), and Parzival's first adventure at the Grail Castle. Although this is derived from Chretien's account of Perceval and ""Messire Gauvain, "" it is retold in Wolfram's quirky style, instead of an imitation of Chretien's famously lucid Old French verses. (Eric Rohmer's film version of ""Perceval"" is a splendid visualization of Chretien's version, and works almost equally well for the relevant parts of Wolfram's retelling, too.)In both Chretien's and Wolfram's versions, there is a lot of comedy derived from the boy's literal-mindedness and ignorance of the world, and the resulting blunders, contrasted with his great strength and physical beauty. (He bears some resemblance to the original, animated, version of ""George of the Jungle,"" except for the smashing headlong into trees.)Then Wolfram returns to what seems to be new material, writing his own conclusion, including the maturation of Parzival. This also seems to have been in Chretien's mind, but he left this romance, as well as his ""Lancelot,"" unfinished.As in other versions, including the Old French ""Continuations"" of ""Perceval,"" and the prose ""Perlesvaus"" (or ""High History of the Holy Grail""), Wolfram draws Chretien's very mysterious ""graal"" into a Christian conception of the universe. But Wolfram explains it as a sort of magic stone that fell to earth during the War in Heaven, not a relic of the Last Supper. That more explicitly Christianized version seems to belong to the Old French cycle of ""Joseph of Arimathea,"" ""Merlin"" and ""Perceval,"" attributed to Robert de Boron, and was later picked up and amplified in the ""Vulgate Cycle"" of Arthurian romances (centering on Lancelot, and introducing Galahad as the Quest hero, alongside Perceval), the version known in English through Malory, and, so far as the Chalice interpretation, also used by Wagner.Wagner plundered Wolfram for names and a certain ""German"" quality for his Grail opera, ""Parsifal,"" besides using another version of a story Wolfram alludes to in ""Lohengrin,' and the poet's name for a character in ""Tannhauser."" Personally, I suggest tossing aside all Wagnerian preconceptions, if any, and allowing Wolfram's real personality to have a chance. Sarcastic (especially about competitors), sentimental (especially about wives and children), full of pride in the knightly caste (a new phenomenon, which its members wanted to be very old), arrogantly announcing that he is completely illiterate in the company of poets who boasted they could read anything ever written, he is both annoying and lovable. A living personality, in fact, appearing in a time used to anonymous authors.For those who find ""Parzival"" a pleasure, or who would like to try a more military, rather than chivalric, work, there are also translations of his ""Willehalm,"" based on the Old French *chanson de geste* of William Curt-Nose, or Guillaume l'Orange, one of the heroes of the legends of Charlemagne and his descendants. I am familiar with two, both into prose. One, by Marion E. Gibbs and Sidney M. Johnson, was published by Penguin Classics in 1984, and is currently in print, as ""Wolfram von Eschenbach: Willehalm."" Charles E. Passage, one of the co-translators of ""Parzival,"" had earlier translated it as ""The Middle High German Poem of Willehalm by Wolfram von Eschenbach,"" published by Frederick Ungar in 1977. Although it is out of print, used copies of the trade paperback edition seem to be available. (Passage also translated ""Titurel"" for Ungar (1985), which, unfortunately, I haven't seen.)Curiously, the supposedly illiterate Wolfram seems unusually aware of the idea (if not the facts) of history. The ""Pagan"" Saracens of his French source are connected by him with the Romans (as descended from the followers of Pompey, rather than of Caesar, and heirs of an old feud), and also with the extra-European characters he had already invented for ""Parzival."" He rather neatly brings into the correct sequence his versions of Arthurian and Carolingian Europe.The main problem I see with Weston's translation of Wolfram is its use of rhymed couplets, which many readers may find wearying long before the end of the second volume. (There is also the distortion of meaning to fit meter and rhyme to worry those especially concerned to get at Wolfram's precise meaning.) Her appendices look helpful, but are as obsolete as the nineteenth-century scholarship from which they are derived.Nabu Press has issued in paperback Weston's ""Parzival,"" as well as out-of-copyright German text editions and modern German translations. Many of these, and others, can be also be found at archive.org (the Library of Congress website), although the two volumes of Weston's translation must be searched for as ""Parzival,"" and not under the translator's name. (Archive.org also makes available the 1891 fifth edition of Karl Lachmann's enduring edition of Wolfram's works; Edwards, and, I think, the other modern translators, mainly used the 1926 sixth edition, or the seventh -- the current version, published by De Gruyer, may be the eighth.) There are also Project Gutenberg editions of a number of Weston's works, including ""Parzival,"" some of them available in Kindle format, among other versions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ER7PI9LCBCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q74V6QK#wasThisHelpful","R21ER7PI9LCBCU","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I reviewed two translations of Wolfram von Eschenbach's ""Parzival"" in January 2005, there were three complete English translations available of the Middle High German poem, an early, and slightly eccentric, version of the Grail Quest, composed between about 1200 and 1210 by a knight and (slightly eccentric) poet from southern Germany.All three translations (to which I gave five stars) were in prose, unlike Jessie L. Weston's two-volume pioneering, and then-out-0f-print (I think), ""Parzival: A Knightly Epic,"" originally published in 1894, and the primary subject of the present review. Jessie L. Weston was an industrious translator of medieval Arthurian (and some other medieval) literature, and a lot of her out-of-copyright books have been picked up and re-issued. She was also a Wagner enthusiast (her ""Parzival"" is dedicated to him). The most famous of her books is ""From Ritual to Romance,"" a highly-speculative, but fascinating, study of the Holy Grail traditions, which she tried to connect to a variety of religious traditions; this is available in a number of formats (although it has been a good many years since Arthurian scholars took her thesis seriously). Her views on the Grail story in any case are based on the French versions of the story, and do not directly involve Wolfram's decidedly atypical treatment of the subject.I will deal with the more modern competition first. It should be made clear that I think these later translations are more readable, although the three (at the moment) Kindle editions of Weston's translation are less expensive than either of the Kindle (or paperback) editions of two of the three two prose translations. I will include as well some general observations on Wolfram and his major works, before returning to Weston's version.The first of the prose translations was Helen M. Mustard and Charles E. Passage's Vintage paperback (Random House, 1961), Parzival: A Romance of the Middle Ages,"" which is (apparently) now out of print. It was followed a couple of decades later by A. T. Hatto's ""Parzival"" (A Penguin Classic, 1980). The third was ""Parzival: With Titurel and the Love Lyrics,"" translated by Cyril Edwards (""Arthurian Studies"" series, D.S. Brewer, 2004). In 2006, Edwards' volume was reduced in scope to ""Parzival and Titurel"" as an Oxford World's Classics paperback, which also omitted the original introduction, and some technical apparatus. Some of us miss having them. (Well, I certainly do!) It now has a competent and readable new introduction by Richard Barber, focusing on the Arthurian context, which is relatively well-known, and less about thirteenth-century German literature. The narratives, however, are complete.Thanks to Edward's decision to reproduce Wolfram's stylistic oddities as much as possible, his translation is less welcoming than the two earlier prose translations, but also more intriguing for those who are willing to take it slowly.Thanks to the difference in title, its reviews have not been lumped together with other translations, as befell the Mustard-Passage and Hatto translations -- which is why I initially reviewed those two together, and constantly compared them.Both Edwards' ""Parzival and Titurel"" and Hatto's ""Parzival"" are now available in Kindle formats. When I eventually reviewed Edwards' translation, I did so from the Kindle edition, without immediate reference to the full-length library copy in which I first encountered it several years before.Those interested in trying Jessie Weston's nineteenth-century rendering can sample her verse style by using the ""Look Inside"" or ""Sample"" functions of the Kindle editions.

Passage, one of the co-translators of ""Parzival,"" had earlier translated it as ""The Middle High German Poem of Willehalm by Wolfram von Eschenbach,"" published by Frederick Ungar in 1977. Although it is out of print, used copies of the trade paperback edition seem to be available. (Passage also translated ""Titurel"" for Ungar (1985), which, unfortunately, I haven't seen.)Curiously, the supposedly illiterate Wolfram seems unusually aware of the idea (if not the facts) of history. The ""Pagan"" Saracens of his French source are connected by him with the Romans (as descended from the followers of Pompey, rather than of Caesar, and heirs of an old feud), and also with the extra-European characters he had already invented for ""Parzival."" He rather neatly brings into the correct sequence his versions of Arthurian and Carolingian Europe.The main problem I see with Weston's translation of Wolfram is its use of rhymed couplets, which many readers may find wearying long before the end of the second volume. (There is also the distortion of meaning to fit meter and rhyme to worry those especially concerned to get at Wolfram's precise meaning.) Her appendices look helpful, but are as obsolete as the nineteenth-century scholarship from which they are derived.Nabu Press has issued in paperback Weston's ""Parzival,"" as well as out-of-copyright German text editions and modern German translations. Many of these, and others, can be also be found at archive.org (the Library of Congress website), although the two volumes of Weston's translation must be searched for as ""Parzival,"" and not under the translator's name. (Archive.org also makes available the 1891 fifth edition of Karl Lachmann's enduring edition of Wolfram's works; Edwards, and, I think, the other modern translators, mainly used the 1926 sixth edition, or the seventh -- the current version, published by De Gruyer, may be the eighth.) There are also Project Gutenberg editions of a number of Weston's works, including ""Parzival,"" some of them available in Kindle format, among other versions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QVPZZCGV6KYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PM7P7AO#wasThisHelpful","R1QVPZZCGV6KYL","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I reviewed two translations of Wolfram von Eschenbach's ""Parzival"" in January 2005, there were three complete English translations available of the Middle High German poem, an early, and slightly eccentric, version of the Grail Quest, composed between about 1200 and 1210 by a knight and (slightly eccentric) poet from southern Germany.All three translations (to which I gave five stars) were in prose, unlike Jessie L. Weston's two-volume pioneering, and then-out-of-print (I think), ""Parzival: A Knightly Epic,"" originally published in 1894, and the primary subject of the present review. Jessie L. Weston was an industrious translator of medieval Arthurian (and some other medieval) literature, and a lot of her out-of-copyright books have been picked up and re-issued. She was also a Wagner enthusiast (her ""Parzival"" is dedicated to him). The most famous of her books is ""From Ritual to Romance,"" a highly-speculative, but fascinating, study of the Holy Grail traditions, which she tried to connect to a variety of religious traditions; this is available in a number of formats (although it has been a good many years since Arthurian scholars took her thesis seriously). Her views on the Grail story in any case are based on the French versions of the story, and do not directly involve Wolfram's decidedly atypical treatment of the subject.I will deal with the more modern competition first. It should be made clear that I think these later translations are more readable, although the three (at the moment) Kindle editions of Weston's translation are less expensive than either of the Kindle (or paperback) editions of two of the three two prose translations. I will include as well some general observations on Wolfram and his major works, before returning to Weston's version.The first of the prose translations was Helen M. Mustard and Charles E. Passage's Vintage paperback (Random House, 1961), Parzival: A Romance of the Middle Ages,"" which is (apparently) now out of print. It was followed a couple of decades later by A. T. Hatto's ""Parzival"" (A Penguin Classic, 1980). The third was ""Parzival: With Titurel and the Love Lyrics,"" translated by Cyril Edwards (""Arthurian Studies"" series, D.S. Brewer, 2004). In 2006, Edwards' volume was reduced in scope to ""Parzival and Titurel"" as an Oxford World's Classics paperback, which also omitted the original introduction, and some technical apparatus. Some of us miss having them. (Well, I certainly do!) It now has a competent and readable new introduction by Richard Barber, focusing on the Arthurian context, which is relatively well-known, and less about thirteenth-century German literature. The narratives, however, are complete.Thanks to Edward's decision to reproduce Wolfram's stylistic oddities as much as possible, his translation is less welcoming than the two earlier prose translations, but also more intriguing for those who are willing to take it slowly.Thanks to the difference in title, its reviews have not been lumped together with other translations, as befell the Mustard-Passage and Hatto translations -- which is why I initially reviewed those two together, and constantly compared them.Both Edwards' ""Parzival and Titurel"" and Hatto's ""Parzival"" are now available in Kindle formats. When I eventually reviewed Edwards' translation, I did so from the Kindle edition, without immediate reference to the full-length library copy in which I first encountered it several years before.Those interested in trying Jessie Weston's nineteenth-century rendering can sample her verse style by using the ""Look Inside"" or ""Sample"" functions of the Kindle editions. Some readers may enjoy it (I don't). It should be pointed out that the nineteenth-century edition of this Middle High German text from which she worked is quite obsolete, as is the translation into modern German (by Simrock) to which she also referred.Beside ""Parzival,"" a long Arthurian (and Grail) romance, and the fragments of ""Titurel,"" which picks up stories and characters from ""Parzival,"" Wolfram composed a long Carolingian epic, ""Willehalm,"" based on a French chanson de geste, and some charming lyrics.Wolfram's complaints about rival poets, and their complaints about him, have turned out to be clues to relative dating of their works. From this, and some external evidence, Wolfram's poetic career has been dated between about 1195 and 1225; with the almost 25,000 lines of ""Parzival"" being composed between about 1200 and 1210.Wolfram seems to have had the last laugh on his critics; ""Parzival"" apparently was far-and-away the most popular German work of the thirteenth through the fifteenth centuries, with something like ninety known manuscripts, and a 1477 print edition. Perhaps inevitably, the fragments of ""Titurel"" were ""completed"" in another long romance, long thought to be Wolfram's own work, but now called the ""Juengere"" (Follower's) ""Titurel.""In ""Parzival,"" Wolfram himself was translating, in his own wayward fashion, Chretien de Troyes' unfinished ""Perceval, or, The Story of the Grail"" -- although he himself claims to have an additional source, the mysterious ""Kyot,"" who had a better, truer, version. Since Chretien himself claimed to have been working from a source provided by a patron, this has at times sent scholars searching in many directions. In his introduction to the Oxford World Classics volume, Richard Barber argues that the ""better source"" was entirely a creation of Wolfram's fertile imagination, and scraps of irrelevant but interesting ideas. He is probably right about the back-story Wolfram creates for it.A Preface introduces the reader (or listener) to Wolfram's moral concerns, and also to his sometimes-maddening use of riddles and metaphors. We then have an entire opening section with the hero's father, Gahmuret the Anschevin [i.e., Angevin], having adventures in a vaguely-conceived Near East and North Africa, where he leaves a ""pagan"" wife and son: the latter, the multi-colored Feirefiz, crosses paths with his younger brother, the main hero, years later. (It is worth noting that, although Wolfram is a snob, and is fascinated by physical differences between human beings, he is in no sense a racist; color is no bar to aristocracy.)(To me, it looks very much as if Wolfram had some sort of additional material -- there are odd resemblances to ""Morien,"" an apparent interpolation in the medieval Dutch translation of the Lancelot-Grail romances, featuring Perceval's ""Moorish"" nephew -- but to have used his imagination quite freely in accounting for it. A prose translation of ""The Romance of Morien"" by Jessie Weston is available in various Kindle editions, one rather randomly illustrated from medieval manuscripts, and as an on-line PDF -- see Weston's Wikipedia biography for a link.)Gahmuret's story is somewhat filled out in the first fragment of ""Titurel,"" but why Wolfram made him an Angevin is unclear; it perhaps has something to do with the accession of a Count of Anjou's son to the throne of England (Henry II), but so far more detailed explanations -- including those by Jessie Weston -- have trailed off into unprovable speculation. (In England, the family became better known as the Plantagenets.)This material is followed by Gahmuret's second marriage, and death, and, joining up with Chretien's narrative, the birth and upbringing in forest isolation of Parzival himself (the idea being to keep him from dying in battle like his father). There follows the ignorant boy's fateful encounter with some of Arthur's knights, his attempts at chivalry, and the splitting of the story to include the exploits of Sir Gawain (recognizable under German renderings, variously handled by translators over the years), and Parzival's first adventure at the Grail Castle. Although this is derived from Chretien's account of Perceval and ""Messire Gauvain, "" it is retold in Wolfram's quirky style, instead of an imitation of Chretien's famously lucid Old French verses. (Eric Rohmer's film version of ""Perceval"" is a splendid visualization of Chretien's version, and works almost equally well for the relevant parts of Wolfram's retelling, too.)In both Chretien's and Wolfram's versions, there is a lot of comedy derived from the boy's literal-mindedness and ignorance of the world, and the resulting blunders, contrasted with his great strength and physical beauty. (He bears some resemblance to the original, animated, version of ""George of the Jungle,"" except for the smashing headlong into trees.)Then Wolfram returns to what seems to be new material, writing his own conclusion, including the maturation of Parzival. This also seems to have been in Chretien's mind, but he left this romance, as well as his ""Lancelot,"" unfinished.As in other versions, including the Old French ""Continuations"" of ""Perceval,"" and the prose ""Perlesvaus"" (or ""High History of the Holy Grail""), Wolfram draws Chretien's very mysterious ""graal"" into a Christian conception of the universe. But Wolfram explains it as a sort of magic stone that fell to earth during the War in Heaven, not a relic of the Last Supper. That more explicitly Christianized version seems to belong to the Old French cycle of ""Joseph of Arimathea,"" ""Merlin"" and ""Perceval,"" attributed to Robert de Boron, and was later picked up and amplified in the ""Vulgate Cycle"" of Arthurian romances (centering on Lancelot, and introducing Galahad as the Quest hero, alongside Perceval), the version known in English through Malory, and, so far as the Chalice interpretation, also used by Wagner.Wagner plundered Wolfram for names and a certain ""German"" quality for his Grail opera, ""Parsifal,"" besides using another version of a story Wolfram alludes to in ""Lohengrin,' and the poet's name for a character in ""Tannhauser."" Personally, I suggest tossing aside all Wagnerian preconceptions, if any, and allowing Wolfram's real personality to have a chance. Sarcastic (especially about competitors), sentimental (especially about wives and children), full of pride in the knightly caste (a new phenomenon, which its members wanted to be very old), arrogantly announcing that he is completely illiterate in the company of poets who boasted they could read anything ever written, he is both annoying and lovable. A living personality, in fact, appearing in a time used to anonymous authors.For those who find ""Parzival"" a pleasure, or who would like to try a more military, rather than chivalric, work, there are also translations of his ""Willehalm,"" based on the Old French *chanson de geste* of William Curt-Nose, or Guillaume l'Orange, one of the heroes of the legends of Charlemagne and his descendants. I am familiar with two, both into prose. One, by Marion E. Gibbs and Sidney M. Johnson, was published by Penguin Classics in 1984, and is currently in print, as ""Wolfram von Eschenbach: Willehalm."" Charles E. Passage, one of the co-translators of ""Parzival,"" had earlier translated it as ""The Middle High German Poem of Willehalm by Wolfram von Eschenbach,"" published by Frederick Ungar in 1977. Although it is out of print, used copies of the trade paperback edition seem to be available. (Passage also translated ""Titurel"" for Ungar (1985), which, unfortunately, I haven't seen.)Curiously, the supposedly illiterate Wolfram seems unusually aware of the idea (if not the facts) of history.

He rather neatly brings into the correct sequence his versions of Arthurian and Carolingian Europe.The main problem I see with Weston's translation of Wolfram is its use of rhymed couplets, which many readers may find wearying long before the end of the second volume.

"[Note: this is not the only offering of ""A Middle English Vocabulary"" for Kindle; I have adapted this review from one posted on a different product page, since Amazon does not seem to have made the connection. (So far as I know, the editions are identical in content, although the other edition has a hyperlinked table of contents to the alphabet; and, for some reason, this one has a three-dimensional-looking picture on the product page, which hardly represents digital reality....).]As the title of this Kindle edition makes clear, this is NOT a full edition of Kenneth Sisam's ""Fourteenth-Century Verse and Prose,"" an outstanding anthology of Middle English literature, usually published with a glossary by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is simply the vocabulary, originally published separately, by Tolkien.Briefly, the original 1921 edition of Sisam's ""Fourteenth-Century Verse and Prose"" lacked a glossary, which was supplied as a second volume in 1922; the two were usually combined in the many later printings, in the 1920s, '30s, '40s, '50's, 60's, and '70s. (This seems more efficient, but requires constant flipping back forth between the sections of the book.) There were ""corrected"" editions in 1937, 1955, and 1970, which may all have been to Sisam's portions of the volume, and, in any case, this edition presumably reverts to the out-of-copyright 1922 text of Tolkien's contribution.To add to the potential confusion, the cover for a previous Kindle edition of the ""Vocabulary"" was lifted from the Dover paperback of a two-volumes-in-one paperback edition, re-titled for that edition ""A Middle English Reader and Vocabulary."" I have reviewed *that* edition fairly fully; there is an interesting discussion in the comments to some of the other reviews, as well.The immediate source of the text for this Kindle Edition of the ""Vocabulary"" is Project Gutenberg, which also has available (as a separate file) Sisam's collection, with his notes, and Middle English grammar. Both Project Gutenberg files appear to have been meticulously transcribed, a notable achievement in view of the fact that Sisam offers original-spelling texts, complete with obsolete characters, a practice with Tolkien naturally also follows. Those who want to try reading it should remember that it was designed for serious students (or at least those who had to satisfy an instructor!), and resembles a textbook because it is one.The ""Vocabulary"" follows the same model; it is meant to serve as a textbook -- and a very good one it is, too. This is Tolkien at his most professional, focusing his considerable intelligence on the technicalities of early English phonology, and the meanings of words, in a format that does not allow for the style and wit of his lectures and essays on (mainly) Old English subjects (notably, but not exclusively, ""Beowulf""). Students of Medieval English literature, and those Tolkien fans fascinated by his created languages (overlapping categories in many cases!) will find the little book fascinating. Those interested ONLY in Tolkien's story-telling will probably be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LPX6EYSA3FKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8PHWXK#wasThisHelpful","R1LPX6EYSA3FKG","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for an English (or other) translation of a saga, this isn't one of them. This book is (I think) the most recent edition of the Old Icelandic text of ""Egils saga Skallagrimssonar"" (The Story of Egil, son of Grim the Bald), and apparently the first prepared with English-language students in mind.The editor, Bjarni Einarsson, unfortunately died (in 2000) with the work incomplete, and Anthony Faulkes contributed essential additional material, notably the glossary; see the Preface for further details, and other assistance in preparing the edition, which was published in 2003. There is also an index of names, which may be of use to readers of any of the various English translations of the saga (see below).The edition is also available (""for personal use"") as a pdf from the Viking Society for Northern Research (see their website), which is extremely unwieldy (using the glossary can be a nightmare), but free. (It is what I am using for a reference text at this writing, although I found a library copy much easier to cope with.)As a very casual student of Old Germanic languages (seriously, Old English with glances at the others), I can't honestly comment on the quality of the editing. From comments and discussions elsewhere I gather that it is sound and reliable.The commentary is almost completely restricted to technical problems with understanding the text, aimed at the fairly advanced students capable of reading it. The only part of a possible commentary on the literary (rather than linguistic) side is a well-written Afterword, which makes the argument that not only the saga but the major poems attributed to Egil (if not all of the poetry in the story) are the work of Snorri Sturluson.For those not familiar with him, Snorri (1179-1241) was an Icelandic chieftain-politician who, before getting fatally entangled with Norwegian politics, wrote (or dictated) ""The Prose Edda"" and ""Heimskringla"" (or ""Sagas of the Kings of Norway""). These are major sources for our knowledge of medieval Icelandic verse forms, and for the works attributed to individual skalds (court poets). ""Egil's Saga"" also has often been attributed to him. Einarsson argues that Snorri not only crafted the saga, but made up the story of his ancestor, Egil, and composed the several major poems attributed to him.For a number of reasons -- including evidence from the manuscript tradition that the texts of these poems were inserted in the course of copying, and don't go back in a straight line to the prose saga's author, Snorri or another -- I find this part of Einarsson's argument hard to follow. Granted that Snorri invented some of the most impressive skaldic verse known from medieval Scandinavia -- poems generally considered superior to those to which he put his name -- I can't see why he failed to embed them in the saga text himself, but left their survival to chance. Or why he missed the chance to include them in his ""Edda"" and the ""Heimskringla.""Be that as it may (and Einarsson's argument is obviously drastically abbreviated), and whether the story is based on sound tradition or largely if not entirely invented, ""Egil's Saga"" deserves its reputation as one of the great works of the European Middle Ages. (Let us not minimize by specifying ""Icelandic"" or ""Germanic."") There have been a number of translations into English, most of which seem to be available now, or in the near future.The pioneering Victorian translation by W.C. Green (1893) is readily available in on-line and in what I think are print-on-demand versions. I have discussed its manifold problems in several reviews of ""Egil's Saga"" translations, and can't recommend it except as a last resort (especially as a cheap last resort).Altogether superior to Green's effort, although not without problems of its own, is E.R. Eddison's translation (1930), which at this writing is about to be reprinted by HarperCollins in paperback (for September 2014) -- a very welcome event, especially considering the very high asking prices for copies of the first edition in recent years. (There was one reprinting, by, if memory serves, Greenwood, but this too is hard to find.) Alas, the new cover blurb seems to make the saga contemporary with its tenth-century hero, and (not very appropriately) compares it to Homer's epics.Eddison provides extremely detailed, and invaluable, annotations. His prose, however, attempts to follow the Icelandic so closely that many find it opaque; so much that, like some of the translations of Eddison's great model, William Morris, it is said that it helps to consult the original (which is beyond me). I adore it myself, but have reservations about pushing it on others. And the language, although it takes getting used to, is far less ornate than in Eddison's great fantasy novel, ""The Worm Ouroboros,"" or his three ""Zimiamvia"" novels (all also announced from HarperCollins, for October 2014).The next translation, by Gwyn Jones (1960), was much more colloquial, and has good, if less detailed, annotations. (Jones was an accomplished translator, from Medieval Welsh and Old Icelandic, a good critic, and, among much else, a friend of Tolkien.)  This has been out of print for years (there was a 1970 reprinting), but copies are often available at reasonable prices through Amazon, and other dealers.Another good translation, by Christine Fell (prose) and John Lucas (verse) was published in the Everymans series in 1975; unfortunately, it seems to be out of print (again, you can look for used copies). The annotations to this translation are quite good, too. Lucas' translations of the verse are charming, but Fell's literal prose renderings of it in the notes are definitely worth reading.Also out of print (and likely to remain so) is the old Penguin Classics version by Hermann Palsson and Paul Edwards (1976). The translation is quite readable, although I found the various ""helps to the reader"" rather thin compared to any of its three twentieth-century predecessors.Finally, the five-volume translation series of ""The Complete Saga of the Icelanders,"" published in 1997, includes Bernard Scudder's version of ""Egil's Saga."" His translation takes the lead place in the Penguin Classics volume, ""The Sagas of the Icelanders"" (2000), a massive trade paperback based on ""The Complete Sagas."" It is there one of ten sagas, and seven shorter tales. (The sagas there have no separate introductions or annotations.)Scudder's translation was also published as a separate volume in the Penguin Classics (2005; as ""Egil's Saga,"" of course), also available as a Kindle Book, slightly revised, and with an introduction and notes by Svanhildur skarsdttir. This is not my favorite, but probably suffers from my familiarity with its predecessors. It should be added, however, that the translation had the benefit of some of Einarsson's unpublished work with the manuscript texts, although (obviously) not the particular edition reviewed here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76ALPGIG8FAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0903521547#wasThisHelpful","R76ALPGIG8FAU","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is (another) posthumous collection of writings by J.R.R. Tolkien, this time largely academic, and only occasionally (and indirectly) connected to Middle Earth matters; it is published under the general title of ""Beowulf, A Translation and Commentary, together with Sellic Spell,"" but it actually contains a little more material than indicated.It is a must-have for *really* committed Tolkien fans, and all Tolkien scholars, and will probably be found of value to any admirers of ""Beowulf"" (and Old English poetry in general) who don't already fall into the former categories. Those whose dedication to Tolkien is more limited *may* want to give it a pass, at least in its hardcover (and Kindle) incarnations -- although the current prices are very attractive. (I am a little dubious about reading it on a Kindle, given that I use lots of colored place-markers, keying the commentary to the translation....). I hope that the following description, and evaluation, will prove useful to those considering purchasing it.The volume at hand contains several distinct, but related pieces, assembled by Christopher Tolkien from his father's manuscripts (including typescript copies, which contain fewer problems with Tolkien's notoriously difficult handwriting). It does *not* contain his published (and famous) British Academy lecture, ""Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics,"" nor Tolkien's introductory and supplemental material from C.L. Wrenn's revision of the old Clark-Hall prose translation of Beowulf (both of which are to be found in the collection ""The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays."") Nor does it cover the previously-published posthumous editions of ""Finn and Hengest,"" (concerning a digression in the poem, and the complementary ""Fight at Finnsburg"" fragment), and Michael Drout's excellent (and, alas, apparently out-of-print) ""Beowulf and the Critics,"" an edition with commentary of the early, and longer, drafts of ""The Monsters and the Critics."" (This is not, I think, directly referenced in the present book, although I may have missed it in my rapid initial reading.)First, it contains J.R.R. Tolkien's own prose translation of the Old English ""Beowulf,"" originally undertaken in the 1920s (based on the 1922 first edition of Fr. Klaeber's great ""Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg""), and (very) slightly revised from time to time over the following years. For the curious, this ""epic poem"" (a label to which Tolkien objected) consists of 3182 lines of alliterative verse (a term Tolkien also disliked, it appears), It is contained in pages 13-105. There is a set of short notes to the translation, as well (pages 107-135), as Christopher Tolkien explains how he arrived at some of the readings, where the existing copies differed, and if there was no clear indication of relative date.Second, it contains substantial-looking excerpts from Tolkien's notes for lectures on ""Beowulf"" he delivered to students at Oxford in the 1930s (some of whom, at least, had available Klaeber's third revised edition of 1936), mainly concerning the Old English text of only the first half of the poem -- the part contained in the Oxford English syllabus, a practice which Tolkien disliked; and he does manage to work in some interesting discussions of the latter part also. This is found in pages 137-353; I am still working my way through it, after checking what Tolkien had to say on passages that seemed to me especially interesting, or are considered exceptionally difficult.Third (pages 355-414),  it contains Tolkien's attempt to reconstruct the ""wonder tale"" of the hero Bee-wolf and the monster, which he (like most others) assumed to have been combined with ""historical"" matter to produce ""Beowulf."" Tolkien, however, offers a rendering into Old English prose, as well as the modern English version. This is the material is described in the title as ""Sellic Spell"" (or ""wonderful story""). It is interesting reading, and provides an exercise for students of Old English as well. (Which I may test myself on someday, if I can get my Old English up to speed.)Finally, it contains two drafts of a poem, or two poems on the same subject, presenting ""Beowulf"" material in the style of a traditional ballad, instead of a ""fairy tale"" (pages 415-425), as ""The Lay of Beowulf.""My first reaction is of overwhelming approval. The ""Beowulf"" translation has some points which I find peculiar, like the references to Dark Age Scandinavian warriors as ""knights"" (which for me always brings in associations of mounted warfare), and the occasional archaic spelling of a current word (Christopher Tolkien notes that he has retained the use of `corse' for `corpse').On the whole, however, its differences from the usual translation practices are in the direction of clarifying the syntactic and lexical issues. For an immediate example, one can turn to the opening, where ""hron-rad"" (line 10) is, for once, the place ""where the whale rides,"" instead of the commoner, simpler, but less precise, image of ""the whale's road,"" which seems to restricts a whale's freedom of movement.Although Tolkien changed his mind on some points over the years, the translation as a whole reveals how he interpreted various disputed passages; for example, that the angered dragon did not, lizard-like, 'scuttle across the stone,' but, doglike, ""smelt now along the rock"" (*stonc aefter stan*) in quest of the thief of the jeweled goblet (line 2288). (This was a standard reading of the time, reading ""stonc"" as a form of ""stincan""; more recent editors have tended to disagree. And yes, this section of the old poem *is,* as many have recognized over the years, related to Bilbo and Smaug.)At this point in my life, however, I am so familiar with ""Beowulf"" in modern English garb (not to mention having long ago worked through the Old English in Klaeber's third edition) that I may not be the best guide to how a reader fresh to the subject will experience the translation.As for the Commentary: I have so far found it impressive, and also enlightening (about ""Beowulf"" and about Tolkien). Then again, I've read several Beowulf commentaries, one of them quite recently, and a fair amount of the critical literature. The issues it deals with may not be so clear to others.The beginning student, at least the one with Tolkien mainly in mind, will probably find help in Raymond W. Chambers' grand old ""Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem with a Discussion of the Stories of Offa and Finn,"" which is one of the few critical works Christopher Tolkien mentions as helpful to the reader. It went through several editions. The original version (without the later Supplement by C.L. Wrenn) is available as a free Kindle Book. For the same type of reader I hesitantly suggest the 1922 (first) edition of Klaeber's text and commentary, also free as a pdf on-line (see archive-dot-org, the Library-of-Congress-sponsored website), which provided the base text for Tolkien's translation. It should be less confusing than constantly checking the variant readings and the commentary for Klaeber's later changes in the second and third editions (although Tolkien probably had some of Klaeber's changes and additions in mind when preparing the lectures on which this commentary is based).Klaeber revised the text, as well as expanded the commentary and bibliography, in 1931 and 1936, and the latter edition, with supplements (1950), was reprinted for the rest of the century; copies are fairly readily available used (I reviewed it some years back, when I was also dealing with some ""Beowulf"" translations). The commentary in the most recent form, as ""Klaeber's Beowulf: Fourth Edition,"" was massively revised by the editors, R.D. Fulk, Robert E. Bjork, and John D. Niles (2008), and is an invaluable modern guide to the poem, but is of much less immediate value to the student of Tolkien. If a copy is available, Drout's commentary in ""Beowulf and the Critics"" contains copious material on the older secondary literature, to which Tolkien was reacting in the 1930s. (I also reviewed the first edition of Drout-Tolkien, back when it was still in print.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS2DK472TDZRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544442784#wasThisHelpful","RS2DK472TDZRF","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Popol Vuh: The Mayan Book of the Dawn of Life,"" Revised Edition, is the sensibly-relabeled digital edition of  Dennis Tedlock's ""Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of the Mayan Book of the Dawn of Life and the Glories of Gods and Kings,"" Revised and Expanded (1996; the translation was originally published in 1985). I reviewed the paperback edition under the long (cover) title in 2004, and I offer a somewhat reconsidered version of that review here. (Note that the hardcover edition to which the Kindle version is linked, at this writiting, is the old -- 1985 -- edition, with the shorter cover title.)[Additional Note: As of February 2015, the print editions of Tedlock's translation no longer appear as a result of an Amazon search unless a fuller title -- ""Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition"" -- is used. This appears to be just a glitch in the Amazon system, but obviously is a problem for prospective purchasers....]The confusing double title, which apparently has prevented Amazon from properly linking the print and electronic editions, does no service to customers who don't realize that the two books are one and the same; and a change of cover art does not lessen the chances of confusion. Of course, the lower price of the Kindle edition is very welcome. So is the likelihood that the digital version will remain available if the paper one goes out of print. The numerous illustrations (mainly from archeological sources) seem to have come through clearly, although the captions seem sometimes to spill over to another digital ""page.""Somewhat less welcome is the prospect of navigating over 160 pages of Notes, Commentary, and Glossary, which requires constant consultations of the back of the book. My advice for anyone reading it on a Kindle app (on a Mac or PC, instead of Kindle hardware) is to open the Notes, etc., in the Cloud Reader, and keep them open as one moves along through the text.As for the book, itself (rather than the mechanics of reading it), the ""Popol Vuh"" (or ""Council Book"") is written in a Mayan language, but a European script. It is the most substantial surviving account of the Maya view of their own history, including that of their gods and divine ancestors. It has presented a host of problems for translators (although the surviving transcription of a lost original has a parallel Spanish translation by the transcriber). The Tedlock translation of 1985 added new information to the work of many distinguished predecessors, and made substantial parts of the narrative clear (or at least much clearer).The fact that a fairly extensively revised edition of this book was not only possible, but necessary, in 1996, a decade after its first publication, might have discouraged the publisher from continuing to call the new version ""Definitive"" on the cover. The title page more precisely then called it a Revised Edition of ""Popol Vuh: The Mayan Book of the Dawn of Life ... with commentary based on the ancient knowledge of the modern Quiche Maya."" However, ""Definitive"" seems to have been the marketing buzzword. But how would a third edition be described?As we have noted, the digital form (of the second edition) has a simplification of that verbose title, and it will be seen that the ""with commentary..."" description has been moved to its cover (where it always belonged) as well. The cover illustration originally appeared on the title page, and with caption, as one of the forty-some interior illustrations.In fact, the work of Dennis and Barbara Tedlock with living Quiche Maya ritualists (priests / diviners / shamans), which, in the first edition, added so much to understanding this early post-Conquest text, was part of a larger expansion of Maya studies, including a more complete decipherment of ancient inscriptions, and greatly improved studies of Maya art. It is now possible to recognize events, and even characters, of the ""Popol Vuh"" in art centuries older, and their prototypes a millennium earlier. Meso-American cultures have been re-analyzed, and lost details recovered, as part of a major, and very rapid, shift in understanding.As an example: a large part of the story of ""Popol Vuh"" involves games played in ball-courts, in this world and the world of the dead; a major collection of papers on this theme, in Mayan and other cultures, ""The Mesoamerican Ballgame,"" was based on a conference held the same year the first edition of Tedlock's translation appeared (Scarborough and Wilcox, 1991).Another change was the adoption of a new official system for writing Mayan languages in the Roman alphabet, one devised, for the first time, by native speakers of the various languages. This adds considerably to etymological and grammatical precision, but enormously complicates recognizing words and names in older systems. (Anyone familiar with the juggling of Wade-Giles and Pinyin transliterations of Chinese will be only too familiar with the kind of adjustment process for ordinary readers.)Tedlock has attempted, with considerable success, to incorporate this new information, and the new transcription system, into the old structure of the book. In the process, besides adding fascinating illustrations and fine-tuning the translation, he has restructured the introduction and notes. Some interesting personal observations are gone, or greatly reduced. References to older literature, often with Tedlock's reconsiderations, have generally been replaced by citations of more recent studies. Once debatable points have been given firm answers, and new questions have been raised.Some material which, at a first glance, I assumed to be missing, turned out, on close examination (with copies of both print editions open in front of me, and the help of a lot of post-it flags), to have been broken up or consolidated in different contexts. In a few places, however, the strain shows, as a once-clear line of argument is disrupted. The sheer complication of the material explicated, in which social, cosmic / astronomical, and agricultural references are constantly intertwined, probably made this inevitable.Archeological and epigraphic material has, I think, somewhat eclipsed in prominence the modern Maya contribution to this edition (perhaps not for close readers of the commentary), although for fuller information it was always necessary to turn to Barbara Tedlock's ""Time and the Highland Maya.""Among more recent publications of considerable value for understanding the mythological and astronomical material, Susan Milbrath's ""Star Gods of the Maya: Astronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars"" (1999) is exhausting, but I found it particularly illuminating. A series of books of which the late Linda Schele was co-author or co-editor (The Blood of Kings,"" 1986; ""The Forest of Kings,"" 1990; ""Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path,"" 1993; and ""The Code of Kings,"" 1999) are more popular in style, and very rewarding; unfortunately, like everything else in Mayan studies, they have dated very quickly, and the reader should always keep the date of publication in mind. Technical studies -- linguistic, epigraphic, archeological, art-historical -- are now abundant, but also harder for me to judge.Dennis Tedlock more recently -- 2003 -- returned to the writings of the post-Conquest Maya aristocrats like those who actually produced the existing ""Popol Vuh,"" in his translation with commentary of  ""Rabinal Achi: A Mayan Drama of War and Sacrifice."" A close reader of this latter book will discover some small revisions of Tedlock's ""Popol Vuh"" translation; for example, the town of ""Rotten Cane"" becomes ""Old Camp,"" and ""Bearded Place"" becomes ""Whisker Place."" More significant differences appear in the excerpts from ""Popol Vuh"" included in Tedlock's ""2000 Years of Mayan Literature, with New Translations and Interpretations"" (2010). In the intervening years, the first real critical edition of the Quiche (K'iche') Mayan text had appeared, edited by a native speaker of K'iche' who is also a linguist, Sam Colop (1999). His division of the text into metrical lines is used by Tedlock in the 2010 revision.There is also a more recent ""Popol Vuh"" translation, by Allen J. Christenson (""Popol Vuh: The Sacred Book of the Mayas,"" 2003), originally published in two volumes, the second of which contained the text and translation in the newly-restored lineation. This edition has been reprinted (2007): and the first volume (a prose translation with detailed commentary in footnotes) is available free on-line as a pdf (on the website of FAMSI -- Foundation for the Advacement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc.).[Addendum February 2015: For some reason, I left out (or deleted) a mention of the blog ""Maya Decipherment,"" which contains fascinating material from the ongoing exploration of Maya (and other Meso-American) civilization; some of it is fairly technical, but not impenetrably so.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A87UAQBC33N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051I4YX0#wasThisHelpful","R2A87UAQBC33N5","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Apology to readers: after struggling to condense a LOT of information in this review, I have given up on what kept turning into a course on the literature and liturgy of post-Biblical Judaism. I refer (*) those in need of such information to the relevant Wikipedia articles. The most important of these is Pirkei Avot,* which contains useful links to other articlesDespite the 1995 date in the Amazon Book Description, this little volume, with its widely-used, but not quite accurate, title of ""Sayings of the Fathers"" was originally published, in hardcover, in 1945; the more recent date presumably refers to the present, paperback, re-issue. (I am writing this review using a somewhat battered copy of the older edition.)The publisher, Behrman House, also offers a re-designed and illustrated hardcover version (which Amazon dates to 1986), including a commentary on the illustrations, and a new Foreword. This is also available from Amazon.In the 1945 version, a Hebrew text faces the English translation, with commentary, mainly referring to the translation, running continuously below both of them. The 1986 edition has a slightly more complicated, less continuous, layout, to allow for the illustrations and their commentary.The 1945 edition is itself excerpted from the ""Authorised Daily Prayer Book"" (""with Commentary and Notes"") edited by Joseph H. Hertz, Chief Rabbi of the British Empire, which began appearing, in parts, 1n 1941; the one-volume edition (almost 1150 pages) appeared, posthumously, in 1946, and was reprinted in the US starting in 1948. (Copies can be ordered through, but not from, Amazon.) This is an Orthodox prayer book, although the commentary is a good deal less technical than in many more recent examples.As noted above, ""Sayings of the Fathers"" is a commonly-used English title for the Mishnah* tractate Avot (or Avoth, Avos, Ovos, depending the transliteration system and variety of Hebrew). ""Ethics of the Fathers"" is sometimes used as an alternative. Strictly speaking, the title ""Pirkei Avot"" means ""Chapters of 'Avot,' indicating that the tractate has been excerpted from its original context. In this case, the chapters have been included in the Ashkenazi* prayer book to provide a series of readings during part of the year. (The basic custom has been traced back to the eighth century, but was not followed by all traditional Jewish communities.)Although there are quotations from the Mishnah elsewhere in the prayer book -- allowing ordinary worshippers to claim the merit of regular study -- ""Avot"" is the only section included in its entirety. In fact, more than its entirety, as a sixth chapter (which also appears elsewhere) has been added to the five in the official text of the Mishnah.""Avot"" is unlike the rest of the Mishnah in that it contains no legal rulings or arguments, but instead introduces a series of (mostly) revered teachers, and their characteristic sayings (""He used to say ...""), which turn out to be exhortations to study, to the pious life. Peculiarly, but not uniquely, it even includes admonitions from a notorious apostate (although the nature of his apostasy is open to debate). The additional chapter is devoted to praise of Torah,* both in the narrow sense of the Five Books of Moses and the wider one of authentic Jewish learning.Prayer Book commentaries have long been a popular branch of Jewish literature. Hertz's contribution to the genre is based mainly on the 1890 translation by Simeon Singer, as part of an earlier ""Authorised Daily Prayer Book"" (also known in American printings as the ""Standard Daily Prayer Book""), including Singer's rendering of Pirkei Avot. To this he has attached a largely homiletic commentary, together with some information on the various sages mentioned. As might be expected he relies heavily on traditional sources, and repeats some identifications which he certainly knew had been challenged on substantive grounds.This is one of my favorite Pirkei Avot commentaries (and the translation is familiar enough that it ""sounds right""). However, those in search of an historical-critical commentary may want to consult R. Travers Herford's ""Pirke Aboth. The Ethics of the Talmud: Sayings of the Fathers,"" the third (1945) edition of which was reprinted by Schocken Books in 1962, and kept in print at least through the 1970s. (It deserves reprinting; with the Hebrew text given paragraph by paragraph immediately above the translation and comments, instead of on facing pages, it should be easier to adapt to digital format.)Another alternative to Hertz's commentary is the eclectic version in Judah Goldin's ""The Living Talmud: The Wisdom of the Fathers and Its Classical Commentaries"" (1957), which  includes extended quotations from traditional commentaries, some by leading medieval and early modern figures, such as Maimonides,* others from comparatively obscure writers. Unfortunately, this lacks a Hebrew text. Goldin elsewhere translated the ""A"" Version of ""The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan,"" a partly parallel text included in the Babylonian Talmud.* (The ""B"" Version has since been translated and analyzed by Anthony J. Saldarini.)A well-informed, if old, and misleadingly clear and systematic, study of the ideas of the sages quoted in Avot, and their colleagues, is Solomon Schechter's ""Some Aspects of Rabbinic Theology"" from 1909 (which I have reviewed under the title ""Aspects of Rabbinic Theology""). It is a longish work, but still shorter than George Foot Moore's multi-volume ""Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era,"" or Ephraim Urbach's massive ""The Sages"" (1975, 1979), both of which share its schematic tendency.Another approach to early rabbinic literature is Norman Solomon's ""The Talmud: A Selection"" (Penguin Classics, 2009), which is made up of well-chosen excerpts from the Mishnah* and Gemara* of the Babylonian Talmud,* with interesting an useful headnotes and footnotes, and a splendid Introduction. The volume is almost 900 pages long, but is designed as a sampler, to be read in almost any order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSEG03QQCW6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0874411572#wasThisHelpful","ROSEG03QQCW6K","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was delighted to see that Jon D. Levenson's ""Creation and the Persistence of Evil: The Jewish Drama of Divine Omnipotence"" had recently joined his earlier ""Sinai & Zion: An Entrance Into the Jewish Bible"" (Harper, 1985; corrected paperback, 1987; HarperOne digital edition, May 2013) in Kindle format. (They are also in Kobo and Nook.)""Creation and the Persistence of Evil"" (Harper & Row, 1987) was one of the most recent books to be included in the distinguished MYTHOS series from Princeton University Press and the Bollingen Foundation (corrected, with a new Preface, Princeton University Press, paperback, 1994). It is the latter text that is the basis of the new HarperCollins EPub edition (October 1, 2013).This pleasure is partly due to the fact that an excellent book is getting a new lease on life, with, perhaps, a somewhat different market than that for scholarly monographs; but also to the fact that my copies of their paperback editions have been missing for some time, and this was a less expensive way to replace both ""Sinai and Zion"" and ""Creation and the Persistence of Evil.""Much academic writing is uninspiring, and much religious writing is more glib than precise. Levenson deals with weighty themes, with philological rigor, but his prose is exciting, and impressively quotable.  Levenson even finds a place for humor: Referring to Psalm 104: 26, ""Leviathan that You formed to sport with"" -- ""It is possible that the psalmist has here sanitized the old myth ... altogether, so that Leviathan appears ... as the plaything of YHWH (his 'rubber duckey,' as a student once put it).""""Creation and the Persistence of Evil"" takes on one the most enduring features of philosophical theology: the understanding of divine omnipotence as complete power over a created, dependent, universe. When joined to omniscience and benevolence, this creates the classic problem of theodicy (the nature of Divine Justice). Levenson examines this viewpoint in the Hebrew Bible, and finds that it is not the only one; indeed, the assumptions of omnipotence, omniscience, and benevolence are most evident when God is reproached with the continuing existence, and apparent triumph, of evil in the world.Levenson argues that the Hebrew Bible -- the Jewish Bible, which is not quite the same as the Christian ""Old Testament"" -- regards its God as the MOST powerful, but does not *always* draw the conclusion that everything else is powerless. From this perspective, God's triumphs over the powers of chaos and moral evil no longer have the appearance of a charade, but of a genuine (if still one-sided) struggle.Moreover, Levenson sees both the Biblical text and some Rabbinic responses to it as contradicting the long-held dogma of ""creatio ex nihilo,"" creation out of nothing. As he states in the 1994 Preface: ""When order emerges where disorder had reigned unchallenged, when justice replaces oppression, when disease and death yield to vitality and longevity, this is indeed the creation of something out of nothing. It is the replacement of the negative by the positive .... This crucial point will be lost on us if we follow the long-standing philosophical tradition of identifying God with perfect being, so that his opposite is non-being, or 'nothing' in the sense of a void. It will equally be lost if we draw a sharp distinction between creation and redemption.""Although the two books can be read quite independently of each other, ""Creation"" picks up themes (mythological, symbolic, liturgical) explored in ""Sinai and Zion,"" and the two volumes can be considered complementary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMNRJYF0XH5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECAUBHQ#wasThisHelpful","R3TMNRJYF0XH5Z","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume is a massive (over 800 pages, including the index) study of selected teachings of early Muslim philosophers/theologians, known as the Mutakallimun, whose viewpoints are known collectively as ""the Kalam."" The basic material was originally intended as part of a more general study of medieval Islamic thought, to be based on the limited documentation available.This turn in was to be part of a study of the relation between philosophy and scriptural religions from Plato through Spinoza (in the seventeenth century). Published portions of the project include the Hellenistic Judaism of Philo of Alexandria. Unfortunately, Harry Austryn Wolfson (1887-1974) was unable to complete this ambitious undertaking, on which he had started work in the 1920s. Indeed, the second volume of his work on the Church Fathers, originally accepted for publication, was subjected to a thorough revision, and, in the end, never published. (For a short biography and select bibliography, see Wikipedia.)However, as the author explains in his Preface, it had dawned on him that the methods he had used in his books on Philo and the Church Fathers could be applied to the Kalam literature already in print. He could ""prepare a volume on the Kalam in which certain problems peculiar to the Kalam would be dealt with in their relation to similar problems dealt with by Philo and the Church Fathers in their common attempt to interpret Scripture in terms of philosophy and to revise philosophy in conformity with Scripture."" (That is the second half of a sentence; Wolfson's style is elegant, but demands concentration from the reader.)The problems which Wolfson chose to discuss are: (1) Attributes; (2) Koran; (3) Creation; (4) Atomism; (5) Causality; (6) Predestination and Free Will. (Those familiar with Wolfson's exposition of what Spinoza did with the ideas of earlier philosophers will recognize most of the topics.)The book is in large part dedicated to digging out the conclusions and arguments of the Mutakallimun from the later, better-known, Arabic writings, Muslim and Jewish, in which they are embedded. This requires a consideration of how philosophical doctrines reached the early Muslim thinkers, and their early encounters with philosophical versions of Christian theology. Histories of philosophy tend to point to Greek sources; as Wolfson points out, much of the early transmission of ideas was probably through the medium of Syriac (Christian Aramaic), traceable in part in changing terminology in Arabic.As an inevitable consequence of this ""excavation"" of ideas, Wolfson sometimes seem to present more argumentation than substance as he works backwards in time.This sometimes has the advantage of revealing how much the Kalam influenced later thinkers, like Avicenna, Averroes, and Maimonides (whose own work was later taken up by the Scholastics of the Latin Church).The Kalam represents an early stage of Muslim thought, but not its original form. For beginners in the study of Islam and its philosophical dimensions, I would suggest the comparatively brief 320 pages of A. J. Wensinck's ""The Muslim Creed: Its Genesis and Historical Development"" (1932), which was well-received in the Muslim world on its first publication. Unhappily, the only in-print edition of the book is very expensive; fortunately, it is available in pdf formats (one with searchable text) from archive.org (a site hosted by the Library of Congress, with which every student should be familiar), free for the trouble of downloading.""The Philosophy of the Kalam"" really should be in print, in a less-expensive paperback edition, but in fact the pricey hardcover edition is available through third-party sellers only. Fortunately, archive.org offers two PDF versions of this book, as well. One, the larger file, is a straight scan of the 770-some pages of text and bibliography (not the index), and is more readable. The other features a machine-readable text, ideal for searching; but the resolution seems fuzzy to me, and it may be a strain on your eyes. I suggest downloading both PDFS, if your hard drive has room for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A8R2JPOXKIPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674665805#wasThisHelpful","R2A8R2JPOXKIPY","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kabbalah (""that which is received,"" or ""Tradition"") is an esoteric form of Judaism, which flourished from the High Middle Ages to the seventeenth century. Even a truly basic introduction demands some prior knowledge of post-Biblical Jewish history, and exoteric Judaism; otherwise, references to names, locales, philosophical schools, and periods of time, are likely to blur together, even if briefly defined in the volume itself. For a reliable, and fairly brief, introduction, I would suggest, among many worthy titles, ""Back to the Sources: Reading the Classic Jewish Texts,"" edited by Barry W. Holtz (1984), which covers most of the relevant literature, albeit sometimes very briefly.The leading twentieth-century scholar in the field -- in fact, the one person who did most to establish the study of Jewish mysticisms (note the plural) as intellectually respectable -- was Gershom Scholem. His collection ""On the Kabblah and Its Symbolism"" was originally published as ""Zur Kabbala und ihrer Symbolik"" in 1960, with an English translation by Ralph Manheim in 1965, from Schocken Books, and reissued with a New Foreword by Bernard McGinn, 1996. It contains five essays of increasing specificity: ""Religious Authority and Mysticism,"" ""The Meaning of the Torah in Jewish Mysticism,"" ""Kabbalah and Myth,"" ""Tradition and New Creation in the Ritual of the Kabbalists,"" and, finally, ""The Idea of the Golem,"" or artificial human being.The essays were lectures originally delivered at the C.G. Jung's ""Eranos"" conferences in Zurich, in the 1950s (one of the few places where Scholem felt he could use his native German language -- and introduce to Jewish thought to a part of the intellectual elite of a continent from which Jews had been nearly obliterated.I have often recommended ""Symbolism"" as an introductory book; it has the great advantage of being about half the length of Scholem's ""Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism"" (1941, 1946, 1954; Schocken Paperback 1961; with Foreword by Robert Alter, 1995), and considerably more inviting, as well as significantly shorter, than the encyclopedia articles collected in ""Kabbalah"" (1974; Meridian paperback, 1978).Another collection, longer, but addressed to non-specialists, is Scholem's collection of popular and ""occasional"" pieces, ""The Messianic Idea in Judaism, and Other Essays on Jewish Spirituality,"" 1971; with Foreword by Arthur Hertzberg, 1995, contains some partly duplicate material, such as another, more popular, study of the Golem; but is none the less worth trying by a relative beginner.Gershom Scholem's ""On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead"" (""Von der mystischen Gestalt der Gottheit,"" 1962; English translation, Schocken, with Foreword by Joseph Dan, 1991) is a set of six complex and elaborately documented essays, tracing specific themes in Jewish mystical thought. These were also Eranos lectures, and, in effect, build on the foundation established by ""Symbolism.""Despite being well-translated, the ""Mystical Shape"" lectures together make up one of his more difficult works (in English), perhaps surpassed only by his long ""Origins of the Kabbalah"" (Princeton, 1991), with its densely-argued readings of some notoriously obscure and corrupt medieval texts. In this case, the difficulties are presented mainly by the long histories of the ideas he investigates, and their many variations and transformations.For this reason, the English-language subtitle of ""Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah"" is accurate, but, as some reviewers have complained, misleading. ""Basic"" is often used in English book titles to indicate ""simple, or elementary."" The German ""Studien zu Grundbegriffen"" in the original subtitle (1962) might instead have been translated as ""Investigations towards Fundamental Principles,"" or something equally, or even more, polysyllabic and intimidating.Certainly, the six essays which made up the contents of ""Mystical Shape"" are substantially denser, and more elaborately documented -- and often richer in content -- than ""Symbolism,"" but it should be possible to read all eleven as a set.In fact, revised versions of both ""Symbolism"" and ""Mystical Shape"" were published in one volume in Hebrew, in 1976, as Joseph Dan pointed out in his useful Foreword to the English translation by Joachim Neugroschel. (The 1991 English text of ""Mystical Shape"" was revised by Jonathan Chipman to incorporate Scholem's emendations.) When the essays are read in order of publication, they take a reader from truly elementary (which is not to say easy or self-evident) aspects of Jewish mysticism to some of its most complex and wide-ranging developments. However, it might be wise to try ""Symbolism"" and ""Major Trends,"" or ""Kabbalah,"" *before* attempting ""Mystical Shape"" -- since I don't know how to ""un-read"" a book, I can't tell you how helpful ""Symbolism"" would be as the sole introduction to ""Mystical Shape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDH8IM8YX03Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805210512#wasThisHelpful","R1JDH8IM8YX03Q","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been re-reading parts of Isaac Husik's ""History of Mediaeval Jewish Philosophy"" in the Kindle edition (originally, it appears, produced as an e-book from Project Gutenberg). The Kindle edition is well-executed, with the rather detailed index hyperlinked to the text, so that there is no problem converting the old page references to location numbers just to find where something is mentioned.I first read Husik's book in a library copy, and longer ago than I care to remember. It was even then antiquated in detail (it is now approaching the centennial of its publication, in 1916), and more recent scholarship concerning the figures it covers can be found, or is at least referenced, in the two editions of ""Encyclopedia Judaica"" (not to be confused with the old ""Jewish Encyclopedia,"" of the same vintage as Husik's book.)There has been a great deal of impressive scholarship in the general area of medieval Jewish thought since Husik wrote; most spectacularly, but not only, in the case of the mystical movements (Kabbalah and its predecessors).However, I don't know of a more modern treatment of medieval Jewish rationalistic thought (in English) that is equally comprehensive in coverage (twenty philosophers in eighteen chapters), and goes into much detail on each thinker -- sometimes tediously so, as Husik rehearses X's stand on Problem Y, so the reader can see how it differs from those of A, B, and C.However, this is exactly the sort of detail a student needs to form a correct impression of the various thinkers, and their intellectual world(s).The book is, however, weakest when it comes to the issue of the Muslim thinkers of the early Middle Ages, and their impact, individual and cumulative, on Jewish thought. This is treated in connection with, for example, Maimonides, but he is himself a major source of information on some now-obscure, but once influential, Arabic writings. Or perhaps this is just the most obvious to me, because later studies of H.A. Wolfson, notably his ""The Philosophy of the Kalam"" (1976), have so clearly shown what is missing in this area. (Note that Wolfson's posthumous volume was part of an unfinished series on Religious Philosophy from Plato, through Philo of Alexandria, to Spinoza, which also included part of a study of the Church Fathers.)I may have missed other faults, due to ignorance of the specialized literature.Besides the Kindle edition, ""History of Mediaeval Jewish Philosophy"" is available in PDF from archive.org (a Library of Congress website), which will be of most value for those who need precise page references. Two print editions appear to be currently available. The Dover paperback edition is that publisher's usual precise reproduction (sometimes with corrections) of the copy text.

"The two introductions to this volume, the new one by Neil Gillman and the older one by Louis Finkelstein, explain a lot about the book's author and its origins. However, this review goes over the ground a little more succinctly, and from a somewhat different angle -- and not everyone will want to struggle with the 'Look Inside"" feature to figure what Gillman, at least, has to say.When this book, ""Some Aspects of Rabbinic Theology,"" was published in 1909, informed opinion was largely skeptical of the whole idea of an early Jewish Theology, as distinguished from the Religious Philosophies articulated in the Middle Ages by Saadia Gaon, Yehudah Ha-Levi, Maimonides, and their successors. (And by informed opinion, I mean the traditionally trained Jewish scholars who were sufficiently modern in their view of the world to worry about such questions.)Certainly there were no obvious theological expositions or programmatic presentations of dogma by the Rabbis cited in the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds, the immense repositories of generations of debate over just about every imaginable aspect of Jewish life. Indeed, there were even warnings about too much speculation (Such as ""What is above, and what is below? What was before, and what will be after?"" Mishnah, Hagiga II, 1) -- admittedly promptly followed in the Babylonian Talmud by examples of such esoteric knowledge (B.T. Hag. 11b-14a), and to whom it might be taught.Solomon Schechter (1847-1915), an outstanding scholar as well as an influential early leader of American Judaism's Conservative Movement (see Wikipedia for a short biography and cross-references), didn't agree with the conventional wisdom of his fellow-Talmudists. In his eyes, the early rabbinic sages had consensus views of God, the nature of Man and the World, and other topics considered theological in western thought, assumptions to which their disputes, questions, answers, and parables constantly refer.What they did not have was a tradition of expounding such things dogmatically and systematically, after the manner of the Church Fathers and later Christian theologians, or of later Jewish thinkers exposed to both Christian and Muslim dogmas.The difficult part of recognizing this shared view, according to Schechter, was to dig it out of the texts, and expound it in a coherent manner, and to do so without resorting to typically medieval devices, such as allegorical readings. It should be observed that the Babylonian Talmud alone runs to about 5500 large pages; and that the literature to be surveyed also included early Midrash (anthologies of originally oral commentary set out in Biblical order), a smaller but still substantial corpus.Schechter had begun lecturing and writing on these topics in the early 1890s, so he was not taking all of his readers by surprise.Its influence is evident in George Foot Moore's ""Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian era, the Age of the Tannaim,"" written in the 1920s; still an excellent introduction by a non-Jewish scholar, albeit dated in several respects. The book continues to be considered a classic presentation of its argument, and remains influential in expositions of early Jewish thoughtHowever, Schechter's entire approach remains an issue. There is no suggestion that his Talmudic knowledge was anything except excellent, his citations accurate. One problem that remains is the doubt that any of the Sages would have recognized their own thoughts as organized and set forth by Schechter in neat, but alien, categories.The other enduring problem is that Schechter, simply by organizing his material in this manner, gives a misleading impression of the very unsystematic way it was transmitted, and the way students would (or would not) absorb its points of view.About the only cure for the latter problem is to actually read a little Talmud -- presumably in translation, since Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic are not part of most potential readers' mental equipment. Fortunately, there are  now more-or-less complete English versions out there; in fact, the entire Soncino translation of the Babylonian Talmud (Soncino being the publisher) is available for consultation on-line, with pdf files available for downloading. Many of the same texts are available in inexpensive Kindle editions, and can be read in that format.An alternative is the Penguin Classic ""The Talmud: A Selection,"" translated and edited by (Rabbi) Norman Solomon (2009), published a century after Schechter's book. It includes an excellent introduction, a copious modern bibliography, and illuminating headnotes and footnotes to the selections. It draws from the Mishnah, a second-century CE Hebrew codification of Jewish law, or rather, legal rulings, and from the Gemara, the Aramaic commentary -- the latter exclusively from the better-known Babylonian Talmud (Bavli), not the less-studied Yerushalmi (Jerusalem, or Palestinian, Talmud). Rabbi Solomon uses typography and lay-out to indicate the development of lines of argument (and digressions) and supplies Biblical contexts, including notes on how this or that citation strains the Hebrew text, or departs from the original context in the interest of atomistic literalism. Be warned: although it contains only samples of the sixty-three tractates of the Mishnah, not all of which have Talmudic commentary (Gemara), it still runs to almost 900 pages itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Z9YZPXBDOKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1879045249#wasThisHelpful","R25Z9YZPXBDOKW","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This edition of ""Sayings of the Jewish Fathers"" is an abridged version of the pioneering English translation by Charles Taylor, a Christian Hebraist, first published in 1877, with a Second Edition in 1897. It is an extract (with liturgical additions) from the ""Mishnah,"" a second-century CE codification of Jewish law -- or, more exactly, of debates concerning that law. The Hebrew text -- and, these days, a translation -- can be found in the majority of Jewish Daily and Sabbath Prayer Books (if the book is said on the title page to be the Sephardic Rite, it won't have it; and some modernists radically abridge the ancient text). Unlike the rest of the Mishnah, it contains exhortations and proverbs, instead of legal rulings and (often dissenting) opinions.Taylor's text (without the critical Hebrew text, technical apparatus, and the full notes) was presented online in the Internet Sacred Text Archive by the late J.B. Hare (1955-2010). It is this version which seems to be available in several formats on-line, competing with Project Gutenberg-based editions of J.I. Gorfinkle's translation of 1913, which is itself based on Taylor's rendering and that of Simeon Singer in his ""Authorised Daily Prayer Book"" of 1890. (Full editions of all of these, including Taylor's ""Appendix"" volume from 1900, are available in PDFs on Archive.org, a Library of Congress site.)I've rated Taylor's version with four stars out of respect for the text, and his generally good job of translating it, but the dubious utility of the abridged form tempts me to give it three, instead.Gorfinkle used the same title (""Sayings of the Jewish Fathers"") as Taylor. This nicely distinguished the sages of the Talmud from, say, the Church Fathers; but even so it may have missed some of the point, as in the Post-Biblical Hebrew of the Mishnah, the word ""Aboth"" (pronounced ""Avot"" in Sephardic and Modern Hebrew: ""Avos"" in the Ashkenazic pronunciation) also signifies the principles behind legal decisions (as in ""the Fathers of Torts""). In that sense, the text can be considered as setting forth the principles of the pious and righteous life.None of these translations I have mentioned are really bad, but they are not the most satisfactory, either, except for being public domain. The text is, for the most part, clear, but the context cries out for explication, and these translations are lacking such essential commentary, or have been stripped of it.Taylor gives the original title of the collect of proverbs, admonitions to righteousness, and exhortations to piety, as ""Dibre Aboth ha-Olam"" (Sayings of the Fathers of the World), while Gorfinkle calls it ""Masseketh (tractate) Aboth;"" both acknowledge that the best-known title is ""Pirkei Aboth,"" Chapters of the Fathers, the form (including additional sayings) incorporated in the Central and Eastern European (Ashkenazic) liturgy. Those interested in details can try the Wikipedia article under the title ""Pirke Avot"" (an alternative transliteration.)Before the First World War, Gorfinkle was already able to point to a host of translations of this little book, into a great variety of languages. (The most recent addition to the list may be Chinese -- see Wikipedia.) As far as the proliferation of English versions go, it seems to be the Post-Biblical Hebrew equivalent of Lao-tzu (the ""Tao Te Ching"") -- everyone feels qualified to produce a translation of a superficially simple-looking text. Of this multitude of renderings, I have two favorite bi-lingual editions.One is Joseph H. Hertz's ""Sayings of the Fathers,"" a revision with extensive commentary of Simeon Singer's version, published separately in 1945, and subsequently, but also included his Hertz's massive annotated edition of the ""Authorised Daily Prayer Book"" (for Jews of the British Empire). Both versions of it open as Hebrew books (""backwards""), and have translations on the left-hand page facing the Hebrew text of the right, with the commentary flowing left-to-right below the main text. Even if it was out of copyright, this would not make a good Kindle (or other standard digital format) book. It is currently available from Behrman House, as a beautifully illustrated hardcover (1986), and, in paperback, in the original format of 1945.Hertz's commentary has a sort of companion in ""Ethics of the Talmud: Sayings of the Fathers,"" by R. Travers Herford (1860-1950), a Unitarian clergyman. Herford's translation (1925; third edition, 1945; US paperback, Schocken Books, 1962) has paragraphs of Hebrew followed by their English rendering, and the commentary separates such blocks of text as needed: a much more digital-friendly layout, if someone gets permission to use it.Hertz's commentary is notably more homiletic and inner-Jewish than Herford's, which is somewhat more concerned with identifying and dating the Sages quoted, and deals with textual and translation problems where Hertz by-and-large follows traditional solutions.Another excellent, but aging, translation is Judah Goldin's ""The Living Talmud: The Wisdom of the Fathers and Its Classical Commentaries"" (1957), which lacks a Hebrew text, but includes extended quotations from traditional commentaries, some by leading medieval and early modern figures, such as Maimonides, others from comparatively obscure writers. Goldin elsewhere translated the ""A"" Version of ""The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan,"" a partly parallel text included in the Babylonian Talmud. (The ""B"" Version has since been translated and analyzed by Anthony J. Saldarini.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I2V57ACWTMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BV8SI2#wasThisHelpful","R1I2V57ACWTMK","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review was originally posted with the reprint edition of the same translation, as published by Jason Aronson, Inc. in 1995. I re-post it here for the information it contains. I have not attempted to up-date to include the Commentary in the new JPS edition. For other changes in the volume, such as separating the Hebrew text from the translation, see the other reviews.Moses Hayyim Luzzatto of Padua (1707-1746/47) was a rather controversial eighteenth-century Jewish mystic. He managed to be accused of heresy for his privately circulated Kabbalistic tracts, and also accepted as a thoroughly Orthodox expounder of the holy life for his popular writings, particularly this book (""Mesillat Yesharim,"" or ""Path of the Upright Ones""), written in exile in Amsterdam!Mordecai Kaplan (1881-1983) was born in Lithuania under the Czars, lived, studied, and taught in New York, helped found the Young Israel movement in the Orthodox community, critiqued the Reform Movement, became an influential teacher at the Conservative Movement's Jewish Theological Seminary, and retired to Israel, where he continued to outrage the Orthodox with his openly modern and sociological and scientific views on religion. Along the way, he founded a fourth Movement in American Judaism, Reconstructionism.Beyond being Jewish, and learned (and having entries in the ""Oxford Dictionary of World Religions""), they don't seem to have all that much in common. Kaplan's somewhat surprising decision to translate Luzzatto's book, undertaken when he was formulating a revolutionary theory of Jewish history, brought them together.Joseph Dan tells Luzzatto's story, briefly but clearly, near the end of his ""Jewish Mysticism and Jewish Ethics"" (1986: Second Revised edition, 1996), a short, stimulating book. He thinks the situation an extreme case of the more typical bifurcation of consensus legal-ethical and controversial theological positions in some types of traditional Jewish writings, although not the most extreme. Dan, in earlier chapters of the thin volume, traced the precedents of mystics choosing to write for the public by addressing human behavior, and not specific legal and ritual issues, and being accepted within the broad discourse of normative Judaism, so his view is pretty convincing.It should be pointed out that ""Kabbalah"" just means ""[what is] received,"" and there has been a long struggle over whether the *mystical* Kabbalah, or any version of it, was really a Secret Tradition, a new private revelation (also something ""received""), or just a human innovation. For those who accepted it, Kabbalah was usually considered something reserved for a qualified spiritual elite.There is also a short, and more sophisticated, discussion of Luzzatto's intellectual background, and historical importance as a popularizer, by Dan's mentor, Gershom Scholem, in ""On The Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah."" Despite the ""Basic"" in the title, the collected studies in the volume are full of technical discussions of the histories of ideas, and clearly meant for relatively advanced students! (""Basic"" clearly means ""Fundamental,"" not ""Elementary,"" here -- translation of the titles of the German and Hebrew editions into English left an ambiguity.)Luzzatto's short book ""The Path of the Upright: Mesillat Yesharim,"" leading the reader step by step through degrees of Holiness, beginning with basic Jewish religious practices, culminates in what is recognizably, but not too explicitly, a form of mystical experience. The title evokes the Biblical Patriarchs, ""Yashar"" (in English Bibles, usually Jashar) being a word regarded as their special epithet in glosses on Biblical references to a mysterious ""Book of Yashar"" (Sefer Ha-Yashar, Joshua 10:13 and 2 Samuel 1:18). But it is also intriguingly non-specific. Perhaps partly because the title implicitly attributed such deep significance to the communal norms (you too can emulate Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob!), the book soon attracted favorable attention. It actually became preferred, even required, reading, in the Rabbinic schools of nineteenth-century Lithuania, which were very much in favor of the life of conscious, thought-out, obedience to Heaven, and, although not opposed to mysticism, were very much set against its public discussion.And not just opposed to publicity for the usual ""Secret Teachings of the Wise"" reasons. Like Luzzatto's original opponents, they were living in the wake of the openly mystical Sabbatean (""False Messiah"") movement of the seventeenth century, and its offspring of antinomian heresies, and had the popularized mystical Hasidic movement subverting their authority as well.""Path of the Upright"" was also promoted as popular reading matter by the Mussar (""Discipline"") movement of moral/spiritual reformers in Eastern Europe, which gave it a broader popularity in Jewish communities as an ""improving"" work for a wide public -- or at least for men literate in Hebrew, an ability far more widespread than Talmudic erudition.So it is only an addition to the paradoxes that the present English translation (generally considered the best; there are several competing versions) was the work of the likewise controversial, but very non-mystical, Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan. Originally published by the Jewish Publication Society of America in 1936 (and reprinted by them in 1966) as ""A Critical Edition provided with a translation and notes,"" it offered the then (and apparently still) standard Hebrew text facing the translation. It was reprinted again in 1995 by Jason Aronson, Inc., and that edition may be the most readily available. I have seen it listed with the Hebrew and English in different orders in the title, and sometimes as by Kaplan alone.(The dust jacket of the Aronson edition gives Luzzatto's first name as Moshe, a better transliteration, but not the one used inside. Some other translations are in fact listed as by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, and there are other transliterations. At least one version announces its allegiance to the Eastern European view of the book by giving the title in Ashkenazic pronunciation, as ""Mesillas."" The Italian-born author probably would have found that a little odd.)Kaplan was a committed rationalist, an admirer of American Pragmatists (among others) as well as a Talmudic scholar. He is best known as the founder of the modernizing Reconstructionist movement (to re-order Jewish life and thought in America; not to be confused with Christian Reconstructionists, who appear to favor re-ordering American life on theocratic lines). Unlike many of the author's original opponents, he was entirely out of sympathy with Luzzatto's other work in principle, not just worried about suspicious trends and tendencies! Kaplan was not even a speculative theologian: his 1937 book on ""The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion"" was largely about the spiritual and moral values of the Jewish religious calendar, and how its symbolic system and liturgy can be understood in the scientific modern world. (It appeared the year after his translation of Luzzatto.)Still, ""Mesillat Yesharim"" came to him with the seal of approval of both the Wilno (or Vilna, or Vilnius) Talmudic seminaries and the highly respected Mussar teachers, and he decided to offer it to Jews in the English-speaking world as an important part of their heritage. And Luzzatto's approach to finding new and deeper meanings in tradition-prescribed actions was recognizably compatible with his own program of re-interpreting, instead of abandoning, such practices. (His critique of early twentieth-century Reform Judaism on this issue contributed to a major re-evaluation of the place of observance and ritual within that movement.)Kaplan's introduction slights Luzzatto's Kabbalistic interests, which, given that he was working before Scholem had laid out a recognizable history of the subject, might have been fortunate. (The less said, the fewer chances to be wrong.) But Kaplan does carefully identify in running notes the exoteric (Biblical and Rabbinic) sources, which would have been instantly recognizable to Luzzatto's expected readers. Luzzatto seems to have avoided obvious references to esoteric teachings or to Halachic (legal) codes, or theological controversies, and Kaplan did not dig out any subtle ones. (Unfortunately, there is no index of the citations; I worked out a partial one for my own purposes, and found that they were heavily weighted to well-known texts.) Although Kaplan taught Homiletics, the art of giving sermons, he scrupulously refrained from imposing his exposition on Luzzatto.A bit dry as a translation of a much-loved work; but careful, precise, and, despite the avoidance of mystical language as such, it doesn't hide what Luzzatto is talking about in the later stages. The pursuit of Holiness begins in the experience of the material and bodily, and forms a series of steps, which Luzzatto sets forth, through increasing degrees of awareness.Some Christianity-based terms like ""the Spiritual Life"" don't really translate well into traditional Jewish thought, at least on the conceptual level, because they reflect distinctions (oppositions of sacred and secular, and, sometimes, of body and soul, for example) that don't quite fit. Luzzatto's short book seems to show that the type of experience doesn't need a fixed name.If you came to this book looking for information on Kaplan and his views, there is a large literature which will be far, far more helpful. A short, and obviously favorable, introduction is Rebecca T. Alpert and Jacob J. Staub, ""Exploring Judaism: A Reconstructionist Approach."" Jack J. Cohn's book in Hebrew comparing Kaplan and a revered Orthodox leader, Rav Kook, has been translated as ""Guides for an Age of Confusion: Studies in the Thinking of Avraham Y. Kook and Mordecai M. Kaplan."" The former requires little knowledge of Judaism, the latter assumes a serious interest and a fair amount of background. Kaplan's own magnum opus was ""Judaism as a Civilization: Toward a Reconstruction of American Jewish Life,"" originally published in 1934; most of his later works popularized, expanded, or applied his views there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23DMRDJD0RHH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=082760856X#wasThisHelpful","R23DMRDJD0RHH8","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm posting this review of ""The History of Messianic Speculation in Israel: From the First Through the Seventeenth Centuries"" (1929) with the Kessinger reprint edition because it is the only in-print version at the time of writing this. The Beacon Press paperback ""second edition"" of 1959 differs mainly (I think entirely) in the addition of a new Preface. Used copies of the paperback, which was reprinted several times, are frequently available.The book is not about detailed eschatological speculation in Jewish lore -- for that, see Raphael Patai's excellent anthology, ""The Messiah Texts."" Nor is it about philosophical and ideological contexts of Messianic doctrines, on which see the first half of Gershom Scholem's (controversial) ""The Messianic Idea in Judaism and Other Essays on Jewish Spirituality.""The speculation in the title refers to ""Calculating the End,"" the often-prohibited, but frequently indulged-in, attempts to determine the time (often in the near future) at which the Messiah could be expected. One is tempted to say that this practice was popular only in times of crisis; but crises were a recurrent feature of Jewish life -- and not only Jewish life -- over any considerable span of time and space. So there is a great deal of temporal continuity, even though the focus changes from community to community with circumstances.Silver does not examine closely the interpretation of current events in the light of Biblical passages or Rabbinic doctrine, but rather more abstract, textually based, attempts, based on numerology and concepts of significant times. This is not the most entertaining of books, although those interested in the application of mathematics to prophecy -- a pre-occupation of, among others, Isaac Newton -- may find it interesting to compare the Jewish version to Christian predictions of the End of Days.For this is, of course, a Jewish Messiah that is anticipated; and the expectations of his nature and role differ markedly from the Christian doctrines. In some views, he is a mighty warlord, in others a just judge, and in still others simply an anointed (the meaning of Mashiach) ruler, an outward sign of Israel's redemption from servitude to ""the nations"" of the present world.Those who discouraged both general eschatological and specifically chronological speculations apparently sometimes agreed with the teaching that ""there are two times at which to expect the Messiah -- when the world cannot go on without him, and when there is no need of him at all.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RL0U9DJPGC7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1162584270#wasThisHelpful","R3RL0U9DJPGC7I","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""For the Sake of Heaven: A Chronicle"" is a portrayal of the Hasidic (Pietist) Jewish communities in Eastern Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by the philosopher Martin Buber (1878-1965); in this case an historical novel, instead of Buber's better-known retellings of stories by and about Hasidic leaders.It deals with the material and spiritual turmoil of the Napoleonic Wars, and the eschatological expectations unleashed by the upheaval. The assumption that Buber's treatment of the period was influenced by contemporary events can hardly be avoided. The Hebrew text was published in 1943, and the German version, with the explicitly apocalyptic title of ""Gog und Magog,"" in 1949.The English title, on the other hand, apparently derives from the early Rabbinic teaching that ""controversies for the sake of Heaven"" (literally, ""for the name of Heaven"") will endure, whereas other disputes (""not for the name of Heaven"") will come to nothing. (See the tractate Pirkei Avot, or ""Sayings of the Fathers,"" Part 5, section 20, and commentaries; the short work is found in many Jewish Prayer Books.)The reader unfamiliar with Jewish culture in Central and Eastern Europe would be well-advised to read up on the subject before trying to get into the novel, which is by no means self-explanatory. Relevant articles in one of the two editions of ""Encyclopedia Judaica"" and the old (early twentieth-century) ""Jewish Encyclopedia"" are probably a good start; the former contains guides to the vast bibliography. Readers may also want to take into account that Buber's portrayal of Hasidism, despite its literary brilliance, has come under severe criticism from scholars who find it far too romanticized, and far less tradition-minded than the real thing. Buber's presentations are definitely influenced by his own philosophy; which itself was shaped by encounters with Hasidic communities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.(Note that I have avoided commenting on ""For the Sake of Heaven"" as a work of fiction: It has been a couple of decades since I last read it, and I don't have a copy available to consult. I have deliberately restricted my observations mainly to information about the book which is not available on the product page, or in the earlier review.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5QOFFKMB0NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YGP9OS#wasThisHelpful","R3K5QOFFKMB0NK","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Tros of Samothrace"" is a massive historical novel, which, together with two sequels, ""Queen Cleopatra"" and ""The Purple Pirate,"" was awkwardly handled by their hardcover publishers, and treated even worse in certain paperback editions (which will be ignored here; the curious may now try the Wikipedia article on ""Tros""). This new Kindle edition of the *complete* series is more than welcome. It neatly clears away a lot of the confusion generated by some publishers' decisions on how to handle the material. (On the other hand, it, taken together with the same publisher's ""Tros of Samothrace"" -- alone -- it produces some confusion of its own. Not to mention a four-volume incarnation of the ""Tros"" novel itself.....)The ""mystifications"" of some mass-market paperback incarnations, reflected in the Kindle incarnations, were unintentional, but perhaps ironically appropriate, given the author's dubious career in British India and Africa, and also his later occult interests. ""Mr. Talbot Mundy"" has been the subject of two biographies in recent decades, with more still being uncovered about his real past. A good overview is provided on-line in ""Talbot Mundy: Master of Mystical Adventure,"" by R. T. Gault. (Duane Spurlock has re-posted Gault's bibliographic information, and in several cases I have deferred to their dates, rather than sticking with what I had found in older reference works. ""Materials Toward a Bibliography of the Works of Talbot Mundy"" by Bradford M. Day is available from Project Gutenberg; very good, but not easy to use in its plain-text form.)""Tros"" and some of Mundy's other stories also have striking resemblances to later fantasy and science fiction adventure stories, not surprising given that Robert E. Howard was among Mundy's original readers, and that more recent fans included Marion Zimmer Bradley, who openly acknowledged his direct influence on one of her ""Darkover"" novels.The rather mysterious Talbot Mundy (William Lancaster Gribbon 1879-1940), whose yarns about his own (often shady) past may have been the prototype for much of his adventure fiction, seems to have written ""Tros of Samothrace"" almost as a detour. He had been asked by the publisher Bobbs-Merrill to write a novel about Cleopatra. It seemed to them like a sure-fire bestseller, something to out-do the sales of his popular ""King -- of the Khyber Rifles,"" which they had published in 1916. It would, after all, be on a more sensational topic than his Kipling-esque tales of British soldiers keeping stiff upper lips in India and Afghanistan. (Mundy, who had legally changed his name to his most popular pseudonym while becoming a U.S. citizen in 1916, seems to have either exaggerated the time he spent in India, or else returned there under other names when he was hiding from the law, unhappy wives, etc. But he wrote about it more frequently than Africa, where he had spent considerable time; of course, he had also *served* time there....)Mundy eventually got around to a Cleopatra novel for Bobbs-Merrill, but not before spinning out the adventures, mostly during Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain, of a supposed minor character in the planned novel. The resulting story of ""Tros of Samothrace"" ran for a year (Feb. 1925-Feb. 1926) in the then highly-regarded fiction magazine ""Adventure.""It was broken into seven separately titled stories, published in nine installments, which gave the magazine a chance to back out, and probably avoided protests from readers about a serial that never seemed to end, but Mundy seems to have had the greater commercial potential of a novel in mind. They consisted of: #1 ""Tros of Samothrace"" (Feb. 10, 1925); #2 ""The Enemy of Rome"" (April 10); #3 ""Prisoners of War"" (June 10); #4 ""Hostages to Luck: (Aug. 20); #5 ""Admiral of Caesar's Fleet"" (Oct. 10); #6 ""The Dancing Girl of Gades"" (Dec. 10); and, as #7, #8, and #9 the three-part ""Messenger of Destiny"" (Feb. 10, 20, and 28, 1926)To my mind, ""Tros"" is one of the great early twentieth century adventure novels; and the hints of occult powers and ""secret wisdom"" add flavor without getting in the way. (Mundy had just then become active in a splinter branch of the Theosophical Society; the same influences are evident in his ""Om: The Secret of Ahbor Valley,"" written the previous year, and much of his later fiction hovers on the edge of fantasy.)The editor of ""Adventure"" (Arthur Sullivan Hoffmann) seems to have realized that almost anyone who had struggled in school with Caesar's ""Commentaries"" (""The Gallic Wars"") was sure to smile at the idea of the story as seen from the other side -- or, rather, from a third side. (One Caesar somehow forgot to mention in his dispatches home!) And in those days, having struggled with Caesar was a pretty common experience for middle-class readers, so the subject, if not quite as glamorous as the Serpent of the Nile, was hardly obscure.Bobbs-Merrill didn't agree, or was put off by the ensuing controversy over Mundy's portrait of Caesar as a budding dictator cultivating his image at the expense of the ""barbarians.""According to Mundy, Initiates from the Mysteries of Samothrace ran afoul of Caesar while on a mission to their fellow-mystics in Gaul from their Aegean island sanctuary, and were blackmailed into spying on the mysterious Land of Britain. (A good classical dictionary would confirm the existence of the island of Samothrace and its Mysteries; although hardly Mundy's Theosophical exposition of its beliefs, and wide-ranging connections to other ""mystical orders."")But was even the wily and ruthless Caesar a match for a man like Tros, who scrupulously honored his word? Honored it precisely and literally, that is, without regard for what Caesar, or anyone else, might have intended when he exacted the promise by threatening to kill his prisoners, including Tros' father, Perseus....The story of Tros and his personal war with Julius Caesar was later extended in another two substantial, but shorter, novels. ""Queen Cleopatra"" had no magazine publication, but appeared (at last!) directly from Bobbs-Merrill in 1929 (426 pages). Instead of the Antony and Cleopatra story, it deals in part with her escape from Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar, an obscure episode in which it turns out Tros (of course) had a role. Mundy and Bobbs-Merrill later permanently parted ways (after fifteen years), with the ""Tros"" stories and the delayed Cleopatra novel apparently among the simmering issues.His new publisher, Century, soon merged with D. Appleton, further complicating the bibliographic record. ""Tros of Samothrace"" finally appeared in a revised form from by D. Appleton-Century, with a British edition from Hutchinson, in 1934. ""The Purple Pirate,"" a sequel to ""Tros"" and ""Queen Cleopatra"" then appeared as four stories in ""Adventure"" and immediately thereafter as a book from Appleton-Century (367 pages), also with a British edition, all in 1935.The complete ""Tros"" alone ran to a whopping 949 pages (960 in the British printing), even without the sequels. It was a work of historical fiction more on the scale of ""War and Peace"" than anything Bobbs-Merrill had planned, or, with ""Gone With the Wind"" still in the future (1936), probably considered practical in the American market. ""Tros,"" didn't become a blockbuster bestseller, but it seems to have sold well enough for Appleton-Century to take on one of the sequels.And the book was fondly remembered by those who read it. Who could forget a character who combined mysticism and heroics, nobility and practicality, exactly as appropriate? So he wouldn't kill a man, but didn't feel it was his responsibility to find out if he could swim before tossing him overboard... And a more than slightly unlikely, but attractive, supporting cast of friendly Theosophical Druids, Victorian-style Ancient Britons (""By Lud of Lunden!""), and proto-Vikings? Or even the rather Hinduized Pythagoreanism that seems to underlie all the talk of Secret Wisdom? By this time, too, Mundy's mostly hostile portrait of Caesar could be seen as a foreshadowing of Fascism.""Tros"" was revived in complete hardcover editions by the science fiction and fantasy publisher Gnome Press in 1958 (along with ""The Purple Pirate""), and, most recently by Buccaneer Books in 1995. The trade paperback edition of ""Tros"" from Black Mask was issued in 2005, and was more than welcome. (There was another hardcover -- I think -- reprinting of ""The Purple Pirate."" from Amereon, in 1991.)There was also a mass-market paperback version of the whole saga, in six volumes, published in the later 1960s (see below for details), and for me they came at just the right time -- I was reading Caesar in Latin, and was amused when Tros gave him a concise, accurate, and completely misleading, report on his adventures in Britain, in exactly Caesar's own compressed style. And was praised for it.Oh yes -- don't be confused about Mundy's novel ""Caesar Dies."" It is an unrelated story about the Emperor Commodus, not the Dictator Julius, and Tros isn't involved. (Unless I failed to notice his reincarnation, of course.)""The Complete Tros of Samothrace"" bundles together all of this material (except, of course, ""Caesar Dies""). If you have a Kindle, or a Kindle app on your PC or Mac (etc., etc.), and think this sounds interesting, treat yourself.Those are the main points. For those who might go looking for print copies, however, I've included some essential bibliographic information in my review of the Black Mask edition of ""Tros."". There are some unpleasant surprises awaiting the unwary. Unfortunately, print copies, especially of ""Tros,"" have to be sorted out from among the fractionalized paperback reprints. For the mass-market paperback editions present a much more complicated picture. (One which also impinges on one of the Kindle editions.) There are a couple of points which may be relevant in this context, however.Perhaps vindicating Bobbs-Merrill's original proposal, ""Queen Cleopatra"" appeared from Ace in 1962, with a cover Gault describes as ""obviously redrawn from a publicity still of Elizabeth Taylor."" Beyond the desire to cash in on the publicity, there is no special connection between the book and the motion picture (ultimately released in 1963), let alone the associated scandals; just the use of some of the same historical personages. (Lud, and perhaps fear of lawsuits, be thanked, Burton wasn't added to the cover.)In 1967, Avon Books put ""Tros of Samothrace"" into paperback in four volumes, as ""Tros: The First Book of Tros of Samothrace"" (= #1-2); ""Helma: The Second Book..."" (= #3-4); ""Liafail: The Third Book..."" (#5-6); and ""Helene: The Fourth Book..."" (#7-9). All of them had lovely covers by Douglas Rosa. (""Helma"" and ""Helene"" are two of the women in Tros' life. ""Liafail,"" the Irish ""Stone of Destiny,"" is here the name of a ship. Not the most appropriate name, one would think, besides being from the wrong branch of the Celtic languages, but philology wasn't Mundy's strong point.)The four volumes were followed by Avon in 1969 with ""Queen Cleopatra"" and in 1970 with ""The Purple Pirate,"" identified as ""Tros of Samothrace #5"" and ""...#6,"" respectively, on the uncredited covers (which look to me and others like the work of Jeff Jones, but seem to be attributed by some to Frank Frazetta.)Avon also issued some of Mundy's occult / espionage / adventure stories set in modern India and Tibet, including ""Om,"" at about the same time -- another tangle of titles we won't get into.There is also a recent complete edition of the ""Tros"" series, published in 2009 in the UK and United States US: Leonaur Books, paperback & hardback as 6 books, corresponding to the Avon divisions, which were Mundy's own: Wolves of the Tiber; Dragons of the North; Serpent of the Waves; City of the Eagles; Queen Cleopatra; Purple Pirate. (I don't know where the NEW titles came from, but they are excellent.) These titles are listed as alternates to the Avon titles in the Amazon description of the Pulptastic ""Complete Tros,"" but that edition actually uses the Avon titles to mark ""Books"" of ""Tros."" This despite the fact that Pulptastic also issued separate Kindle editions of each of these titles!Interestingly It is the Avon editions, with their one-name titles, which are referenced in the four divisions of the Kindle ""Tros"" in the Table of Contents of both the singleton amd ""The Complete ... Series"" versions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E5T2GKBCJPGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSHEZGY#wasThisHelpful","R1E5T2GKBCJPGI","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, ""Chapman's Homer"" is probably not a book for those who have not read Homer before. In fact, it is probably not a book for those unfamiliar with Shakespeare's plays; or, perhaps better, Spenser's Elizabethan Epic, ""The Faerie Queene"". These will introduce one to the high poetic language of the era; and Spenser to the finding of moral and political significations in events and characters.It is likely to be fascinating to anyone who is interested in the ""reception"" of Homer over the centuries, and the different guises translators have given him. They will probably welcome this complete, neatly printed, digital edition.At a rough guess, something like 95% of the people who recognize the term ""Chapman's Homer"" at all will do so in association with Keats' 1816 sonnet, ""On first looking into Chapman's Homer."" Some large proportion of them probably would, if asked, further associate the translation with the Romantic Movement. Others, who perhaps have a better memory for such things, will recall that belongs to the seventeenth century, specifically the early Jacobean period, not long after the death of Elizabeth I.It was in fact the work of the sometime-playwright George Chapman (1560-1634), who was a fairly successful dramatist in a time when William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson were busy producing works of lasting interest. Chapman eventually left the theater, which was not as lucrative for him as for Shakespeare (who was also a partner in his own theater company, and one of its actors).He became, among other things, a translator from Greek, publishing what are regarded as the first-ever English versions of ""The Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey"" in installments from 1611-1615.It was almost exactly 200 years later that Keats, who certainly would have known the eighteenth-century Alexander Pope version in ""heroic couplets,"" seems to have stumbled across copies of Chapman. As he wrote ""Oft of one wide expanse, had I been told / That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne: / Yet did I never breathe its pure serene / Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold"".Anyone who expects from such praise that Chapman's translations are a long-lost treasure of English literature are probably going to be disappointed. They are extremely interesting, and lack the veneer of classicism and dignity applied by Pope (1715, 1725), and others. However, some of the vocabulary is simply obsolete (this edition includes a glossary, which helps, although it is not properly linked to the text). The meter, to the surprise of many (I would think) is not iambic pentameter, since Milton an accepted ""epic meter"" for English. This is perhaps just as well, since Chapman used rhymed couplets, and would have found himself in the same strait-jacket as so many English Augustans (leaving aside, for the moment, Dryden and Pope, who seemed to find it roomy enough).No, Chapman used the well-established ""fourteener,"" in rhyming couplets; an old narrative meter (it had been used in the sixteenth-century Scots English translation of the ""Aeneid"" by Gavin Douglas) which eventually fell out of favor for serious verse. The ""fourteener"" never completed faded away; the Victorian poet (and fantasy novelist, and interior designer, and fine printer, and business-man and socialist, etc.) William Morris, used it for, among other things, his epic poem ""Sigurd the Volsung,"" and his own translation of the ""Aeneid.""Still, being unfamiliar to many potential readers, it is a meter which almost demands initial reading aloud, to find the rhythm, and with it the syntax of many lines. The fourteen (sometimes fifteen) syllables tend to produce a caesura (pause) about half-way through the line (seven-seven, eight-six, six-eight).This isn't a great substitute for the Homeric hexameter, but it does allow a more fluid style than some of the alternatives.What Keats seemed to have missed in his enthusiasm is that Chapman had ""bought"" the general Renaissance belief that Homer was a subtle allegorist, not just a story-teller. However, Renaissance allegories sometimes seem to be about anything the text suggests; unlike the Augustan reading of the ""Odyssey"" as a series of moral exempla, with the wily Ulysses (their preferred form) somehow turning into a (more) priggish version of Aeneas.On the whole, the translation can be read without wading into the ""deeper meanings."" For those looking for Chapman's ""key"" to the ""real"" Homer, it has been the subject of modern studies, including ""Homeric Renaissance: The Odyssey of George Chapman,"" by George de Forest Lord (1956). Copies are sometimes available through Amazon, and elsewhere.For those who are curious about where Chapman belongs (other than at the beginning) in the long history of Homer translations in English (and don't mind having just his ""Iliad"" in the package) can try starting with the Delphi Ancient Classics Kindle omnibus, ""Complete Works of Homer"" (Illustrated). This includes, with a great deal more, Greek texts, and the Alexander Pope translation mentioned above.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YVHXV3OXMGVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008593PM8#wasThisHelpful","R1YVHXV3OXMGVW","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This intriguing little volume, first published in 1921 (and at this writing available from Amazon in three paperback editions as well as the present, Gutenberg Project-based Kindle edition) contains a set of stories in prose, in some cases with included verses, written in later medieval Iceland, and a corresponding set of verse renditions of the same story material, from, variously, Iceland itself, the Faroe and Shetland Islands, and Denmark. Nora Kershaw, the translator, is also known as Nora K. Chadwick, having married another scholar, H.M. Chadwick, somewhat later (1922) in her long (d. 1972) career -- see Wikipedia for a short biographical sketch.Some of the the tales have clear connections to late antiquity, when Goths and Huns chased each other around Europe: hence the title of ""Stories and Ballads of the *Far* Past."" The versions of the stories are later medieval, at the earliest. Any close knowledge of the Migration Age/Fall of the Roman Empire could be an  unwanted distraction, however. The storytellers don't seem to have known any of that history, and probably wouldn't have cared if they did. (Such knowledge wasn't completely unavailable --- Chaucer knew that, whatever Norse or Germans told about Atli or Etzel, the real Attila died ""bleeding at the nose"" while drunk.)The prose works partake of the realism of style and incident characteristic of the major Icelandic sagas, such as the great ""Njal's Saga,"" but the narratives are clearly intended to be entertainments, and extravagant ones at that, with a few ""moral lessons"" sneaking their way in as plot-points. (In one, a character stops to remark that he is making a point of violating some good advice....)Some of the stories had been translated before, and some would be again.There are two short tales (the term in ""Thattr""), ""The Thattr of Nornagest"" and ""The Thattr of Srli."" The former recounts, with a slightly comic edge, stories of legendary heroes, their narrator being a very long-lived survivor who wants to give testimony to the pagan past before dying as a Christian. It is funnier if you know the stories before-hand, but still funny if you don't.""The Thattr of Srli"" is a romanticized Icelandic version of parts of a story known from other sources, notably the German ""Kudrun"" epic. The story of how Odin contrived an ""Everlasting Battle"" on earth (instead of in Valhalla) is joined to some very old character-names from the pre-Viking Age Baltic -- J.R.R. Tolkien was interested in some of the other variants. William Morris and Eirikur Magnussson had already translated the tale as a supplement to their ""Three Northern Love Stories.""""The Saga of Hromund Greipsson"" is supposed to be about a known continental ancestor of an Icelandic family, but the story is filled with magicians, spells, and curses, and the titular hero is a strong-man whose main virtue seems to be a capacity for violence. Not that he is always unjustified -- far from it -- but he escapes being viewed as a thug largely by the lightheartedness of the sometimes over-the-top telling.The centerpiece is a grand heroic saga, based on traditions from the Germanic Migration Age, ""The Saga of Hervr and Heithrek,"" although these follow, rather than precede, adventures clearly inspired by the Viking Age. ""The Waking of Angantyr,"" in which one of the heroines calls on her dead father and uncles to deliver to her a (cursed) heirloom sword has been known in English since the eighteenth century. This episode, and the cursed sword itself, Tyrfing, later inspired Poul Anderson's superb fantasy novel ""The Broken Sword,""Another poem from the saga which has attracted attention from scholars has been ""The Battle of the Goths and Huns,"" which includes names which, phonologically, have to go back to when the Goths were living in the shadow of the Carpathian mountains. The names are about the limit of the stories historicity, though. For example, the sword-name ""Tyrfing,"" whatever its actual etymology, has been hopelessly confused with ""Tervingi,"" a name for a division of the Gothic ""nation."" ""Battle of the Goths and Huns"" also appears, facing the Old Norse text, in Nora Kershaw's ""Anglo-Saxon and Norse Poems"" (also 1922). There are Kindle and print editions, sometimes attributed to Nora Kershaw Chadwick, and at least once listed as ""anonymous."" A pdf version is available from the Library of Congress's Internet Archive site.English translations of the poems in the saga can also be found, with much else, in Lee M. Hollander's ""Old Norse Poems"" (1936), currently available as a Kindle book.An edition and translation of the saga, from a somewhat different textual base, was published in 1960 as ""The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise,"" the work of Christopher Tolkien. The complicated manuscript bases of what is often known as ""Hervarar saga"" caused both translators to include appendices with variant prose passages, and extra verses. Christopher Tolkien's rendering is now available, free, as a pdf through the Web Publications page of the Viking Society for Northern Research, so comparing the two translations is now easy (instead of being dependent on a library with extensive holdings). For the dedicated (or very curious) student, The Viking Society also offers ""Hervarar saga ok Heireks,"" ed. G. Turville-Petre (1956). It uses the same base text as Chadwick's translation, but includes English-language Notes, Glossary, and Index of Names.The verse section of ""Stories and Ballads"" opens with an Icelandic rhymed verse recounting of some of ""Hromund Greipson,"" followed by ""The Faroese Ballad of Nornagest."" The remaining ballads mainly derive from the ""Hervor and Heidrek"" traditions: the Faroese ""Ballad of Hjalmer and Angantyr"" and the Danish ""Ballad of Angelfyr and Helmer,"" and the Faroese ""Ballad of Arngrim's Sons,"" followed by ""The Faroese Riddle Ballad."" ""The Faroese Ballad of Hildina,"" the final piece is the book, is related to the ""Thattr of Srli."" I find these pieces, at least in Chadwick's translations, to be most interesting as examples of popular tradition re-working older material, but some may find them just as entertaining as the prose works, and possibly more entertaining.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CV9IGKLXI91N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TPKWW8#wasThisHelpful","R2CV9IGKLXI91N","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have given this edition a two-star rating based a little on the confusing table of contents -- which suggests a lack of attention throughout -- and the lack of notice that this is NOT a new (2013) translation, but a rather old one: and also on the confusing choice of title-- on this factor, see near the end of the review for competing editions. (I prefer to review only editions I've read, but I've been familiar with the translation used here since the late 1960s, have digital copies, and feel no urgent need to acquire a print edition.)Snorri Sturluson, the author, (1179-1241) was an Icelandic poet and politician, whose entanglement in Norway's internal politics, and the king's desire to acquire Iceland, was the main cause of his murder. He is best known, however, for two books attributed to him on period authority. One is known as ""Heimskringla,"" and is a compilation of biographies of the Kings of Norway, going back to their ancestors in mythological and legendary times, and stopping short safely before his own time.The other is the present book, ""Edda,"" a series of treatises, variously amusing or tedious, on traditional Icelandic high-class poetry. A large part of it is given over to stories of the ancient gods and heroes, whose characteristics and careers were the point of departure for Iceland's high-class poets, the Skalds. (There were once skalds from mainland Scandinavia, but the complex art seems to have died out there following Christianization, while it hung on in deeply conservative Iceland, becoming its main ""invisible export"".)This latter is the book with which we are now concerned.The work is also known, variously, as ""Snorri's Edda,"" ""Snorri Sturluson's Edda,"" ""The Younger Edda,"" and ""The Prose Edda."" These names were introduced to distinguish it from a collection of mythological and heroic poetry which early modern scholars, for no solid reason, dubbed ""Saemund's Edda,"" after a mistaken attribution; it is now referred to as the ""Poetic"" or ""Elder Edda.""(Some scholars also have attributed to Snorri a third work, ""The Saga of Egil Skallagrimson,"" a brilliant piece of work. I am one of those who remain unconvinced, but would like it to be true.)Rasmus B. Anderson (1846-1936), the translator, was a pioneer in introducing Scandinavian culture to English-speaking Americans -- as distinguished from their British counterparts. He was a moving force behind the Norraena Society, with its Norraena Library (1905-1907), the full fifteen-volume set of which is said to have been the largest collection of medieval Scandinavian literature (and some studies) published outside Scandinavia up to that time. It was made up primarily of nineteenth-centuries translations. Many large libraries contain more or less complete sets; at one time or another I have read at least eight of the volumes, and substantially more in their older editions. (There is a handy summary in Wikipedia's article on the Norraena Society, to which I direct the curious; it includes information on what is sometimes considered the sixteenth volume, which I have never seen.)The Norraena Library did not include Anderson's own 1880 translation of ""The Younger Edda"" (this choice of title), a reprint of which we are offered in this book (again, despite the present edition's date of 2013). It is not the worst of the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century out-of-copyright translations which have been re-issued, in print or digital format, over the last several years. Like most of them, it offers only the original Preface, the ""Fooling of Gylfe"" (the source of many of the best-known stories of Norse mythology), and selections from the ""Poetic Diction"" (Skaldskaparmal), omitting the many, many lists of synonyms and figures of speech which every young poet should know. An additional section (Hattatal), in which Snorri offers a hundred-verse praise-poem, illustrating the meters and devices of the poetry, with commentary, was, as usual, NOT included.For those who really want to read it, there is a free Kindle version, taken from a Project Gutenberg edition. However, there are other options, which some will probably find more rewarding.The most nearly complete of the older translations, that by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur, includes the first two parts, with manuscript variations noted, plus the whole Skaldskaparmal. It is currently being offered, in an exact reprint of its 1916 American-Scandinavian Foundation edition, in both digital and print forms, by Dover Books. If you want a print or Kindle copy, of one of the older translations, this would be my suggestion. If you don't mind reading pdfs, the Library of Congress hosts the Internet Archive (archive.org), which includes digital versions of (I think) the translations of Rasmus Anderson, J.A. Blackwell, and George W. Dasent (in an English which some find annoying, but others, like me, enjoy.)More recent translations are: a somewhat aging volume by Jean. I. Young, ""The Prose Edda: Tales from Norse Mythology,"" currently in print from the University of California Press (which has kept it alive for decades), which also excludes most of Skaldskaparmal; a similarly-restricted Penguin Classics translation by Jesse Byock (my personal favorite in terms of style; available in both print and Kindle editions), ALSO titled ""The Prose Edda: Norse Mythology""; and the only really complete English version, by Anthony Faulkes, currently in print under the Everyman imprint, as just Edda.Faulkes also edited all four parts of the Old Icelandic text (Preface, ""Deluding of Gylfi,"" Skaldskaparmal, and Hattatal). These are presently available, along with some interesting articles, as pdf files, on the Web Publications page of the Viking Society for Northern Research (a UK organization). These are free, for private study; the editions are, obviously, primarily for those seriously interested in studying Old Icelandic, although I find some of the long lists in Skaldskaparmal to be quite fascinating in their original forms.[Addendum, March 2015: There is a good article by Jonas Wellendorf, which briefly examines the various versions of the Prose Edda in the main manuscripts, including their internal arrangement, and their differing additional materials, as ""Zoroaster, Saturn, and Othinn: The Loss of Language and the Rise of Idolatry."" A pdf can be obtained by searching Academia.edu for Wellendorf's page there, and downloading the file from the list of his publications. Wellendorf offers an ""ideological"" approach to passages often omitted as interpolations in modern editions of the Prose Edda. The article was originally published in ""The Performance of Christian and Pagan Storyworlds: Non-Canonical Chapters of the History of Nordic Medieval Legend,"" edited by Lars Boje Mortensen and Tuomas M.S. Lehtonen, with Alexandra Bergholm, Volume 3 of ""Medieval Identities: Socio-Cultural Spaces,"" Brepols Publishers, Turnhout, Belgium, 2013.]","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0K2ZGB4QKMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613824556#wasThisHelpful","R2W0K2ZGB4QKMY","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[August 31, 2015: Please note that this review has been included by Amazon's software in a group of reviews attached to a Kindle edition dated April 7, 2014, about a year *later* than the date of my review. In other words, Amazon has lumped together reviews for different editions. If I was still able to separately review the 2014 edition I would give it a full five stars, since it does include the original publication data, and appears to be properly organized, although judging from more recent comments navigation may be a problem.. (I'm posting this information *immediately* after finally noticing the confusion, and I have not taken the time to read the edition throughout.) Although the comments on the Kindle edition originally addressed are no longer necessarily relevant, the bulk of the review, regarding Brodeur's fine old translation, still expresses my views.]I've given the separate paperback and Kindle editions offered here a joint rating of three stars, because both of them seem to lack any indication to alert the prospective buyer that the translation of the ""Prose Edda"" was first published way back in 1916, by the American-Scandinavian Foundation (and not 2011, as one of the copyright notices suggests). That version is long out of print, but there is a free Google Book edition in a very reliable pdf, with the original special characters and formatting intact. Dover Books offers both a Kindle or print edition, either of which can be relied on (Dover also offers the 1923 two-volume Henry Adams Bellows translation of the ""Elder"" or ""Poetic"" Edda, also originally an American-Scandinavian Foundation publication.)If one wishes to read this thirteenth-century handbook of Norse myths and Icelandic poetic diction in the sort of prose favored for such translations a century, or more, ago, Brodeur, a fine scholar with a long career (his ""The Art of Beowulf"" was published in 1959), is probably your best choice, whether in print or digital format. He is less archaic or awkward than Rasmus Andersen, J.A. Blackwell, and George W. Dasent, his Victorian-era precursors, all of whom produced shorter translations. He also had the advantage of a somewhat more advanced state of knowledge of Old Icelandic.Brodeur included an interesting, somewhat dated, ""modern"" Introduction. From the Old Icelandic work he was translating he included the Preface (a rationalizing account of the origins of the Norse gods in deified mortals), the ""Deluding of Gylfi"" (in which most of the best-known myths are told to a disguised king by three mysterious figures, High, Just-As-High, and Third), and the ""Poetic Diction,"" or Skaldskaparmal, which starts off as a conversation between the sea-god and the god of poetry, includes some more myths and heroic legends, but eventually trails away in long lists of poetic synonyms and figures of speech. There was also a pretty reliable index.Like his predecessors, Brodeur omitted a fourth section, Hattatal, which is a long praise-poem by Snorri Sturluson (who is generally credited with most or all of the rest), complete with commentary on the meter and (you guessed it) the poetic diction. Most translators (including Jean Young and Jesse Byock in the twentieth century) either skip the third and fourth parts, or give only samples.I've reviewed the Young and the Byock versions, with more information on the Icelandic poet-scholar-politician credited with the work, and explained something about why it is called ""Snorri's Edda,"" ""The Younger Edda"" or ""The Prose Edda."" (Another Icelandic text, a compilation of poems in a different style, with bits of linking prose, came to be known as ""Poetic Edda,"" or the ""Elder Edda,"" or, in an abandoned attribution, ""Saemund's Edda."")This was, therefore, the most complete translation available in English until 1987, when Anthony Faulkes' full version appeared (full as in, complete with ""Hattatal"") available in paperback from Everyman since 1994. Faulkes rendering, as just ""Edda"" is currently in print, at a quite reasonable price, and serious students will want both it and Faulkes' edition of the Old Icelandic text. The latter is available, along with some articles, as a set of free pdfs, on the Web Publications page of the Viking Society (of the UK; formerly known as the Viking Club); and print copies can be ordered from the UK, through the Society Publications page, and (sometimes depending on other sellers) from or through Amazon.Faulkes' translation includes all of the material in Brodeur's edition, plus an additional chapter of ""Skaldskaparmal."" Faulkes' prose style does not seem to be universally admired by Amazon reviewers, but if you don't like it, you will probably like Brodeur's even less.[Addendum, February 2015: There is a good article by Jonas Wellendorf, which briefly examines the various versions of the Prose Edda in the main manuscripts, including their internal arrangement, and their differing additional materials, as ""Zoroaster, Saturn, and Othinn: The Loss of Language and the Rise of Idolatry."" A pdf can be obtained by searching Academia.edu for Wellendorf's page there, and downloading the file from the list of his publications. Wellendorf offers an ""ideological"" approach to passages often omitted as interpolations in modern editions of the Prose Edda.

"I've reviewed paperback editions of ""The Ship of Ishtar,"" and a digital edition. In those cases, I made an effort to talk about the author, and his place in early twentieth century (1918 and following) place in American science fiction and fantasy. In this instance, I will be giving more details about the book -- while avoiding ""spoilers,"" which makes it a little more difficult.Many readers of Merritt prefer one or another of his ""Lost Race"" novels, ""The Moon Pool,"" ""The Face in the Abyss,"" and ""Dwellers in the Mirage,"" and there are those would point to his much-revised ""The Metal Monster"" / ""The Metal Emperor,"" a sequel of sorts  to ""The Moon Pool"" with which the author himself never seems to have been satisfied.Some of us, however, prefer his alternate-world fantasy adventure, ""The Ship of Ishtar,"" originally serialized in 1924, and reprinted, somewhat abridged, as a novel in 1926 (Putnam). It was the Putnam text that was reprinted by Avon Books from the 1950s through the early 1980s, and is presumably the best-known incarnation. The full text was not restored until the present ""Borden Memorial Edition"" was published about six years after the author's sudden death in 1943, an edition which includes beautiful black-and-white illustrations by Virgil Finlay. This is not Merritt at his most exotic -- there is little place for his splendid strange terrains in a story set mostly at sea -- but it is Merritt at his most obviously romantic, in a setting in which Love and Death seem to be the most evident Powers.This edition was reprinted in hardcover in 1990, and in trade paperback in the ""Collier Nucleus Library"" of fantasy and science fiction in 1991. It later served as the basis of the Renaissance E Books edition, available for Kindle, (without illustrations, alas), and of the Paizo paperback, in two-column magazine format, and with additional Finlay illustrations from a magazine reprinting which he also illustrated.The 1924 text is in thirty-five chapters. The Putnam/Avon text, which is available on various places around the web, was re-ordered into thirty-one chapters, some re-titled to fit, and divided into six parts (possibly suggested by the six-part magazine serialization). Whole pages are missing, including the crucial opening scene, which introduces the protagonist, and his feelings of alienation after returning from service in the First World War. Since this backgrounds his doubts of his own sanity, its absence can only confuse the reader. (A modern parallel would be a recent veteran who is sure that bizarre events are a product of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, until proven otherwise.)The hero, John Kenton, is a well-off adventurer and archeologist (a prototype of Indiana Jones, only with a lot more money), who has financed excavations in Babylon, and receives from it a strange stone block with nearly-illegible warning inscriptions. Naturally, he can't leave well-enough alone when the stone cracks. Fortunately for Kenton, this is not an H.P. Lovecraft story, nor an episode of ""Angel,"" and he does not come to an immediate, unpleasant, end. (Which would have denied us the pleasure of a longish novel, adding another short story to Merritt's bibliography.)Instead, he discovers that the block contains a toy-like ship on a crystal sea, in precious and semi-precious metals and gem-stones. Merritt seems to have taken the basic idea from the ceremonial ""ships"" in which images of the gods of ancient Mesopotamia were carried in ritual processions. (How ship-like these actually were is an interesting question.) This ship, however, is the gateway to a world of endless day, and the deck of a ""real"" ship which has voyaged since the days of Sargon of Akkad. (Which modern research puts about 2300 B,C,, but Merritt, stretching an obsolete chronology, generously estimates at about 6000 B.C.)Sort of the ultimate ""Flying Dutchman"" story (cue the appropriate bits of Wagner); except that the heroine, Sharane, Priestess of Ishtar, is already on the ship. It looks like any redemption will be Kenton's job. And Kenton is not taking anything at face value; even when his antique sword is confidently identified as the weapon of Nabu, god of Wisdom. What does get through to him are the wounds and scars visible on his body during brief returns to his own time and place....As Kenton, and the reader, learn, the ship is the site of an unending duel between the goddess of love and war, Ishtar, and the death-god Nergal, a struggle waged through the persons of their priests, who temporarily incarnate their respective deities.  (Strictly speaking, the game is rigged; in a world without twilight or dawn, Ishtar, goddess of the Morning and Evening Star, is clearly at a disadvantage!) The crew is, from time to time, replenished by victims of spells, from either our world, or one or more similar, but not identical, worlds. (The latter being the only *good* explanation why Sigurd the Viking could have encountered a full-scale Egyptian temple, in good repair and with a full staff, in what historically was Islamic and Coptic Christian Egypt.....)Naturally, Kenton, being as American as Dorothy, can't leave well enough alone, and acts to resolve the situtation. The world of the Ship, however, is not as naturally benign as Oz. His actions lead to complications which fill the next couple of hundred pages. We find, among other things, that this world contains ships beside The Ship, and at least one island, ruled by the King of Two Deaths, and populated by a polyglot mixture from many times and places.Merritt's idea of ancient Mesopotamia is now quite out of date, but it amounts to an entertaining collision of early twentieth-century Assyriology with Herodotus on the one side, and H. Rider Haggard on the other.The mixture is unreliable, but fun. As long as no one takes it too seriously, no harm is done when, from time to time the obsolete nature of Merritt's sources shows through; notably in the use of the name ""Ninib"" for an important god, instead of the modern reading ""Ninurta."" Nin.IB is the representation of a name of uncertain pronunciation, showing that is used a glyph which might be read, or called, ""ib,"" but might be read otherwise.  (Cuneiform script was not an ideal medium, and some scribes seem to have rejoiced in being erudite and enigmatic, but modern scholars have worked out ways to indicate uncertainty.)  By the early 1920s, evidence was emerging that it should be read ""urta.""Likewise, Bel-Merodach (the Biblical form of Bel-Marduk) appears as the chief god in the days of Sargon of Akkad; but he was an essentially local god of Babylon, until as least the days of Hammurabi (ca. 1750 B.C.), when Marduk began his rise to the rank of ""Bel"" (Lord) in southern Mesopotamia -- a  position in which he was eventually challenged by the Assyrian's patron god, Assur, from the north. Likewise, Nabu (Kenton's patron/puppetmaster), his son, was a minor god in Sargon's day, and only in Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian times became a rival to his father Marduk in popularity, and was seen as co-regent of the universe....I mention these points because bits and pieces of ""information"" from Merritt novels -- most commonly, but not exclusively, ""The Moon Pool"" -- have been quoted for years as sober, if exciting, facts, and now circulate on the Web.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VHFL2ONG4A01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046QK0EK#wasThisHelpful","R2VHFL2ONG4A01","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some reason -- probably because the publisher is ""Edizioni Delirium"" and the unknown authors are given as ""Autori vari,"" both according to the copyright page, this small file is listed by Amazon as an ""Italian Edition"" of the text of Carl Orff's ""Carmina Burana"" (""A Scenic Cantata,"" to give it the commonly-used English version of its subtitle, here missing -- strictly speaking it is ""Profane"" -- that is, Un-Sacred or Secular -- ""Songs.""). On the other hand, some of the information is given in English: ""Anonymous"" on the cover, and ""Cover design"" on the copyright page.Perhaps someone, somewhere, was just confused by the fact that most of the text is what perhaps could be considered a very, very, very old-fashioned form of Italian. In fact, it consists of Orff's slightly erratic selection of medieval verses in Latin --  and some bits of Middle High German -- and has not the slightest trace of an Italian (or any other) translation.For some reason, Edizioni Delirium does not indicate that there is a reprise of the opening ""O Fortuna"" at the end of the cyle -- all that would have been needed was some indication that the reader should go back to page one......The title is generally pronounced, even by broadcasters who have shown signs of knowing better, as ""CarMEEna Burana,"" even though the ""i"" should be short, NOT like the ""i"" in machine. (I won't go into the problems of stress/accent in this multi-lingual situation.)The name indicates that the texts come from a manuscript found at ""Benediktbeuern"" in Bavaria, although this geographical fact seems to have less to do with the origins of the songs -- lay, clerical, monastic --  than with where the copies of the texts in one manuscript happened to wind up in modern times. Other versions of some them survive elsewhere. Actual metrically plausible relevant medieval music for some them exists (and has been recorded). Orff's compositions are entirely twentieth century, however, no matter how often Hollywood tries to make them out to be ""medieval sounding.""As such, this Kindle edition is a convenient replacement for the liner notes (in legible type) that used to accompany recordings; at least for those notes which didn't include a translation as well. Or for listening to a broadcast version. (And a translation is probably needed to catch all of what is going on, unless you happen to have been trained in Latin, or as a medievalist, or both; these are very funny poems, frequently made more so by passing themselves off (musically) as something much more innocent than they really are.(My favorite story about this I heard from a fellow graduate-student some decades ago. It seems she attended a performance in Austria, and happened to notice of row of elderly Ladies listening with rapt attention to the innocent little children singing in Latin, clearly without the least idea on their part of what they were singing about. She caught the eye of a priest, who DID understand it, and both of them had to struggle not to laugh out loud.....)There have been several translations of some or all of the poems, in various collections (leaving aside those made to accompany recordings or performances).For those looking for a translation of the text in the Kindle format, Penguin Classics has reissued David Parlett's 1986 translation of these poems, and a good deal more from the same medieval collection, ""Selections from The Carmina Burana."" His main translations, based on critical texts, are readable; special versions of those used by Orff are separated in an appendix, in Orff's order, and using his cuts and other modifications, and are also intended to be singable to his music. This makes it possible to use a hard copy as a silent guide to performance of a broadcast, or live if there are no program notes. If you are using a Kindle or a Kindle app instead of a paper copy, however, and are going to a live performance, I would suggest that you study ahead, and leave it at home!Parlett provides a useful, if now dated, bibliography of the medieval texts. There is what seems to me a decent Wikipedia article on Orff's life and career,  and the various controversies around him currently (i.e., as of this writing) available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JCMEYHIAOO8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TR9CSO#wasThisHelpful","R3JCMEYHIAOO8U","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of the books I review I have read twice (at least); the exceptions are reference works, which are not intended to be read through, and very long and rather technical books, especially those for which technical comments (as opposed to details on the contents) on my part would be presumptuous.""Absorbing Perfections: Kabbalah and Interpretation"" (2002), a very long book (about 660 pages) on medieval and early modern hermeneutics, falls neatly into the second category. I intend to re-read it; but not anytime soon. (For one thing, it suggested a lot of other reading I would like to get out of the way first!)Hermeneutics is defined by Merriam-Webster as ""the study of the methodological principles of interpretation and explanation; specifically: the study of the general principles of biblical interpretation."" And, as the subtitle indicates, ""Absorbing Perfections"" deals not with just any system of hermeneutics, but the multitude of systems inherited, adopted, adapted, innovated upon, and invented, by Jewish mystics from the High Middle Ages (the thirteenth century onwards) to the eighteenth and even nineteenth centuries. This includes systems which read sacred texts as vast symbolic structures, and also systems which read the individual letters as packed with hidden meanings. (In some cases, to be perceived in trances entered by permutations of the Hebrew letters.)All of this with frequent references to modern (basically post-1950) critical theories and theorists, and the established, or possible, impact of Kabbalistic ideas on their works: especially Derrida and Deconstruction, although literary Structuralism and Post-Modernism make appearances as well. (As I see it, Deconstruction begins with the insight that language is tricky and inexact, and then goes off the rails; but I don't have the background in modern philosophy needed to follow its arguments and applications.  That they attempted to communicate this by means of language could, of course, be a part of the problem.....)Now, there are some good short introductory books on Kabbalah (and other forms of Jewish Mysticim), like Gershom Scholem's ""On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism"" (English translation 1965), and some good short collections of Kabbalistic writings, like Daniel Matt's ""The Essential Kabbalah"" (1996; 240 pages) There are also good, short, but advanced books, like Arthur Green's ""Keter: The Crown of God in Early Jewish Mysticism"" (1997; 200 pages).Some of the best (and most important), at both introductory and advanced levels, however, are substantial tomes, like Scholem's ""Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism"" (First edition 1941; third edition about 490 pages, including front matter, bibliographies, and index) and his ""Origins of the Kabbalah"" (English translation 1987, about 500 pages). These were major efforts at reconstructing the chronology of mystical writings, identifying authors and doctrines, and laying the foundation for rigorously argued studies based on close readings of texts, instead of informed (and uninformed) guesses and personal biases.On the same generous scale are more recent programmatic works, like Moshe Idel's ""Kabbalah: New Perspectives"" (1988, about 460 pages), and Elliot Wolfson's ""Through a Speculum That Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism"" (1994, about 470 pages). ""The Poetry of Kabbalah: Mystical Verse from the Jewish Tradition"" (translated and edited by Peter Cole (2012; co-edited with Aminadav Dykman), runs to 450 pages in English, plus about 70 (separately numbered) in Hebrew. Detailed annotations, in smaller print, cover pages 251-434 (and are essential for understanding many of the poems).So far as I know, the current extreme example, published in English in a single volume, is Moshe Idel's ""Ben: Sonship and Jewish Mysticism"" (2007, almost 740 pages in rather small print).So ""Absorbing Perfections,"" although not quite as massive as this last, is not remarkably long; indeed, given that its subject involves pretty much all surviving Kabbalistic writings, only Idel's decision to give only samples of actual exegesis kept it as short as it is. Fortunately, Idel is a fairly good stylist, so the main obstacles facing readers are (a) the need for background information and (b) the inherent subtlety, and sometimes counter-intuitive nature, of the subjects treated. However, statements are meticulously annotated; the notes fill pages 493-663.I would encourage anyone with a background in modern studies of Kabbalah and at least a little familiarity with post-modern theories of literature to try it. I found it tough going, but illuminating. (Some of my difficulties may have arisen from the fact that I was reading it on a Kindle App, and suffered eyestrain from glare until I reset the app.)Others, who are intrigued, and willing to work at it, will need backgrounding; of the books mentioned above, Scholem's ""Major Trends"" is still the most comprehensive basic introduction to the Kabbalah, and Idel frequently quotes it (often to disagree). An alternative is a collection of Scholem's ""Encyclopedia Judaica"" articles, ""Kabbalah"" (1974). This is considerably more up-to-date on some topics, but it does not cover, or too briefly covers, material needed for ""Absorbing Perfections.""On the modern hermeneutics side (excluding specifically Biblical criticism and exegesis), the major introduction with which I am familiar (or was; I read it shortly after it appeared) is Jonathan Culler's ""On Deconstruction: Theory and Criticism After Structuralism"" (1982; 25th Anniversary Edition, 2008). There is, as of this writing, a Wikipedia article ""Deconstruction"" which I found to be pretty good, despite a number of criticisms of its style and level of difficulty; with cross-references to the articles on Structuralism and Post-Modernism. There is also an article on Jacques Derrida; it will leave the reader confused, but, I think, not as confused as reading Derrida (e.g., ""Of Grammatology"") directly.Since ""Absorbing Perfections"" is offered by Amazon only in Kindle format (with hard-copy editions from other sellers) it is worth noting that the Kindle version is NOT formatted with hyperlinks between the main text and the many endnotes. Fortunately, I was reading it using the Mac app version of Kindle, and could keep two copies open on different pages, using the Cloud Drive Reader on my browser, which made the whole experience a lot more satisfying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QZJE93HVY0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00177T5XI#wasThisHelpful","R21QZJE93HVY0M","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review of ""On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah"" is aimed primarily at assessing the book's level of difficulty, and its place among the author's studies of Jewish Mysticism which are now available in English. I have read each of those mentioned at least twice, and most of them three or more times, so I think that my observations are well-informed, if not typical of all potential readers.I have not attempted to summarize the contents, which have been covered in Amazon's Book Description, and by many of the previous reviewers.Kabbalah is an esoteric form of Judaism, so even a truly basic introduction demands some prior knowledge of post-Biblical Jewish history, and exoteric Judaism; otherwise, references to names, locales, philosophical schools, and periods of time, are likely to blur together, even if briefly defined in the volume itself. For a reliable introduction, I would suggest, among many worthy titles, ""Back to the Sources: Reading the Classic Jewish Texts,"" edited by Barry W. Holtz (1984), which covers most of the relevant literature, albeit sometimes very briefly.Gershom Scholem's ""On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead"" (""Von der mystischen Gestalt der Gottheit,"" 1962; English translation, Schocken, with Foreword by Joseph Dan, 1991) is a set of six complex and elaborately documented essays, tracing specific themes in Jewish mystical thought. Despite being well-translated, they together make up one of his more difficult works (in English), perhaps surpassed only by his long ""Origins of the Kabbalah"" (Princeton, 1991), with its densely-argued readings of some notoriously obscure and corrupt medieval texts. In this case, the difficulties are presented mainly by the long histories of the ideas he investigates, and their many variations and transformations.For this reason, the English-language subtitle of ""Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah"" is accurate, but, as some reviewers have complained, misleading. ""Basic"" is often used in English book titles to indicate ""simple, or elementary."" The German ""Studien zu Grundbegriffen"" in the original subtitle (1962) might instead have been translated as ""Investigations towards Fundamental Principles,"" or something equally, or even more, polysyllabic and intimidating.Certainly, the six essays which made up the contents of ""Mystical Shape"" are substantially denser, and more elaborately documented -- and often richer in content -- than the five pieces in an earlier volume, to which it is in effect a sequel, ""On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism"" (""Zur Kabbala und ihrer Symbolik,"" 1960; English translation, Schocken, 1965, with Foreword by Bernard McGinn, 1996). Both books contain lectures originally delivered at the C.G. Jung's ""Eranos"" conferences in Zurich, in the 1950s (one of the few places where Scholem felt he could use his native German language -- and introduce to Jewish thought to a part of the intellectual elite of a continent from which Jews had been nearly obliterated). Revised versions of both ""Symbolism"" and ""Mystical Shape"" were published in one volume in Hebrew, in 1976, as Joseph Dan points out in his useful Foreword to this English translation by Joachim Neugroschel. (The 1991 English text of ""Mystical Shape"" was revised by Jonathan Chipman to incorporate Scholem's emendations.) When the essays are read in order of publication, they take a reader from truly elementary (which is not to say easy or self-evident) aspects of Jewish mysticism to some of its most complex and wide-ranging developments.I have often recommended ""Symbolism"" as an introductory book; it has the great advantage of being about half the length of Scholem's ""Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism"" (1941, 1946, 1954; Schocken Paperback 1961; with Foreword by Robert Alter, 1995), and considerably more inviting, as well as significantly shorter, than the encyclopedia articles collected in ""Kabbalah"" (1974; Meridian paperback, 1978). (Another collection, longer, but addressed to non-specialists, is Scholem's collection of popular and ""occasional"" pieces, ""The Messianic Idea in Judaism, and Other Essays on Jewish Spirituality,"" Schocken, 1971; with Foreword by Arthur Hertzberg, 1995). However, it might be wise to try ""Major Trends"" or ""Kabbalah"" *before* attempting ""Mystical Shape.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGU237G14CXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805210814#wasThisHelpful","R3VGU237G14CXX","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike the two earlier reviews which Amazon software has attached to it, this is actually a review of a Kindle edition, by a specific translator. For this reason, my comments on the translation, commentary and index (or lack thereof) will not match up with theirs. [See note at end for the edition to which it is linked.]David Grene's translation of Hesiod's ""Works and Days"" originally appeared in the volume ""God and the Land: The Metaphysics of Farming in Hesiod and Vergil"" (Oxford University Press, 1998) by Stephanie A. Nelson. This volume is still in print, including a not-too-expensive (by current standards) paperback edition, and available from Amazon. But separate publication of the translation as an inexpensive Kindle book was doubtless a good idea.After all, Grene is a well-known translator, and the translation (as well as the volume in which it appeared) was well-received. And Hesiod, although he lacks the name-recognition of Homer, was a major early Greek poet, whose works deserve to be better known (despite numerous other translations in recent decades).Unfortunately, as too often happens with Kindle editions, there is a big gap between the good idea and its execution; enough to deprive the result of three stars in my rating.To begin with, there is no information given to the reader about where and when the translation first appeared -- which is not Grene's fault; the included ""Translator's Note"" takes for granted what the digital copyright page does not supply.Worse, the text seems to have been digitized by OCR, with NO attempt to copy-edit the results (or maybe a half-hearted one that caught some problems, but let the rest remain). Spelling of words tends to suffer at the beginning or the end; punctuation often is missing, and may be wrong where it does appear. Gaps in the text seem to be random, possibly marking the ends of pages in the original, but perhaps indicating lines missed.There are no line numbers, and there is no index; finding one's way around the poem, or locating a reference, is up to the reader. The product page claims that it is 100 pages long; quite a lot to page through, especially given that spelling errors make use of the search engine something like shooting dice.It is perhaps a fair warning that this ancient Greek poem about farming and morality has been given as its cover illustration a rural genre-scene -- of what looks like nineteenth-century Europe (but might, I suppose, be American).Finally, the Amazon list of editions in other formats refers one (as is only too usual) to a variety of totally different translations.Fortunately for those who want to read Grene's rendering, a pdf version is available, FREE, from the Library of Congress' ""Internet Archive"" (archive.org), complete with Grene's introductory remarks, line numbers, and even his brief textual notes. (This may have been the source for the present edition, simply OCR'd from a digital form, instead of scanned directly from a hard copy.)[The Grene translation appears to have been linked to the paperback edition of the translation of Hesiod's ""Works and Days"" by Tandy and Neale -- a very good translation with a superb ""Social Science"" commentary on the ""peasant ethos"" expressed in the poem. This is rather different from Nelson's approach, as described by Grene in his introductory note to his translation.]","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WTIYSZ3QJ7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIR8I5Y#wasThisHelpful","R14WTIYSZ3QJ7Z","A2519788C514WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2519788C514WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If I forget to rinse it off so that it can be washed later in the week in the dishwasher, then I don't feel too bad just throwing it out.So, while some people would buy these for church picnics or family reunions, I purchased them s that I could use then pitch.I highly recommend these forks for your lazy kitchen or for your church picnic; your family get together or your midnight snack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R55NZNPJDT7OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AV1HUN8#wasThisHelpful","R55NZNPJDT7OO","A3DG93E8TXMKZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DG93E8TXMKZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cups are very nice for measuring dry or wet ingredients. (I don't suggest them for measuring gaseous ingredients, but that's a joke, sorry!!!)They appear to be accurate, though I have not applied a micrometer (mainly because I don't have one). They are durable and look like they will last forever, even better than the hard plastic measuring cups that I bought from Amazon, but misplaced in my house before I got around to putting them in the kitchen. (They'll show up when I'm looking for something else, my friend says.)RECOMMENDATIONIf you are looking for an excellent set of measuring cups, you have come to the right place. Definitely get these cups.If you are satisfied with your current measuring cups and spoons, you are certainly in good shape and don't need to upgrade, but if you are going to help set your offspring up with his or her own apartment, give them your old cups and spoons, and order these for yourself.PERSONAL BONUS(with a very boring anecdote)BONUS: I keep the big cup on the table where I take my morning pills. As I punch pills from three different cards, I drop the pills into the cup, then I do the same with the three pills that come out of two pill bottles.

"This is a nice addition to my freezer space. I really like having a choice between regular ice cubes and these mini ice cubes. I highly recommend having at least two of these trays (two trays in one package) in your freezer along with your regular trays.But, as in life, for every advantage, there is a disadvantage.ADVANTAGEThere's a reason why many fast food places use crushed ice. The smaller each piece of ice, the faster it cools your drink. The only way to cool something faster is to use spherical ice cubes.DISADVANTAGEIce cubes transfer their coldness to the drink by a very simple method, they melt. As the temperature of the drink gets colder, the temperature of the surface of the ice gets warmer, which means the surface is melting.THERE IS A SECRET TO MAKING THE CUBES KEEP YOUR DRINK COLDER LONGERThe colder the drink is BEFORE you pour it over the ice, the longer the ice will last, the less it will dilute the drink, and the longer the drink will stay cold. Some people would say that putting the cubes into the drink is better than pouring the drink over the ice, which I kind of agree with, but do not have any mathematics to support that idea. I don't think the difference is big enough to make any change in your ice methods beneficial in this ""over or under"" method.NOTE: Most people will want to ignore the rest of my review. I get into High School Geometry, and make up my own ""Coolness Quotient"" formula as part of that explanation.RECOMMENDATION: DO YOU NEED THESE CUBES?These cubes are more of a conversation piece than they are of normal use around your house, but for a party, they can be a lot of fun. I rarely use my mini cube trays because I rarely have parties.ONLY GEEKS NEED TO READ FURTHERThe rest of my review is based on high school geometry. If you're not that into math (or maths in the UK), you might want to skip down to the very end.WHY DO MINI CUBES COOL FASTER THAN REGULAR CUBES?Let's apply some high school geometry and see what we get. We will compare the efficiency of two different sized cubes.1. Calculate the surface area of one regular ice cube2. Calculate the volume of that same ice cube3. Divide the first number by the second number4. Calculate the surface area of one mini ice cube5. Calculate the volume of that mini ice cube6. Divide the surface area by the volume of the mini cubeThe larger the quotient (the answer to #3 and #6), the faster it cools, but the faster it dilutes.Lets do the calculations for one inch and one-half inch cubes to demonstrate.Surface Area = 6 * length ^ squaredVolume = length ^ cubedOne Inch Ice Cube (all sides equal one inch)--- Surface Area = 6 * 1^2 = 6 * 1 = 6 square inches--- Volume = 1^3 = 1 cubic inch--- Coolness Quotient = 6 / 1 = 6Half Inch Ice Cube (all sides equal half an inch)--- Surface Area = 6 * 0.5 ^ 2 = 6 * 0.25 = 1.5--- Volume = 0.5 ^ 3 = 0.125 cubic inches--- Coolness Quotient = 1.5 / 0.125 = 12Since 12 is twice as large as 6, we can guess that half inch cubes get things colder twice as fast but melt twice as fast. Of course, this is based on similar volumes (weights) of the ice. One regular one inch cube is equal to eight mini half inch cubes in volume or weight.I will leave it to the nerds to try the same things with spherical ice cubes that have the same volume as these mini cubes or regular cubes.RECOMMENDATIONIf you have kids, get these and encourage them to do some experimentation between the two sizes of cubes. I do highly recommend these cubes for their curiosity value. That's the main reason I bought them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M3PVOVJPJLSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013F5DVDY#wasThisHelpful","R1M3PVOVJPJLSL","A3DG93E8TXMKZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DG93E8TXMKZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not only is this a good gag gift, it is an excellent way to carry data with you from computer to computer. It could even be part of the backup plan for your home or office.GIFT?When I bought this a few months ago, a friend of mine enjoyed his beer and occasional other drinks, so I ordered it for him. Now, though, I have managed to convince him to go to AA meetings almost every week, so it might not have been as good a gift as I first thought. (He has not complained, and says that he has had no problems with this data storage device.)A-B-C BACKUP PLAN?Some of my friends have never heard of this relatively simple plan. Always have one backup off-site; it seems so simple.Most people who already have a good backup plan can ignore the rest of this review:DIRECTIONS:1. Label three USB data drives as ""Backup A"", ""Backup B"" and ""Backup C"" (see proofreading note below).2. Decide how often you will backup your data. Some companies do it daily. Some, weekly. Families tend to do it less often.3. After you backup your data, take that data drive off site, and bring the next labeled drive back on site. Actually, you only have one drive off site at a time.SUMMARY OF BACKUP LOCATIONS(ITD = Info Tech Director)(this chart starts with Drive C being the most recent backup)(the most recent backup is always near the computer, just in case)(the second most recent backup is at the ITD's home)(third most recent backup is in another room at your company, e.g. ITD's office)End of Day 1 or Week 1: Backup onto data device A--------------------------------: ITD takes data device C home--------------------------------: Data device A stays in computer room--------------------------------: ITD brings data device B back to office the next morningEnd of Day 2 or Week 2: Backup onto data device B--------------------------------: ITD takes data device A home--------------------------------: Data device B stays in computer room--------------------------------: ITD brings data device C back to office the next morningEnd of Day 3 or Week 3: Backup onto data device C--------------------------------: ITD takes data device B home--------------------------------: Data device C stays in computer room--------------------------------:,ITD brings data device A back to office the next morningKeep repeating 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-3-etc.PROOFREADING NOTE:I deliberately chose to use UK style quoting in this review. Personally, I think in cases like this, we should keep the commas outside quotes to make it clear what each label says.RECOMMENDATION:I highly recommend using a USB data device as part of your BACKUP plan, and if the shape and picture of the device is special to you, that's even better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP16VM5Q2VP88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXFB5GK#wasThisHelpful","RP16VM5Q2VP88","A3DG93E8TXMKZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DG93E8TXMKZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My purpose in ordering these cheap spoons was so that I'd have something I could use when I didn't want to worry about washing dishes. These spoons are EXCELLENT for that purpose, and at a penny per spoon, I don't mind throwing them out if I don't wash them soon enough.They would also be great for picnics. If your church is having a picnic to celebrate the start or end of the Sunday School year, these are great for that purpose.The box says HEAVY DUTY. They may be Heavy Duty, but there are more expensive spoons that do not twist the way these do (when I deliberately twist them).

"Question: Will you enjoy ""The Joy of Thinking"" ?Answer:It depends, but in general, the answer is yes. I will answer this question in greater detail after the SYNOPSIS and REVIEW.SYNOPSIS:This set from ""The Great Courses"" contains four DVDs and two coursebooks with a total of 24 lessons, each about half an hour in length. I am not going to list all 24 lesson titles, but oftentimes, the two professors will take several lessons to cover some topics in understandable detail, but I will tell you what disk helped me learn the most new things.Topology, the study of surfaces, is the main topic for lessons 13 through 18. I already knew about Moebius Strips, those loops of paper with one or three half twists in them, but it was fun to review, and even understand better, some of the features of these funny strips, much better than comic strips. I knew, long ago, what a Klein Bottle was (it is a bottle with only one surface and no edges, but can only be constructed in four dimensions). Now that I've watched these lessons, I understand the theoretical method of how we would construct such a bottle. The construction was discussed in detail using tubes of paper. What I had never heard before was what would happen if we could cut an actual Klein bottle in half. (We would get two 3-dimensional Moebius Strips.)I was so fascinated by the discussion of fractals, also on disk 3 (fractals are a subset of Topological manipulation). I was so enamored, the disk inspired me to write a computer program to create two of the fractal images they discussed, and I plan to write at least a third one.Disk 4 does an excellent job of explaining probability. You might never go gambling in Las Vegas once you understand why the average person loses about 5 cents for every dollar that they spend.REVIEWI'm watching these DVD's out of order. I love them so much that I've watched disks 3 and 4 twice each. (The library has requested disks 1 and 2 for me, also.) They are so good, I'm thinking of purchasing my own copy.I did see two mistakes in their graphics, but I am not going to take away any stars for those mistakes. (For example, while the professor states that the probability of something is 999,999 out of one million, the chart on the screen had the fraction ""1 over 999,999."" Since these lectures were released in 2003, I'm certain they already know of these mistakes, so I'm not going to tell them. Others most certainly already have.Whether you buy this set, rent the program from someone, or borrow the DVD's and books from your library system, if you are lucky enough to have a library that can get them or has them, I highly recommend these lessons to you. If you are not sure whether you'd enjoy them, I invite you to read the next section.I do recommend that you read each topic in the guidebooks. It doesn't matter if you read them before or after watching the DVD. It is a matter of your preference. Personally, I found that I learned the topic better by watching one lesson, then reading that topic in the book, then going on to the next. Then after watching all six lessons on one DVD, I watched them again, and was surprised to find I still learned something new the second time, probably because the book helped me understand what I heard the first time, but it wasn't cemented into my mind until I watched it again.WILL YOU ENJOY THESE DVD LESSONS?Do you love math? You will enjoy some of these lessons, because you will almost certainly learn something new. I got an 800 on my Mathematics SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test, highest possible score) as a Junior in high school, and repeated this 800 score twice on the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) in 1976 and 1996. In spite of my ""perfect"" math scores (which are, by no means perfect), I learned new things from these programs.Are you trying to understand what your child is learning in school? These lectures are great introduction for parents and grandparents. You will discover that there is new information available now that was not available when some of us were in school decades ago.Do you hate math? These professors actually present mathematics in ways that are easier to understand than the methods that are, unfortunately, used by too many Math Teachers.For example, did you know that you can make fractals randomly? (Sierpinski Triangle.) Have you heard of the Golden Spiral? You will be able to make one for yourself using paper, pencil, ruler, and compass. Did you know that you could fold a piece of paper to create a fractal? Look up the Dragon's Curve, which is made by folding a strip of paper many times, then unfolding it so that every fold is exactly 90 degrees in angle.I hope that I have piqued your interest.( At the bottom of this review, you will see two images, my own computer-created versions of the Dragon's Curve and the Sierpinski Triangle fractals. If enough people ask for the BASIC programs, I will be happy to create a web page that contains the images (each step of the way) and the source code of the program. If these aren't the full size images, I'll try to give you an Internet address for them. )OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSAnother good DVD that will introduce some interesting math concepts to you happens to be part of the very first Disney program ever broadcast in color:Donald in Mathmagic LandAfter you watch the short program, watch all the teacher resources that show clips specific to various grade levels along with questions that students can answer. I was able to answer most of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28T6IP3O4PRCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VEG63S#wasThisHelpful","R28T6IP3O4PRCB","A3DG93E8TXMKZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DG93E8TXMKZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice table. I got it for my living room so that I'd have another place to work on my computer. (My main ""office"" is one entire wall of my bedroom.) I wanted a table that would allow me to put my feet up while sitting at the table, quite a ""feat"" with a rocking chair recliner. There is plenty of space between the legs for this purpose, as you can see in the picture. You can actually make it fit either way, but I rotated the table so the recliner footrest goes under where the table legs are further apart.The table is sturdy, and when I have guests, it is a convenient place for them to work on their computer while I work on mine in my bedroom office.Of course, this table is also great for meeting rooms, church fellowship halls, and many other uses.

"This is a great little snack, but you need to be careful. The nutritional guidelines say that one tin contains two servings of herring, but if you are like me, you can manage to eat an entire container of herring in one sitting. This means that you need to double the calories (which I don't count) and double the sodium (which I do count).The herring tastes excellent, and the horseradish is a great flavor enhancer. In a way, I like it better in horseradish than I do getting it smoked, but both ways deserve five stars. Of course, if you hate fish, then don't buy this product. But if you do, these are great.

I like opening the tin and eating right out of the tin.I highly recommend these herring fillets, but if you are watching your sodium (as I am) or your calories (which I am not), be aware that the nutrition chart (see below) says that this tin contains two servings, so if you eat the entire tin in one sitting, double those values.

The fillets are easy to separate with a flimsy plastic fork, and they can be eaten right out of the tin, or served on a pretty plate.The lid opens easily. Normally, I don't bother removing it all the way, but instead, use my fork to get the last bits of herring out from under the other end of the tin.

"I have watched ""Donald in Mathemagic Land"" more times than I care to admit. It is a wonderful DVD, and even has curriculum information that can be used by teachers to prepare lessons for the classroom.However, I question why, if Ludolph van Ceulen, an early modern mathematicians correctly calculated pi to an accuracy of 35 digits in the 18th century, and Jurij Vega reached an accuracy of 126 digits in the 19th century, that Disney would make two mistakes about the value of pi in this program. (In the glossary, they say that pi is equal to 22/7 or approximately 3.14; while in the program itself, a talking geometric figure makes a mistake, saying that pi is equal to 3.141592653589747 etc. Change 9747 to 9793 and it agrees, as far as it goes, with the 18th century value calculated by hand.Source for 18th and 19th century details:https :// en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Approximations_of_%CF%80(last symbol is ""pi"" symbol, if it doesn't show up here correctly)But, this error is NOT enough to penalize them by removing any stars.I understand the ""Golden Ratio"" and the ""Golden Rectangle"" much better based on this film, even if they say that the golden ratio is approximately 8 by 5 or eight fifths. Technically true, for the high school students that would also watch this, it would be helpful if they had given a more specific, if still irrational, value. Of course, students can easily double check the value on the Internet.Perhaps ""Disney"" included these mistakes so that the older students could do the work themselves to find the correct values.Can you learn from this animated movie?I'm 64. I got 800 for my math score on the SAT in 1968, and got 800 for quantitative scores on my GRE in 1976 and 1996. (My 1996 GRE scores qualified me for the Triple Nine Society.) In spite of my great math scores, I still learn from Donald in this film, which I vaguely recall, might have been the main feature on the first ever color broadcast of Walt Disney's television show.If I can learn more about math when I watch this, then so can you. I highly recommend this DVD to you.John, former teacher, M.S. EducationP.S. How do you create a golden rectangle? (see diagram)1. Draw a square (see red lines in diagram)2. Mark a point exactly in the middle of one side of the square.3. Set your compass to make a circle with a radius that is equal to the distance from that halfway point to one of the opposite corners. Draw an arc from that point that extends to the line that extends from the midpoint that you marked in step 2.4. Make a rectangle that uses the point where the circular arc intersects that extended line.These steps may look complicated, but the film makes it look easy. It also shows us many places in ancient and modern times where we can see golden rectangles and golden ratios.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H8B0KPYNS50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00287Z1F2#wasThisHelpful","R2H8B0KPYNS50","A3DG93E8TXMKZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DG93E8TXMKZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these Pickled Eggs. I agree with the reviewer who reminds us what PICKLED means. The hard boiled eggs actually are put in a vinegar solution that also contains other flavors and optional coloring. So yes, pickled eggs will taste like vinegar. That is part of what makes these ""pickled"". As Merriam-Webster (dot com) can verify (I just looked it up by googling ""define pickled""), pickled means: preserved with salt water or vinegarWhen we preserve something in vinegar, the vinegar is partially absorbed by the food, like the egg in this case. In fact, the pickling process continues until you remove an egg from the jar and eat it.I bought some today at Wal-Mart for just a bit over a buck (plus tax) for two eggs in an airtight plastic package. I've already inhaled the contents of one package, though I learned that I also need to have something to drink on hand while eating the eggs.I came to Amazon to see if they carry it, and did not see it.

"Yes, this is very true. Some college majors require a course called Music Appreciation. The better you know classical music, who wrote what, etc., the higher a grade that you might get. Even if it's not required, it might be a good elective. Amazon even sells textbooks for Music Appreciation, such as Music Appreciation CUSTOM textbook for Eastern Kentucky University (Course number MUH 171 Edition).This album, and similar ones, are great for classical introductions. I highly recommend them. (But don't get the book unless you know your kids might go to EKU.)I highly recommend you add classical music to your home's music appreciation medley.

"I'm sure that these are great for some people, but I never used them once I got them. My good intentions went awry. I should never have ordered these.My advice to others like me:If you think that your legs have gotten fatter because of a medical condition, TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST. When I finally talked to a doctor and told him that I had compression socks, he said it might be okay to try them, but to limit myself to half an hour at a time.Be sure that you don't need to go far beyond the simplicity of wearing socks for what you have. In my case, I found out that I had something called edemas, water had collected in my legs and arms because my heart had gotten weaker after an attack that I never noticed. After 17 days in two hospitals, I have lost dozens of pounds; my arms and legs are nicely shaped again, not tight; and another certain part of my (male) body again looks like it did last year.Do not put off seeing a doctor if you are not sure of what is happening.

"These pineapple chunks are wonderful, and deserve five stars, but the cans leave something to be desired. I bought them because I read online that pineapple in your diet can help with your heart health. A month or so AFTER I read about that online, I discovered that I need to be careful because my pulse rate varies (controlled fibrillation). In fact, some DOLE cans even remind you that adding fruits and vegetables to your diet is good for your health. Bravo, Dole.Five of my cans were dented, but I ate the contents anyway. (Yes, I know that dented cans are a health risk under certain circumstances, such as a risk of salmonella.Most of the time, it felt like, the pop top broke off right after it had made the initial opening in the can, meaning I couldn't turn the can over to use a regular can opener. Imagine my surprise, later, when I read the fine print on the label and saw a statement telling me that if I had trouble with the pop top that I could do just that, turn the can over and use a regular opener. At least they're acknowledging that some people, even this original 98-pound weakling, now 64, might have trouble with pop tops. I found it was easy to start the process, but continuing to pull the lid off is where the tab usually broke off, then I had to use a knife or fork in the small initial opening to finish the job. I will probably go back to picking up my pineapple at Piggly-Wiggly rather than order through Amazon so that I know what I am going to get.In spite of the above, I highly recommend Dole's Pineapple Chunks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R358JG1X0ZLWD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFRP15Q#wasThisHelpful","R358JG1X0ZLWD7","A3DG93E8TXMKZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DG93E8TXMKZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Back then, even the Adventures of Superman was in black and white and black and white televisions were the norm in homes that had TV at all.

I think the tea tastes wonderful.Parsley Tea has a side effect that some people will love. It can act like a mild diuretic, helping a person with urination. But if you worry that fluid retention might be a problem in your life, see your doctor.My dad called parsley nature's toothbrush because, as it comes on your dinner plate at an old-fashioned restaurant, it can freshen your breath at the end of the meal. Parsley is a very misunderstood vegetable. It is the one item most likely not to be eaten on the dinner plate, but in its freshly picked form, it is a beautiful addition to the plate. Of course, for what I describe in this second paragraph, you'll want to get fresh parsley at the store, or ask for it at your restaurant if they didn't already put some on your plate.

"Star Trek: The Next Generation (frequently abbreviated as ST:TNG) was controversial at the time of its release. Many people announced that they would boycott TNG because it did not star the old cast or because it did not use the same characters. Even William Shatner was against the new series, and in interviews, described the problems that the new cast was facing that never faced to old cast.What is ST:TNG? It is, as the next generation (or at least several generations later) after the original Star Trek (ST:TOS). It is 75 years later. Technology is better. The ship is the 1701D, three ships later than Kirk's original 1701 and 1701A. Originally, we know nothing about what happened to the 1701B or 1701C. So, if 25 years is one generation in an average family, and each ship letter is a generation, this new series could have been called,STAR TREK: THREE GENERATIONS LATERPeace has broken out between the Federation and the Klingons, though there are occasional problems. We now see that, just like the Federation includes many people who look different from each other, so does the Klingon federation, as we see a new race of Klingons (that require much more makeup than the original Klingons).Continuity is still a problem. Events in later seasons do not necessarily logically follow events in earlier episodes. For example, in one episode, one-half impulse power might allow the ship to move slowly out of the ship's berth at spacedock, while in another episode, one-half impulse power might be a significant fraction of the speed of light. But ST:TNG does do a better job with continuity than TOS or ""Enterprise"", but not as good as in Deep Space Nine (ST:DS9) or Voyager (ST:V)All in all, ST:TNG deserves all five stars in spite of the lacks I describe, but it is not the best science fiction show of its kind. No matter how much I love TNG (and Star Trek in general), I love ""Babylon 5"" even more. It had a five year story line that was planned out 100% in advance, planned out very logically I must say. If you have never seen it, please give it a chance, but when you do, start with ""Season One"" -- do not start with ""In the Beginning"" or the other prequel. Do an Internet search on ""Babylon 5 viewing order"" to figure out what order to watch it in.I highly recommend Star Trek, not only Season Six, but all seven seasons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AEYAI4XWW10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R143VHC#wasThisHelpful","R3AEYAI4XWW10","A3DG93E8TXMKZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DG93E8TXMKZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I write this review, I am a patient at a hospital in South Carolina. This is a review of the ""urinal"" that they gave me so that we could measure my ""output"" with their help. This particular unit has part number ""U-24"" molded into the plastic. Amazon does not have ""U-24"" included in any of their results.In my opinion, the Medegen deluxe urinal, if it is indeed what I am using, is an average urinal for men to be able to use from their beds or from the edge of their bed. (So far, I'm using it from the edge of my bed and from the front edge of my chair cushion while it is necessary for the nurses to measure how much I urinate per day.)I cannot give it five stars because the opening in the top is the same size as the swelling that I am currently experiencing. I wish that the hospital or Amazon had this urinal with a wider opening.I also question the price, it seems to me that a machine-manufactured bottle should have a lower cost. Perhaps the price varies during the year.All in all, I'm happy with the unit, except for the reservations cited above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XIC9U42G7NHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VS1A1LS#wasThisHelpful","R1XIC9U42G7NHB","A3DG93E8TXMKZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DG93E8TXMKZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great product!  The idea is similar to standard hook-and-loop fasteners, like Velcro, but there are two very important differences:First, the parts that function the way Velcro does are mushroom-shaped.  This makes them cling MUCH better than any hook-and-loop product.  I can't imagine any vibration that would be strong enough to shake a phone, radio, etc. loose once it was fastened with this product.Second, the adhesive that sticks the closure strips to the dashboard or whatever is high-temperature.  It will maintain its grip in a hot car or in direct sunlight.  Typical hook-and-loop tape will let go at some point when it gets hot enough.There is one potential downside:  The fasteners grip so tightly that you can't just pull whatever you have mounted off, as you can with regular hook-and-loop.  It takes some real effort and a bit of time.If you need a Velcro-type gripping system that REALLY sticks together regardless of vibration and that won't let go in the heat, this is the stuff for you.  I recommend it most highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R104MRBLHP1F1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OXK1M8#wasThisHelpful","R104MRBLHP1F1K","A1IUTYIY6PW8DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUTYIY6PW8DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are outstanding safety glasses at a good price.I have a couple of pair of good safety glasses, but they aren't tinted, so they aren't good for any length of time outside.  These glasses are actually dark-tinted sunglasses with UV block rating.  The result is no glare at all and no squinting.In addition, they're extremely comfortable.  They fit snugly without pinching, and they have foam around the lenses that does a good job keeping sawdust, pollen, etc. out of my eyes.  They look and feel very sturdy, but at the same time, they're very light.  Finally, they come with both over the ear frames and a headband, so if I need real goggles, I can have them in about 30 seconds.  There's a fabric bag to hold everything.One important proviso:  There is no way to order prescription lenses for these glasses, and they're not large enough for regular glasses to fit underneath them.  If you need prescription glasses, shop for a different product.Bottom line:  These are really nice glasses at a very good price.

"Roundup Weed and Grass Killer kills weeds and grass.  That pretty much says it all.  It's an excellent product, and Amazon offers it at an very good price.The most notable thing about Roundup is that kills weeds very quickly.  Apply it in the morning, and the target weeds are looking pretty unhealthy by sunset and dead in a few days.  That, of course, is what you want in a weed killer.  Further, this is a premixed product with a pump dispenser.  This means if you see something sprouting, you can just spritz it immediately, without the need to mix something, put it into a sprayer, clean the sprayer afterward, etc.Now, there's an 800-pound gorilla in the room:  The active ingredient in Roundup is glyphosphate, which the World Health Organization has described as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.  Some research links it to other serious health conditions, too.  However, the WHO is referring to dangers associated with large-scale agricultural use, not garden clean up.  Common sense tells you not to spray yourself with it, let kids roll around on plants you've sprayed, etc.  Like every other chemical, if you pay attention to the instructions, you'll be OK.Bottom line:  This stuff works very well.

This is good quality at a good price.The blade will cut through wood, metal, and PVC with apparent ease.  Oscillating tool blades are notoriously fragile and quick-wearing.

More importantly, it hasn't shed any teeth yet, something I've had name-brand blades do within seconds of their first use.The package says it fits all oscillating tools.  I don't know about that, but it fits my Bosch tool fine.Bottom line:  It seems to be a very good product at a very good price.

"I'm not a Deadhead, but I am a fan of the Grateful Dead's music.  I also enjoy insider books by rock 'n' rollers.  That's why I was eager to read Bill Kreutzmann""s book.  The subtitle promises that it details his ""three decades of drumming, dreams, and drugs.""  I liked the book, but the focus of the book is on the drugs, not the drumming and dreaming.Kreutzmann was a founding member of the Dead, present at ground zero when the psychedelic San Fransisco sound exploded into being in the sixties.  He knew and worked with all of the big names, like Carlos Santana, Janis Joplin, the Jefferson Airplane, the Quicksilver Messenger Service and on and on.  Can you imagine the things he saw and the stories he could tell?""Could"" is the operative term here.  Unfortunately for us-- and even more so for him-- he was stoned for most of his career.  In addition, of course, he didn't know nearly fifty years ago that he'd be writing a history some day, so he didn't keep records of what happened.  The result of that combination is a rambling, discursive book with many, many vague, fuzzy spots.In the end, it's a cautionary tale.  Kreutzmann repeatedly tells us that the band's and his personal drug use negatively affected their music, their finances, and most importantly, their health.  The Dead lost four keyboardists to drug-related health issues, and Jerry Garcia died in his early 50s, a sick, old man who could barely stand up on stage.  One wonders what they could have done if they had been recreational drug users, rather than helpless junkies.  Of course, it's possible to argue that the music wouldn't have been the same without the heavy drug use.  It's hard to know.  However, Kreutzmann's account makes it clear that the drugs took a toll.Structurally, the book is a bit frustrating. It's arranged chronologically, but very frequently, it veers out of order.  The co-author, Benjy Eisen, is a professional journalist, so he should have been able to smooth out the narrative.  He didn't.Bottom line:  I liked the book, and I recommend it.  It's certainly not one of the great rock histories, but it is a look inside of one of the most influential bands in rock history, told by one of the few people in a position to know what he's talking about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C30QW2VNL8RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250033799#wasThisHelpful","R1C30QW2VNL8RU","A1IUTYIY6PW8DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUTYIY6PW8DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an outstanding shaving cream.  It produces a lot of the rich, long-lasting lather that is essential for a good shave.  That's really it.  The stuff works exactly like you've always hoped shaving cream would work.The instructions on the bottle say to use an almond-sized dab on your brush, but I've found that about half that amount-- maybe a pencil eraser-sized dab-- does the trick.  That means this little bottle will last a long, long time.  They claim 50 shaves, but based on how much I've used so far, I expect to get many more.  That, of course, makes the apparent high cost of a bottle justifiable.  On a per-shave basis, it's a very good deal.It would be possible to use it without a shaving brush, but I think that would be far less satisfying.  The brush allows you to work up a heavy lather and to spread it around evenly.  Definitely buy a brush if you're using this cream.Bottom line:  This is an EXCELLENT product that works exactly as it should.

"Imagine what would happen today if there were six or eight domestic groups of political radicals who decided to start bombing public and corporate buildings at the rate of one blast per day.  Well, that's exactly what was happening in the US from the early '70s through the mid-'80s, and this book is the story of how it happened.It is a remarkable account, one based on years of interviews with the radicals who were underground doing the bombing and the FBI agents and local police officials who were trying to catch them.  Many of these people have kept silent about what they did for decades.  It's hard to imagine the effort the author went to trying to craft an understandable narrative from all of those interviews.  Everyone involved-- including law enforcement-- was very secretive, and no one had an understanding of what was happening beyond his or her portion of the activities.  Add the passage of decades, and the raw material the book is based on must have been a confusing mess.  Despite that, the book is a tightly-organized, fast-paced work that reads like a fictional thriller.  It's a remarkable achievement.One of the take-aways from the book-- and a difficult one to grasp-- is that these tiny groups of revolutionaries were serious.  In fact, deadly serious.  They sincerely believed that eight or ten people planting bombs in office building bathrooms would become a revolutionary vanguard that would cause the people to rise up, overthrow the fascist power structure, and create a socialist workers paradise.  It's hard to even type that with a straight face.  However, these people not only believed it and said it, they lived it.  Of course, there wasn't anything funny about all of this.  Their bombs killed people and did millions of dollars worth of damage, and they robbed dozens of banks to finance their revolutionary lives.  In addition, they ambushed and assassinated a number of police officers.Back in the anti-Vietnam war '60s, there was a poster that said, ""Suppose they gave a war and nobody came.""  A similar poster for the times described in this book would say, ""Suppose they gave a revolution and nobody came.  In fact, nobody even noticed.""  That's the final irony here.  These people were so completely absorbed in their own beliefs and perceptions that they didn't know that no one-- almost literally so-- even noticed.This book is a fascinating and valuable account of a now nearly forgotten period in modern American history.  It will richly repay you for the effort of reading it.

"This book is a mystery/thriller, so I don't want to say much about the plot.  However, it is a fast-paced thriller that would make it a great vacation or airplane trip read.This is the fourth book in which David Levien has featured Frank Behr, a former cop afflicted with various personal problems who is now working as a private eye.  He depends on cooperation from the cops, who don't like him much and threaten him regularly when he interferes with them.  If that sounds familiar, it is.  This formula has been exploited by many other writers.  Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder novels are the gold standard for me.  In my view, Levien executes the book well, but he's not quite up to Block's level.Part of the problem for me was that at several key points in the story, the author mentions something that clearly was described in one of the three earlier books, something that has a major impact on Behr's thinking and feelings.  Of course, he can't retell the earlier stories, but without some detail, it's impossible to really understand what's going on in Behr's mind.  I was left puzzled about why Behr was thinking or doing something and irritated that I'd have to read three other books to find the answer.Another issue for me was the gore factor.  The bad guy is a psycho serial killer, and Levien establishes that by ratcheting up the blood and gore.  Blood and gore don't bother me that much, but at a certain point, it loses it's power to indicate evil.  James Patterson does psycho serial killers very well by making them well rounded characters, not merely by piling up dismembered body parts.  I think Levien could learn something from that.Bottom line:  I thought the book was well worth reading.  It's very fast paced and filled with twists and turns.  It's not the best book of its type, but it's definitely a great page-turner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19MH1PXA69WM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385532555#wasThisHelpful","R19MH1PXA69WM7","A1IUTYIY6PW8DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUTYIY6PW8DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These removable hooks are a very good value compared to the much more familiar name-brand Command product.  You get about twice as many for the same cost.  However, there are some things to be aware of:First, it's extremely important to follow the instructions about cleaning and drying the mounting surface.  They will stick to a slightly non-compiant surface, but not very well.  In addition, if the surface has much of a texture, they probably won't work as well as you might hope.  This is important, because they have a weight rating.  I found that the 1-pound hooks I got held 1 pound, but not very much more without letting go.  I assume the same would be true for the higher-rated hooks, too.In addition, these are more functional than attractive.  The hook is chrome metal, and the removal tab sticks out past the bottom of the base very noticeably.  This doesn't affect their workability at all, but you do need to think about it if they're going to be visible in an area where appearance is important to you.Finally, the hooks are most certainly removable, but they're not relocatable.  That is, be sure you're putting it exactly where you want it.  You'll be able to remove it with no problem, but you can't use the hook you've removed again.

"This gizmo is designed to keep hair and other debris from going down bathtub drains that have ""pop up"" drain plugs.  It's a flexible, perforated, silicone dome, weighted so it won't float off of the drain.  Generally, it does what it's designed to do.However, it's very easy to accidentally kick it off of the drain when you're showering.  You won't realize you've done that until you look down at the drain.  When it stays in place on the drain, the perforations are small enough that the water will begin to pool.  You can end up nearly ankle-deep in it by the time your shower is over.  Finally, when the water drains away, you need to clean the hair and other debris off of the strainer, which isn't very pleasant.Bottom line:  It works the way it's designed to, and it's well made.  However, there are some usability issues that may or may not be important to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BK0EF1UQEAYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCEBMFM#wasThisHelpful","R1BK0EF1UQEAYT","A1IUTYIY6PW8DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUTYIY6PW8DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fear of speaking in public is very common.  In fact there are surveys that apparently show it to be the most common fear.  The good news is that there is a readily available, effective, and even low-cost way to reduce that fear: Toastmasters International.  This book is a collection of short essays by and about people who have overcome their fears by joining Toastmasters.Good for them, but so what?  The ""so what"" is that as many of them say, if they can do it, everyone can do it.  In fact, the author, Sheryl Roush, says that about herself, too.  That's what these stories are about.  Toastmasters works near-miracles for those who take the program seriously.  If you want or need to become a more competent speaker and want to feel more comfortable when you speak, then join one of the 16,000 Toastmasters clubs in over 120 countries around the world.  Read this book first, though, and you'll see what membership has done for many others just like you.This book will richly reward you for the time and effort it takes to read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R323C30DBAET8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHXT21O#wasThisHelpful","R323C30DBAET8","A1IUTYIY6PW8DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUTYIY6PW8DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like Ridley Pearson's books, particularly ""Beyond Recognition,"" which I think is a classic in the thriller genre.  That's why I was disappointed in ""The Red Room.""I started it, but couldn't get into it.  It seemed to be an episode in a longer story, rather than an independent story.  I thought that reading the first two books in the ""Risk Agent"" series might help, so I found ""Risk Agent"" and ""Choke Point"" in the library.  The first was OK, but I couldn't finish the second.  For me, the problem is that those two books and ""The Red Room"" are indeed all part of one story.  Unfortunately, the story-- and worse, the characters-- are one-dimensional.  John Knox and Grace Chu take on mysterious assignments and run around a lot, eying people in restaurants to see if they have sinister intent, getting stalked and stalking bad guys, moving from hotel room to hotel room to stay out of the clutches of the bad guys, beating people up and getting beaten up, and endlessly chasing people and being chased.  The only real difference among the three books is that they are set in different exotic cities.This isn't to say that they're badly written.  They're not; I don't think Ridley Pearson could write badly.  It's just that they're not good enough to capture my interest and hold it to the end.Of course, interest in thrillers is highly individual.  My gem can be your steaming pile of do-do.  All I can say is that for me, this book and the two that precede it in the series are OK genre are OK but no better.  And they just don't measure up to what I know Ridley Pearson is capable of.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TKFXLD1QEYE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399163743#wasThisHelpful","R2TKFXLD1QEYE9","A1IUTYIY6PW8DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUTYIY6PW8DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of course, coffee reviews are completely subjective.  My nectar of the gods might be your swill.  However, I think Smile Jamaica is very good coffee.I'm actually a little surprised.  The description and packaging are more than a little cutesy, with Bob Marley quotations, tropical colors, etc.  The coffee inside is the real deal, though.  The product blurb promises ""...a rich flavor, balanced acidity and full body..."" that ""...leaves a sweet, mellow, lingering finish.""  Yep, that's exactly what I experienced.I'd happily order more-- except for one thing, the thing that accounts for my 4-star rating, rather than 5-star: The price.

"I buy the Best American Sports Writing every year, and it's always worth the price.  Of course, some years are better than others, and that's due to a unique feature of the series:  Every year, there is a different guest editor.  This year's editor, Christopher McDougall, has done an excellent job.Sports writing has always had a difficult time being taken seriously.  Indeed, there are those who claim that writing about what amount to kid games is trivial and amounts to nothing more than reporting the details of those games.  However, the writing in this collection focuses on events at the intersection of kid games and the darker side of the ""real world,"" and there were some major happenings at that intersection during the year.The collection features stories about the Boston Marathon bombing, the Aaron Hernandez murder investigation, the head injury controversies that are consuming football and boxing, and so on.  Further, most of the essays are character-driven.  That is, they focus on the people involved in the events, not simply on the details of the events.  The result is stories that capture one's attention and that remain memorable.This collection demonstrates something that most of us have known all along:  Good sports writing is simply good writing.  This is an excellent addition to the series, and I recommend it most highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S4BMO7L4L6J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544147006#wasThisHelpful","R2S4BMO7L4L6J4","A1IUTYIY6PW8DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUTYIY6PW8DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This year's guest editor, John Sullivan, has done an excellent job.Having said that, though, I found that the twenty or so essays in the collection were darker and heavier than has been the case in recent past years.  Many of them deal with difficult topics, such as child abuse and neglect, aging and dying, and racism.  The essays were generally shorter than in past years, too, and this, I think, concentrated the effect they had on me.

This book, however, is a strange and disappointing addition to that series.First, the good:  The material is excellent, though it is clearly intended for those who are completely new to OSX.  It's a hand-holding guide to the basic operations of the operating system.  I can picture someone who's never seen a Mac sitting down with this book and learning how to make it do what they need done.  However, anyone who wants any depth needs to know that these books simply don't offer it.  Those who want detailed guides would be far better off buying ""OSX Mavericks: the Missing Manual,"" by David Pogue.Now, the bad:  The production values for this book are terrible.  Every other ""Teach Yourself Visually..."" manual I've ever seen features clear color screen shots.  The whole point of these books is that the user can read what to do and then see what the screen should look like.  Unfortunately, in this book, the screen shots are black-and-white; even worse, they're washed out, as if they were several generation old photocopies.  This makes the screen shots very, VERY difficult to use.  You simply cannot see most of them clearly enough.My bottom line:  Buy a different guide to OSX.

The blade can only be removed or inserted with the knife locked in a partially opened position.

Several reviewers have commented that the selection seems inconsistent to them.  Well, yes.  It is, after all, a collection of stories selected by an individual editor.  It would be very surprising to find universal agreement about the wisdom of his or her choices every year.For me, the significance of this collection every year is that it in effect takes the pulse of the mystery writing fraternity.  In my view, the pulse this year is strong, and the fraternity is healthy.  Every year, the series editor, Otto Penzler, reminds us that the definition of mystery is quite broad.  That's true this year, as well, and the stories range from what I'd call literary fiction to classic noir stories.  For me, this is a strength.  It allows me to read some stories I probably wouldn't have considered as mysteries if I had been leafing through the magazines that contained them.I think some of the stories are much stronger than others, but the collection as a whole is very strong.  It's a great read, and I recommend it most highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMI4MLTX6DNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544034600#wasThisHelpful","RWMI4MLTX6DNU","A1IUTYIY6PW8DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUTYIY6PW8DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being a pragmatist, I initially thought that this rack would have been so much better if it were square or rectangular and included more holes. My wife disagreed, and is probably right. Her argument was that were not going to be making 22 stuffed peppers for ourselves. In other words, if were using the capacity of the rack, were probably entertaining; and if were entertaining she feels that the form and presentation is as important as the function. Like I said, shes probably right.As far as function, the rack works quite well in the grill. Just be sure that if your grill has a bun toaster or similar half-rack, mind the spacing. I know that if I were not careful, there is a good chance that my stuffed peepers could become unstuffed in short order. Because the peppers are inserted into the rack vertically, if the temperature is consistent within the grill, the issue of one over cooked side can largely be avoidedand, of course, the stuffing wont fall out. The only relative downside is that the holes in the rack are all the same size, so, unless your peppers are uniformly sized within a fairly narrow band of diameters, there is a risk that they will be too big or too small to utilize the rack.All in all, its a neat little tool that adds some fun to a gathering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EU1PXH2GFK31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B58A1NW#wasThisHelpful","R3EU1PXH2GFK31","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The central heat in our house is such that by setting the thermostat to a point that my wife and I would feel comfortably warm on a cold night in our master bedroom, our sons room is transformed into a veritable sauna. Obviously, we would rather be a little chilly than force this upon our child, so we needed a solution. This heater is our solution.So far weve only had one night cool enough to necessitate its use, but it worked like a charm. Our master bedroom is about 12x20x10 and the Honeywell was more than enough to supplement our central system. Whats more, because of the thermostat on the space heater, we didnt wake up drenched in sweat. It seemed to maintain a fairly consistent temperature throughout the night. I also liked that I could operate the necessities of the unit from bed with the included remote.We have two dogs that sleep in our room at night, and tend to seek out the warm spots. I was a bit concerned that they would curl up next to the unit and activate the motion sensing automatic shut-off. Luckily, they would need to get  and stay  pretty close to the unit for it to turn off and stay off; it seems like the threshold is a few inches. So all in all, Im glad that the safety feature is there, but its not so sensitive that it prevent normal operation.I will say that I dont know if this particular unit would have the juice to heat our entire room if we didnt also have our central system piping in the slightest amount of warmth. That being said, if one is going to try to provide some ambient heat with this unit in a larger  but enclosed  space, I would recommend a little circulation fan like Honeywell TurboForce Fan, HT-900, as well. We have one in our room, and I feel like it provided more of an envelope of heat than the hairdryer effect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21B3XTA9RPOJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNBKB64#wasThisHelpful","R21B3XTA9RPOJM","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im sure that anyone other than the most diehard AC fans will be a little hesitant to pick up this latest installment in the franchise if they had early release exposure to Unity. Well, I dont mind saying that  although its not quite at Black Flag status  this is a needed win for AC. That is, it suffers from no more glitches than one would expect from any other newly released title, it captures what has been enjoyable about the AC series from the beginning, and it adds a few new factors to remind you that youre playing a new title.Nothing is shockingly different about the gameplay of Syndicate, but the addition of a rope launcher (it is what it sounds like), and the folding-in of a twin character that essentially divides the main character into two slightly different characters adds enough of a different flavor to justify its addition into to ones library. While the environment does not alter the gameplay experience as drastically as that of Black Flag, the time period chosen seems to fit the heart of the AC series well; it also adds a bit of relevant socioeconomic commentaryif thats your cup of tea.If you have enjoyed Assassins Creed at its best, Syndicate will not let you down. It provides the stunning graphics and enjoyable storyline that fans have grown accustomed to, without the fatal glitches that plagued Unity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4ENEVU5YJ7BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X87MH0I#wasThisHelpful","R4ENEVU5YJ7BY","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our son is two and a half, and loves dinosaurs. Although he hasnt seen the movie yet  just the product commercials and film trailers  he is also in love with the kid friendly dinosaur characters from The Good Dinosaur movie. So when his mother and I broke out this game, he was thrilled. Honestly, though, even if it were a terrible game, he probably would have been thrilled. Luckily, for us, I think the game is pretty novel.In reading some of the other reviews I noticed that many people seem to be familiar with the cooperative game model. For me this was a first. Its not that I dont enjoy participating in some goodhearted competition with my family, but this game was a nice change of pace. I think the cooperative nature of the game also made it easier for us to play with our son  instead of just having to play for him in more complex competitive games. The format seemed to get him much more involved and appeared to add to his overall enjoyment in the activity. I suppose seeing him contribute to the team also made it a little more fun for his mother and me, too. After all, one can only derive satisfaction from demolishing a two-year-old in checkers so many times.The game itself is simplistic and a little shaky at times, but I think it is perfect for parents that want to engage in an everybody wins or everybody loses game with their small children.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17KEAWSE94TCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5P1Z0O#wasThisHelpful","R17KEAWSE94TCB","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its neat that these AAs contain recycled batteries. Its also great that theyre Energizers longest lasting alkaline battery.At the time that this review is being written, a twelve pack of these batteries will set you back $16.72 and Energizer Max AA batteries, 12 Count is priced at $8.79. To me, this begs the question: if these batteries cost nearly twice as much as Energizers comparable alkaline product, do they last nearly twice as long, or are they nearly twice as beneficial to the environment (depending on the factor you plug into your personal impact-on-environment utility formula)?From my own experience, I do not believe that these batteries last anywhere close to twice as long. Compounding an apparent lack of value, while I wish I knew the difference in environmental impact between these batteries and the Max product, I have to imagine that including 4% recycled material  although a positive  does not justify such a price jump. I cant help but think that the $8 one could save by buying the Max batteries could do more environmental good if redirected toward some specific cause, if one were so inclined.Recycling batteries is great!

"I have developed a bit of a passion for taking pictures of the sky; particularly interesting clouds.

I have had the opportunity to utilize both polarizers, and they seem to be identical in every way with the exception of the 8th nano-coating layer added, which purports to make the filter easier to clean.

"We have two little dogs, a Papillion mix and a Pomeranian. I mention this because the retraction strength on this leash is a little much for our five pound Pom, but no problem for our 12 pound Pap. I dont necessarily mind that it has a bit of tug to it  particularly towards the end of the extension capacity  because it seems to discourage too much pullinga little, anyway.One stand out feature is that this leash is tape-style for the entirety of its length; as opposed to tape-style for the first two feet and chord-style for the remaining length. I like this for two reasons. One, it feels more sturdy, like a traditional leash. Two, if the pup at the end of the leash gets tangled up between our  or our neighbors  legs, there is much less chance for the nasty rope burns that the chord-style leashes are notorious for. The primary drawbacks for this style leash is that it gives up about 5 to 7 feet in length to a similar sized chord-style leash, and, presumably because it takes a little more juice to get it reeled in, it has a little more resistance than a similar sized chord-style leash. The latter issue, as I mentioned before, might pose a problem for the smallest of pups.I also like the 3 action button on this leash. Its a little different than the various sliding/gliding locks that Ive experience on other leases because its just one solid button with, what I like to call, a clutch. I think its a little bit easier to use, but I fear that it might be more prone to future malfunction. Ill come back and update this review if my malfunction fears are ever realized.All in all, its a great little leash that feels comfortable in the hand, is easy to operate, and does its job well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XU7MFEWIBCD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0133LPAWK#wasThisHelpful","R1XU7MFEWIBCD6","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, if youre reading this, I strongly recommend that you read the review of this knife by Storm. Storm obviously knows their stuff. As for my own, less knowledgeable, opinion; this knife is not worth the $140 that it is listed for at the time that this review is being written.I suspected as soon as I was able to see and handle the packaging in which the knife arrived that this knife is a high margin product for the manufacturer that is meant to look expensive, but did not cost much to produce. Once I held the knife itself in my hands, my initial feelings were confirmed. The balance and form of the knife was all wrong. I have handled a few very nice chef and utility knives, and each felt like they were meant to be used. That is, their balance point and ergonomics promoted ease of use with regard to the typical functions one might expect to use them for. This knife, on the other hand, has the balance of a discount bin hatchet.While it might feel like a $5 hatchet, it looks like an expensive knife. However, for a hundred and forty dollars  if looks are ones goal  it might be possible to pick up a mother of pearl knife that is actually mother of pearl and not acrylic.The one positive that this knife has going for it as a cutting instrument, is that it has a pretty great edge right out of the box. Unfortunately, this edge doesnt hold for too longand then youre just left with a very expensive, albeit attractive, lower-middle of the line knife.Im disappointed. I think it is worth maybe $50 to $60 dollars on the basis of its attractive appearance and out-of-the-box edge, but the current $140 price tag is a premium knife priceand this, in my opinion, is not a premium quality knife.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365RO643MG2FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYHNFRG#wasThisHelpful","R365RO643MG2FW","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I expected this watch to be much more toy-like than it is. If this watch were introduced even seven or so years ago, there would have been adults lining up around the block to pick up wristwear with this watchs capabilities. That is to say, for kids  under eight or nine  this is still a lot of pretty functional tech. Even for adults, its not difficult to be amazed by what all theyve packed into this gadget for a reasonable price.When I put it on my sons wrist the first time, I was concerned that the touch screen would be cheap and buggy. Surprisingly, its not. In fact, all of the components are pretty high quality, and the hardware interacts seamlessly with the software. Again, Im impressed.My second concern was that utilization of the watch would not be as intuitive as some of the tablets our child has had access to. Our son is not yet three, and I can say that  with a few occasional exceptions  he can navigate his way around the pretty expansive library of games and functions without much issue. That being said, he did require some first time instruction on how some of the games and functions worked, but navigation is a breeze. Im confident that children as young as three-and-a-half to four would not even have an issue figuring out how everything worked, as many of the apps have handy tutorials.The games and activities arent going to teach your child Mandarin or anything, but most have a thin educational veil, and all are child friendly.Neither the microphone nor the camera quality are great; but I feel silly even saying it, because this is a $60 wrist computer built for five-year-oldsamazing!Unfortunately, I guessor not, our kids have been spoiled by super accessible high tech gadgets, so I think the luster of this device might wear off in the six to seven year old range. For the really little ones, though, I think they still get a pretty big kick out of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRMINC3LTNURH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCZV0I4#wasThisHelpful","RRMINC3LTNURH","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read an article a while back that mapped out how much phantom power expenses from devices such as TVs, gaming consoles, sound systems, and various media players could cost over the course of a year. I was pretty surprised, and encourage everyone to search out a similar outline of these potential costs. I mention this because, I was thrilled when I received this power strip due to the potential energy savings without having to do anything other than plug in my biggest energy vampireswithin reach of the strip, of course.This strip will automatically turn off up to four devices (although the description on the product page says three) that are not in use; as in when they are in sleep or idle mode. For me, I chose to plug in the television, PS4, and a sound system  each of which defaults to a sleep state as opposed to turning completely off. By my very rough calculations, I anticipate that I could potentially save a minimum of $45 a year  and a maximum of much more  just with these devices!I saw that other reviewers felt that the outlets were too crowded on this strip, which is true. But, for the anti-phantom power outlets, there is ample space for at least three devices, although there are four controlled outlets.The strip has rotating outlet covers, which is nice but not quite child safe in my mind. That being the case, I would probably consider picking up some old school outlet covers if you have little ones in the house.All in all, for the price, I think this strip is well worth it even with the crowded outlets! One has the opportunity to save some cash from the controlled outlets, and a few other outlets that work as most other power strips do so you dont have to reset your DVR every other day. Considering the lifetime limited product warranty, and the limited connected equipment warranty, I feel comfortable saying that under normal use this product should pay for itself many times over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEMHIFR1HP5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZY07UG#wasThisHelpful","RPEMHIFR1HP5M","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At this price point with free shipping - considering that it weighs a little less than a hundred pounds - one can't expect too much, I suppose. Once the piece is assembled it does look pretty sharp, so that's something.My wife was chomping at the bit to get this set up, and so she was all over the assembly. Because I've seen her at work on other pieces, I know that as long as the instructions are accurate and descriptive, and the pieces and holes are machined properly, she's good to go. Unfortunately, in this case, the instructions were not crystal clear, and a couple of the holes were not perfectly sized and/or placed; which dramatically increased the difficulty of the task. By the time I was finished working, and was able to help her out, she had worked around most of the issues, so I went back and bored out a couple of the holes and cleared up the instructional confusion. All in all, it probably took about an hour and a half to get it assembled. Admittedly, some of that was stretched out by the early frustrations my wife experienced.But like I said, when it's completed it doesn't look bad at all. Unfortunately, almost the entire piece is made of particle board. A trait of particle board is that, if it bumps into something or something into it, it doesn't chip or dent like wood. Instead, it crushes and crumbles. While we were moving the assembled chest of drawers into our bedroom, the top surface banged a doorframe, and created a noticeable crush mark. The best option we had was to dig out the affected area and apply the included furniture scratch paint to try to make it look like a wound on real wood. It's not perfect, but from a distance it passes.I mention the construction material because I think that this would be good as a semi-permanent starter piece that might spend a few years in the same spot. I just fear that this piece would not hold up terribly well during a move. So while it might be tempting - unless you're okay with it only lasting a year or so - this might not make the best choice if you're headed to college or are otherwise generally transitory.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Q5FY6X31122/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H24EMFQ#wasThisHelpful","R12Q5FY6X31122","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thankfully, I don't suffer from full face breakouts anymore. But I do still battle with my nose pores and the occasional problem spot. So, for my purposes, this cream works well. I believe that applying it prior to bed diminishes the damage caused by my perpetually oily nose pores, as they seemed to have reduced in diameter within a few days of starting the treatment. I also feel like it diminishes the duration of the occasional problem zit.The cream does not feel heavy or oily, and once it's applied I can't tell it's there; which is a big deal for me. I did let my sister-in-law try it out for about a week, and she was applying it to her entire face. This, as one might imagine, created some dry skin issues.

"My father was an elementary school teacher for much of his adult life, so, while I knew my own child's pleased reaction to the set, I wanted to get his take on whether or not this set might be appropriate for the classroom.His reaction was that it would certainly be appropriate for the classroom, and would probably be best suited for the 8 to 10 year age range. He believed the set would be a good challenging for the eight year olds, and although less so for the 10 year olds it would still be a fun project. He felt that while the projects are neat individually, that kids would get over it quickly - as I found to be true in the case of my own son. To really get the most mileage out of this set, he believes that it would be worth it to pick up a few of the sets and take advantage of the multiple radio frequencies on the controllers to enable several children to let their creations interact. He insists that the children will almost inevitably turn their creations into miniature battle-bots, but that it will still progress their mechanical creativity.As for my own thoughts, the set is fun and a great means to introduce children to mechanics and mechanisms. I have to agree with my father that, once each of the critters has been built, there is little to keep a youngster interested; so this set is probably best in multiples over the long-term.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZLJ8Z0HVIRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF8Z7ZG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZLJ8Z0HVIRP","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife loves a tablescape, and this Halloween table runner is the perfect touch! Unless one is actually handling the runner, it appears to be of a much higher quality than what the price would suggest. Whereas a more expensive runner would have a fabric border sewn onto the woven majority, both the border and the image are printed onto this runner. While it's not going to win any awards as a work of craftsmanship, it gets the job done, and it is probably much more practical than an artisan piece. That is, if someone spills the punchbowl on it, few tears will be shed.Measure your table before you pick this up. Depending on what you're looking for, it might be a little short. 72 inches is six feet - a common dining table length.

"I work in an office where about 15 employees and all of our clients share two his and hers restrooms. Unfortunately, when someone has to use a semi-public restroom, it is often due to a little extra stress on the bowels. Our only remedy for alleviating the resulting odor has traditionally been aerosol air freshener; which usually does not do an excellent job of dealing with the scent it was meant to mask, and frequently provides the additional benefit of being headache inducing when used in quantity.Not to go into too much detail, Poo-Pourri works pretty well - definitely better than its aerosol counterpart - when used as directed.

"I'm not a watch person - for clarity, I should say that I might be a watch person if I weren't so cheap - but it is kind of a ""thing"" in my profession to wear a ludicrous watch; so, by exposure, I've become quite sensitive to the more subtle factors that can prevent a decent looking watch from producing the desired sense of wonder in others. Another point of clarity - if one were wearing a watch for utilitarian purposes, as opposed to peacocking a bit for others, no one would where anything other than a $25 dollar Timex Ironman.So this watch looks great! Almost every person that I've shown it to has said something to the effect of ""Wow that's nice! What kind of watch is that?"" It is nice that Swiss Legend is not really a recognizable brand, so some might assume it's a boutique brand. Some. The devil, unfortunately, is in the details.One of my pet peeves is the way a watch band sounds. That's right, the band. In a truly high quality metallic band, when the band comes in contact with a hard surface, like a desk or countertop, it has a heavy, thick sound. I would imagine that this is due to the density of the metal it is made with. A dead giveaway for a watch that only appears to be higher in quality is that, while it looks and might even feel heavy, when the band comes into contact with a desk or countertop it produces a tinny, higher pitched sound. This watch produces that sound. The second giveaway that this watch is not as high in quality as it appears is that, when the individual band links rub together - which is virtually anytime the wearer of the watch moves - it produces a squeaking sound. While I don't know what causes this sound - although I would have to imagine that it is less than perfectly smooth edges creating friction - you will not hear it from a higher quality watch.To top off the looks can be deceiving quotient of this watch, the buttons and dials are a little sticky; or, at least, less than fluid.There is no doubt that this watch is a stunner to look at. So if you're only concerned about how it looks, and you don't believe that the people around you will pick up on some of the telling subtleties, then this watch might get the job done. However, this watch might produce something other than your intentions among folks that have been around nicer watches. That is, it could make you look like you went out and bought a watch that only looks expensive in an effort to peacock a bit...which can result in the opposite effect of truly impressive plumage.If your concern truly is a decent quality, metal band timepiece, Fossil is a reasonable option at this price point. I know that people see Fossil and think inexpensive watch, but if you want people to see a watch and think expensive watch, it's probably better to buy an expensive watch than to look like a faker. No judgement, though. The fact that I don't have the money, or the desire to spend real money on a timepiece is precisely why I won't wear an expensive looking timepiece. It is a matter of opinion for sure but, in my opinion, one could get a higher quality watch for the same amount that one would spend on this watch, but other people would probably be aware that the higher quality watch is not an expensive one, on a relative basis.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JUIBU5QQSIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XONEDU#wasThisHelpful","R37JUIBU5QQSIF","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Installation was a breeze. It took 15 minutes, tops. And I believe if one were in a rush, it could get done even quicker.My primary concern was that it was not water tight. Although it is mounted far enough forward on the trailer that it should never enter the water, it is not impossible. One dip would probably do the interior components in. My father had the bright idea of sealing the lid with a bead of marine silicone to keep in water tight. After all, this will only be getting used in an emergency, and if I have to pop the seal, I can just clean it and reseal it until the next use.Now this is steel, so it will rust over time, but I feel that if an effort is made to keep it above the water line, and if it is given a fresh water hose down after being around saltwater, it should last at least a few years.For me, the real benefit of this set is that one will never be without a jack in an emergency...because you know that the one time you forget to throw your trailer jack in the back of the truck is the time you'll get a flat. As long as it hangs out in the $60 - $75 price point, it's probably worth it for the peace of mind alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10NCRGJVMP7L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBN1C78#wasThisHelpful","R10NCRGJVMP7L7","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son is two-and-a-half, which is well below the recommended age of 5. But this boy loves his Hot Wheels, so I didn't mind giving him a crack at this set under close supervision.Because he isn't the most patient child, I had to put it together while he was asleep to avoid any major meltdowns. Assembly was actually pretty easy; particularly so once I decided to look at the instructions. This might not seem like a big deal, but I was really pleased to see that most of the stickers had already been applied to the set...which is usually my biggest source of frustration with something like this. The box is also perforated on the back panel, for super easy access to all of the pieces. This was another big help to dear old dad. I would say that total construction time was about 20 minutes. I think I probably could have gotten it done quicker if I needed to, but I was in no hurry and just kind of took my time.The morning after assembly, I placed the set in our living room - primarily because it's one of the only rooms in the house big enough to contain this behemoth (this thing is roughly 7.5 feet wide - including the tracks - by about 2' 3"" tall, by about 2 feet deep - again, including the tracks). As soon as I got my son out of bed I told him that he had a surprise in the living room. He picked up his favorite plush toys - which he takes everywhere - and ran into the living room. As soon as he caught a glimpse of the garage, he dropped his plush tagalongs and bum rushed the set! He didn't stop saying ""WOW"" for the next two hours!I had already put all of his cars on the set, so he was rocking and rolling from jump street. He did require a little council on how to use the tracks without separating the components, but, even at his age, he figured it out. He can now use the side-by-side downhill race component, the elevators, and the simple tracks without assistance. He hasn't quite figured out how to reset the shark stunt yet, but he enjoys it nonetheless. A child even a year or two older probably wouldn't have any problem operating everything included with this set on their own.I have to admit that I cannot comment on the lights and sounds functions of this set. My son is just a little too young to determine that more is sometimes less when it comes to lights and sounds; so for the sanity of my wife and I, I didn't even install batteries...which are not included, by the way.I don't know that I've ever seen my boy so pumped about a toy for so. And watching him enjoy it is so pleasing to me. Hot Wheels has definitely done it again. This set is sturdy and super fun! If you've got about 15 square feet of floor space to spare, and a Hot Wheels enthusiast at home, then I highly recommend this set!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRE2XZKJ5427/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TR1Q#wasThisHelpful","RYRE2XZKJ5427","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the ""Chrome"" version of this showerhead, which could probably best be described as chromed plastic. My only disappointment with this head is that it feels a little chintzier than I expected. However, with the metal variety costing almost a whole hundred dollars more, chromed plastic might be the way to go. It looks metal, anyway.While I understand that the temperature gauge is a little gimmicky, the shower in our master tends to change temperatures quickly. This isn't a big deal for my wife and I, but when our little one needs a quick spritz, we bath him in our shower. Of course, we always test the temperature regardless of what the thermostat says, but once we have the head off its base and are actively involved in the bathing process, it is nice to be able to see if the temperature begins to rise or fall. Unfortunately, when looking down at the head from above - as we do when we're bathing our son - the temperature reads in reverse...but it's not too difficult to figure it out!The various spray selections are pretty standard issue, and cover all of the bases. I have found that the button utilized to change settings on this head is much more convenient to use that the knobs or spinning head faces that I've encountered in the past. We have been using the head for about a month and have not experienced the difficulties switching between spray settings that other reviewers have. If it goes on the fritz, I'll come back and update this review.If you plan on installing this head yourself, I would recommend that you pick up some plumber's tape and a set of Channellock pliers to diminish the risk of leaks. The hose needed to be secured to the base of the system much tighter than I could accomplish by hand to achieve a leak-free seal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REE6671WU3X2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPPQ8O0#wasThisHelpful","REE6671WU3X2Q","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our third shower caddy, in as many years. While we enjoyed both of our previous caddies, they shared a weak link; rust!This caddy has plenty of room for everything we need in the shower, with a deep and wide top shelf, and slot to hold a razor. A second razor slot would have been ideal, but I have managed to hang my razor between the bars on the bottom shelf. I also appreciate the fact that this caddy came with two suction cups that attach to the bottom shelf and adhere to the shower wall. This helps keep the caddy from swinging out of balance when a heavier bottle of shampoo - or anything else - is taken from one side of the caddy.The best feature by far, however, is the promise that this shower caddy will never rust! I am hopeful that we will be putting this thing to use for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFZEX8Y92JBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWQ7ZNA#wasThisHelpful","RKFZEX8Y92JBT","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kettle is a great replacement for our old Chef's Choice cordless kettle. While we enjoyed the old kettle for years, the Aroma provides a few upgrades that are greatly appreciated. Namely, the variable temperature and keep warm settings.My wife and I got into loose teas for a time, and really enjoyed making custom blends. However, with our old kettle, we only had one temperature setting: done. Because we enjoyed different teas, we found ourselves having to wait around for the water to cool down to white and some green temperatures. Likewise, because there was not a keep warm setting on the old kettle we often had to wait quite a while for the kettle to heat back up if we wanted multiple cups of a black or herbal tea.The Aroma conveniently solves these temperature issues while still providing the features we loved about our old kettle, such as a cordless pitcher with corded base, an easy to read water level indicator, and super sturdy construction.We have gotten away from loose teas in favor of the more convenient prepackaged variety, but I believe that I would like to take another crack at the wonderful world of loose teas, now that I can control the water temperature more conveniently.I definitely recommend this kettle!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFY4C2R0CJE7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY2NDAE#wasThisHelpful","RFY4C2R0CJE7C","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My only relevant point of comparison is my trusty Toshiba Canvio Basics 3.0 1TB drive, so I'll lean on that heavily for my review.Surprisingly, the Seagate game drive is actually slimmer than the Toshi, while only about an eighth of an inch wider; which is nice for transport and storage. They seem about equivalent in weight and apparent quality of construction.I had a hard time finding any detailed specs for the Seagate, but the disk speed and transfer rates of the Toshiba are 5400RPM and 480 MB/s, respectively. I would say that the Seagate seems just as quick if not slightly quicker than the Toshiba, which, in turn, seems quicker to me than the internal drive.While it's probably not recommended, an issue with heat has not yet arisen from the drive being kept directly on top of the console.I have to admit that I don't have any friends... I mean, I haven't actually taken the drive to any one of my many friends' homes to try to play a game stored on the drive through their console. According to Seagate, as long as the owner of the game has their Xbox live login, it's not an issue; so I guess I'll have to take their word for it for now.At the time that this review is being written, the price is $129 on Amazon. While it's neat to look at, and potentially a touch speedier than a Toshiba, I don't know that the price differential is worth it. However, I strongly suspect that the price will drift closer to sub $100 in short order to become more competitive, in which case I'd put it in the you might as well category. Hopefully, once the official release date hits, the actual specs will be relinquished so we can determine if it's actually superior to the Toshi or if I'm just falling victim to a pretty green placebo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BVAOCEG2X0HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01065S79E#wasThisHelpful","R2BVAOCEG2X0HP","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our son is two, and he really likes his VTech Go sets. He received the VTech Go! Go! Smart Wheels Train Station Playset and the VTech Go! Go! Smart Wheels Police Station Playset for Christmas and his birthday last year, respectively. While both of these sets are enjoyable, neither hold a candle to this RC set!The advantages that the RC set has over some of the other sets are the remote controlled play, non-forced track interaction, and an easily established circuit.The remote control is great. There are two buttons: forward and reverse. While the reverse button is almost never used, it still gives the operator the feeling of control and choice; as opposed to the fully autonomous, perpetually running cars that come with other sets. I also think that the buttons help the younger users, like our son, establish an awareness of relayed cause and effect.On both of the other tracks that we've used, on at least one segment of the track, the fully autonomous vehicle comes to a point that requires the child to perform some task in order for the vehicle to continue on its path. For older users, this is probably fine, and, perhaps, preferable. However, for those in the 12 - 36 month range, these interactions with the track have a high likelihood of separating track components, requiring older and/or steadier hands to continuously repair the track almost every time the vehicle comes to the point of forced interaction. In my experience this is not fun for the child playing with the set or the guardian forced to play track engineer. On the RC set, however, these interactive segments can be played with manually, if so desired, or they are operated automatically by a small gear on the bottom of the car. Our favorite of these interaction points is the automatically ascending and descending elevator!Finally, and maybe most importantly, the track pieces that come with the RC set easily build into a complete and continuous circuit without much effort, even after the instructions are lost or destroyed. On our other sets, there appear to be more crossways. These pieces always seem to leave a section of the completed track exposed to simply dumping the vehicle off of the circuit. I'm sure it is my fault for unknowingly losing one of the replaceable bumper sections that make these intersections into corners, but I have just found it easier to consistently build a continuous track with the RC set.All in all, I believe that this set provides more bang per buck than any of the other sets we've seen to date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E099P3YX2UJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUZH8DE#wasThisHelpful","R3E099P3YX2UJ8","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First let me say that the product dimensions currently listed are way off at 5.8"" x 1.6"" x 5.4"". This unit is much larger than I was expecting. It is about 10.5""W x 3""H x 5.75""D. A pretty large alarm clock. While it's not an issue for us, I wanted to point this out just in case you're working with a crowded nightstand.We've really enjoyed this system so far. From a standard alarm clock standpoint, it's tops! Alarms can be set for every conceivable duration and occasion and, most importantly for me, it's dimmable.As a sound system, it's also great! My wife has been looking for a nice little set of speakers to plug into her phone so she can listen to music while getting ready in the morning. The iHome has filled this void. Bluetooth is a snap to set up, and the speakers are more than capable of filling our bedroom and attached bathroom with pretty high quality sound.I know that there are other standalone Bluetooth speaker systems out there that might produce a higher quality in terms of sonic range, but the difference in sound is almost indiscernible, while the difference in price is not.

"This product is so bad that I have had a hard time coming up with a way to creatively describe it. I'll try to take it step-by-step.The product is difficult to use for an adult, let alone for the age range that the product is intended for. There was no way that my son or nieces would have been able to effectively apply the special DohVinci Play-Doh without my help. That is, it requires a fair amount of strength to force the ""doh"" out of its tube and onto the project.Unfortunately, once the tacky-ish substance has been manhandled out of its tube, it just kind of worms around without actually adhering to the project. Imagine forcing Play-Doh out of a tube onto a slowly spinning anything, and you've got a pretty decent mental image of what this product is. Yes, the DohVinci doh is stickier than regular Play-Doh, but not nearly sticky enough.After the kids have experienced the disappointment of not being strong enough to apply the dough-like substance themselves, and the substance not being sticky enough to stay on the project without a lot of poking and prodding, they are left with all the excitement of a finished product that is dried up Play-Doh on whatever.The one redeeming - and it's not actually redemptive - quality of this set is the small blinking LED lights. My son and I like to turn these on in a dark room and do funny strobe dances. However, I believe that these lights were added as an afterthought once the creators realized just how dull the toy was. While fun for other reasons, saying that these lights improve the product would probably be akin to celebrating Campbell's for the enjoyment derived from soup can telephones. I can appreciate that they make something that I enjoy, but I can't imagine that they had my means of enjoyment in mind when they designed it.I would avoid this set until they improve the formula of the DohVinci ""doh.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IRRKUYVIS7PZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPMDQWI#wasThisHelpful","R3IRRKUYVIS7PZ","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son loves Cars. Naturally, he was thrilled to receive this playset. The excitement waned quickly, however.In my opinion, the lack of sustained enthusiasm was in large part due to the set's design. The color changing car rolls onto a platform on the set's lower level, where it is sprayed from a bottle filled with cold water, changing its color - the color changing is neat, without a doubt. Then the car is manually lifted in place on its platform to the second level where it is dumped onto a ramp that leads the car to a warm water pool, reverting the car back to its original color. Yes, this is an exceptionally short and, after a few circuits, boring process, but the real issue might be with the mechanics of the process. The components, other than the cold water bottle and the car itself, are surprisingly low quality. Combine a bunch of low quality components, add motion, and what one gets is a herky-jerky heap of not much fun. That is, nothing that moves does so smoothly and without much effort.To top things off, additional color changing cars are not inexpensive. As of the time of that this review is being written, additional color changing cars cost at least $12.50 each. One can see how this might add up. Honestly, if the set itself were of a higher quality, and a little more involved, I could see investing in a few additional pieces. As it stands, though, I feel like it would just be throwing good money after bad.My son loves the included car and still plays with it regularly, along with his other cars. Not surprisingly, he could care less about the set at this point. I can't say I blame him. I feel like this was a weak effort from Mattel; particularly because these are the same folks that make the Hot Wheels sets and cars that have yet to disappoint.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166VGMDM3JUFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TFYK#wasThisHelpful","R166VGMDM3JUFC","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It also does a great job keeping a beverage cold over prolonged periods of time... even under Florida's hot summer sun.While it might seem silly to some, my wife has been diligently using the bands to monitor her water intake throughout the day. She acknowledges the fact that she gets busy at work and simply doesn't make time to drink enough water because she has other things that require more attention. Since using the tumbler she has set a goal of how much to drink by what time and the bands make it easy to track her progress.

"My son is 26 months, well below the 36 month recommended age, but I feel comfortable about him playing with Jake's ship under supervision. The only real chokable is Jake's removable sword, other than that, everything is pretty sizable.With the mandatory dad disclosure out of the way, I am pleased to say my boy really enjoys this toy! He is a fan of Jake and the Neverland Pirates, but I'm not sure that he made the connection between the show and the playset; so I believe he enjoys the set on its own merits, as opposed to its connection with the show.The ship is set on wheels that, when rolled across the floor, activate sword fighting action between Jake and a man in a shark suit - whom I don't recognize from the show. The ship is designed to resemble a shark. Accordingly, the front of the ship is shaped like a shark's head, and the lower jaw also performs a chomping motion when the ship's wheels are rotated.To enable the sword fighting action of the two figurines, they must be placed on pegs that, unfortunately, are a touch difficult to line up with the input on the bottom of the figurines... even for dad. When the Jake and Man-in-a-shark-suit figurines are removed from their respective motion activation pegs, they still provide some action, via the suits chomping jaws and Jake's swashbuckling arm lever.The set is a bit stout in price, but I have to say that this set is sturdy compared to some of the other playsets that we've recently come across. It is made from robust plastic, and is well assembled. I have personally seen it repeatedly dropped on a tile floor from approximately two and a half feet about a hundred times, and it's still ticking.

"While it is not one of the headline benefits that are claimed by this product, I was personally excited to give it a shot for its claims about pore reduction. I was also hoping that it might help smooth out the tone of my skin.Being that I have rather large pores, if a product is working towards their reduction, it is relatively easy to tell if it's getting the job done. For example I used bliss Micro Magic Microdermabrasion Treatment, 3 fl. oz. for a while, and, before I stopped using it because it was getting too costly, I could easily discern that my pores were shrinking. In contrast, even after several weeks of using the Face FX, I did not notice even the slightest bit of improvement. The same was true of my skin tone; although I really wasn't expecting results in that arena.My wife was more concerned with the fine lines around her eyes and mouth. She did feel as if, after repeated uses, there were temporary improvements in the appearance of fine lines, but that any improvement quickly faded. She compared it to the reduction of fine lines - due to mild swelling - that might result if one were to pinch themselves, which would ultimately diminish as the swelling subsided. Even though the results, in her mind, are far from permanent, she believed that she might have continued to utilize the product on a regular basis if it were not for the nonexistent battery life. I certainly agree on this point, the battery life is ludicrously limited.At the very best, if this product is working as claimed, the positive effects appear to be brief. I just don't feel as if the very limited results are worth the time, energy, and money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEHGM2W5FB3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077R67CE#wasThisHelpful","RWEHGM2W5FB3F","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say that this tent is amazing. It's light, compact, easy to set up/breakdown, and comfortably sleeps two, considering its packable dimensions. It seems as if all the other reviewers agree on how great the tent is. I ran into a different issue, however, that I think deserves mentioning.Only after we had used the tent did we realize that we also received a little something extra, a sticker which reads ""WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."" Whoa... what?! We like camping, but not enough to expose ourselves to what sounds like pretty significant health risks.Being a little concerned, I called Kelty to find out what the chemical was, and why they would even offer a product that is so potentially detrimental to one's health. The representative at Kelty was great; super polite, helpful, and forthcoming. He informed me that the tent had to include the warning sticker to be in compliance with California's Proposition 65, the State Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. Prop 65, essentially requires the state to maintain a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer and/or reproductive harm. Cool... right? Who could complain with the state looking out for consumers? So why would Kelty offer this product if it contains a chemical that is known to be toxic? Of course I had to ask.The Prop 65 list contains some 600 chemicals, and if any one of these chemicals are in a product, it needs to be labeled. So while the Kelty rep couldn't give me the exact chemical or chemicals that necessitated the label, he said that the probable candidate is a chemical called Tris, commonly used as a flame retardant. Well, why is it in the product if it is easily identifiable and known to cause bodily harm? All the rep could tell me was that the tent had to be treated to comply with other state regulations. Like I said, the rep was super helpful, and I didn't want him to feel as if I was beating him up about this, so I thanked him, and started looking around on my own.As it turns out, according to California Code of Regulations, Title 19, tents have to be ""treated with an approved exterior chemical process by an approved application concern, or from inherently flame resistant fabric approved and listed by the State Fire Marshal."" It seems to me, then, that, in an effort to be in compliance with Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations, manufactures are able to apply a chemical approved by the state that is also known by the state to cause cancer and/or other reproductive harm. A little crazy, right?I did a little more looking around, and it is actually not that easy to find a tent that doesn't contain toxic flame retardants, which, apparently, have not even been demonstrated to be entirely effective. What's more unfortunate is that tris, in particular, has been found to be capable of releasing into the surrounding environment during the lifetime of the product it is applied to. Yikes!While I am not aware of an easy solution for tent users, I guess I just wanted to bring up an unusual situation that manufactures are being placed in by contradictory governmental regulations that might need some reconsideration. As for myself, I don't think my wife is going to let us continue using this, or any other tent, with this chemical in it; so I guess I'll have to figure something else out.As for my rating of this tent, I'm still going to give it 4 out of 5 stars because the tent itself is awesome. It would just be great if the state didn't put them in a position to utilize a known toxin to ineffectively protect their otherwise great product. I'm docking one star, because I assume that Kelty could choose to make their tents out of inherently flame retardant material. However, I'm not docking more stars because I also assume that this would drive up the price of their product to the point that they would be totally unable to compete in the market place. To me, the onus is on the state. Change the regulation to require the use of inherently flame retardant material and level the playing field among all manufactures, or, at least, don't require/permit the manufactures to use a toxic chemical that, according to some, is ineffectual.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PRZ11Y9LTKJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6KURDI#wasThisHelpful","R3PRZ11Y9LTKJR","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted so earnestly to like this razor. It's interesting to look at, includes a charging base that self-cleans the razor, and came with its own hard-shell travel case. The moment I got it, I set it up to make sure it would have a charge by the time I finished my dinner, about an hour later, because I was so pumped to try it. I had already shaved that morning, so I was working with about 10 hours of growth. And man oh man did it feel great on my face. So much smoother and gentler than my nearly decade old horizontal cutting surface, discount bin Remington. I thought I was in love.The next morning, I had to shave for work, so my standards were much higher on how good of a job this gliding gizmo was doing. Again, not a full day's worth of growth; but I began to notice that I was having to redouble a lot of ground. This was particularly true in the typical hard to manage areas like just below the nostrils, the crevice in the upper lip, the neck, and just below the sideburns. I had to really work to fit the circular cutting surface into these nooks and crannies. One would think that the circular cutting surface would actually be better suited for many of these areas. Nope. I believe that I spent at least twice as long as I normally require getting the job done that morning. The second kick in the gut was that, as the day progressed, I seemed to find more and more errant hairs.I thought that I was probably just falling victim to the learning curve, and stuck it out. Well, the week went on without better results. Just to make matters worse, when I finally had to address my sideburns - as I was unable to properly attend to them with the razor head - I had to physically pop off the razor head to replace it with the clipper head - which otherwise just sits around waiting to get lost - only to discover that, at best, the clipper head was going to provide for the slowing of sideburn creep, because I couldn't get to the slightly longer clipped hair with the circular razor head.Unfortunately, shortly thereafter came the straw that broke my back on this one. I was rocking some two day growth over the weekend - to be clear, my two day growth is probably similar to a proper man's 5 o' clock shadow - and thought ""This is where the circular system is going to shine!"" I was very wrong. It was a train wreck. After trying to get the job done for way too long, I had to bust back out the old Remington that, just a week before, I had hoped to finally resign to the trash heap.While I have gained a lot of respect for my aged Remi', I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this Philips Norelco razor to anyone who plans to let their facial hair grow for longer than a lunch break.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VEZNWW02HBOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDMS#wasThisHelpful","R1VEZNWW02HBOD","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a superb bassist and really only play when I have to. However, I perform with a bassist that is great and we've both had a crack at these strings, so I'll tackle this from two perspectives.Like I said, I don't play frequently. Naturally, my fret fingers are sissified and I can be a bit rough around the frets. What I've found of these strings is that they are very forgiving. Where I would typically expect to get a fair amount of fret buzz, there was much less. Perhaps more importantly, I found that these strings definitely provided my tender digits with noticeably more staying power. I would say, perhaps particularly, for a serious beginner, you will get much more mileage out of each practice/session with these strings than the cheapos. I think this will inspire a lot more satisfaction throughout the learning process, as well!As for my seasoned buddy's experience, he installed them on his Schecter Stilleto Custom 5. They were a little short, as can been seen in the included picture, but he said it didnt seem to produce any adverse consequences. Ideally, an extra-long set would have been better for this guitar.He agreed that these strings produced less fatigue over the course of a several hour performance. Like almost any other strings, he felt that they needed to be broken in a bit before they could hold a solid tune. This process was quick, however, and he said they sounded seasoned comparatively quickly. They also arent too bright out of the box, unlike many uncoated strings. When asked about any stand-out distinctions between these strings and others he has used, he said that the low B produces a fat tone, and the stings are, overall, well balanced in tension in volume.At the end of the day, we both agree that great strings are great strings, regardless of experience level; and these are quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XHNMN0P8P3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002E1O6I#wasThisHelpful","R30XHNMN0P8P3P","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the 1/2 inch drive might be a little beefy for some applications, I like having the extra heft available. I have heard of folks breaking even the comparably hefty 3/8, so I'm not opposed to mixing it up.This particular set will cover the bases for many of the most common applications and, with 72 teeth, will get the job done a little easier. Really, this would be a great set to keep in the trunk or to send off with your child to school. Not to mention the fact that these tools are easy to keep clean, and come with a lifetime guarantee. Unfortunately, the case is not guaranteed; but I can all but guarantee you that this case won't last a lifetime.I'm pumped about the quick-release function! However, I have had a couple of quick-release sets in the past in which the quick release was the first thing to get gummed up and ultimately became the Achilles heel of the set. Although, I do believe this set is of a higher quality than either of those sets, so I'm holding out hope.Overall, it's a solid set at a price that won't break the bank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPUZ3KTAPVAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFKYSDG#wasThisHelpful","R3JPUZ3KTAPVAW","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems like a ridiculous first point of review for a multi-cooker, but this thing is gorgeous. Words really cannot describe the appearance of the Candy Apple Red paint job. Unfortunately, the product picture also does not accurately depict its appearance. I am not kidding when I say that the weekend after we got the appliance two different people walked into our kitchen and said something to the effect of ""That is so beautiful...I want one...What does it do?""Aside from its aesthetics, this cooker is pretty great functionally, too! I do believe that its utility to me will grow as I become more comfortable using it versus the appliances it is meant to consolidate. I will say that, for a novice like me - and even a comparative pro like my wife - the user manual is indispensable. Do not discard it!So far I've really only utilized it as a glorified slow cooker. That being said, it is glorified. So this review will be much more meaningful if I include my wife's experience.Her first crack at the multi-cooker was Risotto, utilizing the Step-By-Step cooking mode. The Step-By-Step mode walks the user through several of the preprogramed cooking methods, eliminating some of the fine tuning. According to my wife, risotto can be a bit of a headache. While she did say that she believed having the KitchenAid Stir Tower Accessory for KitchenAid Multi-Cooker, Contour Silver would have made the process much easier and, perhaps, resulted in a better finished product; she nonetheless proclaimed that the multi-cooker produced the best batch she has made to date. Since the risotto success, she has made multiple sauces and soups. All of which turned out fantastically! I would argue that these creations would have been just as great cooked through traditional means, but she insists that, whether or not my argument is true, the multi-cooker is simply more efficient and convenient while providing an extra degree of precision.Both my wife and I like the fact that the cooking pot is not as large and cumbersome as a traditional slow cooker, so it can actually fit into our refrigerator between cooking something and it needing to be heated for serving.Like I said, I think as we grow more comfortable using this appliance to its full capacity, we will appreciate it even more than we already do. However, even from jump-street it has earned its spot on our countertop.I will add this disclaimer: My wife has repeatedly said that the multi-cooker would be exponentially better in several of what she deems to be common applications with the stir-tower accessory. I count this as a disclaimer because the stir tower is not inexpensive, and, if you enjoy the multi-cooker as much as we do, you might be just as compelled to purchase it as we are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BHKQWSD5Q27P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UL3K722#wasThisHelpful","R1BHKQWSD5Q27P","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was having a devil of a time with my Floratam lawn. It was just failing to thrive. After speaking with some neighbors who have paid for their lawn care, I learned that, because our house was relatively new construction, I might want to aerate our lawn to provide some breathing room within the newly compacted earth. I also happen to be a little frugal, so I looked for a discount solution. This set seemed to fit the bill.Honestly, I was quite hesitant to try them out after reading about the problems others seemed to have experienced. However, knowing that the price point was attractive, and that Amazon is cool about returns if something doesnt work, I took the plunge. Im happy to say that I couldnt be more pleased.It has been about two weeks since I used the spikes in my lawn, and Im already seeing improvement in some of my most troublesome areas. Where the grass was doing okay, it is now a little fuller, and where it was really bad, Im finally starting to see signs of growth.I will say that the straps will give you trouble if they are wet. That is just how this type of strap works, by friction. Moisture will reduce that friction. So I would certainly recommend using them on a dry lawn, and/or hitting the straps with a hair dryer before use if they got wet from any other source. I will also recommend that you not expect to walk with a normal gate around your lawn and anticipate that these straps will stay in place. Because of the solid, one piece construction, the natural bend in your foot when you walk will put a disproportionate amount of pressure on the back straps with every step you take. While it looks funny, I found that a lateral stomping motion was much more effective. Of course, this prevents one from wearing the spikes while pushing their mower or a fertilizer, which would be ideally efficient; but I was not too frustrated by having to make a dedicated aeration effort.These are not perfect by any means. Nonetheless, considering the results and the price, I would say that the imperfections are overshadowed by the products effectiveness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25J6IURSBGK6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005V1SP28#wasThisHelpful","R25J6IURSBGK6G","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I would have to say that my favorite detail of this case is the fact that Case-Mate took the time to make the buttons wonderfully accent the case while maintaining total functionality.As far as the aesthetics of the case, it is tops!

"Ill try not to muddy the waters too much, but I want to provide the sizing details I was looking for when I made my purchase. I am 61, 205 pounds with broad-ish chest and shoulders, but Im also disproportionately leggy in length. Im not robust or slight but, rather, a true medium build. I went with the Extra-Large expecting it to be a little roomy on me, but hoping that I wouldnt be swimming in it as is often the case with XL garments.I have to say that the XL fits me perfectly. The garment is comfortably snug through the shoulders and chest and drapes naturally from there without looking like Im a child wearing my grandpas sweater. The fit actually feels a little odd to me as it is the perfect length to the waist. As I mentioned, Im mostly legs, so if a garment fits properly in width it is usually also a little longer than I would prefer. I only mention this because, if youre taller than I am with more proportionate upper and lower portions, the XL may be a little short. If you would say that youre on the wider end of the body type spectrum, even the XL might be a little more snug than youre used to.As for the sweater itself, I really like it! It is quality construction without the loose weave that is often present on the larger end of the size scale when it comes to knitted garments. The buttons are sturdily fastened and are placed well into the chest for a greater number of button up or down options. It also has pockets, which was a big deal for me. They are a little on the shallow side, but good enough. I would say that, on the scale of cardigan weight, this one falls on the lighter side of the median, but not too light.Overall, I think its great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CR35TW66EF86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1UZSDK#wasThisHelpful","R1CR35TW66EF86","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The swing is great in all the right places. It has a built in mobile, with a peek-a-boo mirror at its core, and plays a variety of tolerable baby tunes. It rocks both front to back and side to side. This might not seem like a big deal until your baby decides that side to side no longer soothes him or her to sleep. The ability to change the swing's orientation might just be the difference between the swing hitting the attic or a few more weeks of use. The seat cover is also machine washable... which definitely comes in handy. So, like I said, great in all the right places.The reason why I love this swing, however, is because it has an AC adapter and can run without batteries. I am not kidding when I say that we easily spent over $100 dollars on batteries alone while our last swing was in use. Obviously, the power cord can pose a strangulation hazard, so it should be used with caution. If it is set up properly, and other children are properly supervised in the presence of the power cord, it is a real game changer!Seriously, if you're thinking about getting a swing that only runs on batteries, go ahead and tack at least another $80 on to the price of the swing itself.

"I have a bad habit of hoarding a collection of single subject, spiral notebooks while studying for this or that. My problem is that I either have to carry around three or four separate notebooks or risk not having the notes I need at any given moment. This binder solves my problem in that it hides my shameful notebook habit, and reduces the number of objects that I have to keep track of for any particular subject of study down to one. Yes, I still have to remove the spiral notebooks to be able to turn the pages, but mine is more of a transport problem anyway. For me, it works.The drawback is that the current price point - as of the writing of this review - is just shy of $14.

"This is one good looking rag rug! I realize that by this product's very nature each rug should look different, but, with a chance of scoring a real beaut, I think it's worth rolling the dice.I have read that others received rugs with hard inclusions.

"It's still Elmo, so our son still wants to love him. However, this iteration seems to occupy the gap between a decent plush toy and a decent educational toy. I'm just not sure this gap needed to be filled.Let's Imagine Elmo is simply too hard, stiff, and heavy to really love on. A bit of a disappointment for our little one. On the other end of the spectrum, Elmo is capable of some interaction. While Elmo's three hats may make it feel like he is really providing a range of interactive capabilities, there is an awful lot of overlap. Playing along with Elmo gets repetitive quickly and just doesn't provide fodder for extended interest; which would be okay if, after getting bored, a child could just snuggle with Elmo, but this Elmo is not for snuggling.Our son was pumped to get Let's Imagine Elmo out of the box, but seemed pretty disappointed after just a couple of minutes. I have to admit, witnessing the rapid decline in satisfaction was a little disappointing for me too.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYS4BN0PDDU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHHLNZ4#wasThisHelpful","R1FYS4BN0PDDU7","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our hope was that the Motorola MBP36S would serve as a suitable replacement for our aging Lorex Wireless Video Monitor LW2451.As soon as we set up the Motorola, I believed it was superior in every way. The Motorola includes an unobtrusive kickstand and antenna, as well as a power supply port right on the monitor, eliminating the need for a charging stand.Beyond the physical design advantages, the Motorola monitor possesses two features that I always wished our Lorex possessed; zoom and a video monitor sleep mode. While the inclusion of zoom is an obvious advantage, the video monitor sleep mode probably required some input from users. Our problem with the Lorex was that when it was running on battery power, it would lose its charge so quickly that we really just had to transport the charging base from room to room with us. With the Motorola, however, we can easily turn off the video feed manually - while maintaining audio monitoring - or set it to turn off automatically after a given period of time. This feature greatly increases battery life, and is also nice to prevent a rather bright screen from illuminating our room all night. The video feed is easily restored by pressing any button on the monitor.On top of a better physical design and the addition of some neat features that our Lorex lacks, both the video and audio quality of the Motorola are noticeably superior.If the Motorola is so superior to our Lorex, then why did we go back to our Lorex after one night? The Motorola is lacking one critical feature: ambient noise cancelation.We have a Honeywell Whole Room Air Circulator Floor/Table Fan, HT-908 in our son's room to circulate air without freezing him from above with a ceiling fan. The hum of the fan also seems to comfort him. Yes, if the fan is humming it's obviously not silent; but it's no leaf-blower either. Without the ambient noise cancelation feature, the Motorola picks up this otherwise innocuous hum and transmits it into our bedroom in the form of white noise... all night. The only real option was to turn off the volume - even the lowest setting was annoying - or just endure it until morning. Because we still wanted to monitor our child, we had to endure it. That was one torturous night that sent us clamoring back to the Lorex, which does possess the ambient noise cancelation feature.To be sure that we weren't missing something, we contacted Motorola. Let me first say that they were very pleasant and professional throughout our conversation. The Motorola representative informed us that the system lacked the feature we were looking for and recommended that we move the fan, and/or raise the camera to a higher level. We tried both and neither worked. Their only other recommendation was to get a quieter fan.The fact is, we could get a quieter fan, but our son likes the noise. If we can keep the fan our son likes while still effectively monitoring our child on a slightly inferior monitor that does possess a feature critical to our particular situation, then that is what we'll have to do. We have decided that we'll keep the Motorola system in place for daytime monitoring, as it is more conducive to working around the house during nap time, but the Motorola simply could not serve as a primary monitor due to its one major drawback.To those who might be reading this review that do not have anything that creates ambient noise in their child's room, please note that if I were in your situation I would have given this monitor five stars without hesitation. For us, however, this monitor makes peaceful sleep very difficult, if not impossible.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGKPNI95TNS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2F0OYS#wasThisHelpful","R2GGKPNI95TNS3","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my own experience, these batteries are great! Of course, my own experience really only includes the countless batteries I have to continuously replace from the seemingly hundreds of hand-me-down toys my 15-month-old has inherited from his much older cousins. These Panasonics last measurably longer that the store brand cheapos I have to buy in a pinch, and at least as long as the other top shelfers I've used in similar applications.Now to the bug-out bag. I know nothing of it, but my brother is a shade-tree survivalist so I thought I would mention it. For what it's worth, these are the type of batteries he would keep in his bug-out bag; which makes sense if they really do maintain a charge for up to ten years. Let's just hope that whatever he's preparing for takes much longer than ten years to occur.On a serious note, I live in Florida, where we are subject to frequent storms. So a short-term emergency pack is a reasonable preparation. Now that I know that some batteries are better than others when it comes to longevity, a pack of these will be making its way into our storm kit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WTTOEX3YJUPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX3DQ50#wasThisHelpful","R1WTTOEX3YJUPN","A17A1KTVI3DG6U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17A1KTVI3DG6U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These trimmers come in a nice set nose hair trimmers as well as well as a beard trimmer. The hair trimmer works pretty well but i had trouble getting it to turn on and it isn't very powerful.

The beard trimmer is also mediocre, it doesn't feel very durable and isn't very smooth when using on your face. It is difficult to change the length of the guard on the trimmer and isn't easy to remove to clean out.

"I received this product at a discount to provide an honest review of it. A problem I always found when walking long distances or running was a constant pain in my shins and sometimes calves. I thought this compression sleeve could help me with this problem because it was holding me back from exercising as much as I wanted. These compression sleeves go on nice and tight, I have fat legs and they still fit on my legs. I went on a long walk while wearing these and I noticed that I didn't have any pain in my shins and I was able to walk for 5 miles and experienced no pain what so ever.

"Well let's just get to the point, lol. I have problems with constipation and occasionally hemorrhoids and this is why I chose to try PLN colon cleanse. And we all know that if you are constipated and not pooping regularly you will have problems with loosing weight. Received fast and well packaged. I decided to start out with 2 in the am and 2 in pm. The pills were easy to take capsule form no taste. I am really bad with burping pills and didn't have any problems with that. I experienced no cramping no urgency and this is very important because I am a surgery nurse and in no way can leave the bedside in a hurry.

"Upon buying my Iphone 6 I never thought about needing a screen protector. I had researched it and most of the websites said that the IPhone 6 wouldn't need a screen protector and it has a scratch resistant screen. I put it in my purse with my keys and it came out with a scratch so I decided to try the ADFILIC Tempered Glass Screen Protector. Before applying I washed my hands to remove all residue and oil from my palms. I made sure the room was kinda humid to decreased the air particles and static electricity. I cleaned the screen with windex and made sure to dry it good. I applied masking tape to one side to provide as a hinge for my screen protector and measured my screen. The Nozza was thin and that helped and fit like a glove on top of the screen. I then took a credit card and worked from the hinge area first to the other side. While doing this I removed masking tape from bottom side of phone and while I removed the tape from screen protector I used the credit card very simple and no bubbles! I noticed immediately the scratch that was there from my keys was greatly minimized by the screen protector. Texting is not a problem with the screen protector in place and I love it!

"My 3 1/2 year old daughter recently became interested in the Calico Critter sets and she was so excited to get this houseboat and hasn't stopped playing with it! In the box, you get the expandable houseboat which measures about 22"" long by 5 1/2"" tall, a Belle Hopscotch bunny figure (3"" tall), a separate island, a small rowboat, and over 50 pieces including floats, flippers, and goggles for the Calico Critters to wear, chairs, drinks, fishing poles, pots and pans, a grill, and more. Adult assembly is required, but isn't difficult and doesn't take more than 5 minutes - you just have to snap pieces together and apply the stickers to certain parts of the boat.I love that all of the pieces in this set are high quality and durable. The plastic they are made of is thick and not flimsy in any way, so I don't have to worry that my daughter will break them. While I like that the set comes with so many pieces, many of them are very tiny, such as the cutlery and glasses, so I took those out of the set until my daughter is older because they can be easily lost or misplaced.By far my favorite thing about this set is that there are unlimited play options! My daughter will sit for well over an hour at a time playing with this and she gets excited showing me the different things all the Calico Critters can do on the houseboat. For example, the shower area converts to bunk beds for the critters to sleep in, there are 2 swimming pools and slides for them to go on, the doors actually open, and the fish shaped kiddie pool has a dial you can turn to watch the sea creatures ""swim."" There is a separate island that the critters can float on the small rowboat to or can pretend to swim to it and the critters can cook a meal on the stove or grill and sit down at the big table. I like that you can fit both the adult critters and babies on all of the chairs and beds. My daughter has used her imagination to make up stories for the critters as they interact, so it definitely encourages imaginative play. She has a few other Calico Critters so it's nice that you can remove some of their fabric clothing and pretend they are wearing a bathing suit to swim. My only criticism is that I wish the set came with more than just one bunny. The box makes it look like you'll at least get a few critters, so that's sort of misleading. You'll definitely need to purchase more Calico Critters, which are quite pricey, but are also very well made and worth the price. She also has several Palace Pets, Kitty in My Pocket, and Littlest Pet Shop characters that she uses with the houseboat to add more characters to the boat. When you're done playing, the houseboat folds up easily to be put away and all of the pieces can go back inside.Overall, this is expensive, but well worth it in terms of play options and quality. Any Calico Critters fan will love this set!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7G9C1ZFS2EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102AC6AO#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7G9C1ZFS2EC","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every Christmas season I like to add to my daughter's collection of Christmas books and this one has vastly become one of her favorites. The story is about Oliver, a young elf who is excited to find out what his job will be for the Christmas season. Each of his family members takes him to work with them and he tries to help in the toy workshop, the bike shop, the bakery, and the writer's workshop, but in each of these places, he finds he's too little or clumsy to complete the tasks. He is sad because he feels he has nothing to contribute to Santa's team until he meets a small reindeer named Dot, who is having trouble learning to fly. They find friendship together and they also find their niche making small ornaments and cards as gifts for the other elves.I like the moral of the story that no matter how young you are, you can always find a way to help or find something that you are good at. It's very relatable to young children. The illustrations are colorful and engaging and the text keeps a young child's interest through the entire story without being too short or too wordy. There is also a sheet of stickers included with the book. Overall, this is a great addition to our Christmas collection that we will read for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZUE88NR759Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545436540#wasThisHelpful","R3JZUE88NR759Z","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves playing board games and she really enjoyed the new Peanuts movie, so she was thrilled to play this. In the box, you will get the foldable, circular playing board, a cardboard 3D Eiffel Tower, a 2 piece spinner mechanism, a Red Baron airplane, a Snoopy doghouse pilot, 24 character cards in each of the four colors for each player (red, black, purple, blue), 9 tokens per color for each player, and an instruction sheet. The game box is very sturdy and all of the game's pieces are well made and durable, made from thick cardboard or plastic. The only thing I could see breaking is the cloud tail on the Snoopy doghouse because it's literally made out of thin paper towel material. If that were to break off, you'd be out of luck as far as playing because the cloud tail serves as an integral part of the game. Setting up the game is very quick and easy with very little assembly: simply unfold the game board, squeeze the Eiffel Tower to expand it and place it in the slots on the game board, and attach the spinning arm to the top of the Eiffel Tower. You'll need to snap the Red Baron plane and Snoopy's doghouse to the ends of the spinning arm and you are ready to play. The game is recommended for ages 4 and up.The game is for 2-4 players and each player takes a colored deck of cards and the tokens of that color as well. On each card is a Peanuts character (Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Sally, etc.). Each player places their cards face down in a stack in front of them. One player spins the spinning arm as fast as they can (the spinning arm serves as a timer during each round) and while it's spinning, players take turns flipping over their top card face up into their own pile next to the face down cards. If the card you flip over matches any other player's face up card, you made a match and can place one of your tokens on that character on the game board. You take turns flipping and making matches until the spinning arm stops spinning. If you run out of cards during the round, you have to shuffle them and continue. To win the game, when the spinning arm stops spinning, if Snoopy's cloud tail lands on a space with one of your tokens on it, then you win. If the cloud tail lands on a space with no one's token on it, then you spin again and keep playing. Even though the spinning arm moves really fast and makes the plane and Snoopy look like they are flying (my daughter's favorite part!), it never topples over or falls apart, which speaks to the nice craftsmanship of the game.I like that this game is fast paced and helps work on matching skills and reaction time for younger players. The concept of the game took my daughter a little while to catch on, but after playing a few times, she got the hang of it and really enjoys playing it. I also like that there is an Advanced Play option for older kids or adults who find the game concept too simple or not challenging. In the Advanced Play option, you play the same way except that instead of taking turns flipping over cards, all players flip their cards at the same time and you have to be very quick to spot a match between your card and any other player's face up card. You have to call out the name of the character first before the player with the matching card can.Overall, this game is really fun and easy to play, is made of high quality materials, and would be a favorite of any Peanuts fan!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HP7ZYMOM0ZGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5P1YTQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HP7ZYMOM0ZGS","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fisher Price has once again created an innovative product! In the box you get a large plastic storage tub and 20 plastic flashcards to help baby learn common first vocabulary words. I absolutely love the idea of these thick plastic flashcards because they are so much more durable than paper flashcards and can withstand the roughness of a baby or toddler without the worry of the cards being bent or torn. The cards have large stickers on them that showcase the word with a very colorful and engaging illustration of the vocabulary word. I like that the cards themselves are bright and colorful as well. Some of the first words are bottle, pig, apple, car, house, ball, shoe, cat, dog, banana, and airplane. The cards are large and perfect size for little hands to manipulate and put into the slot at the top of the storage case.While I like the construction of the cards, I'm disappointed that the cards are geared more towards Spanish than English. The Spanish word is at the top of the card, while the English word is at the bottom, not to mention that the entire back of the box and product description on the back of the package is written in Spanish. I get that Shakira speaks Spanish, but it's a bit much. I find that both words being on the same card as well as the picture very distracting and cluttered and I think it would've been better to put the Spanish word on one side and the English word on the other side. I like the idea of teaching both languages when the child is older, but for a product that is targeted towards children 6 months and up, (realistically a child older than 2 or 3 wouldn't use this product), it seems unnecessary. The item description mentions nothing about these being bilingual or the fact that Spanish is the main focal point. As the child gets older, you can expand the learning by asking questions about the pictures on them like what color things are or what each of the letters in the word are. The storage tub is fantastic and made of thick plastic with a removable lid and carrying handle so you can take these on the go.Overall, these are really well made and an excellent learning tool, but I'd prefer an English word only set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGEMKXWMCCPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ST80H5I#wasThisHelpful","R1EGEMKXWMCCPG","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 year old loves giraffes and when I saw this book, I knew she'd be excited to read it. The story is about Gerald, a giraffe who isn't the best dancer, and how he has low self esteem about his dance skills because the other animals made fun of him and his clumsy dancing. Gerald feels sad and a cricket, who had been watching him, encourages him to find the music he loves inside himself and dance to it his way. Once he followed this advice and let go of what other animals thought and danced to the beat of his own drum so to speak, he found he really could dance and at the party he impressed the other animals by being himself.I absolutely love the morals of this story because they apply to all people, old and young: when you let the opinions of others get to you, you begin to doubt yourself and become so self conscious that you forget to be yourself; and you may not be the best at any given activity, but if you do your personal best and believe in yourself, you will shine anyway. Gerald was able to let go of the opinions of others when he was alone in the field with the cricket and he found his own rhythm and realized he really could do what others said he couldn't do. He started to believe in himself and it showed as he did his best dancing. The morals make great conversation starters with your children about what things they have doubted themselves about and why it's important to believe in yourself. This book touches on bullying and the negative feelings it brings in an easy to understand way for young children as well and opens dialogue about what the animals could have done differently instead of laughing at Gerald.I love the rhyming text and the bright and engaging illustrations.  I like that the pages are made of thick cardboard since it's a board book and I don't have to worry about her bending or tearing the pages. Overall, this is an awesome book with a great message!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADQQP24JWTNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545392551#wasThisHelpful","R3ADQQP24JWTNM","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always used traditional power style eye shadow and was excited to try this because it is a cream gel shadow. I loved the smoky gray/silver color, but unfortunately, I was disappointed with how clumpy it was, how dried out it was when it arrived, and how difficult it was to spread it across my eyelids. I tried using a shadow applicator but because the gel's consistency was so dry, it just scraped a big clump out. Spreading it with my finger was no better and if you accidentally spread it a little farther out than you wanted, it is VERY difficult to wipe off your face - you have to scrub very hard to get it off and for someone with sensitive skin like me, it made this unusable.Additionally, it claims that the color lasts 24 hours, but it creases and fades in just a few hours like every other eye shadow. After trying to use this two or three times, I just threw it in the trash. I definitely wouldn't waste my money on this color tattoo brand again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5JSX5U2ETLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G8R78AY#wasThisHelpful","RB5JSX5U2ETLT","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this set for my 3 1/2 year old daughter and she loves them! I've been teaching her about the planets and these are a great learning tool and a hands on way to learn about the planets. After using these a few times, she's able to identify each planet. In the set you get the 8 main planets, Pluto, and a sheet of 200 glow in the dark star/comet stickers. The planets are not exactly to scale, but they are mostly accurate in their sizes relative to each other; for example, Venus and Earth are often called twin planets because they are about the same size and in the set, they are the same size. Also, Jupiter is the largest planet and is the largest in the set.While I think that these make a great teaching tool, there are quite a few things that could use improvement. First of all, the planets are made of flimsy, thin Easter egg plastic, so when my daughter tries to open and close the few planets that open, I'm always worried she's going to crack one of the halves. Also, the center of the entire solar system, the Sun, is NOT included! I find that so disappointing, especially if you are going to hang them from the ceiling and want to create an accurate model of the solar system. The colors of the planets are mainly accurate, although Uranus is an odd purple color with spots, when in reality it is supposed to be a pale blue color. I do like the detailing on some of the planets, such as Jupiter's lines and red spot. I am disappointed in the Saturn planet because the ring will NOT stay on it - it keeps falling off even when I popped open the planet to insert the thin ring around the edges and tried to close it between the two halves.I do like that you can hang these from the ceiling, but in order to do that, the instructions state you have to use adhesive putty or tack the string into the ceiling. Because she may not be interested in these for too long, I chose not to put holes in the ceiling and also because she likes to hold them as we are talking about them. The other selling point of these planets is that they glow in the dark. Based on the item photos, I thought these would glow really bright, but unfortunately, they glow pretty faintly. I also find it disappointing that the planets do not come labeled. Unless the parent is savvy about the solar system, it may be hard for a child to tell which planets are which. Lastly, the stickers that come with it are very cheap and nearly impossible to peel off the sheet! I ended up ripping lots of them in trying to get my nail under the edge to peel it up, so we just threw them away.It seems as though there are more cons than pros to this set quality wise,  but my daughter does love it and they make the planets more real to her than just looking at pictures of them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R150M29CI3NIXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000066HSN#wasThisHelpful","R150M29CI3NIXP","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this Lenox Cold Dip Bowl set and am so excited to use them again during my parties this holiday season. The set comes in a thick, red cardboard box that you can use to store the set year after year and also is nicely packaged if you are giving it as a gift. You get two ivory colored bowls in the set that will match any table decor: a smaller, shallow bowl with a diameter of 4.25"" and a larger, deeper bowl with a diameter of 6.5."" It has a capacity to hold 16 ounces. The bowls are made of heavy duty, high quality porcelain and feature a beautiful holly berry design on the outside of the larger bowl and the bottom of the smaller bowl. The smaller bowl has a gold rim around the top.I like that the set is versatile because you can use them together, the smaller bowl to hold the dip and the larger bowl to hold ice underneath the smaller bowl to keep the dip cold, or you can use them separately, one for the chips and one for the dip. The smaller bowl can also be used as a candy dish as well. Additionally, the bowls are dishwasher safe and I have washed these a few times in my dishwasher and they looks just as beautiful as they did coming out of the box; the images on the bowls don't peel off or chip with multiple uses and washings. These are not microwave, freezer, or oven safe however.This is such a beautiful and elegant set and I'm looking forward to using the set for years to come. They are definitely worth the price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZUS7M0O34RG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV5H42W#wasThisHelpful","R1FZUS7M0O34RG","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 year old loves My Little Pony and Rainbow Dash and was so excited to get this Glow Pony! Rainbow Dash is super soft and cuddly and measures about 11"" long. She has shiny satin rainbow colored hair in the front and a long spike of hair in the back as well as little blue wings and a rainbow tail. Her cutie mark is on her bottom on the back and even the white part of her eyes are lightning bolts. Her face is cute, although they gave her a flat pig-like nose. On her back is a Velcro closure that houses the battery compartment (runs on 2 AA batteries that are included) and also the on/off switch. We've owned similar types of bedtime toys in the past that have Velcro closures that won't stay shut all the way, but this one does, so I'm pleased about that. A nice feature is that you can actually remove the battery compartment and machine wash Rainbow Dash if your child spills something on it.On her tummy is a large purple circle that when pressed will play 6 soothing songs, including the My Little Pony theme song. It's easy for a child to operate Rainbow Dash by his or herself by pressing the tummy; we've found that pressing it around the music note will turn it on, but pressing it anywhere else on ours doesn't turn it on. The belly glows a soft amber color that is bright enough to light up the area around the child, but not so bright that the child can't fall asleep. It has a replica of Rainbow Dash's cutie mark inside the tummy that lights up too. Since my daughter has been learning to sleep in her own bed, this has been a lifesaver because she's scared of the dark and it serves as a cuddly nightlight for her. I thought about getting her a GloWorm but when I saw this, I knew she'd love this one much more.One complaint is that the music plays really loud and there's no way to lower the volume; similar toys usually have a low and high volume setting, so I wish this one had the ability to play at a quieter volume, especially at bedtime because the loudness isn't conducive to falling asleep. Also, the music doesn't automatically shut off with a timer, which I find annoying because I always have to sneak in her room to turn it off and it will drain the battery quickly if it's running for such a long period of time. To turn it off, you just squeeze the tummy again and it makes a chime sound as you turn it off. Overall, this is a really cute bedtime pal for a young child and my daughter has enjoyed pushing it in her doll stroller and taking it wherever we go. It seems to be of high quality, minus the few flaws, and will surely be loved by any My Little Pony fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271NQ7UNUE68X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLENLYS#wasThisHelpful","R271NQ7UNUE68X","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My preschooler has recently become interested in the solar system, more specifically the moon, and she loves this book. We've read it many times and it still holds her attention. This book gives many interesting facts about the moon and splits the information well between the pages so that there isn't too much text per page, including that it's 238,900 miles from Earth, that the moon influences the ocean tides, that many scientists feel that something collided with Earth that tossed rock and debris to form the moon, and information about its orbit. Other topics covered include solar and lunar eclipses, cultural legends about the moon, and information about previous voyages to the moon. My favorite part of the book is the simple explanation of the phases of the moon that even my daughter can understand.This is a very well written book and does a fantastic job explaining complicated concepts in easy to comprehend terms. The illustrations are eye catching, engaging, and very detailed and showcase the text well. I teach second grade as well and when we do our solar system unit, I always use this book to teach about the moon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R207PAVZXEIMY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0823413640#wasThisHelpful","R207PAVZXEIMY4","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves My Little Pony, especially the My Little Pony blind bags, so I was so excited to surprise her with this Sweet Apple Acres barn. I ordered it online, but be warned that the product photo is very deceiving in regards to how big the barn looks. I was expecting a much bigger barn and was very disappointed that it is very small - only about 9"" by 10."" The front of the barn is beautifully detailed and colorful as are the accessory pieces that come with it, but I was also very disappointed that when you turn the barn around to see the inside of it, it is completely red and plain on both levels of the barn! No detailing at all. Granted that you can decorate the barn with some of the included accessories, but I was expecting colorful detail like the outside of the barn. The manufacturer needs to include a photo of the inside in the product photos so customers know what they are getting ahead of time.Despite my disappointment in its tiny size and lack of detailing inside the barn, my daughter loves it and has really enjoyed playing with it. I really love the accessories the set came with, including Granny Smith and Crimson Gala ponies (both are rare to find), the rocking chair, table, apple bushel, treats, picnic blanket, and squirrel. All of the accessories are adorable and very detailed. My daughter has so many of the blind bag ponies, which are about 2"" tall, so they fit perfectly into the barn and are the same size as the included ponies. Be aware that the play set is designed for the blind bag sized ponies and not the larger pony figures. There are other members of the Apple family available for purchase separately. Overall, this is a really cute toy and has provided my daughter with hours of fun and any My Little Pony fan would love it!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7H8QOPQTZPQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4KAI#wasThisHelpful","R7H8QOPQTZPQ6","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried the Proactiv Acne treatment line years ago and found it to be too harsh on my skin, so I was sure this Dark Spot Correcting Serum would dry my skin out the way the older products did. However, this product is gentle and doesn't irritate or dry out my skin at all. In the box is a 1 ounce bottle of the serum in a sturdy glass bottle, which has a pump mechanism. Although the bottle is really small, it will definitely go a long way because you only need to press it down just a little to get enough out; don't press it down all the way because you'll get way too much as I did the first time. The active ingredient in this product is 2% Hydroquinone, which works as a skin lightener and it's supposed to work on acne scars, sun spots, liver spots, and age spots.I have a small sun spot on one side of my face and I've been using this product daily for a month and haven't seen any improvement in lightening the spot, so I'm disappointed about that. The bottle states that you should discontinue usage if you see no improvement in 3 months, which looks like it will be the case for me. One caution is that the box states that some spots become darker after using this and that your skin will be more sensitive to sunburn.  I did use it on an old acne scar and have seen that fade a small degree, but not as much as I'd hoped. I wonder if the gentler formula is the reason why it doesn't work very well. At this point, with very little improvement shown, I don't think this is worth the $50 price tag at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SYZVHHYO9U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI6TSD2#wasThisHelpful","R3SYZVHHYO9U4","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old Palace Pets fan and she loves it! Bloom measures close to 3"" tall and she has a sparkly removable crown. Her body has embedded glitter inside, which is cool because not only does it make the pony sparkle, but it doesn't make a mess with glitter flaking off everywhere. Bloom's tail is a very sparkly fushia color, but the hair does get frizzy after playing with it for a while. My daughter's favorite feature is of course the fact that when you press the button on her side, she glows. My only complaint is that she doesn't stay lit up for long, only about 3 seconds, so I wish she'd light up longer.

"My 3 1/2 year old is obsessed with My Little Pony as well as these ""blind bags"" she discovered on a YouTube channel. In the blind bag, you get one approximately 2 1/2"" tall pony and a trading card that tells you the name of the pony as well as a fact about that pony. The catch is that you don't know which pony is in the bag until you open it, so the element of surprise makes it super fun for her. There are 24 different ponies in this series, so you do have a chance of getting duplicate ponies, but also a good chance of getting the different ones. This series has a few of the staple ponies like Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Apple Jack, but also lots of ponies from Sweet Apple Acres I had never heard of before like Apple Bumpkin, Uncle Orange, Sprinkle Stripe, and Apple Split.These have made great behavior incentives for my daughter and we enjoy playing with them and adding to her collection!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SOL9GQE9V08G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01443UXUU#wasThisHelpful","R3SOL9GQE9V08G","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter loves the ""Wheels on the Bus"" song, so when I found this Halloween version, she was thrilled. The illustrations are bright, colorful, and engaging. Even though there are monsters, witches, and ghosts in the book, they are drawn in a friendly way so as not to frighten a young child. She sings along with me as we read it and it holds her attention wonderfully. It definitely encourages active participation and also has a counting concept built into it for numbers 1-10. After we read it, I usually have my daughter help me count the cats, witches, monsters, etc. on each page to practice her counting skills or I'll ask her what colors certain objects are, so there's a lot of education value to the book as well as just being fun to sing along to.Some of the lyrics are : ""One spooky bus goes rattle and shake, rattle and shake, rattle and shake. One spooky bus goes rattle and shake all through the town."" ""Three noisy cats go meow, hiss, hiss, meow, hiss, hiss, meow, hiss, hiss. Three noisy cats go meow, hiss, hiss, all through the town."" ""Ten goofy ghosts say, ""Boo-oo-oo, Boo-oo-oo, Boo-oo-oo, Ten goofy ghosts say, ""Boo-oo-oo all through the town.""We enjoy the book so much that we bought another one for my daughter's preschool teacher to share with the class this Halloween.

"This is the second board game from Educational Insights that I have purchased (the other was Sneaky, Snacky Squirrel) and I absolutely love the educational concepts and high quality pieces. You get the cute cut out shape box, which doubles as the playing board when you lift the lid, a pair of Frankie the Cat tweezers, a spinner, 4 place mats that show you the shapes you need to collect, and several foods of each shape (circle, square, rectangle, and triangle and one of each shape for the crescent, star, oval, and heart). I like that there is no assembly required because the company already attached the food cards to plastic pegs for you, so you can play as soon as you open it. The game is intended for ages 4 and up, but my 3 year old can play just fine. Also, it's for 2-4 players, but ours came with a fifth place mat by mistake I guess.The concept of the game is that you need to be the first player to help Frankie the Cat deliver all five courses of the meal using your shape recognition skills. My daughter already knows her shapes pretty well, so this is a really fun way to reinforce the concept of shapes as well as teach strategy skills for collecting the harder to come by shapes first like the crescent, heart, or star, for example, and also the strategy of taking the shapes you need from another player if you spin that option. To play, you spin and use the Frankie the Cat tweezers (which also helps with fine motor skills) to pick up the shape indicated. You can land on a circle, triangle, square, or rectangle and must take that shape; if you already have it, you can't do anything on that turn. You can also spin two ""Chef's Surprise"" options that allow you to pick a food that matches any of the four shapes pictured that you still need. You can spin a ""Yuck! Fly in my Soup"" option, which means you have to put back one of your foods. There's a lose a turn option as well as a ""That Looks Delicious"" option that allows you to take a food from another player that you need. One round can last about 10-15 minutes, especially if you keep losing your foods or keep spinning shapes you already have.I love how it takes this early math concept and makes it so fun that kids don't realize they are learning. Even at 3 years old, this game holds my daughter's attention through several rounds, up to 30 minutes all together. I love how thick the cardboard playing pieces are so I don't worry about them getting bent and torn like most other board games on the market. I continue to buy games from this company because of the educational value and the high quality construction. This game has become a family favorite of ours and we play it almost on a daily basis. Awesome learning game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R164PZFR36AT4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLWJDIO#wasThisHelpful","R164PZFR36AT4N","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these tights to go underneath my My Little Pony Rainbow Dash Halloween costume, even though they are technically dance tights. For the cheap price of $2.99, I wasn't expecting these to be of good quality, but they are EXCELLENT quality. I was really worried as I was trying them on that I'd end up ripping them, but I have worn them a few times so far and they still have no tears at all. The material feels thin and is obviously stretchy, but the weaving of the material is so well done that they won't snag. I have washed them a few times and they still look as good as when I took them out of the package.Because they are one size fits all, the fit isn't going to be exact, but I expected that. I'm 5'6"" and they were pretty long for me, so I had to hike them up high and fold the waistband down so they didn't bunch at the bottom. The only negative about them is that they are like old school highwaisted Granny Hose. Expect to have them hiked up pretty high. Mine were pulled up just below my chest under my costume to get the best fit, which isn't the most comfortable, but it worked.

"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves this set and has played with it nonstop since we got it. The set comes with a thick, sturdy storage tub with a snap on lid that stays shut even when the tub is dropped. I really like the storage tub because you can fit some extra play-doh molds and tools inside of it that didn't come with the set. The storage tub also makes it easy to travel with the set since it keeps everything together. This set comes with 5 small jars of Play-doh (2 shades of blue, red, purple, and yellow), a 4"" hollow plastic dough roller, a dough extruder, a 4"" ""ruler"" with 3 shapes on it, a 4.5"" plastic knife, 3 fruit molds (strawberry, bananas, and a pear which also looks like a balloon). 3 large cutters (heart, circle, star), and 9 mini animal shape cutters, which measure about 3-4"" long. The included animals are an alligator, cat, fish, cow, dog, giraffe, teddy bear, dolphin, and mouse.The Play-doh itself is of the standard expected quality and my daughter loves the extruder so she can watch the Play-doh ooze out of it when she presses it. The ""ruler"" shaped tool can slide onto the bottom of the extruder, which allows the dough to come out in that shape (moon, circle, or star). It is however, somewhat difficult to clean all of the dough from the inside of that. The roller is decent and works well, but I do wish it came with a rolling pizza cutter type of tool as well. I really love the shape cutters. They are made of plastic, but they are more than sturdy enough. When you roll out the dough, the thinner you roll the dough, the more likely it is that the shape won't hold, but if you roll it on the thicker side and press the cutters into the dough, it will hold shape much better and slice the dough perfectly and cleanly without the dough getting stuck inside the smaller crevices of the cutters. In fact, we haven't had to clean them or pick little dough bits out of the cutters at all. On the underside of the knife there is  a small birthday candle mold, which I don't like because when you press dough inside of it, the dough gets stuck in the crevices of the mold and around it and is hard to peel out. The fruit molds held shape well and were easy to peel the dough back out of.So far the set has provided us with hours of fun and she has fun making the animals and creating stories for them as she plays. If your child loves Play-doh and animals, this is an awesome set and we are very pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DIK1UE849TC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPMDLOG#wasThisHelpful","R2DIK1UE849TC0","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 1/2 year old daughter insisted on being Pinkie Pie for Halloween this year and since we always do family themed costumes, I was so excited to find this Rainbow Dash costume for myself. I wear a size 4, so I purchased a small in this costume and it fits perfectly! In the costume bag, you get a beautiful rainbow colored wig, the rainbow dress, felt wings, an ear headband, a colorful tail, and two blue hooves. The dress is very pretty and has a tulle skirt, but it is very short, so I suggest wearing some spandex shorts or solid turquoise tights underneath. I love how curly the wig is and it fits an adult head comfortably while hiding your real hair. It has 2 small hooks and eyelets inside so that you can adjust it to fit your head, however, the second one in my wig broke off immediately. Luckily, I could still adjust it. The hooves have elastic on the top so that they will stay put on your legs and hide your shoes. They hold shape decently and if you don't want them dragging on the ground, I'd position them so the bottom is just above your shoe soles or they'll get dirty and scuffed as you walk. The wings were a bit bent when I took them out, but you can reposition them; they have elastic loops to put your arms through and they are comfortable to wear.As adorable as this costume is, the quality factor is lacking on some aspects of the costume. The first thing I took out was the ear headband and the ears are just rubber super glued to the headband and as soon as I took them out, the glue on one of the ears was coming off, so the ear was half hanging off already. I had to hot glue it back on. Also, the cutie mark on the dress is literally stitched in two tiny places to hold it onto the dress so I can totally see it falling off, plus is was severely bent. The worst is by far the tail, which I don't plan to use because it comes with a huge safety pin and when you attach it to the back of the dress, it hangs limply from the weight of it and you can see the pin! Lastly, the dress had a small dirt stain right out of the bag. For the cost of the costume, they could definitely fix these imperfections.Overall, I do love the costume and it is a great value in that the costume is complete and you don't have to buy the wig or accessories separately. I'm excited to wear it this Halloween and also for my daughter's My Little Pony birthday party!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BI51191HQT2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7REEI6#wasThisHelpful","R1BI51191HQT2L","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for my 3 1/2 year old daughter to use during her swim class and she really likes them. I researched many different brands and chose these because of the mainly positive reviews and I'm very glad I did. I love the blue and pink colors and most importantly, they don't allow water to leak in around the lenses and the lenses don't fog up. They are scented with a cherry scent which my daughter was excited about and the scent continues to last swim after swim without being overpowering.The only thing that I wish was better on these is the adjustable strap. I made them pretty tight on my daughter's head to keep the water from leaking in and after a while in the pool, the straps seemed to loosen and had to be readjusted. Overall, these are very well made and serve their purpose and I'd highly recommend them over other brands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJ5CQJNQCDO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003305GSU#wasThisHelpful","RTJ5CQJNQCDO0","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a lifelong Cher fan, I have seen most of her concerts, movies, and specials, but I had never seen this one and I loved it! Filmed in 1991 at the Mirage Hotel, it features a show from the ""Heart of Stone"" tour. The DVD only features a couple songs each from 1987's ""Cher"" album and 1989's ""Heart of Stone,"" so you will not get a retrospective of songs from her career prior to those albums, but you do get to see her take on several cover songs, which was an awesome treat. The cover songs include Gregg Allman's ""I'm No Angel,"" The Eagles' ""Take It To The Limit"" (my favorite of her covers), Bob Seger's ""Fire Down Below,"" and The Doobie Brothers' ""Takin It To The Streets."" Her own song listing includes ""We All Sleep Alone,"" ""Bang Bang,"" ""I Found Someone,"" ""If I Could Turn Back Time,"" ""Perfection,"" and ""After All."" While this isn't a high production, visually spectacular concert like her Believe and Farewell tours, it is awesome none the less and features Cher at her best. She does do several costume changes, but they are much more understated than the aforementioned tour outfits.The DVD also has several bonus features, some of which are not interesting like ""Cher's Big Blooper"" which just shows her trying to sing with a faulty microphone, a TV commercial promoting the tour, and a photo gallery which literally has 6 photos from her show. The backstage home movies and ""I Survived the 1990 Heart of Stone Tour"" footage of her dancers and crew discussing Cher were interesting. I really liked the bonus performances, which include some cover songs: ""Hold On,"" ""Many Rivers to Cross,"" and Tougher Than the Rest."" Cher actually introduces the performances and tells you how to use your DVD player remote to switch between her performances of these songs in 3 different settings: at the Mirage, in rehearsal, or on the actual Heart of Stone tour. When you switch between them, each version is slightly different. My definite favorite bonus feature is Cher performing my favorite of her songs ""Heart of Stone"" as a duet with Bon Jovi's Richie Sambora, who she was dating at the time.If you are a Cher fan, this is a must see performance and an excellent DVD concert to add to your Cher collection!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RZ5GU4DU6CTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BC8STM#wasThisHelpful","R3RZ5GU4DU6CTE","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter discovered these on a Youtube surprise toy video and she loves them! In each bag, there is a pet, an accessory for it to sit in, and an extremely tiny ""deco bit"" that has a peg on the end and fits into a hole on the accessory and/or pet. Note that these are VERY small and only measure between 1"" and 1 1/4"" tall and that for the price you are only getting ONE pet in the bag.The pets that we have gotten are really cute (a fox, a raccoon, an owl, and a porcupine), but are very easy to lose because of their size, so we store ours in her Littlest Pet Shop carrying case to prevent that. What we love most is the element of surprise with these blind bags because you have no idea what's inside until you open them, which really excites my daughter. There are 24 different pets within this blind bag series so your chance of getting a duplicate pet if you purchase multiple bags is less, but still a possibility.As much fun as these are, the deco bits are completely useless and have nothing to do with the type of pet (a porcupine came with a pencil deco bit), not to mention that the deco bits are like 1/8"" long and were lost within 5 minutes. I'm giving these 4 stars for the useless deco bits, but mainly for the ridiculous current Amazon price of $9.33 for ONE tiny pet in ONE bag! I buy these at Target for $2.49, which is still a little pricey for how small it is, but they make great incentives for my daughter.

"I bought this for my 3 year old My Little Pony fan and she likes the book and we've read it several times. The story is about Twilight Sparkle receiving a letter from the mayor saying that all the ponies are invited to the Equestria Games in Rainbow Falls. All the familiar ponies (Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Twilight, and Rarity) travel by train to get to Rainbow Falls, leaving Spike behind to take care of the animals. Twilight continues to read facts about Rainbow Falls to the others aloud as they explore the town and prepare for the games and she writes and sends postcards about what's going on to Spike. The Ponyville Flyers end up qualifying for a relay race in Crystal Empire, which is another book in the series.The illustrations are colorful and my daughter enjoys pointing out all the ponies in the pictures. The book includes some removable postcards as well similar to the ones Twilight sent to Spike. The book has a lot of text per page, about half the page in fact, so this book is more suited to an older child. My daughter likes it but has a hard time sitting through all the text before wanting to turn the page. I'm giving it 4 stars because I found the storyline to be a bit lacking and not very interesting, but if you have a My Little Pony fan, they'll enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2518BM3QSDYCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316247960#wasThisHelpful","R2518BM3QSDYCI","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my 3 year old after she fell in love with it at Target ($29.99 there, cheaper than the current Amazon price which charges $5.99 third party shipping on top of the base price) and she hasn't stopped playing with it since she got it! The carriage is so beautiful! It's made of semi sturdy plastic and has plastic gems embellishing the gold carriage; it has doors that open on both sides and comes with a white solid plastic horse. The horse has a blue set of reins that attach to it's face (they fall off frequently) and to a notch on its side and a pink set of reins that attach to hooks on the carriage so the horse can pull it. The carriage rolls easily across hard floors or carpets and can be used with the horse or alone since the reins detach. My daughter has used a variety of Barbie and Disney Princess dolls in the carriage and depending on the doll height, it can be hard to slide them in. Barbie type dolls around 11"" tall will fit.As much as we love the carriage, I am slightly disappointed with certain parts of the construction. The doors feel flimsy and while you can open and close them, closing them isn't as smooth as it should be. We have to push the door sideways towards the front of the carriage and then snap it shut because the hinges doesn't line up exactly where they should. Also, on the back of the carriage, there is a clip and seat where you can let another doll ride once you clip its waist in, but this is also not easy to do. The clip is too small and hard to stretch open around a doll's waist. It requires more strength than a child has, which is frustrating for my daughter.Overall, this a beautiful carriage, despite the minor construction flaws, and lots of fun for a little girl to reenact the Cinderella story or to use with other dolls.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZESYA5XXK8CY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD3MT4S#wasThisHelpful","R1ZESYA5XXK8CY","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 year old discovered these My Little Pony blind bags on a Youtube Channel and these blind bags have been an awesome incentive for potty training - she loves them! The ponies measure about 2 1/4"" tall and are made of hard PVC plastic. Despite being so small, they are adorably detailed and colorful and my daughter enjoys the surprise of seeing which pony is in each bag since you don't know until you open it. Along with the more well known ponies like Pinkie Pie, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle, there are tons of new ponies we hadn't heard of like Lily Blossom, Fizzy Pop, and Sweetie Blue. There are 24 different ponies in this blind bag series, so while there is a chance of getting duplicates, you have a greater chance of getting different ponies if you buy multiples.Most of the ponies just have one cutie mark, but there are a few special ones (Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Twilight Sparkle) who have cutie marks all over them. Each pack comes with the pony and a trading card that shows the pony's name and a line that tells you about the pony. We really love these and the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the current Amazon price of $8.80 for ONE pony is ridiculous! I pay $2.49 for these at Target, which is still a little high considering how small it is.

"I bought this for a three year old and she is so thrilled drawing on it everyday. The kitty measures about 8"" tall and comes with a plastic bottle to feed the cat with and ONE marker, so you'll want to buy an additional pack of the Doodle markers. The kitty is made of soft fabric and has white baby pins, hearts, bottles, swirls, and more drawn on the fabric. You can draw anything you want all over the kitty, bib, and bow. When you're ready to start over and clean it, you need to put it in a pillowcase and machine wash in cold water on the gentle cycle. I put it in the washing machine by itself because I don't want to risk the marker bleeding onto my clothes. You can tumble dry it on low or let it air dry and it really does wash completely clean and like new! We've washed ours several times and it hasn't shown any signs of fading or tearing, so it's really well made. My daughter loves taking it to bed and cuddling it before she draws on it again the next day.

"I bought this for my daughter's third birthday and she loves it! When put together, the pool measures about 9 1/2"" x 12"" and has lots of beautiful detailing on it including textured swirls across the top of the pool wall, Barbie logos and bows on the plastic umbrella, and blue and pink tile design on the sides of the pool. You can easily fit 4-5 Barbies in it. The pool has a pop in hard plastic umbrella, hard plastic bench for the Barbies to sit on, and a gorgeously designed ladder and slide. Adult assembly is required and takes about 10 minutes to snap all the pieces together. The instructions are only pictures and the one part I had an issue with was on the white part of the ladder. When you put that together, there is an ""L"" for the left side and an ""R"" for the right side written really tiny on it, which I didn't realize at first, so make sure you have them on the correct side. I really like the embedded glitter on the slide and the dolls slide easily down it and into the pool.The pool also comes with two little plastic drinks that you can snap into the holes on the side of the pool. My one complaint about the pool is that the pool itself is made of a vinyl plastic instead of hard plastic. I wish that it was made of hard plastic because I'm always worried that it'll tear and leak from constant use. So far it's holding the water just fine and not leaking, but a hard plastic would be much sturdier and damage resistant.

It has a velcro closure on the back and comes down about an inch below her bottom.

"I bought this Beach Raquelle doll to go with the Barbie pool I bought my daughter for her birthday. She measures about 12"" tall and is made of hollow plastic because she can be placed in water. I like that her makeup is tastefully done and not trashy looking like so many dolls on the market today; she's just wearing light pink lipstick and eyeshadow. Her bikini is really pretty and doesn't take too long to dry when she gets wet in the water. The suit is easily removable when you want to change her into different Barbie dresses and clothes. I love that Mattel is making dolls with more diverse looks than blonde hair and blue eyes.Raquelle's arms and legs don't bend, but you can move them up and down, sit her down, and move her arms out to the side as well. Her hair is very pretty and curls in the back, but after getting wet and air drying several times, it becomes frizzy and tough to brush through.

"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter's LeapPad 2 and she really enjoys playing with it and I love all the educational value in it! This game is designed for pre-readers and beginning readers ages 3-5 and works on a lot of skills including letter recognition, letter sounds, phonemic awareness, rhyming, spelling, word building, word recognition, counting, and creativity. There are 5 games all together that each work on a combination of the aforementioned skills, though none of the games have specific names when you tap them.In the camera game, you are asked to find three things that rhyme with a provided word, such as ""man"" and you move the camera with the stylus to center on the rhyming item and press the shutter button to take the picture. In the boat naming game, you are given the outline of a letter and jumbled puzzle pieces that fit together to fill in the parts of the letter, which also works on spatial reasoning. After you complete the puzzle, you get to be creative and use the paint brushes to decorate the letter and then you get to see your letter on the boat. In the digging game, you are asked to help the dogs dig for their toys (all three of which start with the same letter) by rubbing the stylus over the dirt and it's really cool to see the dog's paws dig the item out. Once you've uncovered all the items, you drag them into the box that has that letter name. These were shown as capital letters, so throughout all of the games your child will see the letters in both formats, upper and lowercase.In the painting game, you help Emily Elizabeth decide what to paint by choosing letters to form a 3 letter word and she will paint that item. Even if your child can't read yet, once a letter is picked, it only shows you choices that would make sense as the next letter to spell a word. After each completed game, you earn stickers and it will count out loud how many stickers you have so this helps with counting as well. Once you earn 10 stickers, you unlock a new story in the story game. The story game reads and highlight each word as it reads so that helps the child with word recognition and sight words.All of the games are very user friendly for a young child and explain what they need to do. This is one of the best and most educational LeapPad games we have purchased and I highly recommend it. It makes learning to read a lot of fun and the child doesn't even know they are learning!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YOTS0SOVKMPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5HFEUM#wasThisHelpful","R2YOTS0SOVKMPG","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 year old and I had a lot of fun making these mini globes! In the box you get 4 clear plastic domes, 4 foam base plates, 4 characters (Aurora, Ariel, Flounder, a squirrel), 1 shaker stick, 1 rubber ring base, 3 rubber globe bases, 5 glitter tablets, and a tray. The characters are very cute and tiny, smaller than expected, and only measure about half an inch tall, but they are very detailed. I like the ring and globe bases because they are very detailed and a few are shaped like princess crowns and castles to go with the Disney Princess theme.To make the Glitzi Globes, you turn a clear dome upside down inside the tray and pour water into it to the very top (excess water spills over into the tray) and drop a glitter tab in. The glitter tab didn't dissolve in ours like it said it would, so we had to shake it really hard to get it to break up once we finished the globe. Then, you put a character on the little pin on the foam base, turn it upside down, and push it down really hard into the water filled dome. A little bit of water will spill out into the tray. Make sure you press around the edges so it forms a tight seal. Then, put the finished Glitzi globe into a base of your choice. Lastly, press the globe onto the shaker stick and shake vigorously to break up the glitter tab. The bases shown on the front of the box are not necessarily the ones you get. We didn't get a blue base or a purple base as in the picture, so you'll get random bases.These were really easy to make, but I wish for the high price, you got more globes to make. The current price of $24 is ridiculous for what you get and for how quickly you can use the whole kit, in about 10 minutes. You can buy it for the half the price, $12.99,  at Toys R Us, which is where I bought my kit. I'm also giving it 4 stars because the pins on the foam base plates are too flexible and the holes in the bottom of the characters were smaller than the pin heads so it was really hard to press the characters down all the way and securely. We had to remake the Aurora globe because when we shook it to break up the glitter, she fell off the pin due to improper fit and the flimsiness of the pin, so I was glad they give you an extra glitter tab because we needed it. Also, the ring is cut too small, because we could barely fit it on my 3 year old's ring finger and pinkie so it will be way too small for older kids to wear.Overall, this is a cool craft and we will be purchasing another kit to make!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OB8818JJLCA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N386C12#wasThisHelpful","R1OB8818JJLCA5","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this puzzle for my 3 year old and unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed with it. The puzzle has 46 pieces and measures 2 feet by 3 feet when put together. I like that the pieces are so large that they are easy to manipulate for small hands. The puzzle shows Aurora's kitty Beauty, Belle's dog Teacup, Cinderella's dog Pumpkin, and Snow White's bunny Berry. It's very colorful and I like that it's not a traditional rectangular puzzle but has scalloped edges, which makes the puzzle more challenging since it has no corners.As much as we like the puzzle, the item photo shows a box to hold all the pieces, but mine was in a thin plastic bag with the same image on it and a flimsy handle. Because of the shoddy item packaging, when we took it out to put it together for the first time, several of the pieces were already bent or split at the edges BEFORE we ever played with it (see photo - bent piece on the left, edge split on piece on the right). My daughter and I always do the puzzle together because it is a challenge for her and she is very careful with the pieces and after putting it together a few times, a few more of the pieces were already peeling up. Also, the first time we put it together we noticed that all of the pieces (even the ones that didn't arrive bent in the bag) didn't lay completely flat so some of the pieces don't lock together properly. Sadly, the construction of the puzzle is very cheaply done and dollar store quality! Definitely not worth the $13 price tag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HE46AXFGV4BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPTDTQK#wasThisHelpful","R3HE46AXFGV4BR","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I go to a lot of potluck dinners at my friend's house about 35 minutes away from my house and most of the time, my casseroles cool significantly by the time I arrive until I tried this handy casserole carrier! I've had others in the past that I ended up just throwing away because they didn't retain heat for more than 10 minutes, but this carrier does a fantastic job of keeping my casseroles hot and ready to eat at the potluck without needing to be reheated.The carrier measures about 16"" x 10"" so it'll fit many sizes and shapes of casserole dishes. I have used it for both standard sized rectangular casseroles of 13"" x 9"" , but also for a circular casserole dish 10"" in diameter and though it does slide in the carrier a little, it still remained hot and no food spilled out. I really like the large size of the carrier because you can also put serving utensils inside the carrier to transport as well. I really like the red checkered design and the fabric is a thick canvas material with a sturdy metal zipper to keep the carrier shut and help it retain heat or cold. Do keep in mind that you can't place a dish in it that is hotter than 200 degrees because you could melt the lining.I'm giving it 4 stars for two reasons: 1. Though I do like the fact that it has handles, they are only held together with a strip of velcro and the handles are sort of thin and bendable. I think it would be better if the handles were reinforced and also had velcro that wrapped 360 degrees through and around the handles, especially if you are carrying one of the heavier Corningware dishes. And 2. I wish that this had a pocket inside to hold a cold or heat pack to give it extra cooling/heating power. You can certainly still put one in the carrier, but it doesn't stay in place too well.Overall, this is a well made and attractive casserole carrier that does an excellent job and if you frequently go to potlucks, parties, or barbeques, this is a must!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IMB3S68NEIFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQYIZPK#wasThisHelpful","R3IMB3S68NEIFY","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having never used a Vornado brand fan before, I expected typical output based on its small size, but this is by far the best fan I have ever owned! The fan is lightweight and compact at only 11.5"" tall and about 10"" wide, but as small as it is, it circulates air incredibly well within both a small and large room. I have used it in my bedroom, which is about 200 square feet and in my basement which is about 450 square feet and despite the room size difference, the difference in circulation is negligible when on the high setting. The air output can be felt from one end of the room to another and it keeps both rooms cool and comfortable. The fan has deep blade curvature, which allows it to circulate more air with each spin than a traditional fan. On the back of the fan are two ""cones,"" which allow it to spiral the air in a tornado fashion so it sends the air output farther, giving it superior air circulation compared to other fans.I like the retro look and bright red color, but most importantly I love the solid and sturdy metal construction of the entire fan.  It seems like everything is made of plastic these days and doesn't last as long as things used to, but this fan is the exception. The stronger and much more durable metal materials make it well worth the price tag and ensure a longer life of the product. There are also rubberized ""feet"" on the bottom of the fan so it won't scratch your table and I also like that you can adjust the fan up or down a full 180 degrees. You cannot adjust it from side to side though. There are two speeds, low and high, that you can adjust on the back of the fan with a dial. On the low setting, the fan is soundless and on the high setting, it's relatively quiet and about as loud as a microwave.Because of its compact size, it's easy to fit in my suitcase and take with me when I travel and provide me with white noise on the high setting to help me sleep when I stay in hotels and also circulate the air comfortably instead of freezing with the air conditioning. I like that the company stands by its product and provides you with a 5 year warranty as well. Overall, even though this is more expensive than most fans of this size, it is well worth the price in durability, quality, and effective performance. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XCO42OHD0QQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TX79BO2#wasThisHelpful","R1XCO42OHD0QQD","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With spring finally here, I have been grilling quite often and really like this Cuisinart Grilling Thermometer! In the package, you get the 8"" long thermometer (5"" is the metal thermometer probe), a hard plastic probe cover, and a small circular AG13 cell battery that you'll need to insert. One feature I really like is the magnet on the back of the thermometer because it holds securely on the outside of the grill when not in use. I still put my grill cover on, but you'll need to be careful doing that or you'll knock the thermometer off. The probe is very well made and sturdy.To use the thermometer, you press the on/off button on the back and insert it into the center of the meat at least half an inch into it to get an accurate read. The meat temperature will be displayed on the large digital screen. I tested this on several types of meats including steaks, pork loin, and chicken on the grill and compared the temperatures it indicated with my dial meat thermometers and they were almost identical in readings so this digital thermometer is very accurate and efficient. I do prefer the digital readout of this thermometer over the dial types. If you want to change the readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius, you hold the on/off button until you see the change. This thermometer doesn't seem to automatically shut off (I let it sit for 10 minutes and it still didn't shut off) so you'll need to remember to turn it off or you'll waste the battery. Since the probe doesn't come off the thermometer, you'll need to hand wash it.One feature I really like is the ""flex neck"" on the top of the thermometer. You can leave it flat or bend it to a 45 or 90 degree angle, which I find handy when grilling so it faces straight up and I don't have to bend down and turn my head to read the temperatures. The probe cover is really well made and has a clip on the side.I'm giving this 4 stars, despite how accurate it is and how much I like it, because the battery cover on the back is poorly made. You can use a coin or a small flathead screwdriver to turn it and open it. I inserted the battery and the cover kept spinning instead of tightening. I looked at the inside of the battery cover and saw that 2 of the 4 pieces of plastic that lock the cover on had broken off with no pressure (see photo) before I even got to use the thermometer! Fortunately the rest of the thermometer is made well, but I have to use a piece of tape to hold the battery cover on now. Overall, this is a very accurate, easy to use thermometer and if you do a lot of grilling, this is a great tool to have!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN52IYDZIOLAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KA2Y1NA#wasThisHelpful","RN52IYDZIOLAG","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this tablecloth to replace a similar one that had a hole in it and for the most part I am pleased with it. The design is beautiful and colorful and matches my kitchen decor perfectly. The tablecloth wipes clean easily without the colors fading or smudging like I've had with other tablecloths.The tablecloth has a soft underside, but it is definitely not 3mm thick as advertised. It's only slightly thicker than the paper tablecloths you can get at the party store for 99 cents so I don't feel the quality is worth the price of $10.

"I bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday and she and her 6 year old cousins love playing with it! The table measures 35"" across x 27"" high x 15.5"" depth. I was afraid that the table would be too short for my daughter because she is very tall for her age, but it comes up to the bottom of her belly in height. The older kids can sit on chairs and still play with it. I love how easy the assembly was and that it required no tools! It took about 3 minutes to put together because all you have to do is snap in each of the table legs and put the lid on. The construction of the table is very sturdy and the legs don't wobble at all, even with 4 kids reaching across it and leaning on it. I chose this table not only because it got great reviews, but because it didn't sit on the ground and get bugs all over it like many other sand boxes I looked at. We bought a 50 pound bag of sand and it fits perfectly in the table.I love the lid feature because we have this on our deck and it keeps the rain and bugs out of the sand. The lid isn't as sturdily constructed as the rest of the table and is a tad flimsy, but it does the job and keeps the sand clean and dry. On the lid, there is a thick, stretchy bungee cord loop that attaches to the bottom of the table to lock the lid on. When the cover is on, it has a really cute car track embedded in it, which my nephew enjoys to race his cars around.It's nice that the sandbox came with a few sand toys (green bucket, yellow shovel, green sand claw, and yellow sifter). For the most part these items are well made but very small. My daughter loves the green sand claw because it looks like a bear claw and she loves making lines in the sand with it. I highly recommend supplementing what they give you with other sand toys. We have a sand toy set for when we go to the beach and she really enjoys using those items instead of what came with this.Overall, this is a very sturdy table and has provided the kids with hours of fun, so we are extremely happy with it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35SDNBIEA4RL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009F4YR6#wasThisHelpful","R35SDNBIEA4RL4","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best flashlight I have ever owned! Before I bought it, I read the reviews here on Amazon and some of the older reviews stated that it wasn't bright and gave the incorrect lumen levels. This flashlight is LED 250 lumens which is super bright and basically lights up the entire room! The flashlight measures about 9 1/2"" long and comes with 4 AA batteries. The light has an easy to press rubberized on/off button and two levels of light brightness. When you press it the first time, it's on the highest level, press it again and it's on a medium brightness level. Press it a third time to turn it off. The beam of light has a concentrated circle of light in the center and also emits a dimmer large diameter of light around it. I used it while working in my attic and crawl space with no other lights on and it lit the entire space up well from wall to wall, about 25 feet across.I really love the sturdy construction of this flashlight and that it has a hard casing to protect it from breaking should it fall. I dropped it off the top of the ladder when I was on my roof and it fell to the ground about 15 feet below me and it didn't break! It still works perfectly fine. I also really like the rubberized and grooved ends of the flashlight, which keeps it in place without rolling, especially important if you are using it on the job. It also has a nice metal belt clip to clip it on your pants if you are using it on the job. Additionally, I like the finger grooves on the handle because they make it very comfortable to use. My only criticism is that the battery compartment is not clearly marked as to which direction to insert the positive and negative ends of the batteries, but after a few tries, you figure it out.I liked this flashlight so much that I ordered another one to keep by the bed upstairs and one for my husband to use at work. If you're looking for a high quality flashlight that can withstand rough conditions, this is your best bet!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Q6SYYUR0MGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MG68BM#wasThisHelpful","R22Q6SYYUR0MGW","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter caught lice at her daycare and I had never dealt with lice before so I was freaking out. I got this from my local pharmacy after reading how ineffective many of the RID style treatments were from so many reviews. I was so happy I got this because nits were gone so fast! The product is non-toxic and doesn't contain harmful pesticides like all the other brands, so I felt safe using this on my daughter. The box says you can use it as young as 6 months old. Included with the 6 ounce bottle is a ""professional"" nit comb with metal teeth that are very close together so it effectively picks up the nits (eggs) and removes them from the hair. I also like that the comb is easy to clean (boil in hot water for about 10 minutes) and is reusable should you have a lice problem again.The product is very simple to use and doesn't require much time or effort to complete the treatment. To use, shake the spray bottle and spray it on DRY hair about 4-6"" from the head and completely saturate the hair starting at the scalp and work to the ends. I recommend using a towel around the shoulders because when you saturate the hair, it does drip if you have long hair. I used my fingers to work the spray all over the scalp and then we let it air dry. Once the hair is dry, DO NOT rinse the product out and then use the nit comb to comb out any eggs and lice bugs. The comb does a wonderful job of getting it all out and you can definitely see what is coming off. I love that you can use this as many times as you want in a day to make sure all the nits and lice are dead. I personally didn't care for the smell of the product, which smells of black licorice, but it definitely beats the chemical smell of other products. Most importantly, it WORKS! I continued to use it for a few days on my daughter's head and by the second day, I wasn't combing any more nits out because they were all dead and gone. One 6 ounce bottle lasted us 2 treatments of fully saturating the hair.Another nice aspect of this product is that since it's a spray, you can use it on multiple people's heads in your household, though you would want to properly boil and clean the comb to prevent reinfestation. One great thing about the Licefree company who makes this is that they have a hotline you can call if you have questions about the product or if you have questions about lice in general. I called the number several times when I was freaking out about my daughter having lice and they were so friendly and helpful and gave some great tips.Here are some lice tips:1. Inspect the hair under bright light. You can tell the difference between nits and dandruff flakes because if it's dandruff, you should be able to slide it off the hair with your fingertips. If it's nits, it will not come off the hair.2. You may need to retreat lice infested hair another time to be sure it is completely gone.3. Wash all clothing that was worn or linens that came in contact with the lice in hot water and dry on high heat for 30 minutes to kill nits.4. Boil combs in hot water to kill nits for about 10 minutes.I also found Licefree lice preventative shampoo that we use on my daughter on days she goes to daycare and it does work because she hasn't gotten lice again after several of her classmates did: Licefreee Everyday Gentle 2 in 1 Conditioning Shampoo 8 ozHighly recommended and effective!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QK6PGEJ4G2VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KYNNTS#wasThisHelpful","R2QK6PGEJ4G2VJ","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a lice scare at my daughter's daycare in which several kids in her class passed lice back and forth, I started using this on my daughter's hair on days she goes to daycare to prevent her from catching lice just in case. The shampoo contains tea tree oil and coconut oil, which are natural lice repellents. To protect your kids from lice, use the product as directed. You are supposed to wash the hair once and rinse, then wash it again and let the shampoo sit in the hair for 3 minutes before rinsing.The product is definitely effective because my daughter hasn't gotten lice and several of her classmates have gotten it repeatedly. My only complaint and the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the horrible smell of the shampoo. It smells very chemical and the smell lasts long after her hair has dried, so I wish they'd add some pleasant scent to it to mask the chemical smell.One great thing about the Licefree company who makes this is that they have a hotline you can call if you have questions about the product or if you have questions about lice in general.

"Since my daughter was born, I've tried many types of nasal aspirators including bulb syringes, battery operated ones, and the ones that you have to use your own lung capacity to facilitate the suction, but I've always found the bulbs to be the most effective. Of course the main problem with bulb syringes was mold growth because they can be rinsed out, but not properly cleaned or dried, so every year I'd buy new ones. I was so excited to find the first truly cleanable bulb syringe in the BoogieBulb!I ordered the 3 oz size, which is slightly larger than the standard bulb and is made for toddlers. This has a wider tip that I've found fits my daughter's nose more snugly, which in turn makes the suction more powerful because there are no gaps between the inside of her nostril and the syringe. Despite the fact that the bulb is made in two separate pieces, it will NOT come apart when you're trying to suction the child's nose if you are using it properly. When suctioning, press your thumb upward on the bottom of the bulb and release to collect the mucus. If you squeeze if from the sides, it will come apart and not suction properly.The best part of the bulb, besides its powerful suction, is that it can be taken apart and cleaned so there's no chance for mold growth. I wash ours in warm, soapy water with a clean rag and I got a straw cleaner to scrub inside the syringe part and get out all the mucus, then I let it air dry. It is a little pricey at nearly $14 dollars, but it is well worth the cost for peace of mind that there is not mold growing in it like traditional bulb syringes and it pays for itself in not having to constantly buy new bulbs.

"I have recently redecorated my bathroom in purple and gray with floral accents and this trashcan fits my motif perfectly! The trashcan measures 10"" tall, so it's small enough to fit between the commode and our sink, but large enough to fit several days worth of trash in it before needing to be emptied. I was expecting it to be made of thin, flimsy plastic for the price, but was pleasantly surprised that it's made of hard acrylic plastic and is quite sturdy.The purple color is gorgeous and the flowers are very detailed. I especially love the embedded glitter inside the plastic, which gives it sparkle, but doesn't make a mess. The item photo doesn't show it, but there's also an image of Tinkerbell on one side of the trashcan that's not mentioned in the description either.

The trunk is made of canvas and has a velcro closure flap on the front to keep it closed, as well as two canvas handles on the sides if you need to carry it. If you want to fold it up and store it, it collapses easily and lays flat. My only criticism of this trunk is that when it's full, the sides and front bow out.

"My 3 year old daughter is Frozen obsessed and super excited to see the ""Frozen Fever"" movie short. Until she gets to see it, we've been reading this book, which is the same story as the movie short. The story centers on Queen Elsa being super excited to plan a special birthday for Anna and Elsa is obsessing over every detail from the cake to the party banner to all the presents. Kristoff and Olaf are on hand to help as Elsa wakes Anna and leads her on a scavenger hunt for all these thoughtful presents she has made for Anna. Unfortunately for Elsa, she's coming down with a cold and every time she sneezes, little snowmen appear and run around the castle, unnoticed by Elsa and Anna. Anna keeps insisting Elsa rest but she doesn't want to ruin the day so she keeps pressing on until she nearly falls as she becomes dizzy from a fever. At that moment, everyone yells surprise and Anna was presented with her cake. She was so happy and Elsa finally rested as Kristoff and Olaf delivered all the little snowmen to the ice palace and Marshmellow on the North Mountain.The story is cute but I felt like the plot is somewhat lacking. I though that the little snowmen would play a greater role in the story and present some funny challenges to the party, but they contributed nothing to the book plot and were just there. They also didn't include the funny part from the movie trailer where Olaf is caught eating the cake. Of course this is not noticeable to my daughter, but an older child might pick up on that. Included in the book are over 30 stickers, many of which are sticker gift tags with ""to"" and ""from"" written on them to go with the birthday theme of the book.The illustrations are actual still shots from the movie short and they are very colorful and wonderfully detailed. Overall, this is a cute book, slightly lacking in plot, but we still enjoy reading it and seeing the life the sisters have after the original Frozen movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R292EU1MOKOO2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736434399#wasThisHelpful","R292EU1MOKOO2K","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these Disney Store dolls from the actual retailer (where you can get them much cheaper) for my 3 year old Frozen fanatic and we love them! Both Elsa and Anna measure 12"" tall and are stunningly detailed. They look exactly like they do in the ""Frozen Fever"" movie short and both dolls are fully jointed and moveable at the head, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, and feet. For my daughter, the only downside is that they are hard to make sit down because their feet spread so wide  apart that she can't have them sit in her Barbie car.Elsa has a beautiful floor length blue-green floral print gown with a gorgeous sparkly and sheer cape. Around her shoulders on the cape are pretty pink flowers which also adorn the entire back of the cape as well as glittery blue flowers. For the most part, the glitter doesn't shed, which is definitely a plus compared to other Disney Store dolls we've purchased in the past. I like that on this version of Elsa, she's wearing her blue ice shoes unlike the original Elsa doll. I don't like that they are held on by little rubber bands, which are a hazard, but if you remove the bands, her shoes won't stay on. Elsa also has her classic braided hair with a pretty purple flower on the side.Anna is wearing a pretty blue sunflower printed gown with a dark blue sparkly bodice and a green floral vest.

"I have a 3 year old daughter and two 6 year old nieces who come over a lot and I'm always looking for crafts to do with them that don't make a mess and these are perfect! Even though it's recommended for age 5 and up, you can still make these necklaces with a younger child as long as you help them. In the kit, you get two 38"" long pink necklace cords, two 38"" long purple necklace cords, 4 clasps, 20 foam jewelry shapes (butterflies, rainbows, hearts, bows, stars, flowers, and peace signs) in various sizes, and 6 mess free glitter sheets. The purple and pink glitter sheets are larger than the others at 3.5"" x 4"" and the green, blue, silver, and dark pink sheets measure 2"" x 3.5."" Even though the sheets are small, the foam bead sections to use them on are tiny so you'll have enough with some left over.To use the kit, you carefully peel off and discard the white paper shape from the bead, for instance a flower petal or section of a butterfly wing, which has sticky material underneath it. Then you peel the white paper backing off of the desired glitter sheet, press the glitter sheet over the sticky part of the bead, and rub it for a few seconds with your finger to transfer the glitter and lift up carefully. When you do this, on the glitter sheet, it leaves an impression of the shape you just did so that way you know the next part of the sheet to use. You'll want to start on the corner of the glitter sheet and work your way around it placing the shapes very close to one another versus starting in the middle so you won't waste it.Once you've used the glitter on the foam beads, you string them onto the necklace cord, which has hard plastic melted around each end like a shoelace in order to make it easier for you to string the beads. Each bead has two small holes in the sides which you feed the cord through and they stay firmly in place on the necklace without moving, which is awesome so you can space the beads out on the necklace. On the front of the box, it shows a necklace on which there are tied knots to give it a look different from a traditional necklace but unfortunately there are no instructions on how to do that, which is a shame. We just made standard necklaces and the girls had a blast. The cords are very long but you can trim them to fit the size of the child; you'll need to trim off the hard plastic on the ends anyway. To attach the clasps, you need to feed the end of the cord through each part and tie a double knot to hold it in place. The clasps are very hard to open once the necklace is on so a child will need help with this for sure.I was amazed at how easy this was to do and how gorgeous the necklaces turned out! And they were truly mess free without the need to let it dry. Right after we transferred the glitter to the beads, I scratched at it with my fingernail to see if glitter would flake off and it didn't at all.Though it looks like there's not much to transfer the glitter to at first, many of the flowers have individual petals and the rainbow has lots of stripes to do. Aside from how mess free these are and how much fun the girls had, I really like how creative this allows the child to be with all the colors and to truly make a design all their own. They show you examples on the packaging, but you don't have to follow that and can make any color scheme you want. One cool thing is that if you don't have a section of glitter left that's large enough for the shape you're doing, you can piece it together with leftover glitter from all the sheets. I plan to get more of these for guests to make at my daughter's birthday party.Overall, this is a very well made set with lots of creativity options and it is a truly mess free craft!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZKRU1HDJR7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR38S4O#wasThisHelpful","R22ZKRU1HDJR7S","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 year old loves games and we've both really enjoyed playing this younger version of Uno, which has lots of similar rules to the Uno card game I loved as a kid. Children who are 3 or 4 years old may need some help to play, but they will still enjoy it. The game includes a plastic barn, 24 farm animal game pieces, and instructions. The sturdy plastic barn measures 8"" x 5.5"" x 4"" and serves as a part of the game as well as a handled carrying case for the whole game, which is perfect if you are taking it for a long car trip. There are 4 cows, 4 pigs, 4 chickens, 4 sheep, and 4 skunks, one of each in the four colors (blue, green, yellow, and red). The skunk serves as a ""skip"" to make another player lose a turn. There are also 4 farmers (white pieces) to use as a ""wild"" that when played, you get to choose the color. The figures are really cute and have stickers on them for their faces and molded details on them, such as a curly tail for the pig and wings for the chicken. The game pieces are small at 1.5"" tall but also chunky enough for a preschool child's hands to manipulate easily. My daughter sometimes just likes to play with the animals and put them to sleep in the barn or have them play, so the game doubles as a toy!To play the game, you have to put all the game pieces in the barn, shake it up to mix them, and each player picks out 5 pieces from the barn. One thing I didn't like is that since you have to mix them up, many of the animal faces are visible and face up when you open the barn to pick, so what we did was make a rule that you have to close your eyes to pick your pieces so you can't cheat. The barn door folds down to place one random piece from the barn on it to start. On your turn, you have to either play the same animal on the barn door or the same color. For example, if there's a blue pig on the door, you can play a blue cow or a green pig. If you have a wild farmer piece, you can also play him at any turn. If you play the farmer, you get to choose the color for the next person. When you play a figure, you push the the previous piece into the barn and put the one you're playing on the barn door for another player to match. If you have nothing that matches, you pick 1 piece from the barn (we again said you have to close your eyes so you don't cheat) and if it matches, you can play it, but if not you have to wait until your next turn. Once you have one piece left, you have to say ""Uno Moo""  and if you don't say it and another player notices, you have to take 2 pieces from the barn. Whoever gets all their animals back into the barn first wins!The concept of the game is really cute and a lot of fun while also helping a preschooler work on color identification, animal identification, matching skills, and strategy skills by trying to play colors that the other players don't have. My one criticism of the game is that it is easy for other players to see what you're picking if you happen to pick a game piece from the barn that faces up or if they are sitting right next to you at the table. I wish it came with something to hide your pieces.If you're looking for a fun game that you can play with your preschooler that also has educational elements to it, this is an awesome choice and a perfect transition for when they get older and can play the Uno card game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32EU1RFDXLZX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4KLUNA#wasThisHelpful","R32EU1RFDXLZX7","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a picnic table on my deck that we use most seasons, but since we have nowhere to store it during winter, it tends to get pretty dirty from all the rain and snow after each winter and has to be power washed. I am extremely pleased with this cover! The cover is a beautiful hunter green color and is large, measuring 72"" x 57"" x 30."" My picnic table measures 72"" x 54"" x 28"" so this is perfect fit. You also get four 37"" long cords and 4 cord locks so that you can secure the cover to the picnic table.The grommets that you feed the cords through are weatherproof, which is nice so rust doesn't stain the cover.  Simply insert the cord into a grommet by the table leg, wrap it around the table leg, and feed it through another grommet close by, and press down on the cord lock to feed the cord ends through it. Then, slide the cord lock upward until you get a secure fit. Personally, I didn't need to use the cords since the cover fit so snugly on my picnic table, but if you live somewhere that tends to be very windy, I'd recommend using them.The textured fabric is very thick like canvas with a smooth, waterproof underside. We just got 10"" of snow and my picnic table is out in the open on the deck and this cover is truly waterproof because when I dusted off all the snow and lifted the cover, my picnic table was dry and clean underneath. The packaging also states that the fabric is tear resistant which is great because when I was putting it on the table and trying to maneuver the cover so the cover corners matched up with the table corners, I snagged one corner on the edge of the wood and it didn't tear or leave a mark. The stitching on the fabric is also very well done, so I don't imagine it would get holes in it after long term use.I did like that it came with a matching canvas carrying tote to store the cover in when its not in use, but unfortunately, the tote is so much smaller than the cover and its nearly impossible to get this huge cover back into it. So I've decided to use the carrying tote as a reusable grocery bag. If you are looking for a high quality, attractive, and truly waterproof picnic table cover to protect your table, this is your best bet!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30Q5N6YLC0DSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2S3EAG#wasThisHelpful","R30Q5N6YLC0DSF","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 3 year old Barbie fanatic really loves this set! In the set, you get a 12"" Barbie doll with a beautiful white top and floral dress skirt with black heels, a 2.5"" tall plastic color changing dog, a small eyeshadow brush for spreading the water, and a 6.5"" tall plastic table to hold the 1.5"" tall doggie tub. Barbie's head and arms are movable but her joints aren't so her elbows and knees are stuck in the same position and it's harder to make her sit down during play because of this. I really like that her makeup is classy and tasteful and not trashy like so many dolls on the market today. After getting wet and air drying several times, her hair becomes greasy feeling, frizzy, and harder to manage and brush through, so I'm not fond of that.The dog comes in the package vibrantly colored in hot pink, purple, and blue and to change him to white, you dip him in warm water in the doggie tub. To add color to him, you use cold water, but it must be VERY cold water or it won't work. The item pictures are deceiving because in the pictures, you can use the eyeshadow brush to make designs on him, but this did NOT work for us. I followed all the directions and used the little brush and ice cold water and no color showed up. The only time that color showed up was when I dunked the dog in the water so the brush does nothing in that regard. I even tried to use hot water when he was fully colored to make a design and again it didn't work and to get his fur back to white. I had to rub the brush really hard on the dog, so the color changing feature on the dog really only works when you dunk him in water versus using the brush, thus making the design potential for him nonexistent.Barbie's white top is made of soft cotton and when you use the brush and cold water, you can draw designs on it anyway you want, so I love the creativity options of the doll. However, my doll's shirt doesn't have a large section of blue when wet as the item picture shows, but a tiny 1/4"" strip of blue on her shoulder and the majority of it is pink and purple when wet. Once her shirt is dry, it will return to white, but it takes about an hour for it to air dry, which is far too long for a child to patiently wait so play time gets limited in that you can't do a bunch of different designs in one sitting since you have to wait for dry time. I tried blowing the top with a hair dryer so that it would dry quicker and that allowed it to dry within minutes. Only the front of her shirt is able to be colored. The eyeshadow brush has very thin padding and is flimsy so I can't see it lasting long, but you can replace it with a clean, better quality eyeshadow brush from your makeup bag.Overall, this is a fun set and we enjoy it a lot despite the issue with the brush and the dog's color changing. If your little girl loves Barbie and dogs, this will be a hit!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18RA1U62V5GL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4UJFXG#wasThisHelpful","R18RA1U62V5GL1","A2YV6F6DLENNTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YV6F6DLENNTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a follow-up to 1989's Red Devil (re-released in 2015 as ""Red Devil: The Book of Satan, Evil on Earth 1"" as part of a series), Green Devil continues the ideas and story from Red Devil while also serving as a stand-alone story.  However, it's not necessary to read Red Devil to enjoy Green Devil, though the references to the earlier work in the story may prove distracting for some readers.Much like Red Devil, Green Devil tells the story of a criminal investigation uncovering an ancient evil (and a plan to destroy North America) based near Salt Lake City, Utah.  Religion, particularly the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Saperstein uses the term Mormon) and Native American beliefs, plays a huge role in discovering and fighting the evil.Green Devil is a supernatural thriller, which doesn't hold up as well as the older Red Devil, in large part because the characters are nowhere near as engaging as in Red Devil and in part because of some plotting or factual flaws that detract from the story.  For example, a character has a farm adjacent to a rich villain's property, and the curiosity of that character poses a threat to the villain.  However, instead of simply buying out the farm, the villain decides that terror and murder are better strategies.  Saperstein also makes some mistakes, identifying one character in an early chapter as a G-10 government employee and in a later chapter as a G-12 employee.  However, government pay grades are GS (e.g. GS-10, GS-12) not G, and a GS-10 employee isn't particularly powerful in the DC arena from which the character originates.  Formatting errors like two characters speaking in the same paragraph or italicized paragraphs that are actually dialogue pop up from time to time, just enough to annoy the reader.A bigger concern is that Saperstein risks following a formula in plotting his stories.  Green Devil follows a plot trajectory very similar to Red Devil, with some minor deviations leading to a conclusion seen before in Red Devil.  Hopefully, future novels in the series won't simply rehash the same plot with a different villain.Still, despite these flaws, it's still a good read.  Though reading Red Devil isn't necessary, I would still suggest reading Red Devil first as an introduction to this universe.  Green Devil continues the story, but just isn't as gripping.  If you enjoyed the earlier Red Devil, you'll also enjoy this continuation, but in my opinion, probably not as much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KPRY3RAYYRTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010721PTA#wasThisHelpful","R1KPRY3RAYYRTI","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read Red Devil back in 1989 when it was released as a mass market paperback.  It's a joy to see it released in a Kindle format, as it's a particularly enjoyable supernatural mystery/thriller.The story is set in the 1980's, with a worried Soviet premier assigning an investigation into the circumstances surround the death of a close friend to another close friend, a KGB investigative colonel.  As the case unfolds, it becomes clear that Colonel Peter Somoroff is facing an ancient evil, and that he may be out of his depth without a lot of assistance.Saperstein cleverly takes a story which is part spy thriller, part mystery, and part supernatural horror and creates a work which is greater than the sum of its parts.  Drawing in large part on a mystical version of evil, author Saperstein successfully creates a universe ripe for further exploration.  The ending of Red Devil promises further explorations into this created world.  Now, in 2015, we finally see not only a re-issued Red Devil, but also a sequel.Re-reading the story over two decades later, it's still a great read.  It moves quickly, and the story is intriguing.  If you enjoy a good story and a bit of supernatural horror, you'll love this book.  It's not like the techno-thrillers which came to dominate the 1990's, but a much more old fashioned thriller driven more by the story instead of weapons/technology.  Well worth the time to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WAHOK43S6WQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7S72Z2#wasThisHelpful","R2WAHOK43S6WQF","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a replacement for my 579 lightbulbs in my 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan.  The bulbs are used in the dome/reading light in the front seating area.  Other LED bulbs sold as direct 579 replacements were in fact too long to fit.These bulbs are shorter and thus function as a 579 replacement in terms of size and fit.The connector is a T15 socket.  Basically, the T10 and T15 are the same base; the number refers to the width at the *top* of the socket.In terms of light output, these lights are what I would call average.  I think they put out just about the same light as my original incandescent bulbs, but use less energy in doing so.  And of course, they are estimated to have a much longer lifespan, upwards of 12 years and probably longer in the real world, as the dome light doesn't stay on very long or get used other than when opening/closing the doors.The light quality is white/blue, in the range of noon daylight.  Not yellowish or warm like an incandescent bulb.I can recommend these as a direct replacement for the 579 light bulb, especially in terms of size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNAL4OI9SXPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2HV68A#wasThisHelpful","R2RNAL4OI9SXPX","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these lights for my 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan, as they work for the rear seat reading/courtesy lamps.  They are extremely bright and are much brighter than the incandescent lamps they replaced.  I did have to squeeze the light contacts so they would have a firm grip on the light's metal surfaces, but that was about it for installation concerns (and making sure the orientation was correct, as the lights are sensitive to polarity).The light quality is very good--a white/blue similar to daylight at noon.  Definitely not the warm incandescent look.Highly recommended as a replacement for the Automotive 569 bulb, although note:  there are no loops on the end of this LED bulb.

I was able to pop off the light fixtures in seconds and swap the incandescent bulbs in there for these LEDs, which give off a white-blue light.

"Purchased an 18"" neck 34"" sleeve fitted shirt.  Nice shirt, neck size is good, but for a slim fit it's a bit closer to a normal-sized shirt than I would have expected.  High quality material, comfortable to wear and looks sharp.  Washes and irons easily; material is a little thin for heavy starching, but the cuffs and collar will hold starch okay.I am short and stocky (5'5"") with a thick neck; with me, the shirt has a neck that's good for me (18"") but has shoulders that are a tiny bit too large, even though I have slightly larger than average shoulders--a little surprising on a fitted cut.  It's hard to find a perfect shirt that's the right size, so while the fit isn't perfect (hence the loss of star), it's still a very good professional shirt.  I have other shirts that are 18"" fitted that have a better cut and fit than this shirt so I have some idea of what to expect.As a plain white shirt, it's perfect for business or business casual (e.g. a sport coat and no tie).  Looks sharp under a jacket.  Van Heusen is a brand with a long history, so I feel better about buying this shirt over a no-name shirt.

"I gambled that this Andrew Fezza shirt with a 17.5"" neck and ""slim fit"" would fit my short, stocky body and large neck.  I won the gamble--this shirt looks great.  It's high quality material, a cotton-poly blend.  More importantly, it's a woven pattern, not a printed pattern, so the shirt looks incredibly expensive, even though it's not.The fit is right for me; the 17.5"" neck is generously sized (I would say it's closer to 17-3/4"") and the slim fit works for a shorter, stocky person like me so that the shirt doesn't billow like a standard shirt often does.  It's not so slim fit that it's skin tight, and it would probably look even better on a thinner person than me, but it still looks great.  Definitely not a shirt for anyone with a large gut though.Basically, a great shirt if you need a dressy casual look that seems expensive but isn't.

"I bought the 17.5"" neck size shirt, hoping that it would fit my neck.  I am short and stocky with a thick neck for my height.  As a result, standard 18"" neck shirts tend to fit right around the neck but then look like sails with shoulders too wide for my body.  This shirt however doesn't have that problem, being more towards the fitted size.  Indeed, the shirt has a label that says ""Slim Fit.""  I am not slim, but the shirt is just fine on me, so it's not that tight.I was extremely pleased that the 17.5"" neck is generously sized (probably around 17-3/4"") so that I could comfortably button the top button if needed.  Major plus there.The shirt itself is a cotton-poly blend, good material.  The pattern you see in the images is an actual weave and not a print.  In other words, it looks extremely expensive, far more expensive than the actual current Amazon price of just over 18 dollars.  I have seen shirts costing 4x this price that didn't look as nice as this shirt.If you need a dressy casual shirt, want something that looks expensive but isn't, and need a fitted look that isn't skin tight, this shirt is precisely what you are looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BK591VHD0KAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVMRM4#wasThisHelpful","R2BK591VHD0KAU","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bright LED lights, fits well, easy to install.  Works great on my 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan as a replacement lamp for a burned out license plate bulb.  T10 base means it can fit other applications in my vehicle, although not as well because it's not bright enough to make a good 579 bulb replacement (which has the same base).As others have mentioned, the cover over the LED has a tendency to come off if you aren't careful and need to rotate the bulb to get it to the right polarity to light up.  The trick is to pull on the white base and not the cap, and that is tougher than it sounds, because the bulb seats very low once installed.Otherwise, this bulb is an easy recommendation for a 194 bulb replacement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EH4H22O6FTPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2D3VZG#wasThisHelpful","R1EH4H22O6FTPT","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Normally, to get a replica that looks this good, you'd need to go on an auction website and pay a couple hundred dollars or more.  It fit my model perfectly, and even the wig in the cowl looked good in my digital images.The only thing you'd really need to get to complete the look are purple boots, but other than that, you get the rest of the costume.It does get a bit warm to wear, according to the model, and it probably won't take abuse if worn regularly, as opposed to a couple of times a year for parties and Halloween.  Nevertheless, it's a nearly perfect Batgirl costume and a great value.  The fit is as expected and is very flattering/forgiving.  An A+ Batgirl costume.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUUAAI5F6K8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0PF8B4#wasThisHelpful","RQUUAAI5F6K8W","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small and portable, the Transcend Information USB 3.0 Card Reader is an absolute winner.  I tested it with a Sony UHS-1 U3 speed rated card and got a write speed of 65 MB/sec and a read speed of 93 MB/sec, which essentially exceeds the claimed specifications (60 MB/sec write; 90 read).  I like that it's small enough to take with me in my camera/computer bag, with no annoying cable hanging off.  At under $7.00 as of this writing, this is a bargain: unbeatable performance, unbeatable price.  I wish it took compact flash cards, but you're limited to SD, micro SD, SDHC, and SDXC cards.  It's backwards compatible with USB 2.0, although you'll get lower speeds because the 2.0 bus acts like a bottleneck, slowing down data transfers.  If you're looking for a USB 3.0 reader for your micro SD or SD card, then look no further:  this is the best USB 3.0 card reader for those formats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N9YYZE3LCUQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009D79VH4#wasThisHelpful","R3N9YYZE3LCUQZ","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these ankle boots for photography shoots, because I needed a glamourous purple boot with a rebellious vibe for the images. The boots fit as expected, according to my model.  She reported that the boots are not super-comfortable, because of the pointed toes and the high heel, but they are acceptable for normal use as long as it doesn't involve long-distance walking.From a purely visual standpoint, these boots look great.  They were flattering to the model and photographed well.  A bit flashy, but it was exactly what I wanted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9EZ7RRS19PEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1TZ7AI#wasThisHelpful","R9EZ7RRS19PEW","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an absolutely ""must have"" book for hiking in the area around Portland, Oregon, which includes hikes near Mount Hood, Mt. Ste. Helens, the Coast, hikes within Portland, and various National Forests and State Parks.  I had and used an earlier version of this book and absolutely loved it, and this update is fantastic.  The descriptions of each hike are useful, personal, and practical.  Directions to the starting point are easy to follow, and the hike profile showing altitude changes is very useful at gauging how difficult a particular hike might turn out to be.  While I would love to see more photos, the photos that are in the book are a good start and allow me to know what to expect on the hike.I got other hiking books for the area, as well as using websites, but I found myself going back to this book again and again because it's so well-written and practical.  I really wish I had discovered this book earlier, because quite honestly, I wasted years missing out on some fantastic, easy-to-do hikes out of simple ignorance.  So, don't make the same mistake I did--get this book and get out there.Since each hike listed includes an evaluation of difficulty--easy, moderate, strenuous--as well as distance, it's easy to find a hike that suits your level of skill and how long you want to hike.  For example, when my parents came to visit, I was able to find a hike that wasn't going to be too long or difficult for them (Trillium Lake), and when my young nephew came to visit, I selected longer, moderate hikes (Ramona Falls and Silver Falls State Park).  This particular edition, the 5th edition, has some useful features:  in the first few pages of the book are summary charts showing each listed hike, distance, difficulty, and best time, as well as whether they are wheelchair-friendly, have good views, or are good for runners.  In the back of the book are appendices listing additional resources.This is a great book that I am confident you will love.  It's a practical and well-balanced book, well-written and interesting, with a great selection of hikes.  It's a must have book and one that is best purchased as a hard-copy rather than as a Kindle version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JOPIZS9ETHPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0897325125#wasThisHelpful","R2JOPIZS9ETHPF","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a memory card capable of sustaining enough write speed for 4K video, and a U3 speed card was what my camera manufacturer recommended.  Luckily, Transcend makes this affordable U3 card with a claimed read speed of 95 MB/sec and a claimed write speed of 60 MB/sec.  I immediately ordered two cards to use in my Panasonic LX100.As soon as the cards arrived, I grabbed one and tested it in my UHS-capable card reader (to get the most speed, your reader must be able to take advantage of UHS controllers).  Long story short:  I got write speeds onto the card of 59 to 60 MB/sec, exactly as advertised.  Read speeds exceeded the 95 MB/sec claimed speed, going into the triple digits.Just for comparison, I compared this card against the U1 Transcend 32 GB SDHC card to see if there was a speed difference.  Yes, there was:  the U1 rated card moved at about 36 to 37 MB/sec (write speed) and read speed was again in the triple digits.  That's actually enough to meet the U3 specification of 30 MB/sec, but there isn't a lot of ""headroom.""So, if you're writing 4K video and/or if your camera can take advantage of UHS-I, I can highly recommend this card to obtain the best possible U3 speed for writing to the card.  It really does do exactly what the label says.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D87E7P70PVYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3KA814#wasThisHelpful","R3D87E7P70PVYX","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a USB 3.0 card reader that's capable of taking advantage of the UHS-1 controllers built into the latest memory cards.  While my current SIIG and Lexar USB 3.0 readers are pretty good, technology marches on and it's important to keep up, if only to save time during transfers of large files.After getting the reader, I tested it with my Windows 8.1 system that has built-in USB 3.0 ports(a Lenovo laptop).  And boy does this card reader deliver the speed.  With my Transcend U3 speed capable cards, I got write speeds of 59 to 60 MB/sec, exactly as claimed, through this card reader.  Even with older U1 speed cards, it was writing to them at 36-37 MB/sec steadily, sufficient to actually meet the U3 speed specification of 30 MB/sec.Read speeds were ridiculous in triple digits.  I could move a 1 gig file so fast off the card that it was too quick to notice--less than 5 seconds.In brief, this card reader works well, delivers the speeds claimed, and is easy to carry with you when you need it.  It has slots for microSD, SDXC/SDHC/SD, and compact flash.  Other reviews have pointed out that you cannot use the microSD and SD slots simultaneously, so please be aware of that.  Otherwise, this is an excellent card reader/writer that delivers exactly as advertised!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNY2QBRY7PHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056TYRMW#wasThisHelpful","R3DNY2QBRY7PHL","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this pan in June 2014 and waited to see how it would hold up after several months of use.  And it's going great--with proper care, this pan should last a long time.  I notice that most of the reviews for this rectangular 13X9 inch pan are actually for the heart shaped cake pan, so my review is specific to the 13"" x 9"" pan.First, I ain't cooking cakes in this thing. I'm putting greasy, meaty things into this baby.  Porch chops, chicken, lasagnas--you know what I'm talking about.  These are things that tend to ruin pans by sticking just enough to ruin the non-stick coatings over time.  Thankfully, this pan has held up very, very well.  I've noticed some light staining but it hasn't seemed to affect the non-stick properties of the pan.Non-stick is a bit hard to claim; stick-resistant would be more accurate.  I still have to do a bit of rubbing to get stuff off the pan, but it's nothing like it would be if this was just a regular pan.  Supposedly the pan has a 10-year warranty, but I would be very happy to get 5 years out of any pan the way I like to cook.This may not be the most expensive pan out there, but it is pretty darn good.  I don't use metal utensils on this pan; you can find safe utensils for things like cutting lasagna that won't scratch the coating like a metal knife will.  Cared for properly, there's no reason why this pan shouldn't provide years of service.  A great bargain choice for pan!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SNLVEURFGIMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DIX5E#wasThisHelpful","R3SNLVEURFGIMS","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most ovens these days seem to cheap out and come with uncoated aluminum broiling pans, which are a pain to use and keep clean.  As someone who enjoys cooking (and eating) but doesn't enjoy cleaning up the mess associated with cooking, I HAD to get something better than el cheapo pan (which is Spanglish for the usual uncoated pan).Enter the Range Kleen 2 Porcelain Pan.  Well, deliver the pan actually; I carried it into the house myself since I would have been scared if this thing could enter the house by itself.  I used it to cook some foods directly on the surface, then went to clean it off.  And voila!  Things didn't stick and the pan looks great.  With the older uncoated pan, I would be scrubbing and worrying about whether I was going to be getting aluminium into my food, as well as getting wrinkly dishpan hands.  This porcelain pan has made using and cleaning much easier for me.It's not as big as the standard pan that came with my oven--same length but not as wide.  Since I don't need the extra space, the lost width (about 25%) is unimportant to me.  I don't have the need to overcompensate for my shortcomings.  But if you really need that space, it might be a consideration for you.  Some people have really large families and might need a bigger broiler pan.  Me, I just give them smaller portions <wink, wink>The pan is made out of better, heavier material than you might expect for the price.  My top pan fits nicely into the lower pan, which sounds kind of dirty, but actually is a good thing--no warping noted.  When heated, the pans don't warp either as far as I've noticed, but I haven't really put my head into the oven to check (despite repeated suggestions from others that I do so).Since people always are looking for negatives, I will say that the edges while not sharp are definitely not baby-smooth rounded.  Since I use oven mitts (my skin isn't strong enough to just grab this right out of the oven), I don't think the risk of cutting yourself is that high, but reasonable care should be exercised when washing the pan.After several uses, the pan still fits well, it still looks like new, and I'm just a little bit fatter and more satisfied, since less food is sticking to the pan and more food is sticking to me.  I think if you are unhappy with your uncoated aluminum broiler pan or if some unscrupulous former resident has taken your broiler pan, this is an excellent replacement.  It only comes in the exciting dark grey color though, so be still your beating heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R40CW6BU38C78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IYHHPO#wasThisHelpful","R40CW6BU38C78","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have hair that is so tough, it could be used to clean the barrel of a cannon.  In fact, when I had a beard and short hair, the guys nick-named me bore brush.  So, no ordinary razor blade is just going to shave this face.  Oh, I've used those 5-bladed razors; you know the kind--with the big heads and even bigger marketing budgets.  But like an Internet whore, they're all promise and no satisfaction.  Give me my razor with some real moves, some real satisfaction.I stared into the mirror.  Some ugly mug stared back at me.  Quickly, I splashed warm water on my face, and the guy in the mirror was still just as ugly, but with a wet face.  A bit of shaving cream, and it was time to transform that ugly guy into the superhero everyone loves.  But like Underdog without his Super Energy Pill, I noticed that my razor was completely dull and powerless.  Thankfully, the geniuses at Amazon had responded quickly to my Polly Purebred call for help and delivered this product--fresh Mach 3 blades--just the day before.  Quickly swapping the blades, I appreciated the thoughtfulness of how Gillette had put the blades into a clear plastic safety case.I wet the blade under the stream of water and began to shave.  Stroke after stroke, my hairs were cut down like trees being mowed down by lumberjack clearcutters on meth.  The sharp blades were like Star Trek Borg--resistance was futile.  No hair could stand against them.  And yet, miraculously, the blades never broke the surface of my skin.  It's the exact opposite experience of shaving with a sander, but I digress.Rinsing the lather off my face, I gazed into the mirror and saw some baby-faced superhero staring back.  I almost wished I could grow my beard again, just so I could shave it off.  But I'll settle for waiting a day or so and coming back again for another round of shaving pleasure.Sure, these Mach 3 blades are great and fit both my Mach 3 and my Mach 3 Turbo handles (which are the same, except the color of the Turbo grip is black, which as we all know makes it faster somehow).  Some people see these as replacement razor cartridges.  I see these guys as Adventure in a Clear Plastic Case.Your mileage may vary.  Batteries not included.

"I love this movie, so I was very excited to see that it's available on Blu-ray. But this transfer is so horrible that I cannot recommend anyone purchase the Flesh & Blood blu-ray.  You would absolutely be wasting your money.  Adding insult to injury, my older DVD version actually upscales better to an HD TV than this blu-ray disc, that's how bad this blu-ray is.The story itself is fairly simple:  set in medieval times, with plague ravaging the land, virginal Agnes gets kidnapped by a gang of mercenaries, who soon take over a castle.  Her noble boyfriend sets off in pursuit of her, but in the meantime, Agnes has started manipulating mercenary leader Rutger Hauer.  It's gory but entertaining, with sex, nudity, violence, and a bit of questionable science thrown in for more fun.Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Agnes, and she's something to see.  However, the poor transfer ruins virtually all the fun scenes with her, which take place in dim light.  This is a problem that does not exist in the DVD version, which means that it's a problem with the transfer itself and not the original material.Thus, while I find the story to be entertaining and about 4-stars, this product is a zero-star product.  Save your money and avoid frustration:  Do NOT buy the blu-ray.  You will be bitterly disappointed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SC07PNCZQKS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LC4PCPG#wasThisHelpful","R2SC07PNCZQKS8","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this bed as a prop for a photography shoot, and I needed something inexpensive that could hold a twin-sized mattress (which I already had).  This bed was exactly what I was looking for, with only some minor drawbacks.Assembly is required, and it took me an hour and 15 minutes to complete with the included tools (a simple wrench and an allen hex key).  The box arrives in a surprisingly small package.  My box had partially broken open during shipping, but none of the parts had gotten lost.  A single person can assemble this bed in about an hour and 15 minutes; don't let the many pieces or screws intimidate you when you open the package.  The instructions are easy to figure out (simple diagrams) but I would have preferred some actual wording to explain things too.So once assembled, it looks pretty good.  It's study and level.  So here's the drawbacks:  1)  the bed is not easy to take apart if you ever need to move or store.  The way it's assembled require you to almost completely disassemble it if you ever want to change residences or just store the frame; 2)  the rounded rods on the bottom make it too easy to slide the mattress around; 3) while the rods are reasonably close together, I can't help but feel that a flat surface would be better for the mattress on top.  I'm thinking a thin sheet of masonite might be a good addition for this bed if you plan on using it for any length of time.Anyway, this bed looks as it is pictured, it's certainly sturdy enough, and it wasn't too hard to put together.  It's inexpensive, though you might find a used frame and headboard combo on your local Craigslist for less.  I can recommend this bed frame, but please keep in mind the drawbacks I mentioned above, as they may be deal-breakers for some people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BQSKH9CQZ859/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8I4APS#wasThisHelpful","R2BQSKH9CQZ859","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this screen to use for my photography as an interesting backdrop and it's gorgeous.  I now wish I'd gotten the 4-panel version, because this 3-panel version looks and works so dang nice and I'd like a little more width in my photos.  If you actually need it as a changing screen, it works quite well too!When shipped, it arrives folded and flat.  No assembly is required, you simply get it out of the box and unfold it.  And for storage, you can fold it back up  again so it's flat and only 1-panel wide and a few inches thick.  Mine arrived with a couple of the cross pieces pushed out of place, but simply pushing them back into position fixed that.  Just be aware that the screen part is fragile and inspect your screen on delivery.It seems obvious, but I'll state it explicitly:  the screen cannot stand on its own if completely unfolded.  You need to have the panels at an angle to keep it upright.  The cherry finish is gorgeous and adds a touch of class to any room with furniture that has a matching finish.  The hinges are properly attached and are not loose.Whether it's for photography, as a set piece, or for a practical changing screen, this is a great addition.  About the only thing you should be thinking about if you're looking for a screen like this is whether you should get the 4-panel screen instead.  If you're doing photography like me, get the 4-panel.  If you just need to create a little bit of privacy in a smaller area, the 3-panel does that.

"I purchased the Nikon D3200 with 18-55mm lens as a Christmas gift for my sister's boyfriend, who has an older Canon 40D SLR.  He LOVES it, and I've ""converted him to the Darkside.""  Even though his 40D is a good camera in its own right, the more modern technology, better out of camera color, and menu system of the Nikon D3200 have re-ignited his love of photography.  The D3200 is being phased out at the moment, resulting in great bargains for camera and lens kits.With the capability to do both video and still photography, the D3200 is a great step for budding filmmakers and family photographers.  The quality of the images far surpasses what can be done with a cell phone camera, but at the cost of more weight and larger physical size.  The ability to change lenses to suit a particular situation is a huge plus, as well as the ability to control exposure.The camera itself has a nice large screen on the back, a pop-up flash, and the ability to be used in all the camera modes you'd expect from full manual control to aperture or shutter automation to a program mode that turns the camera into a point and shoot machine.  A helpful guide feature in the menu system greatly assists inexperienced photographers, and the large screen on the back makes it easy to see camera settings (although I prefer a screen on the top panel, which this camera lacks).  You can shoot at up to 4 frames per second, which is as fast as expensive film cameras of the 1980's.The drawbacks for this camera include its smaller size, which may not accomodate some large handed shooters; settings which can only be accessed via the menu instead of a dedicated button; and the fact that the newer D3300 offers improved performance and reduced size for about $100 more.So, what to do with your hard-earned money?  As of this writing the D3200 is an incredible bargain, with features suitable for all levels of shooters from beginners to professionals.  Quite frankly, for someone who knows how to properly use a camera, you will only get better images from a more expensive camera in highly specialized situations (like virtually no light or where you might need 11 frames or more per second).  The feature set difference between the D3200 and D3300 is negligible, making the D3200 the better buy.  If you're in the market for a digital SLR and money is tight, look no futher:  The D3200 will re-ignite your passion for photography just like it did for my sister's boyfriend.  He's already bugging me for lens recommendations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDL0RX2CGVBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQQPRGG#wasThisHelpful","RFDL0RX2CGVBY","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the DVD version of Gator Bait 2: Cajun Justice. To make a long story short, this is a 3-star movie with a 1-star transfer to DVD.  The movie is okay, with a fairly straightforward rape and revenge storyline with an attractive female lead, but the DVD transfer is just horrible with artifacts everwhere.  If you liked the movie on VHS, you will be mad at spending money to get this DVD which looks horrible.Gator Bait 2: Cajun Justice is not really much of a sequel to the original Gator Bait.  Jan MacKenzie plays a city girl who marries a Cajun guy so they can go live in the Bayou.  A bunch of inbred-types kidnap her after she takes a bath, torment and eventually gang rape her.  She escapes and then takes revenge on them.  End of story.  Like I said, a fairly straightforward storyline, made more watchable by the charms of Jan MacKenzie who plays sexy and vulnerable very well in this story.So, you'd expect the DVD to be much, much better than the VHS version in which the movie was originally released.  It's not.  Not only are there no extras but the transfer itself is just poor.  I can't help but feel that if I simply did my own transfer from LaserDisc (I own the LaserDisc version) to digital that it would be a lot better than this DVD.  About the only reason to buy the DVD version is so you can put the VHS machine away.  Just don't expect it to look any better (and indeed it often looks worse) than watching it on VHS.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19N4I458OVTAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009R68HFI#wasThisHelpful","R19N4I458OVTAI","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This may be a mediocre miniseries, but it's 5 stars for Hayley Atwell (Captain America, Agent Carter) and Ruth Wilson (The Affair), who play the lead female roles.  I purchased the Blu-ray version, which is available as an import from Spain.  All six episodes are one one disk.The blu-ray plays just fine in my U.S. region LG blu-ray player.  So, it is region-free.  The image quality is what you would expect from a high definition source.  Colors are good, the picture quality is sharp.  While the default language is Spanish, the menu option ""idiomas"" allows you to select ""ingles"" or English as the language for viewing, just like when it aired on American TV.Sadly, despite the radiant and memorable appearances of Hayley Atwell and Ruth Wilson, the miniseries suffers from the sin of being boring and does not compare well with the original Patrick McGoohan series.  The ultimate mystery of why Jim Cavaziel is in the village gets lost in an confused and unclear storyline.So, while I cannot be enthusiastic about the miniseries, I can say that it's worth watching just to see Ruth Wilson and Hayley Atwell in early roles.  Fans of The Walking Dead will also be pleased to see Lennie James in a key role as well.  Ian McKellan is his usual articulate self.

"I have never used a wet saw before, so I can't compare this to another product.  What I can say is that for me, a complete and utter beginner with using a wet saw, this wet saw works great.  The set up of the product was easy, taking only a few minutes.  The hardest part was getting the circular blade properly mounted; that took a couple of minutes.After that, it was simply a matter of adding water into the reservoir and using the saw.  I cut 3/8"" granite tiles, 18"" x 18"".  As others advised, I took my time, but the blade had no problem cutting the granite.  The dual ruler markings make it easy to align and make straight cuts.  The guard over the blade works great--it keeps the saw from spitting water everywhere.  The top of the saw has channels which capture water and direct it back into the reservoir.  Nice.There's a side extension, which was somewhat useful.  The guide locks well and the engraved rulers are accurate and extremely useful.  I made about 50 different cuts of all my granite tiles and they were all perfect.Yes, this saw is slightly more pricey than the other saw that's really popular here.  But for me, the extra price of this Skil saw was worth it for the power and relative lack of water spitting.  I feel pretty confident that I could tackle some more tile jobs around the house, saving me a lot of money.  If a complete beginner/amateur like me can use this saw and feel good about it, then this must be a five-star product.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E639Z08O8K0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J21SL6S#wasThisHelpful","R3E639Z08O8K0E","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been taking adult piano for just over a year now, and this Easy Movie Fake book is perfect for me!  It's perfect for any advanced beginner piano student.  The chords are listed in the back and there's plenty of easy to play songs inside.  The book is out of print, so it's easy to overpay because it's in demand.  The arrangements themselves are very simple, so players who are above the beginner stage may find the songs less than challenging.

"Got this Moen drain for my new stainless steel sink.  Fits perfectly, looks good and works great.  The stopper holds water in the sink without any problem.

"This is a good sink.  I needed an undermount sink to go with my new granite countertops, and like most people shopping on Amazon, I wanted to get the best one possible while not spending a ton of money.  Having gotten a stainless steel sink before for a prior home, I was concerned about getting a sink without a tinny sound.  What got my attention first was the price--this sink is far less expensive than competitive sinks.  The second thing that got my attention was that it has sound-dampening pads underneath the sink.I was concerned about the thickness of the sink--18 gauge steel is pretty thin; 16 gauge would be preferable.  And when the sink arrived, the light weight made me a bit more concerned, especially compared to the cast iron sink it replaced.  Once the sink and new faucet got installed though, all my fears evaporated and turned to joy.  Because this sink is an absolutely fantastic value and it works great!Turning on the tap, the sound of the water hitting the sink was soft like with the cast iron sink, not tinny at all.  The sound dampening pads really work great!  I don't need to add any kind of insulation or coating on the bottom to make it more solid.  It looks and fits great inside my kitchen sink cabinet, which is 35 inches wide.  It's a deep sink too, 9"" plus the height of the granite.  It came without drains, so I had to buy those separately (one for a disposal and a regular one with a strainer basket stopper).Both bowls are equal-sized, so if you have particularly large pots, you might want to consider a sink with one bowl larger than the other or even a single bowl sink.  Otherwise, this sink is fine for most dishes, pots, and pans.  The stainless steel with the brushed finish is perfect for hiding normal wear and tear.Bottom-line:  great sink, great price, has sound dampening, and sounds good and solid when water hits the sink (no tinny sound).  A little thin and light, but you can't tell that once it's mounted.  An excellent value and good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MST8QJZA2HRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XDDG38#wasThisHelpful","R3MST8QJZA2HRT","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After getting my kitchen and bathroom counters replaced, I decided to do the new backsplashes myself, which necessitated getting some drywall spackling to repair the holes and scrapes from when the old backsplashes were removed.  Initially, I got a generic drywall spackle from the local ""HD"" store, and that worked pretty well.  However, I ran out with a couple of rooms left to do, so I ran out to the other big-box hardware store competitor ""L"" and found that DAP Vinyl Spackling was available for the same price as the generic, so I picked that up.  What a big mistake!Unlike the generic, this vinyl spackling ran down the drywall like slowly melting ice cream.  It did fine on really small gouges, but if the damage was wide or deep, it didn't work as well as the generic.  It seems to be significantly wetter than the generic and this made it a problem.  It also really likes to stick to itself, but it doesn't seem to like sticking to the drywall.  So, I would apply it to the wall, then watched as it slowly oozed down the gouge, leaving a depression at the top of the gouge and a beer belly of spackling hanging off the bottom of the gouge.Working it with a straight edge to get it flat was also a problem.  Again, it's okay for small gouges, but for anything deeper than 1/8"" or wider than an inch, I found that the straight edge tended to grab this spackle and pull it out of the hole or gouge.  Instead of a nice flat surface, I often either had the spackle pull out of the hole or make pointy spackle mountains.  Using a wet straight edge had its own problems, making the spackle even wetter so it would run faster out of the gouge.The instructions say to use it above 50 degrees.  Well, I can't even recommend using it at any temperature.  Sure, it's spackle and yes, it's going to eventually cover the holes with repeated applications.  I'm sure it'll last a long time and is less likely to crumble compared to generic spackle.  But given the two different experiences I had today, where the generic stuff applied well, stuck to the drywall, and was way easier to work with, I cannot give this vinyl spackle more than two stars.I really hate to rate it this low, because I've used and liked DAP products in the past.  But I can't let anyone else waste their time by using this stuff when the generic spackling works better.  From what I've read online, vinyl spackling is supposed to be for bigger and deeper gouges, but this stuff would require you to apply it in multiple coats to fill the gouge/hole.  Unless you specifically need vinyl spackling, I suggest staying with the generic drywall stuff which is easier to apply and less frustrating.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNKS00Q18VFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002N6G4#wasThisHelpful","R1LNKS00Q18VFU","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful, entry-level Swiss automatic watch. With its classic look, which include a date complication at the three o'clock position and Arabic numerals at 12, 6, and 9 positions, the Hamilton is a great introduction to collecting watches.  The band is brown leather, with a buckle.  The face of this model has gold markings against an off-white background, with a patterned-center.  Lume is dim, but sufficient. The hands have a nice shape to them.In terms of accuracy, mechanical watches are generally not up to the accuracy of a quartz watch.  My particular Hamilton was is no exception,  sometimes gaining 10 seconds a day or losing about 6 seconds a day, depending upon how the watch is moved during the day.  Over the course of a week, it's within 30 seconds of the correct time.If I had to cite a weakness for this design, it would be the power reserve of this self-winder.  A couple of time, after wearing it all day, the watch would be dead the next day, having run down about 12 hours after I took it off.  That seems a little short to me.  Either I'm not moving my wrist enough or the watch isn't very efficient at capturing my movements. Since the watch is dressy, odds are that most users will move their wrists/arms in a typical office environment,  that is to say, not as active as someone constantly doing physical labor.  Compared to my cheap Invictas with their Japanese movements, the Hamilton doesn't apparently have a large reserve or perhaps only winds in one rotational direction.Compared to my Oris, this watch is quite favorable, with its conservative good looks and Swiss mechanics.  It's priced much more moderately too.Tissot makes a similar watch that you might also consider.Overall, not the best Swiss watch, but certainly a good choice to start with.  It has the classic look, Swiss internals which are found in more expensive watches, and a price that makes it affordable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R306GAHZIFNUUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LB8CUI#wasThisHelpful","R306GAHZIFNUUM","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful watch; the photos really don't do it justice.  The face has some dimensionality and depth to it, making it a good looking watch.It keeps perfect time.  Over the last two weeks, it has been 100% accurate, with no deviation from the time I initially set it to.  It matches my radio-controlled Casio watch (which is synchronized to an atomic clock daily).  I expect that it will hold fairly close to the claimed 10 seconds accuracy per year.The hand sweeps quite nicely, better than mechanical automatic watches.  It helps to set it apart from other quartz watches.Bottom-line, it feels good to have a watch that keeps accurate time that doesn't require a daily synchronization and that looks much more expensive than it really is.  This precisionist movement is really worth the investment, although your experience may vary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TJGGGA6G8WRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00700822Q#wasThisHelpful","R1TJGGGA6G8WRV","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trying to make the home more energy efficient can be difficult when the outdoor lights have the tiny candelabra base instead of the standard light bulb base.  But instead of getting all new outdoor fixtures, I decided to use these Feit 4.8 Watt LED bulbs to replace the 40 watt incandescent bulbs in the fixtures.The good news:  they fit the candelabra base just fine.  The bulbs are a little fatter than the standard incandescent bulbs, but this turned out not to be a problem for my light fixture.  If you have a tight squeeze in a fixture with regular bulbs, you may find these ones a little too fat.More good news:  I had to replace nine incandescent bulbs, but since these use so little energy I'm basically getting light from nine bulbs while using the same power as one of the old incandescent bulbs.The so-so news:  The light is not as bright/penetrating as the old incandescent bulbs.  I would say that they put out more than a 25 watt bulb, but less than a new 40 watt bulb.  Since incandescent bulbs exhibit worse performance over time, these bulbs should be much more consistent.  The light is more white than warm; 3000 degrees Kelvin is pretty generous, and I think it's closer to 4000 as the light is fairly white.  It works just fine for my outdoor application.Overall I am happy with my bulbs.  I ordered three packages and all nine bulbs are working fine.  The bulbs are marked as suitable for a damp environment, so outdoors in an enclosure should be fine.  I can't give them the full five stars because they simply aren't as bright as they claim (although they are pretty close).  The relatively high price will be offset by cost savings and reliability over time, so hopefully the claimed life is accurate.  And using 1/10 the energy of my old lights makes me feel better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AKCT7B7NDMWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ED55XT6#wasThisHelpful","R3AKCT7B7NDMWH","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've now had this watch for over a year, so I can definitely say a few things about it.  This is a diver-style watch, with silver face and rose-gold colored markings, including the rotating bezel and arrowhead hash marks.  In keeping with current styles, it's quite large, quite thick and heavy, which makes it somewhat impractical as a daily dress watch.  Indeed, it's so thick that some people may have trouble with dress shirt cuffs and this watch.  That's a shame, because it's (in my opinion) a beautiful watch to look at.  It looks far more expensive than it actually is, and the contrast of the rose gold with the silver face draws plenty of eyes to look at it.Dress watches are usually much thinner, but many people now wear diver's watches as their ""daily beater"" to work.  The style of this watch would seem more suited to the office than the garage though, and that's where the size becomes something of a drawback.  Unless your have some room in your shirt cuffs or wear (horrors!) short-sleeve shirts, you're going to notice your shirt catching on this watch.Invicta has placed a Japanese Seiko NH35a self-winding movement inside the beautiful case, and this movement has some really nice features.  For example, unlike less expensive Seiko movements, this one ""hacks"" (e.g. the sweeping second hand stops when the crown is pulled all the way out) and can be hand wound when the crown is loosened from its locked-down position.  The hand-winding is a particularly nice feature if you haven't worn the watch recently and need to get it set and running quickly; it's better than twisting your wrist repeatedly to self-wind.As with most mechanical watches, the accuracy of this watch depends on day-to-day wear.  As a practical matter, I noticed the time was off by a minute or two after a couple of weeks.  This is to be expected with a self-winding watch in this price range.  It is normal and not a defect.The crystal does not have a ""Cyclops"" or magnifying glass over the date, which may be hard for some people to see.  I myself do not have an issue with this, but some people might.  I think leaving the Cyclops off gives the watch a better look, and I don't have a problem reading the date.The case back is see through, allowing you to show off the details of the essentially unadorned movement to interested parties.  It is pretty nice to be able to see the mechanism at work.Overall, this is a large, beautiful watch in search of the right audience.  Its size doesn't quite go with its dressy style.  Its sporty diver's look is contrasted by its dressy, rose gold accents on a silver face.  Its modern sizing contrasts with the classic look.  The pairing of a reliable Japanese automatic movement at this price point is remarkable.  If you can handle the size and the look, it's a good value.  Just know that it's not your granddaddy's watch and it won't be as thin or as small as you might expect.  Think of it as the BBW of watches.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RJO86P6AHI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YW9BSG#wasThisHelpful","R35RJO86P6AHI0","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a truly beautiful timepiece, with a clean classic look.  While some prefer a watch with Roman numerals, I prefer the Arabic numbers instead.  The silver-faced dial is clean, with raised numerals and hash marks.  The date complication is located at the 6 o'clock position, which gives this watch a very balanced, even look that doesn't exist with watches where the date is displayed at the 3 o'clock position.The exhibition back displays the Oris movement, with the red Oris balance wheel.  It's actually an ETA 2895-2 movement that is just a modification of the ETA 2892 for a small second hand.  Oris does some decorating, but at its base, it's an ETA movement, found in many other Swiss watches.In terms of time keeping, the watch has been accurate over the last two days, varying only by a second.  Since the calendar must be adjusted periodically, the variation of a few seconds over a couple of months can easily be corrected when adjusting the calendar.The leather band is attractive.  Initially I was planning on swapping for a black band, but the dark brown band has really grown on me.  Adjusting it is very easy with Oris' band deployment.Overall, an excellent choice for anyone who needs a classic, understated dress watch with a Swiss movement.About the only flaw is that as a dress watch, it's not rated for anything other than hand-washing water resistance.  The watch isn't designed for swimming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I2QW3KSDXT03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049E0JWC#wasThisHelpful","R2I2QW3KSDXT03","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great, stylish watch that keeps very good time, but its success in styling is marred by a truly horrible band attachment that prevents the band from curving down my wrist.  This is a good to great watch for someone with a wrist above 7-1/2 or 7-3/4 inches, but below that, the horns/connectors of the watch will cause the band to stick out slightly from the wrist.  Unfortunately, the connectors are not flexible.  It's a real shame, as this is a stylish, nice looking dress watch that isn't expensive.Besides being stylish, a major plus for this watch is the easy adjusting band, which features infinite adjustments which can be done by just about anyone at home.  The band itself is comfortable and the double-clasp system seems sturdy enough for me on this model.  The watch face is beautiful, with carbon fiber edging.  The white numbers are legible.  The date complication is somewhat small though and the watch will have to be held somewhat closer to be able to read the date (black numbers on a white background).  The crown is small, and doesn't feel terribly sturdy.  In fact, it feels like the cheapest thing on the watch, which is a shame because the watch itself is really beautiful.The date can be adjusted by pulling the crown out halfway and turning the crown so the top rotates counter-clockwise (when viewed from the side).Given the cheap feel of the crown and the limitation of the band attachments, I can't rate this watch higher than 3 stars for people with wrists 7-1/2"" or smaller.  Indeed, while the watch case is 40mm, with the band issue, the watch is effectively 50mm in size on the wrist.  Definitely a beautiful watch but only for those with large diameter wrists.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4P7DSG8JLVHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I683AG#wasThisHelpful","R4P7DSG8JLVHP","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I attended the Comic-Con panel on July 24, 2014, which featured Adam West, Julie Newmar, and Burt Ward, as well as clips from the Blu-ray release and information on extras. I can confirm that the Limited Edition Blu-Ray will include never before seen photos, a Hot Wheels Batmobile, and several featurettes on the disks.  The episodes themselves look gorgeous--scratches cleaned up, colors corrected, modest sharpening done.  At the split screens showing the old TV broadcast vs. the new Blu-Ray, the improvements were stunning.  This will be a ""must-own"" for physical media.  Episodes will be complete and uncut. They even showed cameos by Dick Clark, the Green Hornet and Kato, and Bill Dana as Jos Jimenez. Fans will not be disappointed.UPDATE:Here's an update on the set after actual delivery:The Blu-ray completely lives up to the picture quality shown at Comic-Con.  Colors pop off the screen, the image is sharp with no annoying noise or grain, even in dark scenes.  For example, you can make out when Batman needs a shave, the natural grain in Batman's cowl, even the ragged threads of Batman's cape.  For the first time, I noticed that Batman's ""ears"" are a different color than most of his cowl. Simply amazing.Because the original show was not wide screen, on modern HDTVs, you can expect black bars on the side of your screen.The seasons are individually-cased, and each season has disks that are color-coded, so you won't accidentally mix up the disks.  Special features are on the last disk in the Season 3 set.I can also confirm that the ""Batgirl Pilot"" is included in the special features, under the section entitled ""Bat Rarities! Straight from the Vault"".  Also included there are Burt Ward's screen test with Adam West, Screen tests of Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell, and a tribute to James Blakeley, production manager on Batman and The Green Horner.The Batgirl Pilot is not re-mastered, so the colors are faded with scratches and other defects visible.The included Episode Guide is okay, but while it gives a short description of each episode, lists the villain, original airdate, writer and director, it doesn't list the guest star(s) for each episode.  The actors playing the villains are named only the first time they make an appearance in an episode; subsequent episodes only list the villains name, which is fine unless you have to want to view a later episode and can't remember which actor is playing the villain.This set is exactly what it was promised to be--the best color, the best imagery, the most complete set of the Batman TV-series ever.  It's the pinnacle of what Blu-ray was meant to deliver.  Gripe about the price, but it's well worth it if you love Batman and have a high-definition set.  Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZ3NK19KJF5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LT1JHLW#wasThisHelpful","R3TZ3NK19KJF5V","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love these USB 2.0 Mediabridge cables.

With ordinary cables, the phone will charge at a much slower level.As a data cable, it works just fine for transferring files.  The connections are reliable.Quality-wise, you can't beat these cables.  The insulation is thick.  I like the 10 foot length--makes it easy to plug a phone into a wall charger and keep the phone on a nightstand or table.  The usual 6 foot cables never seem to be long enough.

"I can only echo what everyone else here has said:  the Karcher T350 surface cleaner works and it's a real time saver.  Setup is less than 5 minutes, and the unit itself has options for power (moving the heads closer or further from the surface to be cleaned) and lift (opening doors for how much the unit ""hovers"" over the surface).On my dirty driveway, it took what would be about 3 to 4 hours with a wand into an almost pleasant 45 minute session with minimal splash back.  Yes, some dirt and debris will still leak out, so expect to get the bottom 4 inches or so of you pants covered in grime.

You can lift the unit to get a blast of water to help clear the remaining dirt, lest it sit and dry in place.The unit actually does hover quite nicely, and bit of care is needed or the unit will fly up from the water pressure.  The Karcher T350 does come with a two-piece metal hose tube that screws directly into the trigger wand of many pressure washers.  An adapter is included to fit with some types of wands from non-Karcher pressure washers.  The user holds onto the tube much like a broom, only with a grip to keep the unit from lifting off the ground.Definitely a ""must buy"" for anyone who uses a pressure washer to clean areas like driveways.  It's a huge time saver and easy to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P6DGZ6GYDFYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EDVTLW#wasThisHelpful","R3P6DGZ6GYDFYU","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered the Generac 6596 2,800 pressure washer and when it arrived, I couldn't wait to start using it to clean my driveway.  Setup was very easy, taking about 20 minutes to get the pieces out of the box, get the handle onto the frame, screwing on some hoses, and adding oil and fuel.  No tools were required, so even the most unskilled person could get this thing working easily.The instructions remind you in multiple places never to start without having your water hooked up and turned on, so as long as you follow the setup instructions, it shouldn't be a problem getting the washer working.  Mine started on the first pull, which is pretty impressive.This model of Generac comes with 4 wand tips, ranging from a cleaning solution tip to a 0 degree ""blast"" tip.  I paired mine up with a Karcher T350 surface cleaner (rated at 2650 psi, so use at your own risk), and it worked great cleaning my driveway.  It made a normally 2 to 4 hour job a 45 minute job, plus it didn't leave streaks or areas where I missed.The large wheels and upright orientation make the pressure washer easy to move around, and the placement of the hose connectors made it easy NOT to accidentally get the hose up against the hot engine (a cause of failure in other models).  This Generac also comes with a detergent reservoir, although since I didn't use it, I can't say how well it works.Bottom-line for me:  this is an affordable power washer that does the job.  It cost me less than what I would have paid a professional, it accepted an inexpensive surface cleaner attachment, and it's powerful enough to get a dirt and moss encrusted driveway clean.  I can't speak to long-term reliability, but I will update if there are any significant changes in performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381LI59N7DDYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEO8BHI#wasThisHelpful","R381LI59N7DDYN","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie is one of my favorites from when I was a child.  The images of flying saucers attacking Washington DC stuck with me for decades (and in fact, the scenes are basically stolen again for ""Mars Attacks!"").  While Mars Attacks! is a bore, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers has a distinct 1950's charm to it.  From the idea that 1950's technology could somehow match the civilization of an interstellar race to the boss marrying his secretary employee,  it's a snapshot of an optimistic yet paranoid time long gone by.One of the more interesting scenes involves a ""differential analyzer,"" a primitive type of computer seen both here and in ""When Worlds Collide"" (another great classic sci-fi movie).  Today, we have phones that are way more powerful than a device that took up half a room.  There's reel to reel tape recorders, V2 style rockets, and some primitive but effective special effects miniatures.The plot is fairly simple:  aliens intend to force the Earth to surrender, and make contact with a rocket scientist to act as their go-between.  Earth decides to resist of course, so it's up to the rocket scientist to come up with a way to drive the invaders away, culminating in a spectacular battle in Washington, DC.Today, we know far more from movies about things like lasers, kinetic energy weapons, computers, etc. so this movie definitely will feel dated to today's more sophisticated audience.  But it's still enjoyable as a classic and as a snapshot of the life/society was like back then.  It's practically begging for a modern remake that isn't a boring parody (I'm looking at you, Mars Attacks!).  Definitely a must own for fanatical movie sci-fi fans, for someone looking for something to entertain young kids (a few people do die though), and for people who just like older movies.  Nit-pickers and people in love with modern special effects won't enjoy this movie as much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SB9P5QP264HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006CXGG#wasThisHelpful","R2SB9P5QP264HO","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a replacement sensor after my original sensor disappeared from outside.  I was pleased to find out that a new sensor was inexpensive and this one was fully compatible with my base station (just check the back of your readout station for the IT-915 logo if you need to check compatibility with this sensor).When I received it, it was as simple as popping batteries into the remote sensor, then into the base station and waiting 30 seconds for them to sync up.My wireless sensor has been outdoors in some heavy rain, sheltered under a plant.  It's working fine and keeps accurate temperatures (I like it a lot better than the competing Acurite weather station I also own).

"I got two sets of these chairs for my round patio table, and they look really nice.  As others have noted, you can't really keep them folded up unless you use a strap or rope on the seat, and turning them upside down to keep it folded will likely scratch the top of the seat and the arm tips.  The chairs seem sturdy enough, but I wouldn't put someone over 250 lbs. into one of these chairs.  The connections appear to be good quality brass, so they should last even in bad weather.

"I purchased this carpet cleaner because I realized it was half the price of having a commercial carpet cleaner come in.  I had previously owned a Hoover, which I liked but I had given it away several moves ago.  This model is a more advanced version of what I had owned.  Quite simply, this is an excellent cleaner that sucks up a lot of dirt without soaking the carpet.  The brushes work great and help to loosen the dirt.What sets this cleaner apart is the clean water rinse ability.  Most other cleaners spray a mix of detergent and water, then vacuum it up.  This Hoover allows for a plain water rinse, which not only pulls up more dirt, but leftover detergent as well.My carpets dried within a few hours and look better than when I had the carpets professionally cleaned.  Plus, I can clean them any time I want for just the cost of detergent.Disassembly and cleaning are easy.  It's shocking to pour out the dirty water tank.  A quick rinse in the tub and the tanks are good to go.I really like this cleaner and it earns 5 stars for value and performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K2435CUWGW1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013YPWE6#wasThisHelpful","R2K2435CUWGW1X","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somehow, I always pictured Harry Bosch as more rumpled and heavier, but Titus Welliver does a credible job at capturing the rough-edged detective.  The LA locations and supporting actors, coupled with a good storyline, really help to make this Pilot work, and I hope Amazon approves it as a series, although I don't want them to take 10 episodes to solve a murder.(spoilers follow)In the pilot, Harry Bosch is a driven LA homicide detective who lives alone and has no life except for his murder cases.  He's so driven that he'll even take overtime work from other cops, just to have a puzzle to solve.  While working overtime, he's called to meet with a retired doctor, whose dog has found what appears to be the bone of a child.  Complicating matters for Bosch is the fact that he's also facing a civil suit for killing a serial killer suspect, that he doesn't trust his assistant chief, and that he's under media scrutiny for his civil trial.Compared to the books, the live action version makes a few changes.  Obviously, unlike the book Bosch, the Amazon Bosch is not a Vietnam veteran.  Deputy Chief Irvin Irving is now an African-American, where in the books, he seemed more like an angry, uptight white guy.  However, he still likes jazz and still lives on a hillside.Overall, this pilot is very refreshing.  The characters are interesting and the acting and dialogue are believable.  Titus Welliver is watchable as Harry Bosch, and he conveys the essential pain and emotional walling off of Harry Bosch, without ever revealing it to the other characters.  A few things bothered me--the skull of the murder victim looked too adult (the bones shouldn't be joined together like that); Bosch is just a little too smooth with the ladies; there aren't any real angry exchanges between Irving and Bosch.  But given a chance, this show has the capability to hit some real high notes.  Definitely worth investing in, not only for Amazon, but for the viewer as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO3VY8ZZ1AN34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3MPDP4#wasThisHelpful","RO3VY8ZZ1AN34","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(spoilers follow, although I don't know how something rotten can be spoiled more).I had great hopes when I saw that Chris Carter of the X-files was the writer and director.  However, within seconds of the show starting, those hopes were dashed by the truly horrific acting of French actress Louise Monot, who practices completely unconvincingly for her audition.  Apparently, she's in LA looking for an acting gig, while her husband and daughter are in NYC, where there are apparently no acting gigs.  Right.This is followed by a bunch of really annoying people all getting together on an elevator, just like that Twilight Zone episode where all the characters turn out to be dolls stuck in the donation bin.  Drunk/rude Irishman? Check.  Rich old lady?  Check.  Bad French actress? Check.  Lady cop wearing vest but no patches/badge?  Check.  When the elevator stops and the bickering begins, I instantly hated every one of these characters, mostly because they don't talk or behave like real people do.After escaping the elevator and finding themselves trapped in the garage (which conveniently doesn't have a fire exit), our group is joined by the snooty lawyer dude from Heroes and his prostitute girlfriend, along with an escaped African-American convict who claims to have been wrongly convicted.  At this point, you'd be correct in thinking that Chris Carter thinks we're mushrooms, because he's feeding us crap and keeping us in the dark.  None of this story works.  It only gets worse as the story progresses, and we see what's happening outside the building.The characters don't act like normal people.  They don't talk like normal people. Worse, the ""event"" that keeps them together makes no sense either.  Having been in real disasters, I can tell you that people do not walk about aimlessly in downtown cities, nor do they start behaving badly.  Indeed, disasters in the real world have a tendency to bring out the best in people helping each other.  Not for Chris Carter apparently.  His extras just walk around with no apparent purpose except for eye candy; there's no logic at all to why the group never bothers to ask each others' names; and we have no idea why this group of people sticks together when clearly, they don't even like each other.  Imagine being trapped in a room with a guy who smells of alcohol, an obnoxious lawyer, a gay clown, and a cop who just shot someone; and then imagine what you might do after you got away from them.  Yeah, that's not what the stupid French actress does.This intrepid band of losers decamps to the rich old lady's Bel Air mansion (so the hooker can get naked in front of strangers for a swim and quote the Bible), only later to flee to the well-known Bel Air National Forest (?), conveniently located behind the house (?), because they're too stupid to recognize a bunch of gang members with guns (""They're here to rescue us!"").  There in the forest, they encounter a demon creature and the show ends, mercifully.Now the show has some possible good points.  I like the creepiness as the characters all discover they have something in common.  The demon creature is good.  And I don't mind that the hooker character gets nekkid and goes swimming while LA burns.Sadly though, this is like picking corn out of a dung heap.  I really expected more from Amazon and Chris Carter.  The truly bad acting, the unlikeable characters, the bad writing, and the implausible behaviors all act like lead weights on a boat, sinking this pilot show.  Clearly, Chris Carter was aiming for some kind of Neil Gaiman-like story but ended up with a bad Tim LaHaye ""Left Behind"" interpretation instead.  You deserve better--don't watch this loser.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QD7RT21LDBNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3MP3SG#wasThisHelpful","R3QD7RT21LDBNJ","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Worlds Collide is based on a book of the same name, which influenced movies from this one to Deep Impact and Armegeddon.  Parts of the book have been changed to make the movie more entertaining.Produced by legendary sci-fi producer George Pal, When Worlds Collide tells the story of what happens when astronomers discover that the world is on a collision course with a rogue star.  Scientists desperately try to create a ""space ark"" to send survivors to a planet accompanying the rogue star, in the hopes of saving a small remnant of the human race.Released in 1951, the movie offers some good color and good acting.  The lead male reminds me a bit of Danny Kaye, but thankfully never bursts into song or starts dancing.  Sharp-eyed viewers will notice Hayden Rourke (Doctor Bellows from I Dream of Jeannie) or Stuart Whitman (Those Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines), but the real star is the 1951 special effects, which look pretty good even today, although they use a lot of miniatures and matte paintings.Definitely a ""must see"" for anyone who is serious about their science fiction movie collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BD5WFZIX8RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEBB94G#wasThisHelpful","R9BD5WFZIX8RM","A2NJG2VNE0CHV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJG2VNE0CHV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is regarding the full, paid version of the game.I would probably have given this game a four-star rating, but unfortunately when I was on the next-to-last chapter and opened up the game to play, the game opened up a window and said that the file had been corrupted and that the game would restart. So after hours of play, I was kicked back to the beginning of the game and all of my progress was lost.Also once you got beyond the blue dragon's gatekeeper scenes, the map only showed the location of the chapter's main objective, e.g. gathering the dragon eggs, rather than the scenes where the player needed to completely an action - as it had previously been showing.The game otherwise was enjoyable. Artwork was beautiful. Hidden object scenes had items appropriate to the setting and time, and seemed to be paced nicely throughout the story; there were plenty of them for those who like them (I do, when they are well done). There was a nice mix of puzzles; I only skipped one. The map allowed you to travel from one location to another.  Setting the story in ancient China made it a nice change from the usual fantasy locales.  There are three game difficulty modes; I played the middle one which only put sparkles on the HO scenes, and no glints on points of action.I played the other Myths of the World game (IIRC, Spirit Wolf)  in this series on this same device and had no problem with it.I liked this game, but since the &#34;whodunit&#34; was known right from the start, I have no interest in replaying it to see if I can even get past the point where it glitched.

"Did a marathon read of Sweep In Peace, because once I started I couldn't put it aside. What a well-plotted story, with the plot and subplots alll twisting and turning on each other throughout the story, yet all meeting up at the same place in the end. It's not ""great literature"", just a really well-told story. A number of other authors in the urban fantasy field (we all know who they are) should use this book as a primer regarding pacing and character development. There were a lot of characters in this book, but each of them was nuanced just enough to let them remain distinctive in the reader's mind, and their behaviors made sense in the context of who they were and what cultures they represented. The author(s) took the time to shade the characters with gray, so they weren't merely stereotypes of typical ""alien"" races, and in doing so they also did a lot of great world-building for those cultures - something other authors can't achieve even with multiple books.I would recommend reading ""Clean Sweep"" first, because although this book can be read as a stand-alone, ""Clean Sweep"" first introduces some characters that appear in this book and begins a loose story arc that this book continues.Here's hoping there are many more books in this series. So far, I've never read a book by Ilona Andrews that I didn't enjoy, and there aren't all that many authors that I can say that about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IO9XDGFQH9VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WQUTTM#wasThisHelpful","R1IO9XDGFQH9VH","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've already had auto-open umbrellas, but this one has the extra feature of auto-close, so how could I resist?The umbrella comes with a mesh holding case, which shows that someone was thinking, because it's much easier for a closed umbrella to dry out that way.

Unfortunately, they haven't yet figured out a way to make the stem collapse down by itself, once it has been extended, but it's no problem to close it down and lock it back into placeThe opened umbrella is not as large as a golf umbrella, not is it as small as one of those Totes that you can fit into a a pocketbook easily.  To me, it is the perfect size.  It will shield me, my pocketbook and any items I might be carrying.  It is also a good two-person umbrella.

"When I first chose this book to review, I was initially put off by the title, because I thought that it was going to be a Hunger Games clone, and I am one of the few people in this world who apparently has no interest in the Hunger Games series.  Thankfully, it's not like it at all.  It is more of a space opera, more akin as another reviewer mentioned to Catherine Asaro's Skolian Empire in that the characters' backstories are just as interesting as the current plot (or subplot). The setting isn't static, and there's interesting world-building begun (this is obviously the beginning of a series) that can lead to a lot of off-shoot stories if the author handles them correctly.I found this to be one of those books that once you start reading, time passes without you really realizing it.  And I was surprised at that, because I was reading a paper book, when for the past couple of years most of my reading has been mainly ebooks and I wasn't quite sure if dead tree versions would still hold my interest as well, since I can't fiddle with the type size and fonts.I'll definitely be looking for the next book by this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RKZ61LNX5J9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783295244#wasThisHelpful","R1RKZ61LNX5J9D","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had a number of Swiffer products over the years but I think this is one of my favorites.  It's basically a cordless vacuum with a Swiffer dust pad on the bottom.  It contains a rechargeable battery so when you're done using it, you just plug it into an outlet to charge until its next use.  This isn't a powerful vacuum for picking up things on carpets, for example, but for hard surfaces it works very well.  My test kidlets make a mess every time I feed them so there's always crumbs and such on the kitchen floor.  This Swiffer makes it very easy to pick up their mess with very little effort.  The pads are easy to change (and can be reused if the floor isn't super dirty) and I had no problems emptying out the dust cup.  It's easy to operate, to move around, and isn't especially noisy.  I'd definitely recommend this product, especially for someone who has to do a lot of quick clean-ups, or for someone who's starting to have difficulty bending down to hold the dustpan when sweeping the floor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R304HEAEC4XJFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBP7CTW#wasThisHelpful","R304HEAEC4XJFT","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those toys that's just cool to have.  It's not some itsy-bitsy little dinosaur; it's a great big honking thing that no one is ever going to trip over by accident.  It wasn't hard to assemble, though I did need help slamming one piece in. It has lights and sound and motion and everything.  It's designed so that it's not simply a dinosaur moving forward on the floor; kids can use their imaginations and create scenarios for the characters that accompany the dinosaur and the various perches that exist on the creature itself. The majority of the actions that can be done with the creature are non-motorized, so if the batteries die, the dinosaur can still be played with while waiting for the battery replacement.  My test kidlet (now 7) has had a blast playing with this toy, and it's one of the ones that he still pulls out to play with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6L2PDFYAAY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKT84Y#wasThisHelpful","R2F6L2PDFYAAY8","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The test truck for this review was Dodge Ram 1500 Quad-Cab.The mats were well-made, and the set consists of two front mats and a single-piece back mat.  The back mat is designed so that it can be cut into two separate mats for a better fit.  In our instance, they had to be cut that way.  The mats are black with some gray inserts in the front mats.  Since these are somewhat universal mats, they are designed to be cut to fit the individual vehicle.  The mats can be cut easily with scissors but for fine trimming a razor is best.The front mats fit the 1500 well, with only minor trimming.  The mat gripped to the floor well under use - no slipping or sliding.  The back mat had to be cut into two separate mats for a better fit.  The back mats also required a lot of trimming to get them to fit properly under the back chair; they were a little too long.  So the front mats fit well, the rear mats not so well, but they are still very usable.While there are a lot of little channels and indents to hold water and snow and dirt, these mats are not the kind that are really going to hold a lot of liquid.  They aren't designed with large channels with high edges to really prevent spillover onto the carpet; the design seems to be geared for more everyday use.  It'll probably handle the wetness from a rainstorm okay but not for multiple days of melting snow, for example.Compared to the original equipment mats, these are not as thick.  You could perhaps call them ""heavy duty"" if all you do with your truck is general driving, similar to car driving.  But if you use your truck for work, where you are climbing in and out all the time, wearing heavy work boots and depositing a lot of dirt and grit on the mats, we're estimating that the mats will probably last a couple of years.  They aren't really ""heavy duty"" in the context of that type of use.  But for the average suburban truck owner they will probably last longer than a non-""heavy duty"" mat.All in all, you get value for the price you're paying, and if the mats fit your particular truck well then you are ahead of the game and can avoid the cost of custom mats.  These are good mats and the price is good for a full set.  Thought was put into the design to allow for higher wear by the gas pedal, and in the ways the mats could be trimmed to fit a particular truck model.  I'd recommend them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8W6GZJWKA9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLSG6V8#wasThisHelpful","R1D8W6GZJWKA9I","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, this rug feels so good under my feet!  If I had this wall-to-wall, I would sleep on it - lol.It's very plush, very thickly woven and has a nice rubberized underside which prevents it from slipping on my bathroom's tile floor.  The size (21x36) is perfect for alongside the tub.  The linen color of this particular rug looks like it will go with most neutral-toned bathrooms, or if you want to add a neutral tone to a bolder-colored room.  I have odd-colored porcelain fixtures in my bathroom, so the linen tone doesn't quite go with the sort of pinkish/mauve-ish pale color (I call the color ""fleh"") they are.  That's the only thing that's giving me pause on whether or not I should buy the contour and a smaller rug to make a complete set - even though they are rather high-priced.  But I've found with bathroom rugs that you get what you pay for, so if this rug can stand up to wear and tear, and multiple washings, then it is worth its price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWE1MO2E6IZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMXNJPI#wasThisHelpful","R1EWE1MO2E6IZE","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this product to review because while I don't thankfully have a problem with dandruff, every now and then I do get an itchy scalp and I've found in the past that using Head & Shoulders usually solves that problem, so I figured having a container of it around would be useful.This size container (14.2oz) provides a substantial amount of shampoo, so I expect it to last.  The shampoo itself is white and creamy, not too thick, not too thin.  It has a nice fresh scent that isn't overpowering.  My one minor quibble is with the design of the lid: the opening hole for the shampoo to squirt out from should have a little more of a lip around it so that when pressure on the sides of the bottle is released the remaining shampoo is sucked back into the container; that would result in less smearing of the shampoo on the container's surface.The shampoo itself suds nicely and rinses out cleanly.  I have thick hair to begin with so I was initially a little apprehensive that this would really bush it out, but my hair remained manageable which was good.  What I was also surprised at was how my hair retained its own wavy style after a night's sleep.  Usually when I wake up, my hair looks like it belongs to one of the Kazon Nistrim from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (look up the image) - very scary.  But after using the H&S shampoo, I can just brush it out and it looks fine, which is a very strange but welcome experience for me.  The kidlets were playing hair salon with me as their customer and they complimented me on how soft my hair was.So I am very positive about this shampoo and would recommend it even if you don't have a dandruff problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIUO10JB37KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FIZGLOG#wasThisHelpful","RLIUO10JB37KC","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For those who don't know Jon Gnagy, he started the learn-to-draw how-to shows on TV.  Back in the day, I always watched his show in fascination - how he would take simple lines and create a beautiful scene.  I had his Learn-To-Draw set as a kid and it helped teach me how to draw, understanding and using shading and perspective.  It was one of my favorite creative toys for years, and I learned so much from it.  I was adding depth and movement to my drawings way beyond what my schoolmates were doing, because of it.  One of the kidlets in my family (a 9 year old) is very artistic so I gave this to her as a birthday gift and she really appreciates it.The contents of the set are almost exactly the same as the one that I had as a child, from the artist's drawing and carbon pencils to black chalk to the smudge sticks/smudge pad to the pliable white eraser to the pencil sharpener.  Since it is the ""Master Set"" it also includes colored pastels, two trays of water color paints, and two paint brushes. Large sheets of white paper are included.Of course, the gem of the product - and the thing alone worth getting it for is the ""Learn To Draw"" booklet which, I'm happy to say, is exactly the same one I remembered.  What a walk down memory lane that was, to see those lessons on how to draw a still life with that large pumpkin, and the one about drawing the harlequin Great Dane.  I was reading over the instructions on how to create depth and perspective and they are just as clear now as they were then, and after having quite a few art classes in life, I realize how much I learned from that book.  There are also booklets on learning to draw the human figure (no genitalia shown) and a color booklet on drawing landscapes.  There are fold-out instruction on drawing with pastels and painting with watercolors.The only lack in this set is that there is no separate drawing board.  I suppose the sturdy cardboard storage section of the box could be used for that, but I missed the one that came with the set that I had as a kid.  That thing lasted forever, way beyond the time that the art supplies had all been used up.  It looks like a different Jon Gnagy set still contains a drawing board though: Jon Gnagy Original Learn to Draw SetIf you've got a kid in your family who loves to draw, I would recommend getting either this set or the one mentioned above.  The key is the learning to DRAW aspect, because once you learn the lines, perspective, vanishing point and shading of simple drawing, it is very easy to apply those things to other mediums like watercolors and oil paints.(P.S. If you're interested in seeing Jon Gnagy in action, there's videos of him up on the 'Tubes.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V3IWO8763UJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M5BBZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1V3IWO8763UJ6","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're like me, you've been addicted to PEZ since you were a little kid.  The PEZ dispensers are all well and good, but it's the candy I crave and I eat it so fast that it wasn't even worth the effort to put it into the dispenser in the first place - lol.I've been getting my fix by buying those 6-stick refill packs that are in candy aisle in stores, but they get home and they're immediately gone.  Now, this 2lb. bag of PEZ is like having a security blanket of PEZ; I know that they aren't going to disappear at one sitting.I have Amazon Prime so I got delivery of my order fast.  What's weird was that I actually got a Sunday delivery, even though the means of shipment was shown as the USPS.  I'm not complaining, though.There seems to be a relatively even mix of all the single fruit flavors in the package - cherry, raspberry, strawberry, grape, orange and lemon.  There are none of the two-fruit combos, no chocolate, no cola, and no ""Sourz"".  The candy is fresh; you will not crack your teeth on the tabs if you crunch them.  The candy is delivered in a sealed plastic bag in a box that would work nicely as a gift box.An interesting fact about why it is named PEZ: the letters are taken from the German word for peppermint, ""pfefferminz"" - the ""P"" from the first letter, the ""E"" from the middle letter, and the ""Z"" from the last letter.  It was created originally as a breath mint in 1927 in Austria.  If you used to have one of the original-style dispensers like I did with the plain flip top (no cartoon characters back then), the reason why it was designed that way was so that it would mimic a cigarette lighter, to encourage people to take a PEZ instead of lighting up a cigarette.The price is good, the candy is fresh, and the delivery is fast.

"I used to take the nephews on day-trips through New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland when they were young, and a lot of the routes mentioned in this guide were ones that we pretty closely followed.  I've also visited some of the Pennsylvania sights mentioned, so I have practical experience of the recommendations and they are sound and worth making the effort to see.I liked the way the book is designed.  There are a lot of full-color pictures, clear maps, sightseeing detours, and historical and cultural informative tidbits about the various areas.  There are some lodgings and restaurants listed, but the main focus is on the various area sights to be seen.My only quibble was that I thought that they short-changed New Jersey a bit in the listing of places to see, a number of interesting Revolutionary era sites weren't mentioned. And they also omitted NASA's Wallops Island Visitor Center from the Delmarva trip route.  It's a neat little space museum near Chincoteague which is nice for a quick stop, and if you're lucky you might actually see a rocket launch.For me, this is a great book to pick up, thumb through and pick somewhere to take a ride to see.  Sometimes unless you have a book like this one at hand, you don't even realize all the interesting places that are within a day's drive.  The trips themselves are designed to last two to five days if you're going to follow their planned route, so they are perfect for a long getaway weekend. or a short vacation without expensive travel costs.  Sometime all you need is just a few days away from the usual hustle and bustle of normal life; it gives you a chance to recharge your mental batteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TMAZVQ7L9TJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1741798140#wasThisHelpful","R1TMAZVQ7L9TJ7","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this product to review for Vine because, frankly, I wanted to try one of these men's razor to shave my legs.  Guys always have these razors that look like they were designed in some tech whiz's lab, while we women get the small-headed, rigid pink razors.  So boring and so easy to nick oneself with them if one doesn't have model-thin legs.  If you've got a lot of leg acreage like me, using one of those little pink things takes forever.  Hence my choice to give this a try.I really liked it.  I liked the movement of the razor head along the curves of my legs, it did a good job without nicks and left smooth skin behind.  It was easy to hold and use.

She said that she would buy this Cutter product for herself to use at work; that's how well it worked for her.

"This was my first experience with an infuser pitcher.  I've been trying to cut the soda habit recently and have been drinking more water and lemonade, so this is the perfect item to give the water more flavor (and probably get more Vitamin C into me, too).  I like this pitcher because it is large enough (3qt) to hold enough liquid to make it worthwhile using, yet it will fit on my refrigerator door.  I like the fact that it is dishwasher safe and BPA-free - and that the manufacturer put that info right on the label (a previous product I reviewed from Amazon didn't even have the country of manufacture listed on the product).I didn't have much of a problem figuring out how to open it, because I saw that button on the handle that opens up the center section, but I would suggest to the manufacturer that perhaps a secondary label on the device showing precisely how to open it would be helpful (having the instructions inside were somewhat redundant).  The lid twist-seals nice and tight.  It comes with an insert that contains a few recipes to get the user started.  The infuser takes up the full length of the pitcher, so you can put in as little or as much fruit as you like.  You can also remove the infuser and just use it as a regular pitcher.  The plastic seems sturdy and well-designed, and it didn't have any odd plastic smell.I like this product and I think that I'll be getting a lot of use out of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12BPJ1573LA7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYRP3WC#wasThisHelpful","R12BPJ1573LA7M","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been reading this series since its start.  It's one of my favorites, to the point where I tend to give the entire series a re-read before a new book comes out (and I also have all of the audiobook versions, too), so reading this book was a bittersweet experience for me since it is the official end of The Walker Papers where Joanne Walker is the primary character.The series is about Joanne Walker, born Siobhan Grainne McNamarra Walkingstick, the daughter of an Irish woman and a Cherokee man, born in Ireland but given to her father to raise at the age of six months.  We meet her for the first time in the book ""Urban Shaman"", living in Seattle and working as a police mechanic there.  She's a woman with some serious issues regarding her parents and her life.  Our introduction to her coincides with the apparent awakening of her shamanic nature while on an airplane returning from her mother's funeral in Ireland, and the series takes off from there.  She starts off as a very reluctant shaman, and only takes on the mantle because the alternative is death. This is an urban fantasy series involving the Celtic and Native American mythic pantheons and various other aspects of the paranormal and magical world.  It is set mainly in the Seattle Washington area, though there are forays to Ireland and North Carolina in later books.  One thing I've always liked about this series is the wry sense of humor that underlines it.  Horrific things happen to people along the way but it's leavened by the camaraderie between Joanne, her co-workers, and her friends.For those of you who may not have ever read this series, the author provides a concise  summary of the action in each of the previous books in the story arc so far, so if you are coming into it cold, you're brought up to speed story-wise.  But I would sincerely recommend that you begin with the first book in the series, ""Urban Shaman"", first rather than this one - not because you won't enjoy it - but just to prolong the pleasure of the series and to really enjoy each character's personality to the fullest, not to mention their interactions. You may learn in this book that Morrison is Joanne's main squeeze, but unless you've followed the course of their unusually convoluted relationship over the course of the series, you won't really appreciate how much she has evolved to reach the point she's at in this book in relation to him.  Cernunnos isn't merely the Celtic god of the Wild Hunt; he's been an integral part of the series from its start and his presence has forced Joanne to confront who and what she is, not to mention what she will be.Just a note for those who have been reading the series from the start.  I would highly recommend reading Ms. Murphy's book, ""No Dominion"", which contains parts of the story from Gary Muldoon's point of view, and recounts what happened with him and the Wild Hunt while in Ireland, and his life with his wife Annie.  It really adds another layer to the understanding of the background to this current book.For those who have been faithful readers of the series, I think you will enjoy this book; I know that I did.  While I was sad that the series has ended, Ms. Murphy ended it well.  Think of the end of a play when all the cast comes out for a bow; that's what happens in this book with various characters from all the books having either cameo appearances or mentions so we can touch base with them one last time.  It was good to be reminded of all of them and they were incorporated well into the storyline of this book so that their inclusion made sense.With the previous book in this series, ""Mountain Echoes"", we were left with a cliffhanger.  Joanne gets a call from her septuagenarian sidekick Gary that is wife - who died about four years ago - is alive.  This book kicks off from there, and leads to the final showdown between Joanne and the being known as The Master, whom she's been in conflict with since she came into her shamanic powers.  We've known that this confrontation has been inevitable, because it's been the underlying source of a lot of the conflicts that Joanne has faced, that it was the cause of her mother's death, and that it was basically the reason why Joanne was born as a new soul.Sometimes when there's an upcoming fight with ""the big bad"" in a series, the actual face-to-face conflict becomes anticlimactic and is given short shrift by the author because it's clear that the author his-or-herself has become bored with the whole storyline.  Not so with this book.  The entire book is basically the final confrontation between Joanne and The Master, with its ebb and flow highlighting the various other characters of the series.  You can tell that Ms. Murphy had a definite idea how this story arc should end, and it's a good one.I don't want to give away real spoilers but I confess I was slightly reluctant to start this book because I didn't want the series to end, and I was afraid of what might happen, because I've been burned before with the directions that certain authors have taken their characters. But having finished the book, I'm happy with it because Ms. Murphy ended it well, and in a way that was true to the characters.  Not everyone makes it through unscathed nor does everyone makes it through, period; how could they with such a cataclysmic confrontation basically between good and evil?  Seattle once again pays a  physical and emotional price for being Joanne's home.  So while I am sad over some of the things that happened, I am happy, too, over other things.  This isn't one of those books that you will throw against a wall when you're done because you're so upset over the events, or that you'll refuse to re-read (if you're like me who enjoys re-reading favorite series).  Everything that happens does so for a purpose, not on a whim, and I as a reader and a fan can accept that, and can celebrate where the conclusion leaves us.So get this book, read this book, and enjoy this book.  And let's all hope that someday in the future Ms. Murphy decides to revisit this particular universe of hers and gives us more stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UN1K0ECSGJDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778316912#wasThisHelpful","R1UN1K0ECSGJDC","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The six-year old kidlet got this as a birthday gift, and decided that this was going to be the craft project for the day and I was going to be the one to help him with it.The reason why I decided to write this review is because I was really impressed on how well Crayola thought out the design and manufacture of this product.  It is probably the most well-designed and sturdy one that I have come across.  The case that will hold all the supplies, first of all, comes fully assembled - so that's one less step for the adults. Someone really put some thought into it because it contains a tray to store the instructions and labels and color chart, a tray to hold the measuring containers (and designed so you can temporarily lock them in place to avoid spills, while containing any that might occur), the clear side lids flip open to form upright holders for the markers while the color is being absorbed into the tip, while the interior of the container is divided into segments to hold the dye bottles and unused marker pieces securely.  Everything locks into place by means of a handle that also doubles as the device you use to snap the competed marker together tightly.  And, they included two cardboard boxes that you fold together to store the created markers; the boxes are designed so that they can be colored in themselves. And a set of tweezers to hold the markers. Oh, and there are also labels included so you can write down the names of the colors you created and affix them to the markers.  Importantly of all, the instructions are clear - with pictures.There is enough dye and marker pieces to create 16 markers in the set.  There is a color chart coordinated with the measuring cups that allows you to create a wide range of specific colors.  My little guy had great fun making the colors shown, and then he decided that he was going to mix his own colors so we also managed to get black, brown, olive green and army green.  As a result of this project, he understood color creation better, not to mention the various ways to add numbers to reach the number 15 - since each color on the chart was created by adding two different color amounts so that the sum would total to the number 15 mark on the measuring cup.I can't stress how much he loved this toy.  We made all sixteen markers at one sitting, though I'd imagine that most kids would make the project last a bit longer.  There was still some dye left over and a few extra pieces.  I see that Crayola offers refill packages and I'm definitely going to get some.  What also impressed me about this product was how tidy it was.  The kids and I have done projects with dyes in the past, so the little guy automatically went looking for some plastic gloves and I cut out a plastic trash bag for him to use as a smock - but they were totally unnecessary.  The kid played with color dyes and stayed clean!  I stayed clean!  It was unprecedented in our experience.  The dyes also rinsed off easily from the measuring cups and from the tray they were in, just under running water.This was truly one of the best-designed and fun projects we've ever worked on and I can't recommend it highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22BUJECXB7MO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI6J8KW#wasThisHelpful","R22BUJECXB7MO0","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a handy little guide to carry around in your pocketbook, backpack or pocket if it's your first or second trip to San Francisco.  It's designed to be a pocket guide, and that's exactly what it is. It's slightly wider than a paperback with a cover and pages that are sturdy.  It contains 224 pages and has a map of San Francisco's neighborhoods (as Lonely Planet defines them) on the inner cover, and a city map of San Francisco attached to the inner back cover that you can fold out.The neighborhoods are broken out into: Golden Gate Park & the Avenues, Golden Gate Bridge & the Marina, the Haight and NoPa, Fisherman's Wharf & the Piers, North Beach & Chinatown, Hayes Valley & Civic Center, Downtown & SoMa, and the Mission.  Each neighborhood had segments entitled ""Explore"", ""The Sights in a Day"", ""Best of San Francisco"", ""Getting There"", ""Top Sites"", ""Don't Miss"", ""Sights"", ""Eating"", ""Drinking"", ""Entertainment"", ""Shopping"" and includes a map of the area.Like all Lonely Planet travel guides it also includes a chapter called ""Survival Guide"" which give brief information regarding where to stay, transportation information, emergency services, and other information essential to travelers.This is not the travel guide you want if you are trying to choose a lodging, because that's not the focus of this book.  This is something easy to carry around, so that when you're traveling around the city, you can always find something to see or do, find a place to eat or stop for a drink, and you won't miss out on any of the must-see's of the city.  The book is filled with full-color pictures and maps, with colored break-out boxes with tips and hints and historical facts.  Stand-out dishes in the restaurants are mentioned.  Each recommended site or location gets a small paragraph of information.I found this to be a very interesting and useful book.  My only quibble with it is that the font size is just a little too small for these aging eyes; for me I was doing the glasses-on/glasses-off thing with my bifocals.  But I would imagine that most people wouldn't have a problem with it at all, and of course, the smaller font allows for more information to be packed into the book.I enjoyed it and would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T40KFFD0EQFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742208754#wasThisHelpful","R3T40KFFD0EQFA","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Dead Will Tell"" is the sixth book in the Kate Burkholder series.  When an author hits a fifth or sixth book in a series, that's usually the point where the reader can tell if the storyline has started to stagnate and the books become formulaic.  I am happy to report that this series is still going strong.  I have been following the trials and tribulations of Kate Burkholder in her job as Painters Mills Chief of Police from the first book, and it amazes me how Ms. Castillo manages to keep the characters fresh, the murders gruesome, and the people of Painters Mills from fleeing en masse.I like the tension that Ms. Castillo has created by having Chief Burkholder being a former member of the same Amish community that she now has police jurisdiction over, having her now be on the ""English"" side but still with the sensibilities of her Amish heritage.  The Amish are a hot topic on reality TV, but I think that this series gives a better, non-sensationalized portrayal of the community and showcases the commonality of humanity. As with each of her previous books, the crime that drives the story is horrific - there are no ""clean"" murders in this series - and Kate has to reconcile her public and private lives in order to get to the bottom of it.  Her love interest, John Tomasetti, is a man with ghosts of his own and his subplot interweaves with Kate's and with that of the murders.  There is an element of romance in the series as their relationship has developed, but it doesn't overwhelm the mystery aspect.I've always found the locations in this series to be very easy to visualize; the characters never act in a vacuum to me.  I always seem to get a good sense of place and season, even though I've never been to the Amish areas of Ohio.  This is just a very good series and this book is a fine addition to it.  I'm looking forward to the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZCSYOEHFOZLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250029570#wasThisHelpful","RZCSYOEHFOZLC","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one of those devices that I always think of getting whenever I see one being used, but have never gotten around to actually getting for myself.  I happen to like to marinate chicken so I was happy to give this product a try.I found this OXO meat tenderizer very easy to use.  On the top, the lock/unlock slider was clear to see.  The product was easy to use and it was easy to see where it had been used on the meat and where it was still needed.  I didn't have any problem applying the pressure needed to piece the meat.  The blades were sharp.  The design of the product precludes any inadvertent self-injury.  The two buttons on the side of the top portion are pressed simultaneously to take apart the tenderizer for washing, and it is top-rack dishwasher-safe.  It seems to be made well.This tenderizer resulted in the marinade penetrating the meat much faster, meaning less waiting time before cooking.  The food was, I thought, more flavorful than marinating it the old way.I would recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9X0468VLOVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEZ8A1U#wasThisHelpful","RC9X0468VLOVN","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Mr. Clean throughout my life to clean floors, so I was interested to see what they came up with as a new cleaning product.Mr. Clean Liquid Muscle is a liquid gel concentrate product.  The gel is not one of the thick, gloppy ones; it's more like a thicker dishwashing liquid-type.  It is bright yellow and has a pleasant lemon scent.  It has a flip top that allows you to use it as you need it - a few drops on a sponge or a squirt into a pail of water.  The squirt is a pre-measured amount, so it's easy to make sure that you're using the proper amount - as opposed to just pouring it out of a bottle the way you do with regular Mr. Clean.  If you're using it in water, there's no need to rinse afterwards; the instructions do advise rinsing if you are using the product straight from the bottle.I thought that it did a great job of cleaning both ceramic and vinyl tile.  It was easy to remove stuck-on dirt, greasiness and stickiness.

"Although these cups are nicely packaged to give as a gift, there is absolutely no information on the box, in the package or on the cups themselves stating where they were made, if they are lead-free, and whether or not they are microwave/dishwasher safe.  The Amazon blub states that they were made in China, are FDA-certified lead-free, and are microwave/dishwasher safe, but the product itself makes no claims as to that.  The cups do not even have a manufacturer's name stamp on the bottom. Because of that, I would be loathe to give these as a gift to anyone because I have no way of verifying their safety.The six stoneware cups are a nice size for a hot beverage and are pleasant to look at.  The colors are bright and coat the cups evenly.  They seem to be nicely made, and hold a good-sized beverage portion.  I have larger hands and could only fit three fingers through the cup handle, which was a little awkward for me, but wouldn't be so for someone with a smaller hand.  The cups were well-packaged and arrived with no damage.Given the multiple problems with lead paint in items made in China (assuming these actually were made in China), and given that the packaging doesn't even any make any claims of safe manufacture, I wouldn't recommend them.  There are plenty other manufacturers who are proud to list their company name on their product and to provide information as to place of manufacture and correct care.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFUBYO51J6N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCYS232#wasThisHelpful","R3UFUBYO51J6N4","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never really tried any cheddar popcorn before, but since I like cheddar cheese and am a lifelong consumer of Cheez Doodles/Cheetos I figured that I'd give these a try.  I picked up a box of unbuttered microwave popcorn (my preferred method of popping corn), popped it up and sprinkled this white cheddar seasoning on it.It gave the popcorn a rather salty, cheddar flavor that was pleasant.  You control the degree of flavor by the amount of the product that you sprinkle on it, and can always sprinkle more as you empty out the popcorn.  Since it's white cheddar, there's no orange cheese dust left on your fingers, which is nice.  It comes in a container with a snap lid over a perforated cover, so it's easy to control the amount you put on your popcorn.All in all, I found it to be a tasty product, and a nice change of pace from regular buttered popcorn.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HKN5HZ8VPSDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H72831M#wasThisHelpful","R3HKN5HZ8VPSDW","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've played with K'nex construction sets in the past with the kidlets - most recently put together a suspension bridge and they are fun.  However, in this particular incarnation, K'nex is trying to be like Legos, and they failed miserably.Apparently the K'nex people didn't realize that the same people who buy Legos would be attracted to this product due to its similarities and didn't pay attention to how clearly the Lego instructions are laid out.  With the K'nex instructions (all graphics, no words) it wasn't clear if you were supposed to use two of one item or if the arrow between the items meant that you were moving the piece in that direction.  It wasn't clear if you were using two really tiny pieces or one tiny piece in certain sections.  I am the family instruction reader so I know good instructions from bad, and these could have been much clearer graphically.One of the main problems, though, was that the blocks didn't lock together very tightly in instances when they had to overlap rather than be exactly on top of one another, and the design didn't allow for reinforcement of those weak spots, as the Lego constructs are designed to do.  We never actually got the car fully put together because it would break in half before we could put the top section on; after five attempts we just gave up on it.I would reiterate the manufacturer's warning about a choking hazard.  There are a lot of very small pieces in this kit that would be dangerous to small children.  And some of those pieces were very tiny and easy to drop.  It didn't seem as though the package contained any extra pieces to possibly compensate for those that might drop and disappear in carpets.I have to agree with the other reviewers that it was amusing that the there were instructions for assembling the Peter character, when he came fully assembled, and that in order to place him within the car you have to remove the lower half of his body.  I don't watch the TV show ""Family Guy"" so I can't comment on whether a toy based on that program is age-appropriate; to me it was just a K'nex toy that I thought the kidlets might like.So, in summary, don't waste your money.  While the plastic pieces appear to be well-made, the same care wasn't taken in the creation of the instructions or the interlocking design for the car.  If you can't actually make it stay together, it's rather useless and becomes just an exercise in frustration.  As the kidlets told me to tell you folks, ""this one gets a bad review"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGG92SOSC4H2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXM6HVK#wasThisHelpful","RGG92SOSC4H2E","A19JGPUJAX048H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JGPUJAX048H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you want to stack the deck in your favor, purchase these supplemental disks along with the primary Litter Kwitter kit and just plan on using them.  By all rights, the company should have included these with the primary kit if it really wanted to increase the odds of training success.Might your cat be able to transition stress free through the disks that come with the primary kit?  Sure.  He also might experience anxiety from the huge increase in hole size that interferes with training and causes unneeded frustration for the owner.  My thought was, why take the chance if it's not necessary?  The less stress and anxiety he experiences, the more likely that training will go smoothly.  Small, smooth changes are best.  I would have used even more transition trays if they were available.My wife and I used the extra trays to train our two 14+ year old rescue furballs.  Start to finish, training took about 4 months.  We've been completely litter free for 10 months.

"My wife and I used the system to train our 2 adult cats (14+ year old rescues) and we have been litter box free for 10 months.  Using the additional techniques below, we went from start to finish in about 4 months.Why did I choose Litter Kwitter?  When it comes down to it, any system or method on the market today is designed to condition a cat to relieve itself in the toilet.  Whether you're making the contraption yourself with a book like How to Toilet-Train Your Cat: 21 Days to a Litter-Free Home, or purchasing a commercial kit, the bulk of the effort comes down to commitment and training.  I think the Litter Kwitter system is the sturdiest, most versatile system on the market to get the process started.Before you even think about starting, I highly recommend you purchase the Litter Kwitter MultiKatKit even if you only have 1 cat.  (-1 star for not including this in the primary kit.)  This process is about conditioning the animal and slowly introducing him to a new behavior.  Having multiple steps eases the transition and stacks the odds in your favor.  One of the advantages of the Litter Kwitter tray system is that you can move back and forth between stages if you encounter transition problems; however, I didn't move to a new stage unless I was pretty much positive that the cats were comfortable with the existing stage.I also recommend you visit the forums at litterkwitter dotcom.  It's chocked full of ideas for attaining success, such as putting tinfoil on the floor to discourage accidents or putting friction tape on the toilet seat to reduce slipping.  The training process requires active participation and yes, there will be accidents that you'll have to clean up.  It's messy, and we found ourselves cleaning the tray, the plastic adapter, and the toilet daily.  If you expect a perfectly clean, hands-off process, I think you'll be very disappointed in the results.In addition to following the general instructions, here are some things we did to ensure success:1.  Night Light.  We noticed that a lot of the initial pee aiming problems were happening at night and I realized there was absolutely no ambient light whatsoever in the spare bathroom.  Yet I was expecting our felines to jump up onto a small platform, position themselves, and hit a small pan in pitch black conditions.  Our motion-sensing night light wouldn't always register cat movement, so we installed a bright, always-on LED night light and it reduced aiming mishaps by half during training.  We've kept the light in place and no longer have aiming mishaps.2.  Clicker Training.  To help get the cats used to correct positioning, I started clicker training with them (Big Button Clicker).  No need to buy a special book.  Just do an internet search for ""clicker training"" and you'll be able to get all the info you need.  After 10 days and about 5 minutes per day with each cat, they would both squat on cue in the proper location and proper position in order to receive a treat.  Whereas leaving them to their own accord might only put them in contact with the toilet seat for a couple minutes per day, clicker training put them on the toilet seat for much longer.  It helped condition them to enjoy the toilet seat and helped them learn balance.  By being present while they were on the toilet seat, we were also able to ""rescue"" them a few times when they slipped and almost ended up in the drink...an act that could have caused enough anxiety to turn them off from further training.  Additionally, I immediately performed clicker training with them the moment I moved to another stage.  That served two purposes:  It distracted them from the change in tray size during the crucial first moments; and, it helped them associate good things with a new stage.  Repetition, repetition, repetition.3.  Irresistible Treats.  My cats are finicky, but there's one thing they go nuts for--fresh tuna.  Rather than buying expensive, processed treats--which they didn't respond to during clicker training--I used canned tuna in water.  Plus, we feed our cats on a schedule rather then letting them constantly graze, so I did my training when they were hungry.  I put a little bit of mushed tuna in the center of my palm.  When a cat moved into the correct position, I'd click and then open my hand and cup it around his face.  Not only did it help keep him in the proper position (lift the face up and the butt goes down) but by turning my palm into a little bowl, it was easy for him to lick/eat the tuna without it flying all over the place.  Very effective.4.  Make the Toilet a Pleasurable Place.  I must admit, I have historically incorporated negative consequence training into litter training.  I decided to try just the opposite this time.  I ignored accidents and did everything I could to make the toilet seat a pleasurable place for the cats to be.  I'd regularly carry them into the bathroom, set them down on the toilet seat, and then pet and praise them.  To this day, whenever we hear a cat pooping or peeing, we say ""Good boy, {name}!"" or ""Good girl, {name}!""  I am honestly surprised by its effectiveness and the additional attention I seemed to get from them.5.  Step Stool.  We bought a cheap plastic step stool (easy to clean) and put it in front of the toilet. It helps the cats get up on the toilet more slowly without their fearing that a misjudged jump from the floor may land them in a toilet bowl full of water.6.  Paper Towel Trick.  As we progressed to larger openings, the cats seemed to be spooked either by the water or by getting wet from their poop and pee splashing in the water.  We floated a paper towel on the surface of the water and then sprinkled a little bit of litter on the paper towel.  Seemed to do the trick until they got completely comfortable with the water.7.  Cleanliness.  The trays hold much less litter than a litter box, and part of the training process is to continually reduce the amount of litter used.  The contraption, therefore, must be kept soap-and-water clean lest the felines seek out a clean place elsewhere to do their business.  With two cats, we thoroughly cleaned everything every time there was significant unabsorbed pee in, on, or around the tray.  We discovered that our cats did their darndest--despite the shrinking tray--to pee in the tray or in the litter.  When we moved to the ""white stage"" (adapter only with a little bit of litter around the tiny rim that holds the tray), they'd even try their darndest to pee on the litter there.  It wasn't until we completely removed the adapter that they started peeing more in the center of the toilet seat.  So, make sure you check around and under the adapter, too, in case pee has migrated to hidden places.8.  Enzymatic Cleaner. The stuff is miraculous. We've used OUT! Enzymatic Cleaner for years. Its smell is more fragrant and not as harsh as some other enzymatic cleaners we've used. It makes problems disappear and helped salve some of the frustration of the training process.  An enzymatic cleaner is also a good way to completely remove smells so that cats are discouraged from revisiting a spot where they aren't supposed to be relieving themselves.I believe the single most important factor in our quick success was the clicker training.  Even 10 months later, I still occasionally do clicker training with them on the toilet seat.  I wish I had done this 14 years ago, and I'll certainly be doing it with all future felines.  The quickest success, I think, comes from patience and from having a heart for understanding animal training/conditioning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R6UL5I8WHN8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014N70QO#wasThisHelpful","R3R6UL5I8WHN8V","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The elastic straps aren't strong enough to hold it up onto the armrest, so the cover works its way down over time, which means material ends up covering the lid release button.- Like all neoprene-like material I've seen, human hair and pet hear will thread its way into the fabric, making for more difficult removal.- The material has stretched a bit with time, which will require occasional retightening.I give the seat covers an A and the armrest cover a C.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11K2PMLA7T6BP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BXB5GG#wasThisHelpful","R11K2PMLA7T6BP","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this feeder to replace a Duncraft triple tube feeder.  After several years of faithful service (and a few falls), the Duncraft polycarbonate tubes were starting to show their age.  I decided to purchase an all-metal feeder in the hopes it wouldn't show age so quickly.  This Stokes feeder fits the bill.Pros:- No issues with bird entrapment.  I've had thousands and thousand of birds visit the feeder in the last year, ranging from goldfinches to flickers, and have never observed any kind of entrapment.  I checked the inside of each feeding port and didn't detect anything sharp or catchy.  The ports appear to be the same size as on all my other feeders.- All metal with a robust finish.  Should last years in any weather.- HUGE capacity.  Easily holds twice as much as my Duncraft triple tube feeder.  I estimate it holds about 10 scoops from my Heath Feed Scoop.- No, it's not squirrel proof, but squirrels won't be able to chew on and damage the metal.- Great drainage and drying.  In Nebraska weather, I've never had a problem with black oil sunflower seeds drying out and being consumed before they spoil.  The tray is the only thing that gets a little goopy because of all the seed waste.Cons:-  The screw-on top ring is secure, but I've had at least one instance on a different Stokes feeder (Stokes Select 38069 Squirrel Proof Double Suet Feeder) where a raccoon was able unscrew the feeder (which was hanging from a solid hook) from the top ring and drop the entire feeder to the ground.  Consider hanging this feeder from a swivel or a rope so that larger animals can't use resistance to unscrew it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SL72E2Y8I0OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M7P3N4#wasThisHelpful","R3SL72E2Y8I0OS","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pioneers suffers from the same fatal production flaw as many other reality shows on TV today:  It tries too hard to be overly dramatic.  Nonstop high tempo background music overlays most of the scenes and crescendos at ""dun da dun!"" scenes that really aren't that big of a deal.  The participants seem to spend most of their time focusing on conflict, problems, and the negative.  It's more of a performance for the camera than it is a documentary.

"I watched the first 7 episodes of the show.  It started out nicely:  Great scenery, interesting, diverse characters taking care of everyday things.  Unfortunately, the scripted drama started to take over around episode 7 and I lost interest.  The show quickly started revolving around an F-bomb laced conflict between the town's bar owner and the rest of the community as the bar owner attempted to install a more stable power system in town.  Other dramatized conflicts, such as the one resident's farm animals getting loose, start to pop up.  The producers take normal daily events (like the sighting of a bear) and try to turn every one of them into dramatic life-or-death events.  You can tell that the characters are putting on a show for the camera.  And cue the dramatic music.I may try again if the producers tone down the fakery and the residents stop acting for the camera.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4E0SHJXMEHL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVBK9LE#wasThisHelpful","R4E0SHJXMEHL7","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are generally two genres of Great North reality shows today:  Programs that lean more toward the documentary side and programs that lean more toward the scripted drama side.  Dr. Oakley, Yukon Vet definitely falls into the documentary side and therein lies its strength and interest.  After one is tired of the overly scripted drama in other reality shows, it's nice to watch what appears--at least on camera--to be the normal life and normal responses of a normal person.  Dr. Oakley is a professional with a heart and that clearly comes through on camera.  She's calm, cool, and collected.  It's enjoyable and educational to watch her interact with Alaska's and Canada's domestic and wild animals.  Her presence on camera seems natural and I don't see any of the telltale signs that she is putting on an act.Another strength is that the show truly is family friendly.  Whereas most Alaska reality shows today are full of bleeped out cussing, this program has no bleeped out language in most episodes, and only a few in the remaining episodes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RVWYF53KJTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1IX4JA#wasThisHelpful","R3RVWYF53KJTT","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched the first episode and quickly lost interest.  I love the concept...western culture, hunting, guiding, family life.  I hoped it would be an Idaho version of Alaska, The Last Frontier.  Unfortunately, the producers take a very ""scripted reality show drama"" type approach to the show.  The drama seemed manufactured and the on-camera interviews/segments with each person just seemed scripted rather than natural.  The ""competition"" between the families is the primary angle of the show, so you can imagine all the conflict that might be scripted in to build up that storyline.

"We, too, purchased this Danforth pewter lamp after watching the How It's Made episode.  The price through Amazon is significantly less expensive than purchasing through the Danforth website because of free shipping.  It's smaller than we thought it would be because size reference pictures were very difficult to find online prior to purchasing.  It's 1/2 to 1/3rd the size of an Aladdin Genie III lamp.Pros:- Contemporary styling.  The flame on top of a hollow, round wick is a sight to behold.- Beautifully manufactured.  The font is precisely finished to a satin sheen.  The burner is a highly polished silver.  The threads on the burner-to-font connection are clean and tight.  All parts fit together perfectly.- The round wick and center draft result in the same amount of light as 7 to 10 single-wick candles.  Its brightness is uncomfortable to look directly at when it's set to put out the maximum amount of light.- The chimney on mine is easy to remove and replace during lighting.  It's also quite secure.  (I know some have to adjust the metal tabs because they are too tight.)- Low, stable design.  Easy to carry around by the font once it's lit.- Holds a surprising amount of fuel.- Burns quite nicely and cleanly with my kerosene-based (non-paraffin) fuel.  Also burns well with Ultra-pure.Cons:- The wick adjustment knob doesn't have any real knurling on it, so it's a little difficult to get a purchase on it to raise and lower the wick.- The wick on our lamp was not trimmed properly before leaving the factory, so it burned very irregularly.  I had to trim it so that it was perfectly round and even at the top.- Ours arrived with a circumferential manufacturing scratch on the glass around the bulbous portion of the chimney. (Checking with customer service).  Edit:  Danforth sent us another chimney, no questions asked.- One fuels this lamp by unscrewing and removing the entire burner and pouring fuel into the font.  After the first fueling, subsequent fueling will be a little messy because the wick tail will drip fuel.We like it and plan to purchase additional ones in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TK4WJLJ85NVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LKIK7A#wasThisHelpful","R1TK4WJLJ85NVU","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Season 4 has the same enjoyable content as previous seasons.  It seems far less scripted with much less fake drama as compared to other Alaska reality shows.

F-bombs are more regular now and some of the cast are starting to test how vulgar/creative they can get with it.

"This review is for the 2-bay unit:  Model FD2002.  Disclaimer:  I actually bought my own dock.  ;-)Pros:- Supports 6TB drives.  Confirmed with Western Digital Red 3.5"" 6TB drives.  Note:  My retail box said ""Supports 4TB"".  (Old packaging??)- Lightweight but hearty plastic.  Has rubber feet but moves around easily without the weight of hard drives in it.- Can access both drives simultaneously while doing normal file operations like reading, writing, etc.- Crystal Disk Mark shows 197MB/s sequential write speeds over USB3.0 to a Western Digital Red 3.5"" 6TB drive spinning at 5700 rpm.  USB diagnostics indicate that it is indeed connecting at SuperSpeed.- No issues connecting at USB2.0 speeds on my old laptop.- Auto-installed all drivers in Windows 7 Home Premium x64.- Comes with a clear plastic form-fitting cover to keep out dust.  The plastic is the same as the thick plastic used in retail packaging these days...the stuff that requires scissors to get into the package.- Comes with one USB3.0 data cable.Cons:- You might experience conflicts trying to perform simultaneous operations that require locking a disk.  I experienced lockups that necessitated powering down the dock if I attempted to run Checkdisk or Western Digital Data Lifeguard Diagnostics on both disks simultaneously.- It's been a little glitchy a couple times when I inserted two drives simultaneously, as if it had difficulty recognizing both hard drives if they were spinning up simultaneously.  I've had the best luck in those situations by turning off the dock with the power button, inserting the drives, and turning the dock back on.  Or, inserting one drive, letting it be fully recognized in Win7, then inserting the second drive.- Standard 9mm 2.5"" or thinner hard drives are easy to flex back and forth once they're installed.  There's a slight gap between the drives and the dock plastic, so the drives don't have a lot of lateral support.  Be careful that you don't put undue stress on the drive connections after installation.I'm quite pleased with quality and performance thus far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217TNCJ09KUEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1KXE9K#wasThisHelpful","R217TNCJ09KUEN","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I upgraded my Lenovo Y530 laptop with this Samsung SSD. While some Y530 owners have had problems getting their SSDs to work in AHCI mode, I had no problem with the 850 Pro. My BIOS is AMI EFI BIOS version 10CN38WW (220) which is the original BIOS that came with the laptop when I purchased it in 2009. The SATA interface was already set to AHCI with the original hard drive.Installation was easy and no additional hard drive spacer or adapter was necessary for it to fit properly in the hard drive caddy: The existing mounting holes and screws lined up perfectly. A fresh install of Windows 7 Home Premium x64 from CD went flawlessly and I did not have to load any additional SATA drivers. Using Crystal Disk Mark, I get around 270 MBps sequential transfer rates on this old system...a little over twice the speed of the original 5400 RPM hard drive.After installation, I ran the Windows Experience Index function. Some blogs indicate that doing so allows Windows 7 to detect the new SSD and to make necessary system changes such as activating TRIM and deactivating automatic defragmentation. While TRIM was indeed activated, automatic defragmentation did not get disabled. I recommend doing a manual check of the system to make sure the most effective SSD settings are correct.

"I installed the black Husky Weatherbeater floorliners in my black interior 2013 Rav4. I uploaded several pics of how they look in place.

After comparing these side-by-side with the Weathertech Digital floor liners, I decided to purchase the Husky floor liners because of their thicker, more rubbery texture.Pros:- More rubbery & flexible than the Weathertech liners. A bit heavier as well.- Driver's side integrates with the OEM floor mat connectors. Holes are already present--no cutting necessary.- Driver's side has a recess for the gas tank door release.- Area under gas tank release is protected.- Sharp nibs on the bottom hold mats in place.- Full coverage of the ""false pedal"" on the driver's side.- The Rav4 model has contemporary styling rather than the star pattern available for truck models.Cons:- The seams aren't perfectly flush against the carpet in all places.- The Husky model for the 2013 Rav4 does not overlap the door thresholds the way some other Husky liners do for other vehicle models.

"I purchased this tray feeder to replace a Birdscapes Clear Window Feeder 348 which didn't make it to a second season.  I primarily get doves, goldfinches, house finches, chickadees, and cardinals at my feeder.  It is positioned just a couple feet away from a human chair on the other side of the glass, so I think regular interior movement may be pushing some species to the feeders further from the house.Pros:- Robust design.  Mine took a 12-foot fall after a raccoon raid and was nary worse for the wear- I really like the new poly lumber designs, which should hold up extremely well to multiple seasons- Hardware is stainless steel- The metal grating has strong black paint and is held in place by a set screw- Rain drainage and seed drying is very good unless there's too much seed (see cons)- Because it's plastic, metal, and stainless steel, it's very easy to disassemble and clean in the kitchen sinkCons:- Zero protection from the weather.  If the seed depth is too great, the seed in my feeder rots before it dries out after a rain.  I keep a smaller amount of seed in the tray so that it'll dry quickly after a rain.  I'm considering a Birds Choice 23X12 Acrylic Window Mount Cover.- The grating is installed a little tight on my feeder and requires needle nose pliers to get it out after the set screw is removed- The window glass and window sill tend to get a bit mucky from bits of seeds the birds fling aboutAt first, I didn't think birds would dare come so close.  Now that they've gotten used to movement inside the house, birds feed at it constantly.

"I use this rack to cook jalapeno poppers in the oven.  It's not perfect, but I like it.Pros:- Stainless steel is easy to clean and is thick enough for use at oven temperatures without warping.- The coring tool works really well on larger jalapenos.  However, it's too big for smaller jalapenos (the size I usually harvest in my garden).  To fix this problem, I bent the end of the coring tool further inward so that it would fit into smaller jalapenos.Cons:- There is no bottom.  That's good if using it on a BBQ grill, but not so good if using it in an oven.  When I use it in the oven, I place it on a cookie sheet to catch dripping cheese or bacon grease.- The holes are usually going to be too large or too small because of the wide size difference among jalapenos.  I use toothpicks through the jalapenos to hold smaller ones.  On larger jalapenos, I can usually push them far enough into the hole to hold them.  If the jalapenos are tall enough, I can insert them through the holes and let the bottoms rest on the cookie sheet I put underneath it.It's not perfect, but it's sufficient.  Until someone invents a rack with auto-adjusting holes, this'll do nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IKWUPZNFHOIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LF3SV6#wasThisHelpful","R3IKWUPZNFHOIU","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found these Toyota OEM filters cheaper here on Amazon than elsewhere.  It came in an OEM box with all the parts pictured.  Detailed instructions and diagrams are clearly printed on the box.The filter media seems effective.  Used filters are intact, show no indications of decaying or falling apart, and are easy to remove from the filter cap.  I don't bother going through the trouble of using the drain tube to drain the housing before removing the housing.  It's a little messier, but it means I don't have to remove the housing plug or replace the smaller o-ring on the housing plug.  Additionally, I don't replace the large o-ring unless I see significant problems with the installed one.  After a recent 9,000 mile oil change, for example, the o-ring still appeared brand new.  I saved the replacement o-ring for a future day.Multiple used oil analyses on my 2013 Toyota Rav4 show that these filters are quite satisfactory for 10,000 mile oil change intervals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KFZ393IBBHWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C65DYQ#wasThisHelpful","R3KFZ393IBBHWS","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Gold Plug installed in my 2013 Toyota Rav4 with 29,000 miles.  At the end of a recent oil change (9,000 miles on Toyota oil and OEM filter), I had approximately 1/2 mm of buildup on the magnetic drain plug.I don't plan to replace the aluminum seal after every oil change.  After 20,000 miles and 2 oils changes, I have no leaks.

"I purchased the Kuat NV2 gunmetal gray add-on from bikepartsexpressdotcom in July 2014 for $340 with free shipping.  The quality, like the main Kuat NV2, is absolutely amazing and better than any other platform bike rack on the market.Pros:- Easy to assemble with all included tools and instructions.- Comes with three keys and a Kuat aluminum bottle opener keychain.- The rack is still rock solid with the extension.  It does flex a touch more in the rearview mirror while traveling as a result of the extended length.- Once assembled, the extension can quickly be removed by taking out 4 allen head bolts (and reinstalling the end cap if so desired).  The two original platforms are still installed in their closer-together positions, but I think that's a small price to pay in order to quickly switch back and forth as the situation dictates.  (Note:  consider intertwining the cable locks between the main unit and the extension so that an educated thief can't remove those 4 allen head bolts and walk off with two of your bikes.)Cons:- In order to keep the rack from being excessively long when the add-on is installed, the main two platforms are installed closer together and all four platforms are ultimately closer together.  This reduces clearance between bikes and may require adjusting seat heights or pedals in order to have appropriate clearance.- Because of the additional length, when the rack is lowered to the ""open the tailgate"" position, the rack rests on the hitch tightener knob.- There's no guarantee the add-on will come with the same lockset number as your original rack, so you will likely have to use two different keys on the security locks.  The good news is that replacement cables can be purchased from Kuat with your desired lockset number if one must have everything keyed alike.  I chose to keep different locksets in order to deter thieves a touch more.- If you damage or break the hitch tightening knob (say, you drag it on a low driveway), you have to buy the entire tightening mechanism (about $30) rather than just buying a new knob.This add-on is a no brainer if you want to use the Kuat NV2 to carry 4 bikes.  Pricey...just like the main unit...but likely to last a lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROAS66UYHNGPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SFRNDK#wasThisHelpful","ROAS66UYHNGPQ","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't had much luck with this feeder.  Clinging birds and birds interested in nyjer or finch mix chose easier sources (my Droll Yankees tube feeders) and normal rainfall soaked the feed to the point that it began sprouting.  I've gone back to using tube feeders to present finch mixes.Pros:- Well built.  I'm a big fan of the new poly lumber feeders.- Screens easily slide out for cleaning.- The paint on the screens is robust.- Holes are small enough to provide easy access for nyjer or finch mixes.- Stood up to at least one raccoon attack.Cons:- Birds seem to choose easier feeding sources if they are available.- Zero protection from the weather and seed at the bottom of the feeder never dries out.  A single rain requires me to empty the feeder, clean it and refill.

"It is certainly true that debates rage on about the quality of Fram air filters and oil filters.  I have used them almost exclusively on 5 different vehicles for a total of about 440,000 miles and I haven't had any mechanical problems associated with either air or oil.  Those are my personal experiences.  Take it for what it's worth.This filter is a direct fit for the 2013 Toyota Rav4.  Construction quality is the same as other Fram air filters.  The orange rubber seal makes for a good fit in the air intake and seemed to be a little more compliant than the rubber seal on the OEM filter.  This filter, unlike other panel filters I've used, also has a bead of embedded glue down the middle of the filter pleats in order to prevent the pleats from bunching up and reducing surface area.  I saw no discernible difference, including paper media quality, between the OEM Toyota filter and this Fram filter.  Prices are cheaper online than at Walmart or auto parts stores.Multiple used oil analyses through Blackstone Labs on my Rav4 indicate there is no dirt/silicon based foreign matter making it into the engine or oil circuit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R452DTQRAOFWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RW2XYA#wasThisHelpful","R452DTQRAOFWB","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blackfish is not a pure documentary in the strictest sense--a movie in which the producer endeavors to evenly display information from both sides of the argument.  Rather, Blackfish should be considered an advocacy documentary.  The producer is most certainly using facts and opinions to advocate for one side of the argument and to advocate for action.  There is only about 1 minute of film where a proponent of Sea World provides an antagonistic viewpoint to the producer's theory.  The rest of the video is designed to express, convincingly so, that imprisoning killer whales is animal cruelty and often results in aggressive behavior.I think it's a good documentary and worth watching a couple times.  When I was young, I though Sea World was a terrific place where captive animals were well cared for and where humans could be educated about the plight of sea mammals.  I also believed that exposing humans to sea life in such close quarters would raise awareness and make humans more sensitive to appropriate ocean conservation efforts.  It accomplishes those things, but at what cost?  Do the ends justify the means?  Is a ""little bit"" of animal cruelty acceptable if it brings in money and raises awareness?As I grew older and attended more Sea World venues, I began to recognize that these animals did not reside in captivity voluntarily and that restricting animals to little concrete swimming pools or metal cages was unnatural.  Comparing animal behavior in the wild with animal behavior in captivity solidified this understanding for me.  I no longer frequent zoos or places like Sea World because of this realization.  We humans are smart:  We can certainly come up with a way of appreciating and learning about animals without keeping them as prisoners in cages.Blackfish is worth the watch.  It provides a perspective that Sea World purposely tries to keep out of the public eye.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGO2U09YMHYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EL6AAEU#wasThisHelpful","RBGO2U09YMHYU","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these for use on a Trek DS8.5 hybrid mountain bike.  They are my first experience with a clipless setup and I now can't imagine *not* having a clipless setup on each of my bikes.  I have them paired with a  Shimano SH56 SPD Cleat Set and Shimano SH-MT43G Bike Shoes For Men.Pros- I initially thought clipless shoes and pedals weren't ""necessary"".  After using them, I was surprised by just how much they increase pedaling efficiency.  It's surprising how much I can relax my upper legs when I don't have to concentrate on keeping my feet from slipping off the pedals.  Being able to pull up during the pedal stroke also adds a significant amount of extra power when needed.- The dual platform lets me use regular shoes--or simply not clip in when wearing clipless shoes.  It's also nice to have the platform side to get the bike up to speed (or out of a difficult spot) before clipping in.- Plenty of adjustability.  I have the cages set to a loose setting.  With the SH56 cleats, it's easy to twist out of the cages but it's nearly impossible to unclip from the cages by pulling straight up (i.e., they're working as designed).- Good, sturdy metals.- They don't look as aggressive as some other mountain bike clipless pedals, so they match the styling of hybrid bikes or leisure bikes a bit better.Cons- Because the nubs on the platform side are broad and blunt, they don't offer much traction, and my shoes slip around on them more than I'd prefer.- The black paint scratches off very easily.- The cages are a little more difficult to clip into than I would prefer:  I have to fish around a bit to get the cleat to engage.  This could be the result of the shoe and cleat combination as much as the pedal.  (I'm comparing this setup with the same shoes on Shimano PD-M324 SPD Dual Platform Pedal, which are quite a bit easier to clip into.)The pedals would be nearly perfect if the platform side had a bit more traction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MMWNO7LMQKME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAOIAQC#wasThisHelpful","R1MMWNO7LMQKME","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After scouring the market for a set of gaiters, I decided on these for a 5-day elk hunt in the Wyoming mountains.  They're pricey, but I am very pleased with their performance.Pros:- They fit very well with room to spare.  I wore them over thick knee-high wool socks, long johns, BDU pants, and 800-gram size 11.5 Danner hunting boots.- The under-boot straps are a heavily rubberized cloth material.  It'd take a lot to damage them.  They also have buckle holes along all but the first 2 inches on the opposite side from where they buckle.  The strap can be lengthened or shortened (which allows the gaiter to sit lower or higher on the boot) to account for different ankle and boot circumferences.- The top cinch is a nylon strap with a lever-type buckle.  It holds very well.  I rejected a pair of Cabela's gaiters because their elastic cord stretched too easily around the top of my calf and the spring loaded elastic cord lock would not hold.- They're essentially silent while in use.  The outer material is a soft, flannel like material and the inner material is not stiff or ""crunchy"".  A friend wore a pair of Outdoor Research black gaiters and they ""swish, swish, swished"" like a pair of nylon rain pants.- They seemed plenty ""waterproof"" as I spent 4 hours wading through knee high snow.  The tight fit around my boots also kept snow out of my boots and pants.- They seem to be snag-proof or at least highly snag resistant.  I didn't have a single snag in mine after tromping around in the Rockies for 5 days.- They did provide some additional insulation for my lower leg.- The Velcro is more than adequate for holding the gaiter on my leg.  Also, there's a standard hook at the bottom that connects to a shoe lace to help keep the gaiter from riding up.- A little tag on the inside tells you which is the (L)eft and (R)ight sides.- The lower snap is a nice touch but not essential.  One could partially overlap the Velcro, not use the snap, and still have enough holding power.Cons:- Perhaps the Velcro might wear out over time?Sizing Help:- I purchased the Large (9-12).- When the Velcro is fully overlapped, the top circumference of the gaiter is 19 1/4"" and the bottom is 18 1/4"".  One could overlap the Velcro less and gain about an additional 1"" of circumference, yet still have enough Velcro holding power.- My leg circumference just below the knee (where the top of the gaiter cinches down) is 12 3/4"".  I essentially had to tighten down the top strap as far as it would go in order to get a snug fit at the top.- My calf circumference is 14 1/2"" at the widest point.- I had comfortable room to spare with this size.  I estimate I could add another couple layers of clothing (in addition to that mentioned above)--say, a pair of sweat pants and another pair of long johns--before I'd have to worry about the gaiters being too tight around my calves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWO0X5NUAU00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MXYTG4#wasThisHelpful","R1TWO0X5NUAU00","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm quite pleased with this cargo rack.  I'm using it on a 2013 Toyota Rav4 with the Curt 13149 Black Class 3 Trailer Hitch.  The rack has a 500lb weight limit and the hitch is rated for 525lb tongue weight, so it's a good match.  I've hauled firewood, game hauling carts, and coolers.  It's a great buy.Pros:- Wow, it's big!- No license/registration required.  Can't say the same for a trailer.- Easy to assemble with common hand tools.  It comes in five pieces: two rack halves, the main square mount tube, and the two flat plates that hold the rack halves together.  Rock solid but heavy once assembled.- Good fit and finish.  Paint is robust, though the metal will rust if I scratch off the paint.- Has a slight upward tilt so that it tends to sit flat as weight is added to the rack or to the back of the vehicle.- Easy to secure with an anti-rattle hitch pin.  I'm using the Tow Ready 63201 J-Pin Anti-Rattle Pin and Barrel Lockset for 2"" Square Receivers and it stops all movement and rattle.- The additional cross bars underneath the diamond grate add confidence and keep the diamond grate from sagging.- A convenient place to temporarily set gear if out hunting, fishing, or camping.  Also serves as a convenient place to sit while afield.Cons:- It's heavy.  You may wish to use two people for assembly and installation.- Takes up significant storage space when not in use.- Depending on clearance, you may have to remove stuff from the rack to get your rear gate open.- The diamond grating is a tighter weave, so only small strap hooks will fit through the grating if one needs to attach straps to something other than the side bars.- It blends in to the back of the vehicle and could be struck by following drivers.  I applied Incom RE800 1.5-Inch by 4-Foot Highly Reflective Tape, Red and Silver to the top bar to make it more visible.- The rear of the hitch tube is open, so it can collect dirt & water, and makes the rack look a tad unfinished.I have no regrets on this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UEHSRDR57KVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G4Z5J0#wasThisHelpful","R1UEHSRDR57KVH","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These game bags are a heavy canvas, similar in thickness, toughness, and threadcount to a heavy duty pillow case.  They do an excellent job of protecting the meat from dirt; however, they are not ""waterproof"" (so to speak) so blood will still saturate and drip through the fibers.  I had no problem fitting a hide-on hind cow elk quarter with room to spare.  On another hunt, I fit an entire doe antelope into a bag.  There was about a 4-inch tear in one of the seams after use, but I don't know if it was due to my roughhousing or because of weak stitching at that location.  At any rate, it's an easy repair.  One could safely suspend a quarter in the air in these without worrying about the bag failing.  They wash up easily.The only downside is that they're rather heavy....maybe 3-4 pounds...and take up quite a bit of room in a pack.  I left them in the truck until my harvest because I didn't want to cart them around all day.Would I buy them again?  Probably not.  There are some very tight-weave heavy duty game bags (as opposed to the more chinzy cheesecloth variety) available that worked just as well for less money and a fraction of the weight.  I used the Alaska Game Bags (Alaska Game Moose, Elk, Caribou Rolled Quarter Bags Bags, 60-Inch (Pack of Four)) and preferred them on this hunt.  If I don't foresee needing to suspend quarters with the bag, the heavy duty Alaska game bags work marvelously.  Further, if I needed to suspend the quarters, I could tie the string directly to the quarter and then surround the quarter with the bag so that the bag itself is not holding the weight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HF9ZY42TUQBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006G8I0WU#wasThisHelpful","R3HF9ZY42TUQBK","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the same product available in auto parts stores and was a direct fit for my 1997 Ford Ranger 4.0L V6.  Each of the 6 wires was slightly longer than the OEM wires, so I had no difficultly making them reach.  Each boot had a dab of dielectric grease...a nice touch...although I added a little bit more grease to make it to my liking.  I installed the wires in conjunction with Autolite XP103 Xtreme Performance Iridium Spark Plugs. I've had no performance problems with them.  Neither have I noticed any notable increase in performance, though I think I did detect a faster startup and smoother idle.  They were not numbered (as were my OEM wires), so I took care in matching up sizes before installation.I took away 1 star because the female terminal inside one boot was slightly misaligned and I had a difficult time getting it to seat with a tactile click.

"I'm a lifelong shooter and have reloaded somewhere in the neighborhood of 18,000 rounds over the last 15 years.  After years of putting up with heavy recoil and cutting my bench sessions short on heavy recoiling rifles, I purchased the Caldwell Lead Sled DFT.  I lucked out at Cabela's during a 50% off sale last Thanksgiving, and walked out the door with it for about $125.  Even at $175, I say it's worth the cost for sighting in heavy recoiling firearms.  Working up handloads on my .300 Win Mag was miserable prior to this.  It is, frankly, effortless now.Pros:- Despite the many pieces in the shipping box, it's easy to assemble with included tools and great instructions.  Total assembly time was about 25 minutes.- Made of substantial materials:  beefy metals and very sturdy components.  It weighs about 20 pounds alone. It doesn't feel cheap and I was pleasantly surprised by its robustness.- Fit and finish is terrific:  Good paint, good texture, close tolerances.  The green cordura fabric will last a lifetime.  It's rigid, unlike a lot of the rests on the market that easily flex or wobble during use.- Cuts recoil on my .300 Win Mag by about 90%.  I'm using it with 75lb of shot.  The front of the rifle still hops up about 1 to 2 inches, and the sled moves to the rear about 1/2"".  It's enough that I have to reset elevation and windage adjustments after each shot.  Consider putting something under the rubber feet so that they don't get sandpapered by a rough concrete shooting bench like mine did.- The elevation and windage adjustments are smooth and allow minute corrections.  Final hold, however, still requires input from the shooter.  I can get the rifle very close to zero with the adjustments, but simply pressing my shoulder against the buttplate or gripping the rifle's stock is going to induce some movement.  In other words, this isn't a set-it-and-forget-it rest.  I still need to practice a good grip, good breathing, and good trigger pull if I want to keep my crosshairs on zero.  Having said that, the sled reduces my effort at holding zero by 70%--so much so that I was tempted to ignore breathing discipline while shooting.Cons:- It's difficult to fit more than 3 Caldwell Lead Sled Weight Bags on the tray.  I use 3 bags which contain three 25lb bags of lead shot.  Because the cam locks for the front slide protrude down into the tray area, they interfere with the front bags, and the tray isn't quite wide enough to hold 2 bags of shot side-by-side.- Because the gun is not allowed to recoil freely, some say it could cause damage to the stock in the long run.  I'll report back if I experience this.- It's taller than shooting bags alone, so you may need a booster seat at the shooting bench to get to the correct sitting height.All in all, I was very impressed with its quality and usefulness.  It made me think, ""Wow, it's definitely worth what I paid for it.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VFMTY0HA9BW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X7AJP6#wasThisHelpful","R1VFMTY0HA9BW6","A2RO3VB5MDP13B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RO3VB5MDP13B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautiful bird house. I love watching birds outside my home. I think birds are just really pretty. The opening is small so its perfect for wrens and other very small birds. This handcrafted birdhouse looks sturdy and well made. It has a nice sloped blue roof ans the body of the house is white with a brown base.

"The SoundLogic XT Rechargeable Wireless Rave Bluetooth Speaker is awesome. I love that it gives off a nice light show. As the music plays the front changes colors and when bass hits the color gets higher. I think there is around 8 different colors. Its really pretty at night. The speaker itself is nice. It can stand up or I can lay it down. The sound is crystal clear and gets really loud.It is rechargeable so you dont have to worry about batters. I love that I can use it Bluetooth or plug in the cord and plug into my device. I love listening to music and love to jam out and this speaker allows me to do just that.  It starts to pair to my devices in seconds. It comes partially charged right out of the box. This is one of my favorite portable speakers and since it is portable I can take it with my places.

The other stool I have doesn't have a back so I feel a little more safe in these. When they arrived we took out all the pieces and did notice that one of the little decoration pieces was broken but it wasn't a big deal and you cant even tell it. I love the transparent look these stools have.They took maybe 10 minutes to both together and comes with everything needed. It has the foot rest which is nice and it has a handle on the side to raise it up or down. They look to be of high quality. They have a chrome finish look that really shines. They actually do look great just in my kitchen. I need to find another set because we have company over every weekend.So far everyone that has sat in these have really liked them.

It does take 3 AA batteries which aren't included. It is a bump and go so while its moving if it hits say a corner wall of something it will bump its way out and go in a new direction.

When it came in I figured it was going to require some tools to put it together but it came in a huge box fully assembled. I thought that was nice. Now it is heavy so make sure its in a place where kids cant knock it over.It looks great sitting in my kitchen. Its got a soft padding and really comfortable. The only thing I would change is the back. I have a habit of wanting to lean back and it wouldn't be good if I actually forgot. We sometimes have small gathering so I have to make sure no one sits in it if they have been drinking. Its got a nice classic look to it and the stainless steel really shines and sets the stool off.

I even used a couple on a chip bag and they work great for that. So far I have had none that has broke. They do a fantastic job at keep my crafts in place. I will be using these a lot. These clips are just as good as the more expensive brand and I would recommend them to everyone.

"This light is perfect for my bedroom at night. i like having a clock in my bedroom and before this I was having to get up to look on my phone but with this I can lay in bed and look at the time. It works with 3 AAA batteries and even has an alarm on it. It even has the date and temperature on it and I find those to be a great feature.The alarm took me a few minutes to get figured out but I finally got it. The light isn't to bright but is bright enough to see at night and even great for a little night light. The alarm is loud enough that it wakes me up really easily. I really like it and think its a great value.

"I bought this to handle larger fruit as I'd been using a green lime squeezer for years that worked well but forced me to buy smaller lemons or use a reamer to juice. Seller is very conscientious provides recipes, etc. However the juicer isn't as efficient as my older and smaller green lime squeezer. I followed the directions to place the squeezer on the counter, which is awkward, since trying to squeeze it by hand holding it over something to catch the juice didn't seem to squeeze out enough juice. Lemons seem to fold in on themselves inside the sieve part trapping juice inside the lemon no matter which way I insert the lemon half. Totally couldn't handle an orange. It is stainless steel and seems well made so I'm not sure what the problem is but if I buy another I'd probably buy the cheaper yellow lemon squeezer although reviewers have mentioned that they are no longer the same quality as the ones made years ago.

"Not the cheapest pillow inserts but definitely much better than average. They have plump loft and nicely fill pillows and aren't easily crushed. I'll put in the warning that appears in other places regarding pillow forms...measure your pillow cover before you order a pillow insert and then purchase a pillow insert that is at least 2"" larger than the pillow cover. For example I ordered these 18"" pillow inserts for pillow covers that were @ 16"". These are very fluffy and nicely fill out the cases. I bought them to replace the feather and down combination inserts that were sold by the Pottery Barn to go with the cases years ago. They never seemed full enough and there were chicken feathers poking through the cushions that I'd pluck out weekly.

"Don't want to get into a big brouhaha about what a toaster ""should cost"" etc....obviously this toaster is expensive...and you can make toast in countless ways without it...enough said. I've probably bought 15 toasters, toaster ovens, etc. since 1968. They are covered the range of toasting bread...some were fine some were total dogs...I bought all these toasters not because I have some kind of fetish but because at different times I've needed different toasters. Initially I received a GE Toaster Oven as a wedding gift...my Mom's had worked great...mine died in a relatively short time and before dying it basically dried the bread rather than toasting it. So I bought another...and by then I had a family and a piece or two at a time wasn't cutting it...so I bought a toaster that could do several slices of bread at once. You'd think that would be it...but of course we moved onto Bagels and the slots were too narrow and slicing them narrower was a pain (literally) and the toaster would try to toast both sides of the bagel. Ok so I finally moved onto a toaster that would be both wide enough and toast just one side of the bagel and then I began baking artisan breads...I could control the width of the slice by the bread was always longer than the slot and so I'd have to cut the slice in half so the length would fit into the toaster. In between times I'd toast bread in the oven but as I now live alone turning on the oven for a single slice of bread is insanely energy inefficient...I was also tired of dragging the toaster in and out of the cupboard each morning because it hogged so much space on my counter to make 2 half slices of bread for my eggs so in a fit of pique I checked Google for what's the best toaster and up popped this toaster...what sold me was that it was very narrow reducing the amount of space it took up on the counter...AND it could adjust itself to both the width and length of whatever bread I tossed into it. It toasts just one side of a bagel for lox and cream cheese perfectly and has several settings for various shades of toast. Since a few reviewers mentioned the toaster died after 10 pieces of toast, I've waited until I'd made toast a hundred times and so far it just keeps getting better and better. There is a learning curve which the manufacturer mentions: Fresh bread is ""moister"" so you need to set the buttons to a higher level in terms of darkness to toast it, conversely if the bread is dryer you push a button for lighter toasting. It holds a long slice of artisan bread and toasts it perfectly without cutting it in half, the sensor seems to figure out every once you told it what you want. Try to cut the bread with a flat surface as I noticed with one piece that I more or less ripped from a loaf of fresh bread the uneven part of the crumb that stuck out toasted darker than the rest of the bread. Do not leave the toaster plugged in after you are finished using it unplug it as it stays on and ready for the next job of toasting immediately if you don't unplug it.Finally while it has a function for defrosting frozen bread I haven't used it because when I freeze bread I freeze rolls and so it's easier for me to toss the roll into the microwave on defrost bread for 22 seconds and then slice the roll in half  if I'm going to toast it. I never freeze sliced bread so I have no idea if this function works or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R96AQ6EMZNN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TK76DU#wasThisHelpful","R1R96AQ6EMZNN9","A3MHEGH6EIS5ZU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MHEGH6EIS5ZU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice coasters, good thickness, color and pattern a good match to Spode blue Italian. Offered at various sites with a fluctuating price so if you don't need them now shop around. I choose Amazon because they had the best price at the time I was looking and free shipping but I've seen them on eBay and Home Click at the same price or less although sometimes more hence the advise to shop around. One caveat with any of these types of coasters is that they work well with hot drinks like tea or coffee but if you put a sweating glass of something cold on them they tend to cling to the glasses and or course they don't absorb water so you need a cocktail napkin under the glass.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUYXUB3XU535/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036MECD0#wasThisHelpful","RKUYXUB3XU535","A3MHEGH6EIS5ZU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MHEGH6EIS5ZU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am really pleased with this Immersion blender. I bought it to replace an older immersion stick with multiple blades that was just ok...I noticed one reviewer said it was hard to clean what I've discovered is that since the base is stainless steel when I want to clean it, I boil some water and just put the Quik Stik into the boiling water after rinsing it off to sterilize it. No problem at all. I'd shopped around because as I've gotten older I find lifting a pot of soup and pouring a bit at a time into a blender problematic...so felt that if I could skip the step of pouring split pea soup into the blender and back into a pan...life would be easier. This quik stick is like a little outboard motor and works fine...no lifting although it's not as fast as a blender does small batches it's just easier for me than doing all that lifting and pouring back and forth. Also much more convenient than pulling the blender out of the cupboard rather than just reaching into the drawer to get the Quik Stick.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKMUQYD39ZWI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWN0YVU#wasThisHelpful","RKMUQYD39ZWI7","A3MHEGH6EIS5ZU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MHEGH6EIS5ZU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a semi-pro photographer. In other words, I am paid, have some skill, but I don't make my living doing it. My main software of choice if Adobe Lightroom, but while that is a wonderful tool for photographers, it does have limitations. With Lightroom, you can enhance what is already there, touch up skin and go wild with colors and tones. But you can't open closed eyes. You can't really move elements within a photo. You can't add things that aren't already there.But with this, you can. I'm amazed at the tools included. The price of this software is very similar to Adobe Elements, but you get everything Elements has, and MORE. You get a warp tool. You get a serious number of brushes that are great to use. You can edit RAW photos. You can add text and make it wrap. You can do so much!There are easy modes for those who want something nice and quick. But I often find those effects to be heavy-handed and way too processed. But with this, you can go into the edit mode and do everything yourself. Use those layers, adjust the tones, make it look real nice.Is it difficult to learn? Probably, if you have no previous experience at all. But I wouldn't say it's any more difficult than Photoshop, or GIMP.It has two versions: 32 bit and 64 bit so you can choose what works best on your computer.Who is this software for? Someone who is serious about photography but hates the thought of subscription services. (I am one of these.) Someone who doesn't want to pay through the nose for software.Does this replace Lightroom? No, it doesn't. Lightroom really shines in that you can edit tons of photos AT ONCE. This is necessary if you are a professional. But if you're a hobbyist and you're not dealing with hundreds and thousands of photos, then this is really the only thing you need.Can't recommend it enough.If you do decide to get this and are having a hard time learning how to use it, there are plenty of good tutorials on YouTube, not to mention","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FLMXMZA2IL0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60EW#wasThisHelpful","R3FLMXMZA2IL0D","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first got this, the thing was wildly inconsistent. One minute my head was 96.2, the next it is 98.4. (These readings were almost taken back to back from the exact same spot.) The reading would also vary greatly based upon which spot on your forehead you would use. It was also difficult to use because it didn't come with explicit directions. There's all sorts of beeping going on and I'm not sure what they all mean. How long am I supposed to hold the scan button? Where on the head do I scan? There were some directions on the packaging but they weren't specific or helpful.I was very frustrated with this thermometer and just stuffed it into a drawer. However recently, my baby got sick and I couldn't find our regular thermometer so I got this out. It said everything was fine. I tried it several times and it varied from 98.2-98.8 which seemed more consistent. But you know, I still was worried because I just didn't know how reliable this was. My husband finally found our regular thermometer and everything was indeed okay.So would I recommend this? I don't know. For the price, I think you could go with something more reliable and proven.

"I can't believe how well this works! I""m one of those who hates going to the bathroom in public places, and heck, even at a friend's house. But unlike most, I detest the aerosols and other bathroom deodorizers. They're so heavy handed, and they just feel like you're trying to over power the bad smell with chemicals.But with this, it actually works and I like it that it's made from essential oils because if there's any ... um... back splash, you don't have harmful chemicals on your skin.It's very easy to use: just shake, spritz three times, do your business and flush. And the smell really is gone, not just a good smell covering a bad one.The ultimate test was when I had my husband try this. My husband can really bomb a bathroom (sorry honey!) so much so that it lingers LONG afterwards. But he tried this, and I entered the bathroom immediately afterwards and nothing but good smells! I was blown away!The only bad thing I can think of, is that the Rose geranium smells is a bit strong, and it does linger in the bathroom for some time.

They're very soft and pretty airy.-Colors are neutral, nothing way out there.-Fit was perfect-Launder well and low maintenance (Yay, no hand washing!)Dislike:-They did not look flattering on me. The waistline scoops down right at the belly and makes it look bigger/flabbier. Of course this could just be a particular thing with my body shape so I didn't ding off any stars for this.-There is only elastic at the waistband, none for the legs so they do move occasionally.Just a note to keep in mind: the colors are assorted so you may not get what is pictured.

"This doll... where do I even begin? I got this for my daughter and though she was a bit young for it, I thought she would still be able to appreciate some elements of the toy. But I was wrong. The doll scared her. Freaked her out is probably a more proper word. She kept hiding behind me and peaking out to look at it.But do you know who *did* take to the doll? My son! He actually loves it and plays with it for hours on end. So at least it is appealing to children and that is a very important element. Which is why I gave this four stars. But if it were solely up to me, I would knock down a few stars.First of all, it *is* a little scary. I can relate to my daughter. When the baby is chewing, the mouth chomps up and down and there's a mechanical sound accompanying it so it is a little weird. Secondly, the head is so heavy that it often falls over. And then the baby says words to the effect that it can't eat while laying down. My son cannot get it to sit and often just feeds it in his arms. I can get it to sit after many tries. We'll probably just wind up propping it up with some books.Also, there's the food. It's basically play doh that you shove into its mouth, but then it sticks there and doesn't go down to later be ""changed"" in the diaper. My son usually uses his finger to make it go down, but as the directions clearly state, fingers should never be placed into the doll's mouth. (Good luck with that one!)So in summary, I'm not crazy about this doll. I prefer traditional ones that don't have bells and whistles. But I can't just go on my feelings because this isn't for me -- this is for my child, who for some reason, LOVES this doll.

I think maybe the overtones interfere with it because I could tune each string (and it would register as perfect) and then strum and it would say 2 or 3 strings were off. I've yet to have the strum feature be reliable.Of course tuning the old fashion way - each string at a time - works great on this. And the display is very bright and easy to read. But if you're going to be tuning one string at a time, there are other (cheaper and better) tuners that are more suited to the job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CVAR0P7JZJMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZU4G0ZK#wasThisHelpful","R3CVAR0P7JZJMV","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this game. I ordered this for my six year old boy, who knows nothing about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I wondered if, not knowing the story line or who the characters are, would he still like it? And the answers seems to be yes! He played it non-stop for a week!This game is very different than previous leap pad games. It did not come with a cartridge, the game itself is downloaded via wi-fi or over Ethernet if you connect it to your computer. The cards themselves...well, he had a hard time figuring them out on his own so I did have to help him. But once he figured it out, it was kind of cool. The camera recognizes the cards well, even in low light conditions. The characters popping out of the cards was quite a novelty and very neat. But what I like best about the cards was the fact that my child was physically interacting with the game, not just staring at the screen in a mind-numbing way. The game works with math and fraction skills, but also is very much a game so there is a fun factor too.All in all, we've been pleased -- he enjoys the fun and I like that it's reinforcing math skills.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWXMK49LDOKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1P4TA#wasThisHelpful","RQWXMK49LDOKN","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got our camping lantern and absolutely love it. Why hadn't anyone thought of this before? It's useful in so many ways! It comes with two USB adapters, one male and one female. So you can use the female and plug it into a laptop and charge the light. Or if you need something to be charged you can use the male adapter. (You would also need your charging adapter because few phones are going to be able to use the female USB by itself) If you feel like roughing it (or are in an emergency situation where there is no electricity) you can hand crank the thing to power up the three phase alternator within the light. No constantly searching for batteries!We have used it both as a flashlight and lantern. My six year old likes the lantern because it's cool and has a ""camping feel."" I like that the light is very bright and so versatile. It has a handle that you can use to hold or to hang up, and since it collapses into itself, it's small and very easy to pack. I think this light would be useful not only for camping trips but in emergency situations as well.Note: I did receive a sample in exchange for an honest review.

"I have four hummingbirds fighting over the feeder I have in the yard, so hoping to alleviate some of the congestion, I got this window feeder. (Plus, I was looking forward to some up-close observations of the birds.)On the first day, two of the birds hovered by looking at it but did not feed. On the second day, I had one feed. On the third day, I had two feed. After that, nothing.I've tried moving it to different windows and still nothing.My personal theory is that the hummingbirds are scared by their own reflection because they think it is a competitor bird. Because my birds know full well this feeder is out there; they just choose to fight over the one in the yard and ignore this one.But I have to add that the ant moat on this works spectacularly. On the first day, I installed it without the ant moat. I read previous reviews where people complained the suction cup wasn't holding. So rather then add extra weight to it, I figured I would go moat-free. Besides, we really don't have  any kind of an problem where I live. But wouldn't you on on the second day, I woke up in the morning to find a steady stream of little black ants heading for this thing? I dusted off the ants, quickly installed the moat and then dropped of my son at school. I forgot about the whole thing until lunch time, where I observed the poor hapless ants swimming around in the water. The line of ants was still there, much not as strong. By dinner time, the line of ants was entirely gone leaving only the waterlogged ants to their fate.So the moat works spectacularly. Wish the hummers actually used it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RROTTWY0EISX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E5X9GK#wasThisHelpful","R2RROTTWY0EISX","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since I had children, I've become much more aware of what goes on my skin. My baby daughter is always blowing raspberries on my arm, gumming down on my fingers and get even giving me kisses. That makes me aware of what ingredients are on my body lotions because I really don't want her ingesting anything terrible while she's loving on me.So I""ve started making my own body oils. Mostly I had been using sweet almond oil but the shelf life is only one year. Plus, it does have a tinge of scent to it. I've used jojoba before but it's very expensive.This coconut oil, so far, is the best thing that I've ever used. I use it after a shower and my skin is so soft.

"I got this for my son who's always biking, scooting or running around outside. It's great to hold things for him, such as the garage door opener so he can let himself in, but mostly it's for safety reasons. With the summer solstice past us, the days are getting shorter and he's still playing when it's dark. So I have him wear this and I feel like it makes him more visible.I like that the belt feel sturdy and well made. The straps are adjustable so that it can fit on my husband, or it can fit on my skinny little son. The par that holds things looks tiny, but in reality the back is a gusset type design so it actually contains a lot more than you think it can.So far we've been very happy with this.

"We've got a two-story house. The wi-fi antenna is on one side of the house on the second floor. The Roku is clear on the other side on the first floor. If we use the wireless with the Roku, the video is so slow to load. Like slower than sprouting mushrooms, slow. And it stops intermittently to load some more. Needless to say, this is annoying. So I jumped on the chance to get this power line adapter.It's so easy to set up. You stick an Ethernet cable into it, hook it up to your router, then plug it into any plug in your house. Then go to where you need fast internet, plug the accompanying unit into the wall outlet, then viola! You have an Ethernet port! It really is incredibly easy! And it's really fast too, so much faster than when we were using wi-fi.And added benefit is that with this model, you don't even lose the use of your plug outlet since it has the power socket on the back.We've been really happy with this, con't recommend it enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A6HVJRRE2EBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3QPG1A#wasThisHelpful","R1A6HVJRRE2EBJ","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: 11/17/2015 - This laundry cart is now out of commission. Shortly after writing this review, one of the wheels broke off. We supper glued it back on, and that worked for awhile, but it's now broken yet again. But this time, the wheel didn't simply come off, the wood housing for it actually split. For the price you're paying, this should last longer than this. What an utter disappointment. I've changed the rating to two stars. Original review follows below.When I saw this laundry cart available, I immediately got it. Visions of my children neatly throwing their whites and colors in the appropriate bag right before jumping into the bath swam through my head. No more picking up clothes! No more hauling the heavy (and unwieldy) Rubbermaid plastic basket up and down the stairs. I was delighted and excited to try it out.But in practice, things were a bit different.Assembly was very easy and my husband had it up in no time. The first thing that struck me was ""Whoa, it's much bigger than I thought!"" It didn't fit in the kid's bathroom. So much for putting it next to the bath tub. There just wasn't room.So the next option was to put it in my bathroom. And again, there wasn't room. I mean, I suppose it fit but it was in the way and made navigating in the bathroom cumbersome.Next, I tried putting it in our closet. It's a small walk in closet and immediately saw there wasn't room there either. Finally, we settled on placing it in our bedroom right next to the bathroom door. And it works great there. Love it that the bags are movable and so light. Love it that the colors are neutral and go with any color scheme. Love it that there is ample room int he bags so you've got a good size load when they're full.If your laundry room is on the same floor as this cart, I envy you because there is no heavy lifting involved at all - just wheel the cart to wherever it needs to go.So this laundry cart is great. Ample size as long as you've got a good place for it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QHTPI7ZL0F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH5QTJW#wasThisHelpful","R37QHTPI7ZL0F7","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two children: a baby girl and a six year old boy. Both of them have dry skin/ eczema problems. In the beginning, with the first one, I would use baby lotion on his skin but it didn't help the eczema. Also, I found out that baby lotion actually has lots of questionable ingredients, even the ""hypoallergenic"" and ""natural"" ones. The pediatrician recommended good old petroleum jelly, which helped the eczema. However I was still not happy because the jelly still had a very industrial oil smell to it. I know it says it's refined and ""purified"" but I didn't like the idea of putting it on my sweet baby.The only solution that I have found is to use natural oils with essential oils. So far I have tried Jojoba oil and this sweet almond oil.This sweet almond oil is wonderful; both children use it and no reactions, nothing. It goes on so well and makes their skin so soft. Each of them has their own little bottle and my son loves it that mommy made it just for him. I put several drops of lemon grass for his (because that is the scent he loves best) and a few drops of lavender for my baby girl. With my baby, I give her a bath, give her a little all over massage with the sweet almond oil with lavender and she gets so relaxed. Makes bedtime a lot less stressful and she drops right off to sleep.So far, I really like this oil. My only complaint (and this seems common with many oils, not just this one) is when I received it, the outside of the bottle was very oily, as if some had seeped out during shipping.)Note: I did receive a free sample for review, however I did try my best to be honest and unbiased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342RDNV1F7BH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VEBYV6S#wasThisHelpful","R342RDNV1F7BH9","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've used this several times on outings with my 11 month old daughter, and it's great for both restaurant highchairs and grocery shopping carts. Very nice and soft with colors that are gender neutral. (I'm one of those moms that are against saturating baby girls in pink and purple.) The pockets are ideal to stuff little toys in there for baby to find. ( If I put my things in there, like sunglasses or keys, the baby always gets them.) I also like very much that it can fold into its own little pouch. Makes it easier for me to stuff into the diaper bag.Now on to the bad things, which aren't really that bad at all. First, I'm the only one that can make it fold into itself. My husband has tried valiantly but cannot figure it out. Also, (and this is true with ALL cart covers, not just this one) it's a little cumbersome to lug around, unfold, place it, then put it back when it's time to leave. I found it's just easier to wipe down the cart with sanitizing wipes and then just put the child on the cart. Some might think I'm a lazy mom but I like to think of myself as practical. This is my second child and I did the whole cart cover thing with the first one but with the second one, my hands are fuller, my time stretched thinner and I'm much more willing to take the easy route.But with all that said, if you're going to get a cart cover, this is the one to get.

"This came at the perfect time as our 11 month old has had a cold for about a week now and her nose is dripping like a faucet. We have Nosefrida and while the idea is similar, this oral suction aspirator is much better. For one thing the tip slightly tilts up and is smaller, making it easier to place gently in the nostril. The Nosefrida is so big that you have to put it slightly outside of the baby's nose therefore making you lose a bit of suction. So in short, I got a lot more snot out using this.The other thing I like is it's made of silicone and is soft. The tip (if you accidentally poke your baby with it) is quite pliable and doesn't hurt. Best yet, because it's silicone you can just pop this sucker into the dishwasher. Love that feature! I also like it that the part that goes into your mouth is hard. On the Nosefrida, it's soft and my husband would involuntarily bite down on it occasionally which impeded the air flow. That is not a problem with this one.The only thing I don't like? The filters. You have to use a new one each time. And I can't find where to buy replacement filters or how much they cost.  It comes with a number of them, however when those run out, it looks like we're just going to have to use it as a bulb aspirator.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RA3BJEA8LCJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P38Q9TU#wasThisHelpful","R2RA3BJEA8LCJX","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got an 11 month old baby who loves to press her face against the window in our kitchen nook. This happens on a daily basis. There are spit trails, palm prints and when she's sick, there's even snot stains. Licking the window is not a rare occurrence. So am I going to be cleaning this window with Windex? No way! I just take a microfiber cloth, put some water on it and scrub away all the nastiness. If the window is particularly dirty, I'll add a bit of vinegar to the water mix and it does the trick. It doesn't leave any streaks and the window is clean, ready for little miss to gaze once again at the little birds and squirrels on the other side.I also use these towels to dust throughout the house. I used to use swifter but felt guilty throwing the dust thingies away after each use. Seemed wasteful. But these towels pick up the dust without spreading it or adding it to our air. Once done, they go right in the washer and dryer.I also use them to clean my iPad screen, computer screen and even my eyeglasses too. So many uses! Which is why I liked getting these towels in bulk.

"I got this for my 6 year old son and he absolute loves this. As I type this, he's marching around our yard carrying this under his arm. When he woke up in the morning, the first words out of his mouth were ""can I play with my water truck?"" He's even asked if he could bring the water truck to the dinner table, where I promptly said ""No."" (I had to draw the line somewhere)At first he wasn't that impressed because the truck's not very big. It's also very light weight, and the water spout/gun didn't look impressive enough. But we put water in, took it outside and he pushed the handle down. His face lit up when he saw how high and how far the water squirted! He let out a squeal and said ""Mom, did you SEE that! It went almost as high as the neighbor's roof!!"" (It did not; our neighbor's house is nearly three stories tall but I guess to our son, making half way was close enough)And now that he's carrying it around everywhere, it's kind of a good thing it's so light weight.Of course with this toy, you have to have the talk of ""Don't shoot people in the face with it""And really, it's basically a water gun, but I guess for people who are anti-gun but still want their kids to have fun, this is the alternative.Either way, the toy is a hit.

"I'm getting closer to 40 years and the wrinkles on my face are starting to get noticeable. I've seen products like this advertised a lot lately so I thought I would give it a try. After using this a few times, here are my thoughts:- When I first opened the package, the tip that was already on the device (the coarse one) had a fine white residue on it. As if it had previously been used or perhaps was dirty from the factory? Either way, it was very unappealing to have something that goes on my face come out of the box with residue on it. The other two tips were clean.- I used the precision tip on low suction because I have sensitive skin and did one area of my face. I tried my chin and only my chin so I could compare how my skin looked between my chin and the rest of my face.- The feeling was weird. It's literally vacuuming your face while you slide this abrasive tip over your skin. You have to slide it very slowly, and this is hard to do so since the thing is sucking away at your skin. After the first time, my chin was majorly red and irritated. The irritation subsided pretty quickly though. The second time it was red and irritated as well, though again, the irritation only lasted minutes after I was done.I have not seen any difference or improvement in the skin, however I will freely admit I have not used this enough for it to work. The thing is, it's uncomfortable and unpleasant enough that I'm dubious I want to do it again.I do feel like if given a chance, this could work to reduce lines and wrinkles because it is sucking the collagen back into the lines. Of course it is also stretching your skin out a bit with the suctioning so I'm not sure if the trade off is worth it.Also, you have to use a new filter every time you use the device. EVERY TIME. So you're constantly sinking money into this. It comes with a bag of 30, and you can buy more from the manufacturer's website (I think it's $9.99 for a bag of 30 filters) So it's not too expensive, but still not cheap either.

"This is my first non-kitchen knife and so far, I've been impressed with it. Very sharp, light, and portable. (I've tried cutting things of various thickness and it's performed very well) The fact that it has a flashlight built in is very handy too. Flipping the blade open is easy to do, and closing it is easy too, but requires two hands and is hard to figure out but once you do, it's no big deal. The handle feels firm in my grasp, and doesn't seem likely to slip. The belt clip means that if I'm wearing pants with no pockets, I can still carry this around and have my hands free.My only complaint is lack of instructions. It comes with a small slip of paper with drawings on it which is hard to figure out. It tells you how to close the blade, but not really. I was also curious as to how to care for the knife, since this was my first one. I went on to the manufacturer's website to see if there was more information. I found this knife, clicked on ""download instructions"" and got a blank page! Doesn't give me much confidence in the company. I know this knife comes with a lifetime warranty but I don't know how good the company is that backs that warranty.But the company aside, the knife does seem to be in good mechanical condition and does everything it's supposed to. All around, I'm pleased.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX78S9HK98636/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UP3TOD6#wasThisHelpful","RX78S9HK98636","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was much more work than I initially realized. Call it ignorance on my part but I thought I would just dump a few seeds in the bald spots on my lawn and then fresh, green, grass would sprout.But no, I realize that's pretty unrealistic. You have to dig up the bald spots and get rid of the dead grass, loosen the dirt and then once you spread down the seed and mulch, you need to diligently water it. Thankfully, we've had lots of storms/rain in my area so it has mostly been a hands-off thing for me after the initial lay down.I really like that it has everything included: the fertilizer, mulch and seeds combined together.

"I got Elements 13 because the full Photoshop program was daunting to me. It seemed overly complicated, plus, with the creative cloud subscription service, I would be forever paying money just to use the software. Elements 13 appealed to me because it was simple, and the things I learned using it would help me with Photoshop should I ever decide to upgrade and go all in.But I hit a snag. Elements 13 wasn't as simple as I thought it would be!Sure, the quick modes and guided modes were easy, but I really wanted to use expert mode and it was a little baffling. For example, I wanted to add text to one of my photos. Simple, right? Just use the text tool. Which I did, but for the life of me, I would click on my picture, type, and nothing would show up! It was very frustrating!That is, until I got this book. I love this book. So detailed. Gives examples. You don't have to read everything, just the parts you need to get what you want accomplished. It's written in easy to understand language. Has many photos and illustrations to show you exactly what it's talking about.

"I'm an hobbyist photographer, which means I've got a *ton* of raw images that take up a lot of space. But these are my ""culled"" images, and many of them are very important to me so I was really looking for a back up system in case my computer goes kaput. (I'm also a mom to a 6 year old and a baby which means I have tons of video footage too.I've thought about doing cloud storage but I just have SO MUCH that it would take forever to upload everything.

I know, these are not likely events but still, call me paranoid if you must.This Seagate fit the bill for what I need. It had enough memory space to last me a while, and it was such a cinch to hook up to our router. That way,  both me and my husband has access to it.

"My son absolutely loves hot wheels and has many of these track builder sets. Even by itself, this thing is pretty fun. He loves how the cars gets ""rejected"" by being popped off and I like it that it has many configurations so that it doesn't get old too quickly.It is fairly large and will take up quite a bit of space in the child's room. This is especially true if you have other track pieces and the child builds upon this, which mine did. That's another benefit to this - with the additional tracks pieces, really, the possibilities multiply.I like this because (with the additional pieces) there's room for engineering and creativity. And the ""zoom"" factor makes it addictive for him to play this as opposed to being on the iPad all day. By itself, it's still a good toy but I think to really get the full benefit, you should get additional track and at least some of the other track pieces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YNCDWRMH82E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYWGC36#wasThisHelpful","R2YNCDWRMH82E1","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure why this happens but it happens a lot. The label on the vitamin bottle will say ""Kids complete"" (or something along those lines) and they are actually far from it. Often, they are missing iron and calcium. That is the case with these Smarty Pants vitamins but it's also true with many other childrens chewables or gummies vitamins too. Why do they do that? It find it frustrating as these two things are very important for growing young bodies.Also, I don't like that kids over the age of 3 need to take 4 gummies per serving. That's a lot! Especially considering they don't taste very good. My 6 year old son didn't like it. Curious, I tried them too and thought they tasted awful.

"My kids and I have severe allergies to dust and pollen. (Lucky husband has almost none. Why couldn't they get his genes on this one huh?) So I was thrilled to be able to get this. We already have the Hoover WH10600 which we love so I had high expectations for this one.Immediately out of the box, I thought this thing was huge. It looked like a wall air conditioning unit, it's that big. We didn't see any manual with it, but it did come with an extra charcoal filter. We plugged it in and it, whoa! The thing is *really* quiet.  So much more quiet than any other air filter I've ever owned. I was really happy with it (for all of two minutes) when I decided to test out some of the features.And that's when the disappointment hit. None of the buttons worked. NONE.I looked online for the manual and we did everything it told us to. We tried not pressing too hard like it said, and still, nothing. My husband tried it. I tried it. We can't even turn it off, we had to resort to unplugging it from the wall.What a huge let down. I still give it three stars because the low setting works fine for our use.

"I've been a crocheter for over twenty years and in that time, I've come to realize that organization is key. I can't tell you how many times I've misplaced a specific hook, or my stitch markers have gone missing. I've gone looking for scissors on more than one occasion and those yarn needles are never where I think they are. All these doo-dads are so small and get lost so easily, which is why this organizer is a blessing to me. I LOVE that everything is in one place, no more hunting for this or that. And it's handy because I often take my crocheting to various places to keep myself busy - waiting during my son's music lessons, dental appointments, in the car pool lane at my son's school - and this little clutch makes it so easy to have everything with me.All the implements seem to be equal in quality to what I already have. Definitely would recommend this for the beginner - you get everything you need all at once. And even for those who have been crocheting for a long time; it's a perfect crochet-on-the-go companion.I received a free kit for review purposes but wouldn't hesitate to buy this in the future for gifts for friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7IEKBHP1TQER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKNXFBU#wasThisHelpful","R7IEKBHP1TQER","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this for the little one, who is 8 months old. I know she's four months away from the recommended age limit, however she actually does like to play with it. She loves gnawing on the little plastic figures (Her favorite is the farmer!) and she loves to toss them down the silo. I'm surprised (and thankful) that she hasn't gone nuts with the door which triggers the sounds. (Don't worry, if you kid DOES go nuts with the door you could always turn the sound off and then pretend that it broke.)The barn is much bigger than I thought it would be. My oldest, who is 6 years old also plays with it. There was a peaceful moment when the two of them were playing, side by side, with this toy and I was so filled with joy that I ran for the camera. But then the moment I took the lens cap off, the big one was playing with a toy the little one wanted and crying broke out.

"I have two children, the youngest currently at 8 months and in the middle of teething. I've always just believed that spoons were spoons, they're kind of all the same, but that notion was proved wrong with these. They are the best baby spoons I've ever used between both of my children. My baby girl LOVES these. The reaction to them was far more than I ever imagined. Her eyes literally opened wide and she gurgled and smiled as she bit down on these spoons. Even my husband (who normally is oblivious about baby gear) noticed how different and nice these were.They're silicone which means that they're safe. (Pacifiers are made of silicone if that tells you anything) I don't have to worry about BPA or any other chemicals. They're colorless so no worries about dyes or harmful colors and they're very easy to clean, just pop them in the dishwasher. Probably the best thing about them is the squishiness of them. Even after we feed her, baby loves to gnaw on these while the rest of us finishes our meal.

"The idea for this is pure brilliant; I thought it would be a time/sanity saver. I mix pumped breast milk with formula, and need 3 oz of formula for each bottle. If you've ever mixed bottles, you'll know that 3 oz is difficult to make because it's 1 scoop for every two ounces. Measuring out 1.5 scoops (when there is no halfway mark on the scoop itself) is an exercise in trial and error. We thought this would save us since you can set the machine to 3 oz and, la-dee-dah, our troubles are over!But reality kicked in and we are still measuring and mixing bottles by hand. Why you ask?Several reasons:1. Our bottles do not fit on this machine. We use the Dr.Brown's glass bottles. The 4 oz. size is too short and the machine winds up missing the bottle and spraying formula everywhere. If we use the little stand that comes with it, the 4oz bottle hits the top and doesn't slide under very well. We tried using the Dr. Brown 8oz glass bottle and that doesn't fit at all.2. When the formula reservoir was 1/3 full, the machine thought it was ""empty"" and refused to work.Putting the thing together was also not a walk in the park. The directions could have been clearer and there were so many things to wash. Overall, the idea was great, but the execution not so much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20524A2XDB0UA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5USFBG#wasThisHelpful","R20524A2XDB0UA","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My baby is 8 months old and we got this mainly for the ""play"" feature. This is our second child so we actually had two pack n' plays from my oldest, however my baby hates to be placed in these pack n' plays. The floor is off the ground on legs and when she crawls around or moves, the floor wobbles and moves with her. This has proved to be very frustrating and she always screams to be let out.She's perfectly happy to sit and play in this however because the soft mat is on the floor and doesn't shift around under her. It's so much more stable. She's happy with it, which means I am THRILLED!But this is an all-around great tool to have with baby. I actually wish I had this when my little one was born. She had GERD and had so much trouble with spit-up the first few months of her life. This inclined sleeper, placed next to our bed, would have been a God-send to me. Instead, we tried various other things (like sleeping in a swing, or rocker) which did not work out too well because they caused other sleeping issues.  (The swing squeaked loudly when she moved, the rocker positioned her head in such a way that it was hard for her to breathe.)The inclined sleeper does have buckles to keep your baby secure. It is rated for babies up to five months, or whenever the baby starts to roll or turnover.The diaper changing clutch that comes with this is also very nice. I've had many portable diaper changing mats in the past that come with my diapers bags, but this one, by far, is the nicest. Easy to clean, has good cushioning to make baby comfortable, and a pocket for everything.Can't recommend this enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OFK69CET2PB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCJULWE#wasThisHelpful","R2OFK69CET2PB5","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for those looking to buy this used since you really can't buy this new anymore. The question is: Is this worth buying used? Will I still get much usage out of it? The answer is a resounding YES! Go for it!I have always been interested in photography, however DSLR cameras are EXPENSIVE. Entry level models are around $500 and that's a lot of money to sink into something you're not sure about. So when the chance to get this used came up, I jumped on it. It was my first DSLR and I was nervous, but it was something I was dying to try. And I'm so glad I did! I now have other cameras and consider myself a hobbyist enthusiast, and despite having newer/nicer cameras, I still take this one out and use it quite often. It's an oldie but a goodie!This things I like:1. Built like a tank. I have bonked this thing so many times, and while I have not outright dropped it on the cement floor, I've come pretty close. I can't believe how nice it still looks despite my abuse.2. It's simple. I really don't need Wi-fi, eye-fi, GPS or any of those bells and whistles that the newer models come with. I want a beautiful picture with good focus and vibrant colors. This camera delivers that. I shoot in Raw and the processor doesn't slow down much. (Well, except when I'm photographing children, who move a mile-a-minute and I need to capture EVERY MOMENT, then the buffer gets a little overwhelmed.)3. The menus and buttons are intuitive. I did read the manual however you kind of don't really even need to. The minute I got this, without knowing anything about photography, I started shooting immediately. My hands and eyes were just itching to capture every moment around me and this camera, on auto, does a good job of that. Obviously it is to your benefit to learn to use manual mode, however for the beginner, it's nice to have the auto work so well while you're trying to get a grip on aperture, shutter speed, ISO and such.4. Despite being simple, it does have all the features that you need to capture that great photo. It has front and rear curtain sync flash; matrix, center-weighted and spot metering, auto exposure lock, single auto focus and continuous auto focus among other features.Some things people might think are cons:1. Only three focus points. I actually don't think this is a con, since I mainly just use the one in the middle and recompose, however some people like to have options and three isn't many.2.  CCD sensor. I know CMOS has dominated the latest image sensors, but I find that the CCD on this one produces quality images that are comprable to my newer CMOS DSLR cameras.3. Only 10.2 MP. But truthfully, even though the newer ones have more than double the MP of this one, 10.2 mp is more than what you would ever really need. If you read up on things, you'll find that megapixels is not your main concern when looking for a quality camera.So really, the cons aren't really cons for me, though I suppose some people may think of them as cons. So if you can get this camera for really cheap used, I would jump on that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KWXHNNC239WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012OGF6Q#wasThisHelpful","R2KWXHNNC239WG","A3QEIVO8AB3YMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QEIVO8AB3YMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"" Its already running!""The dishes come out spotless. Our old DW had a seal breaking down (one of the reasons we were getting rid of it) and it left little rubbery black spots on all of the dishes. One cycle in the Bosch and all of those spots were gone.Minor niggle: You almost HAVE to use a drying agent to get the dishes perfect. Because of this the cost of ownership is a tad higher on the front end, but the energy efficiency of this DW probably more than makes up for it.Setup:Wow - Completely doable by most people. It comes with a junction box that is super easy to setup and install. I was so blown away that I didnt have to lay under the DW for 3 hours trying to connect all of the power connectors. That little junction box plus plug that you can remove was a delightful surprise.As I stated it was very light and easy to put in under the cabinet.Overall we are VERY happy with our purchase.Thank you for reading my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2781QDQ1LGF4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCEWIQK#wasThisHelpful","R2781QDQ1LGF4L","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had other linksys routers in the past but since they were purchased by Cisco, you know the router people; the quality has drastically improved. About this router. I have this hooked up behind my cable modem. In front of it is a 12 port Gigabit switch and this is in-between. Setup was very easy and as stated it is almost effortless with the built in setup. Now for the specifics. I noticed that this router did extend beyond my old router by a good 30 feet. The file transfers were on par with my previous router. I have 2 kids in the house and everything is wireless so we really tested this thing out. I never noticed a slowdown on any file transfers, it just seems that this router is a beast.Overall we are very pleased with our new router and expect it to last some time. I will update this as we use it more.Thank you for reading my review.UPDATE:12/14/05Ok so after my initial setup I began to have random drops on both 2.4GHz and also 5.0GHz. I suspect a firmware update will be out soon because this is a problem with this model I will update this review when I find out about it. Performance wired is fine. Its the wireless that drops often. I talked with the techs at Linksys *(it comes with 6 months free tech support if you register it), and they suggested to update the firmware even if it is 1.0 because it might be better than the factory default. I declined to do this but I suspect it will not make a difference.They also suggested setting the 5GHz to 20 or 40 MHz and setting 2.4GHz to channel 6 by default. I did this and as of this update its been up 1 hour with no dropping. IMHO this is completely unacceptable for a router in this price range. It is my hope they have a new firmware soon.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y1HYEX8LWTTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ19M72#wasThisHelpful","R2Y1HYEX8LWTTS","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This headset from Turtle Beach, while based on Disney Infinity as a theme, is right on par with the company's other offerings. This set comes with some cool features:- Ability to change covers on the side (they are stickers that are similar to laptop/phone skins)- A cord that is almost 1 mile long (ok thats an exaggeration, but really it has a super long cord)  I think this is to reach a console and remain on the couch. You can remove the long section and be left with a standard length cord with a headphone/phone mini jack plug on the end.The sound quality is very similar to my Xbox Turtle Beach headset. Its has rich bass and good highs. It really shines at the midrange, which makes sense as this is for VOIP communications with your team mates.For children?Because Infinity is a child's game, I gave these to my daughter to use for a few weeks. She has worn them almost non stop while she is playing with her electronics or tablets. Quite often she cannot hear me because of the passive noise suppression built in. It fits her head quite well and she has never complained of any pain for wearing long periods.Overall this is a great headset, the theme is fun for kids or fans of Infinity!Thanks for reading my review :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5NZM8E8QOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVQQJBW#wasThisHelpful","R3T5NZM8E8QOX","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"High quality fryer!We bought a Waring Pro fryer for our food truck a few years ago and has held up well since we sold the business (we kept the fryer). It had seen some commercial use for the 2 years we had it. Getting long in the tooth; when this one popped up we grabbed it. First off the quality is top notch! The Waring had a dial timer that NEVER worked correctly. This one has a digital readout that is easier to see. *When making double fried- french fries its critical for the timing to get a consistent product. The DeLonghi fryer with its digital timer is super easy to monitor cook times. The dual zone is nice because you can make 2 batches at the same time and alternate the frying you are doing.Pros:+ Digital timer+ Dual Zone allows for faster cooking and cooking multiple things+ Great constructionCons:- Cleaning might be a problem over time but for now it cleans up well (I am thinking of when the grease gets to be more sticky in the corners)Overall we are VERY happy with this fryer and would recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11E8TK5GQUNRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00489QJUE#wasThisHelpful","R11E8TK5GQUNRV","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I currently have 4 monitors on my standing electric desk. Prior to this I had 3 monitors mounted on a triple tree bar. The one I ordered was cheap. Both in manufacturing, quality and performance (3 monitors were all at different heights over 3 inches different). Because of this I had guessed this single mount would be similar. I was COMPLETELY wrong. First off this is from 3M. It comes with a nice 3M pad for your desk. The build quality is fantastic. It looks professional. You will not be ashamed to show it off. It has a TON of customization options. Its flexible in many different ways. Comes with allen keys so you need nothing to get this setup.

"This bed is absolutely amazing. For this price you generally do not get a mattress that is memory foam. We were pleased how it arrived in a large box and not a crate that we were expecting. It was easy to set up. Smelled a bit funny for a day but that cleared up quite well. Give it at least 24 hours before using it.Pros:+ Comfortable+ Supportive+ Easy to install+ 2 Free Memory foam pillows (also a con see below)Cons:- The memory foam pillows are a great bonus, my biggest issue with them is they are made from the foam scraps left over.

"Got this set and my son and I are having a blast playing with it. The car is pretty fast and crazy wild to control. My main issue is with the life of the battery. It seems that it only lasts about 10 minutes and then its dead. Would like it if it was a bit longer. Besides that this thing is super fun. Perfect for the upcoming holidays! See if you can get it to jump as high as the top of the tree. The car is super rugged for how small it is. I am glad they took into account that it is going to be slamming into the side walls and of course flying when they designed it. Overall pretty rugged. Get another car to charge so you can play longer.Pros:+ Fast+ Rugged+ Fun+ Easy to setup and get goingCons:- Battery life is 10 minutes or so- Car is a bit hard to control, but that is because if it steered the linkage would almost 100% for sure break.Overall this is a fun set for you and your kids to play with.

"Overview:Ok lets say I love this software! For the past year I have been putting all of my family history on Ancestry. It has been pretty good with regard to finding details out that I might not know. The main issue I have with Ancestry is the monthly cost. With this software you get 3 months deluxe US, which is almost 2x the cost of this product, for that alone its worth it.Reports:(+)So what makes this software so great? The reports mostly. I have one branch of my tree go back to 1060. Thats more than can be shown on any tree available from Ancestry. The farthest you can go on the web is around 3 generations not 25 generations. With the reporting tools on this software you can get a variety of reports that flesh out your family. Ones such as marriage report listing whom everyone was married to. A generation report listing who was born under whom. Honestly there are too many to list here, each one is a very unique way to view a part of the story.Seamless integration with Ancestry:(+)I lost not a single bit of data transferring it from the web down to my computer. All I did was log into ancestry from Family Tree Maker and it drew down all of the data in a GENCOM file. Once in the software it populated a local database with over a years worth of work. With my personal experience this was pretty great.Trees:(+/-)Along with reports the trees available are all great tools for showing your family. I mean the software is Family Tree Maker it should also print out the trees. It does with some great designs. Unfortunately the trees on the software are also limited. I believe you can go back max 6 generations but then it stops. The designs are pretty good to show different relationships. Overall I would have liked more generations, knowing the tree would be physically huge but that is what I want to show.Manual: (-)Holy cow! This is the most convoluted huge tome I have seen in a very long time for a manual. My advice; skip it. Nice effort on their part to add it but it makes even opening the box a daunting appearing task that might scare more users than help them.Summary: (+/-)If you are a versed internet user/ computer operator you can expect this software to perform as an essential at-home addition to the work you have done on Ancestry. If you are just starting out on this journey it might be better for you to use the website first and then start using the software. Their website has much of the same interface and use along with other family members you may not know providing key pieces to your tree. I dont think of this as a solo tool but instead as an augmentation of another (Ancestry). As that, it excels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18YI878UCY99B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP7AP7C#wasThisHelpful","R18YI878UCY99B","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantastic!This hoover is one of the most powerful hoovers I have used in a long time. Matter of fact when its in the low carpet setting the suction is so strong I cant slide it across the carpet. Not sure if that is a good or a bad thing. I am guessing over time it will mellow out. But for now I cannot run it in low mode on a 1/8 inch thick area rug because the suction is so strong. Besides that there are some really nice features that this vacuum brings.1. Hardwood floor setting. - This is handy in my house because we have almost 100% hardwood flooring in the house. It turns off the brushes (sometimes - read below)2. Cord winder. I had the next tier down from this one and it did not come with a winder. This one has a nice winder in it (strong like bull).3. Pet and HEPA filters - Its amazing how fine of a dust you will see in the canister after use. Its the fine dust that it gets up that is so beneficial to those with allergies.Some pros and cons:Pros: + Easy to assemble - basically 1 long threaded cross head screw. - a bit tricky to line up sometimes + Ability to turn off the brushes + Super strong suction - I cant set this at lowest setting on my area rugs it wont move + Lots of accessories + Great Suck for a Buck ratioCons: - Sometimes its a real pain to get the hardwood mode to engage. Best trick I find is turn it off stand it up till it clicks, engage it then turn it back on - Hard to push on low carpet even with it set on high.

"The 3rd installment of Dead Rising made officially as an XBox One release day game, is full of issues. The story takes over as Nick and his friends look to escape the city infected with a mass zombie horde. The zombies in this game are slow and stupid, not nearly as silly as some like seen in World War Z or as incessant as the ones in Day Z. Now if you follow my YouTube channel you will see I am big Zombie fan. I did a whole series where I played some 30 zombie games. Getting this game for the Xbox One was almost a no brainer for me. I was soon disappointed with the game I got day 1.The main issues I have with this game are these. When you have a brainless slasher combat game you need simplicity of control.Often I would be fighting and accidentally hit a button that would throw my weapon away. Or when in the midst of combat I needed to eat some food the devs decided that picking up a bag of chips and then eating it should be 2 separate buttons. While from the outside it seems so common sense that it should be easy to remember, in the midst of combat its anything but intuitive and a real chore to remember the keys. Sure with enough muscle memory you might get it but its really difficult in the beginning. Ok so your amazing with muscle memory.Ignore that part of my review if you will. Instead the physics are laughable at best. Several times I would bump into another object to have my car explode and I flip no less than 300 times down the road to stand up unscathed. Once I bumped into a parked tow truck (a side rescue mission to clear out the zombies around this girl) The car became damaged but I kept on clearing out the Zeds.What happened next was hilarious if it wasn't so sad. The car blew up, I flipped 300 times in the air and flew into a building a block away. When I stood up I had killed all of the Zombies around the girl and every car in the area was on its roof.  Its not just when the car blows up that the physics are laughable its most things you hit/run into when driving.Shooting in this game seems a bit off too. Its hard to describe, but the camera angles are all wrong. You never get to really aim well. Its just a sloppy mess and your better off not using a gun at all.Pros:+ A day one zombie release for Xbox One+ Lots of carnage+ Silly situations are funCons:- Controller a mess (too many functions for a hack & slash game)- Camera following is terrible when shooting- Physics are atrocious with regard to explosions and damage- Feels really sloppy- Graphics are for Xbox 360Overall I was not happy with the gameplay/controls/physics. Also this is an obvious 360 game ported to the One. The graphics are decent at best. I realize its a release title and they didn't write it for the One but it still feels old.Recommendation:Skip this for now and get it in the bargain bin next year.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY15CWI1AVPLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB90AHA#wasThisHelpful","RY15CWI1AVPLR","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am an old D&D gamer and was curious which Pathfinder adventure I should have started with. Someone recommended this adventure to me. It is perfect mix of story, pace and combat to keep 4 brand new characters busy for at least a year. The biggest problem I have is trying to get the group to stop playing. Its got all 4 of them super jazzed about the next time we meet. Totally worth the price, for pro DMs and even new ones starting out.Here are some suggestions:>> Get the accompanying miniature set (get bases from Piazo they are cheap, dont buy the beastiary box just to get the bases.)>> Use Piazo's website to assist in each leg of the adventure. It will guide you as you go, especially if the party veers off track too far>>  Get a big whiteboard for maps.

"Ok enough with the puns. I have an older hoover upright animal and a dyson animal. Did I mention I have animals? Comparing these 3 products is not really equal. The Dyson is over 5 yrs old and the other hoover is over 1yr old. That being said the Dyson still performs as well as the newer hoovers. As far as this model I am really impressed with it. It does clean the carpets really well. I did the 2 pass test with this and the older hoover. I vacuumed a room with the previous model, then went back over it with this one. I got almost 2x as much dirt in the canister as with the previous hoover and this was me vacuuming the room in sequential fashion.Pros:+ very powerful and works well on hard wood floors.+ Setting below low carpet makes bare floors easy+ nice accessoriesCons:- older model had power button this has a switch half way down the body in the back behind a door next to a leopard.- no auto retracting cord (Previous model had it)Overall its a really good vacuum with a high bang for the buck value.Thanks for reading my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTKAV26UVY0CU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BC00QVK#wasThisHelpful","RTKAV26UVY0CU","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been tattooing one way or another for 18 years. I took a break about 10 years ago and decided to recently get back in the game the ""right"" way.I am apprenticing under an old friend of mine that is now running a very successful studio. He recommended I get an inexpensive kit to start off with. This book was included with the kit I bought. Good thing too, it by itself is over 1/3 the cost of the kit. All I have to say is it is well worth the money. Being involved with tattooing for as long as I have, as a client and apprentice and hang about, I have seen some real bad examples of hubris and downright hatred of people not going in the way they did.What I mean is, an artist will almost always say they magically apprenticed first and never once tattooed themselves or anyone before becoming an official apprentice. This is basic BS, which CR Jordan points out almost immediately. As soon as I read that I felt comfortable enough to understand this guy is on MY side and not about to throw some old school boys club mentality at me. Instead this book is a wonderful guide to get the basics out of the way when thinking about jumping in the business.This book will NOT make you a tattoo artist. It will NOT get you a job. It will NOT teach you everything how to run a tattoo shop. It WILL give you the basic lingo and methods so that when you do go in for a job you sound informed and educated. That is what most artists want from their apprentice. They want to see that you are willing to go out and learn on your own enough of the basics so they can talk to you; ""Hey man, grab me a 5RL, 7 Mag and a couple of barrels"". After you finish this book you will know what they are talking about.It gives you the confidence to feel you can handle the basics in the shop and the confidence of your teacher that he doesn't have to spend months getting someone off the ground.Overall I have never read a better book in the intro to tatooing than this. I have several old books from Huck Spaulding and others that look pretty and have very little info. CR Jordan puts the rubber to the road and gets you running fast.Highly recommended!Thanks for reading my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37U47HHDXV6QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615281478#wasThisHelpful","R37U47HHDXV6QZ","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have 2 Macintosh Laptops that are getting a bit long in the tooth. I decided to test this drive out on Windows 7 as I have 8 drives hooked to this PC and had plenty of choices to benchmark against. Upon removal from the box I noticed it now looks much different than other reviews have shown (excellent video reviews by the way). Anyway the case is now changed appearance and is much smaller and compact. One thing to note there is still a standard SATA port that connects the main body to the base. Removing the main body is easy just hold the base down and pull up gently. It removes very easily.I have uploaded a graphic to show just how well it performs vs an internal SSD, and an external HDD. The numbers do not mean anything other than its nice to see just how well this drive performs. Because it is so fast I highly recommend it for use as a media drive, backup drive (Windows Backup and Mac Time Machine). It  is quiet and has a nice light white glow as it operates.If you flip through the graphics above look for one with my Geekasurus logo on it to see the various benchmarks.Pros:+ Installs easily+ Finish is that of flat black slightly rubberized (no fingerprints)+ Can be formatted for Mac or PC+ Super fast USB 3.0 Speeds (see graphic)Cons:- Did not come with thunderbolt cable as mentioned in other reviews. Just 3.0 which is fine, just thought I would mention it.- USB 3.0 connector is not standard shape on the base side, meaning you cannot get a longer cord cheaply and will need to purchase one that is made by Seagate (really?)Overall the cons are not really all that bad and as it stands this is a great 3000 GB drive that is only marginally more than a barebones drive without the external case and SATA.

"I set this up according to the manufacturers instructions. One thing I did was use a GPS to mark the path I tried wearing this pedometer. I did a simple 1 mile walk. The GPS marked 1 mile traveled, this pedometer was over 300 feet off. While this is not major the long term use would lead to a significant difference. You can adjust it and I am sure with more fiddling you would get it right.Pros:+ Can upload the data to your PC+ Easy to use and install+ large numbers make it easy to readCons:- as stated would take some fiddling to get it right.Overall I think its a good solution for some people.

"I am on a low carb high fat diet. Because of this I am limited in the breads I can make. Mostly they have a ton of eggs in them.

"The build quality of this dolly is really good. I do have one small complaint that I will mention below but overall its a fantastic device for amateur video producers. The design is really strong, you can tell that this was made by a company that thought of many issues that video creators face while trying to shoot. The wheels can be rotated in several different ways. Because of this you can go from a straight dolly to a panoramic with no tools or any major fiddling with it. Just look at the top of the device and it tells you which way to set the wheels to do what you are trying to do.Pros:+ Well made high quality+ Easily adjustable with no tools+ can install cameras and different mounts via the central adapter+ Wheels are smooth and quiet (didnt pick up any noise on mic camera).+ well thought out!Cons:- This one is more a problem of physics. When you take the feet off of your tripod and put them into the round parts of this dolly you cannot extend the tripod to max height. If you do the small size of the dolly makes your tripod extremely tippy and you risk smashing your expensive camera on the ground. This can happen with the tiniest pebble or dirt hanging up the wheels.  I almost lost my camera 3 times trying to use the dolly to do a pan while the tripod was at eye height.This is just a warning and not a major issue with the dolly. If you intend on using your tripod with this you will need a shelf or table at waist height to roll this across. I applaud the multiple uses for this, tripod at full height is not one of them apparently.Thanks for reading my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZBW6ZPZ9NBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009X2OS72#wasThisHelpful","RIZBW6ZPZ9NBX","A1KKE6VX8VPWZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KKE6VX8VPWZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am usually not a fan of anything wireless when referring to a gaming peripheral. The reason for this is you may be in the middle of a part of a game that if you lose the peripheral you will lose the match/game/raid... whatever. I kind of feel the same way about this headset, other than talking might not be as critical as hearing. Most assuredly not as critical as a mouse and keyboard.The installation was a bit of a pain if you generally dont read instructions (like most guys). I recommend reading the instruction manual for sure. There is one minor issue I have and Ill list it below.Pros:+ Comfortable+ No cord means you can move your head freely during game time.+ Good sound+ Decent microphoneCons:- Headphones do not operate via USB. This is a wireless only headset. As I mentioned above if you are gaming and the batteries run out, you would think you could plug it in to use it as last measure. I could not and that bugs me more than anything.

"About 2 months ago we shifted our diet to low carb high fat diet. Because of this it is tough sometimes to find products with high levels of saturated fats. If your wondering what I am talking about watch Fat Head. The more fats in the diet the better for you. Now to the coconut oil. You dont need much so when you first get this product you may be suprised that almost 1/3 of the container is empty. It is because as the oil condenses it shrinks a bit. There is a full 16oz in there but like with a bag of chips this settles after packaging.Pros: + Lots of good fats that are healthy for you + Melts easily + Does not add any flavor to the cooking (in case you were worried that all of your foods would taste like coconut, it doesn't)Cons: - They should have used a smaller container.

"I like Zevia sodas - be warned they are an acquired taste, though.  The stevia is super sweet tasting at first, but not long after, you get used to it.  It's like switching from diet coke to real coke, or from diet coke to coke free...when the sweetener used changes, it takes a bit to acclimate to the new flavor and then you're good.Anyhow, the reason I took off 2 stars is because while I was willing to put up with some flavors I didn't like as much, I didn't realize how many of the flavors have caffeine in them.  I'm used to natural sodas being caffeine free, since it's a terrible additive!  I don't drink anything with caffeine in it, it makes me jittery and sick to my stomach, so finding that 4 of the flavors are actually caffeinated was a disappointment.  Maybe if I'd looked closer at the flavors/ingredients I would have seen this in advance, but thought I'd post here so someone else who doesn't like caffeine won't make the same mistake I did.Update:  So, I finished all of the sodas and want to report 1) that caffeinated sodas don't have a ton of caffeine in them.  If I drink a diet coke with caffeine, I am woozy and sick to my stomach.  I didn't experience that after drinking the caffeinated Zevias.  And also, I noticed they now have other variety pack options with only caffeine free drinks, so you don't have to buy 24 of just one flavor.  I'm trying the fruit mix next, which has 4 different fruit flavored sodas, all of which are caffeine free.  So, I added a star back for those two reasons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QCYIYDFFZI3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZK6KUUY#wasThisHelpful","R2QCYIYDFFZI3O","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wrote a long review only to have it censored because I used a four letter word with an asterisk.  This novel is disgusting.  Alex, the ""hero,"" is a total hypocritical arse who deflowers a drunk girl just out of the schoolroom one night, but no worries because she was a serving girl or learning to be a whore...so he thinks since he doesn't really talk with her first.  Of course, she's really a young lady who followed a friend to a ball and was fed spiked punch and then abandoned by her friend and the man who talked them into going.  So basically, the heroine, ""Charlotte,"" was raped (drugged with alcohol and taken advantage of, even if she ""enjoyed"" it).  Fast forward many years and Alex is back in England after his father died and is now an Earl.  He sees Charlotte at a ball and decides instantly that he will marry her, but doesn't realize she's the girl from the party.  She does, and brings it up several times, but neither of them asks or gives details, because of course that would end the book right there, and we can't have that.  Instead, they stupidly grope along - he pursues her, seducing her whenever he can and finally convinces her to marry him.  She, after hearing his story about how his first wife was a ""whore"" because she slept around before marrying him, didn't think it was important to straighten out their past with him.  No, instead, after they make love on their wedding night, she has to comment, ""oh that didn't hurt like the first time.""  Why? Because if she didn't, they couldn't have the next part of the book where he calls her a whore and says disgusting and terrible things to her that he can never take back.  He then abandons her and tells her he's going to dump her in the wilds of Scotland instead of continuing to Italy where they were supposed to Honeymoon.  He then forces her to ride in the ""third coach"" with the servants and rides on ahead to his estate there.He has time to think about everything and decides that she must have slept with his twin brother, and only once, so he can live with that, and then looks forward to ""forgiving"" her and treating her like his own private whore...I mean, wife.  Who cares, same thing to him.  She arrives and gives him the cold shoulder for ONE DAY and then....he realizes his error and apologizes for all the horrible things he said, and when she brings up this night they slept together he lets her finish for once and realizes SHE is the girl in the garden and he get down on his knees to beg her forgiveness.  Nope, he tells her in a condescending way that he will overlook her sleeping with his brother and not set her aside, but that she will sleep with him whenever he wants or else.  Yes, that's right, he threatens to ruin her name and set her aside if she doesn't sleep with him!  RAPE, again.  So, then, she says fine, but lays there like a dead fish.  He doesn't want her that way, and when he can't get a rise out of her, he goes to leave.  Whew.  Glad that horrible scene is over.  Except it's not.  SHE calls him back, asks what's wrong.  She was trying to act like a lady, since he said she behaved like a whore before.  He told her he only said those things in anger because someone else had ""conquered"" her first, but now he's over that and she can be a whore all she wants, but only with him.  Does she throw him out for his callousness?  Does she tell him to go to hell?!?!  NO!  She acts the whore (her words) and they have lots of sex.  All is well.  Then he has to go off for some trip and of course, she is pregnant but doesn't realize it, his twin brother comes home, you see what's coming.  He goes off again accusing her of being a whore with his brother and getting pregnant...ugh.  He doesn't even bother to ask her, no he just ASSUMES it's true.  This is the worst ""romance"" novel ever.  If you like RAPE, followed by RAPE, and a lot of demeaning verbal abuse in between, then by all means have at this novel.  Otherwise, avoid it like the plague and seek out a writer who treats her women with a modicum of respect.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31EKB2E1VJLXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440234565#wasThisHelpful","R31EKB2E1VJLXU","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a pair of Howsers with a quilted nylon exterior that I love, but are getting scruffy after a year of use (I can't go barefoot, so I have a pair of indoor only slippers that I wear EVERY day, all day in the house).  So, I ordered this pair thinking it would be the same, but with a cooler exterior finish.  They look just as nice in person as on the website and fit perfectly, EXCEPT for one major issue:  The top of the shoe where you see some sheepskin sticking out?  Well, it ""tucks"" under when you put it on your feet.  You *could* take about 10 seconds every time you put them on, digging your finger in and straightening that out, I suppose, but I want a shoe I can slip on and wear without hassle.  So, I'm sending them back and ordering another pair of the quilted nylon kind.

"Reading through the negative reviews, I saw a lot of people say these shoes are hard to get on unless you have flat feet, and that there was no arch support.  I have flat feet, and I have been moving toward barefoot shoes (or at least ones that don't have a giant arch support in them), so they are perfect for me.  I have been walking around in them for a while now and feel like they are comfortable, with cushion in the heel, but definitely NO arch support.  My feet will be doing the work, which is how I like it.  If you want or need arch support in your shoes, I don't think you'll like these, but for me they are great.  Also, the style is attractive from the top and the side, and they add about an inch to your height (important for us shorties).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197PGG1RFMTL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ALYB446#wasThisHelpful","R197PGG1RFMTL9","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find it incredibly hard to get past a plot in which the hero takes a woman who has suffered a terrible ordeal, and he uses her vulnerable state to exact some sort of revenge on her for her past behavior.  It's reprehensible and in no way could it possible result in the hero and heroine falling in love, because once she found out what he did, she would (rightfully) never forgive his callousness.  So, there was no point for me to read further.  I *hate* it when an author allows a heroine to forgive treatment that is reprehensible all in the name of love.  Sorry, no man who would do that to a woman could ever be considered a hero in my mind, and no woman who would overlook that terrible treatment would have a happy ending with him.And I would add that I *might* have been able to overlook this terrible plot if the writing had been anything other than DULL, BORING and PLODDING.  I think the Drake character deserved a much better story than this.

"I've been using Retainer Brite on my Invisalign night guards for years, but I've noticed that they don't ""fizz"" as much as they used to and they are also quite spendy compared to this product.  So, I thought I'd give CleanGuard a shot based on the reviews here at Amazon.  I've been using them now for several weeks and I think they do a good job.The instructions say to use 2 tablets, but I only use one.  I like the fact that you can leave your guard in the solution all day.  With the RetainerBrite, if I don't take it out after the 15 minutes, I feel like it leaves a slimy coat on it and I have to really rinse it off afterwards.  I don't find that is the case with the CleanGuard. I also like that it fizzes more - it may just be a visual, but it feels like it's really working to remove the germs etc. on the guard.People aren't kidding when they say the cap is *VERY* hard to get off.  Especially the first few times.  My advice:  find a flat, thin piece of metal (a blunt knife, or letter opener, or ruler even) and use that to wedge the cap off.  It will save your poor fingernails a lot of pain =).  Second, once you have it off, don't push it back down the entire way - leave a little space so it's easier to get off next time.Bottom line:  both products work well, but CleanGuard is much less expensive so I'm sticking with it as long as that's the case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS33P12Q7IHLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNXIDH6#wasThisHelpful","RS33P12Q7IHLX","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes I will hear a song and I can listen to it over and over and over again and it never gets old and it just makes me FEEL something that I like.  Do you ever find a song like that?  A million years ago in college, it was Lita Ford's ""Kiss Me Deadly.""  I have no idea what it was about that song, it's not my typical music at all, but I couldn't get enough of it.  There have been just a few others since then, and this is one of them.I love the lyrics even though they are a bit depressing, they are just so true.  ""Love is a polaroid/Better in picture/But never can fill the void.""  And so playful, too, ""I am a head case/I am the color of boom/Thats never arriving/And you are the opera/Always on time and in tune/And I am the color of boom.""  Who doesn't want to be the color of boom?  And how many of us Operas are moths to the flame of someone like that?  We Gregs want our Dharma,  Chuck Bartowskis want our Sarah Walkers, it's the classic case of opposites attracting.  But it's always better in pictures, isn't it?I can totally picture this being used by a SYTYCD choreographer for a mash-up piece with ballerinas and hip hop dancers.  I mostly buy music to workout to, and create a lot of my own Zumba-like or dance aerobic routines.  After a few times goofing around with them, I generally have a set routine down, but with this song I can't stop myself from just dancing.  It inspires my imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UUPTF612KVHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVZ29ZM#wasThisHelpful","R2UUPTF612KVHK","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Does anyone remember when Sarah McLachlan wrote a song from pieces of an obsessed fan's letters?  Well, I like imagine Britney put this one together from her ""team"" telling her to get off the crazy train and get back to making them all tons of money.  She's like you want to live the high life?  You have to work hard for it (at your job).  You want an amazing body?  Also, lots of work (in the gym or track or on the bike, whatever you do).  And this might be depressing, because let's face it, many people work their arses off, but don't live like Britney Spears, but it's also empowering - when you are working toward a goal, it's uplifting.  And then she talks about not letting the sh*t get her down, ""Hold your head high, fingers to the sky/They gonna try to try ya', but they can't deny ya'/Keep it moving higher, and higher..."" and so on.

"As a song to listen to for working out, this is great.  My one complaint is the lyrics.  So, it's about a guy who is out and about a lot and everywhere he goes there are beautiful women he's drinking with who have ""long long legs"" and great asses and are willing to go home with him, but ""nah nah honey, Im good/I could have another but I probably should not/I got somebody at home,/And if I stay I might not leave alone.""  Yeah yeah, what a great guy for being true to his lover....BUT, I just don't like this idea that he's looking and an extra drink would be responsible for his cheating?  Call me crazy, but I might admire a fine physique on a man (or woman for that matter), but when I'm with someone I love, I honestly don't think about other men that way.  I know we're all wired differently, but the lyrics just started to irritate me.  Let me put it this way - if he posted this to his girlfriend, telling her what a stand up guy he is, would she be thrilled and think he's a romantic, or would she get pissed how much he's talking about other women's body parts?  I would say the latter.

"I am a longtime Keen fan and have a pair of leather Newports that are just getting too scuzy, even though they still work awesome as shoes.  I tried to find another Newport, but in my size, neither Amazon or Zappos had them and besides paying full price and then some to make custom ones on the Keen site, I didn't see a style/color I really liked.  So, when these Whispers went on sale on Amazon, I thought what the heck and bought them.  It's a pretty style - the straps are smaller than the Newport and these are nylon on neoprene, not leather.  It took me a ltitle while to get used to the feel of the little straps on my feet but now I don't even think about it.  I have always been a size 8 in Keens even though I'm an easy 7.5 in all other shoes.  The keens are just a fraction too short on my feet, so I go a size up and thus the 8's always swim a little on my feet, but are still comfortable.  Overall, I really like these sandals and they are my go to shoe for this summer.  The purple color really pops, too.  My only complaint is minor - the elastic cords are way too long.  I know I can take apart the plastic mechanism and cut them, but that's a lot of work and tends to scrape up the plastic.  I wish they just made them shorter for women's styles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLIG6VMZHKFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG85E8S#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLIG6VMZHKFZ","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, the jury is still out on these.  Fit is very good - and so far they've been fine for my workout classes.  Based on some of the other reviews, I thought that they would have more padding on the sole.  They do have a nice ""elastic"" stitch over the top of the arch, which I think helps with support.  It's too soon to say if they will last.  Overall, for the money I paid, I think they were a good choice, but I may spend more next time and look for better padding.  One thing I did note that is negative - these socks get more than damp with sweat when I workout.  I'm not a sweaty foot person, and none of my other socks do this.  I'm not sure if they don't breathe well enough, or what the deal is, but as long as I don't have to put the socks on again (for example, after RIPPED I take them off for yoga, then have to put them back on to walk home), it doesn't really bother me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UPNTVHVA2GZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOMS18Q#wasThisHelpful","R1UPNTVHVA2GZW","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to like these.  They looked good on my feet, although the laces were pretty wide (i.e. the shoe seemed on the narrow side).  I have a pair of Merrell barefoot cross trainers, but the style was discontinued, so I got these as I wanted a mostly black pair (my other ones are bright blue).  However, after wearing them around the house for an hour, I had incredible pain in my feet.  There is a high arch in the shoe, which pushes into the inside of your foot and if you don't have an arch to match it, I think that's when you get the pain I was feeling.

"When I saw the pilot way back when, I loved it and was so thrilled Amazon greenlit the series.  Now, all I can say is, ""Amazon, when is the second season coming?""  This season is well done, and Titus Welliver is amazing as Harry Bosch.  I had to take off one star because of multiple WTF moments where you as the viewer can't believe the stupidity of the actions of supposedly seasoned cops or of the plot line.  The political machinations are also a bit far-fetched.  SPOILER ALERT - don't go further if you don't want to read about key aspects of the season.  The series points out several times about how the press and 24/7 coverage can impede an investigation or even convict (in public opinion) innocent people surrounding a crime.  And yet, it supposes that if a camera man goes along on a screwed up police outing, the DA can just confiscate the memory card and that would stop it from getting out.  Hello.  The camera man would never give up the only copy that easily, except that he knows there's a cloud backup...which he then gives up just as easily to the deputy police commissioner?!?  He would've made a copy for himself.  That's a big flaw.  Not to mention that EVERYONE would be asking, where's the footage?  You couldn't keep the fact that there was a camera there secret, and then the news story would be, ""DA steals memory card in an attempt to cover up his giant screw up.""  And then there is the fact that Waits killed a man after his escape, then he killed a store clerk, killed a male prostitute and a female prostitute, but it was only after he kidnapped a new mother that the Chief of Police puts all available cops on the case to track him down?  That's crazy too.  Once they had the lead about the boy's home, they would have had a slew of cops combing the files and they would have found the killer's file in a day instead of the long, drawn-out process that it took with only a few people looking.  And same thing with the car the killer was driving.  They can't see the license plate, but they could easily look up all the gold minivan's owned by little old ladies (his mother) and narrowed it down that way.  And my biggest WTF is the fact that Harry Bosch's psych profile was leaked to a reporter and there was no investigation or complaint filed?  First, there are only a few people who would have access to that file to leak it, so it wouldn't be hard to find who did it.  It's not like any cop in the area can get his confidential psych records, so the fact that Pounds or whatever his chief's name is, wasn't immediately fired is just stupid.  Second, Harry Bosch could sue the department this way and that for not protecting his confidential information.  All this hub-bub is made of his rookie girlfriend filing a bogus harassment case against him to save her job, but Harry, who has been violated by a senior officer through this leak, can't do the same?  It's absolutely ridiculous.But, having pointed out all that (and I'm sure there are more), I still loved the series.  The actors are all top notch and the setting, the mood, everything pulls you in and keeps you engaged.  I can't wait to dissect the next one =).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N49VVC756202/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3MPDP4#wasThisHelpful","R3N49VVC756202","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a sucker for dystopian future  novels, and I decided to listen to this one on audiobook after seeing a movie came out and thinking I might want to watch it (I never watch a movie based on a book without reading the book first).  I just couldn't get past the inconsistency of the premise.  SPOILER ALERT - don't read further if you don't want to know plot points and events that happen in the book.  First, we're thrown into the world of the Maze without any background, and most of the book is spent in this universe, so you would think it had some meaning, or larger purpose.  But no, we find out at the end that it was an ""experiment"" to test the subjects, in anticipation of them doing something in the disastrous world that remains.  Ok, so I'm cool with that, but WHAT was the point of the maze?  What was the point of killing them off?  What was the purpose for keeping them there for over two years?  It all seems stupid and pointless.  And apparently, the boys were chosen because they tested as extraordinarily smart, but it takes them TWO YEARS to figure out the maze makes a LETTER each day?  It takes them over TWO YEARS to figure out that the WICKED on the side of the creatures who threaten them stands for World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department?  I mean, come on!  They boys all come across as INCREDIBLY STUPID instead of the geniuses they are supposed to be.  And the whole point of the serum given after being stung by a WICKED beast is never really explained.  If these boys are your future hope, why are you poisoning them?  And my favorite instance of ""genius"" stupidity was where they enter the words into the computer to escape, kids are dying by the second and they can't freaking figure out that the last word PUSH means to PUSH a button?!?And then, they escape and get out, only half survive (technically less than half since many died before they even attempted the escape and only those who tried to escape are counted in that 40), and they come face to face with a woman scientist who clearly doesn't see them as human beings, one of their former cohorts who they thought was dead is clearly being mind-controlled and stabs Chucky, who is Thomas's ""little brother"" in spirit.  Does Thomas go crazy and attack the WOMAN who is clearly controlling the situation????  Nope, he attacks the clearly in pain and struggling boy who was forced to throw the knife.  What a crock!  He is supposed to be SMART and he acts like an idiot.  And finally, the whole ending where rebels break in and steal them away - even I could see it was just another part of the experiment.  How did the rebels know they broke out at that exact minute?  How did the rebels with their antiquated guns break in to a secure facility?  All of these obvious markers that it's just another ploy by the WICKED team, and yet none of our supposed geniuses even thinks about it.  Yeah, so, it just didn't fly for me.  I couldn't get past all of these glaring problems with the premise.  I rarely quit a series, but I just don't care what happens to these dimwit kids who can't figure the simplest crap out on their own.  You might argue that I'm an adult and this is meant for kids, but 1) I know 12 year olds who would agree with me about figuring everything out way ahead of the characters and 2) I would argue that this book's violence is way too mature for kids not in their teens at least.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B6A23PF6T32P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SRC2PO#wasThisHelpful","R3B6A23PF6T32P","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I listened to the novel on audiobook and was fascinated by the premise.  I like the author's elegiac take on an apocalyptic event and the aftermath.  I even liked they way she threaded her various characters around the celebrity actor whose death is the beginning of the end for North America, though at times I found myself saying, ""another tidbit about this dead guy...I want to know about the people who are still alive.""  But I do see how Arthur Leander stands in for good people who have gone astray in a world of materialism and excess, and also the crazy way in which charismatic charlatans become our ""false gods"" like the way Arthur's son, Tyler, becomes a prophet based on misreading the bible and creating a new religion based on a comic book written by Arthur's first wife.  It's a very subtle indictment of our society while also mourning its loss at the same time.But, there are two issues that really irked me.  Other reviewers have commented on the inability of the remaining population to reestablish modern living conditions.  I also found this incredible.  No one tried to reestablish power in 15 years?  Did all the satellites fall from the sky and all the fiber optic cable get cut when people died of the flu so that cellular service disappeared overnight?  That's crazy.  The infrastructure didn't collapse - the population did.  Resources would be bountiful and it would be a matter of locating ideal places in the world where smaller versions of culture could be maintained by those who are left.  At the very end of the novel - 20 years since the flu - a settlement has lights.  It would never have taken that long.  Even if every electrician died in the outbreak, library books exist and people can learn how to work the system.  It's ridiculous to think that a flu epidemic would force a dark ages.And finally, I have a beef with any novel that just ends.  What happens to Jeevin?  What about the city of lights?  What ever happened to Miranda, who we last left in the beach dying of the flu...or did she?  What about those ships that were all off shore and so not impacted by the flu?  What did they do for 15 years?  What about the pilots who left and didn't t return?  And our main characters stories are clearly not through.  There must be another novel in the works to finish their story.  I'm so sick of trilogies and what not that don't bother to give you a complete read in each novel.  There should be a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Anything else is sloppy.Having said all that, I still really liked the novel and will read the next one if/when it comes out because I'm invested in the characters.  But, I have to say there is another story from this same premise that is so much better.  I hope some other aspiring writer will write it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCY5IQTYUCC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353308#wasThisHelpful","R3CCY5IQTYUCC0","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need some logic in your romances, then the set up for this novel will have you pulling your hair out with the stupidity of it.  First, I doubt it's even possible for a husband to leave his life insurance and other benefits to someone other than his spouse and child.  The child has RIGHTS to support from a parent.  Then, when the person who was left the money comes to give it back (and I just cringed at how much TAXES the wife would have to pay because her husband left it to someone else), she REFUSES based on some utterly stupid need to ""stand on her own.""  WTF???  I stopped listening right then.  NO MOTHER who is not absolutely CRAZY would deny their child the money that should have rightly been his.  Any sympathy I might have had for her was gone at that point, so I couldn't care less what happened to her.  Books like this one are what make reader scoff at the notion of ""Romance"" fiction.  It was lazy and sloppy and just plain stupid.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NRZSRIGW8KTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HBH8BE#wasThisHelpful","R1NRZSRIGW8KTL","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the larger size of the Blue/Purple with White Flowers and the smaller size of the Pink/Yellow Geometric Circles.This product was SO EASY to install.  I measured my windows, measured and marked my lines on the clear plastic that is attached to the film, and cut my pieces.  I cleaned the window first, as the instructions said.  Then I spritzed the whole window (this is the key part - use a spritz bottle and don't be stingy!), unpeeled my piece and voila.  I just smacked the whole thing on, lined up the top straight and smoothed it out with my hands.  Used a towel to wipe up the excess water that comes out the sides and bottom.  SO EASY.  Anyone who says it is hard is NOT using water!  I didn't even need a squeegee - just used my hands and the towels to work out any air bubbles and in about an hour, checked and the window was dried and the vinyl on perfectly.My only con is that I wished the colors on the Blue/Purple one were a little more vibrant.  I feel like they are somewhat muted compared to the pictures shown on Amazon, and also to the other style (pink/yellow circle design), which are much brighter and really pop in the sunlight.  But, both styles are beautiful and I've received several compliments on them already.  As for letting the light in, these do that well.  We have much needed privacy now and no longer have to look at our neighbors junk and ill-kept yard, but without sacrificing the sunlight.I have some pictures to post, and I will try to figure out how to do that...when I hit the link I get a 404 code.Bottom line, very pleased with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HMPOFZOUNHT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU20H6Q#wasThisHelpful","R1HMPOFZOUNHT2","A1H0P7ESJE2109","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H0P7ESJE2109?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I will probably keep it since I really need help teaching my daughter time telling right now, but otherwise I'd been sending it back.  Look carefully for a PLASTIC durable version that has gears.

"Christmas in Cornwall for the whole family might not be something which appeals to every one but Anna and Mike want their family to have one last Christmas together before they go their separate ways as they have decided to divorce so they have rented a large country house for the holiday period.  Thea and her brother and sister, Jimi and Emily are not keen on seeing their parents split up especially as they seem be getting on so well but they are willing to enjoy the holiday.  Thea is still recovering from splitting up with Rich after their relationship went wrong and she needs something to take her mind off it and help her to start afresh - could handsome Sean be the one to help her get back on her feet?This is an entertaining and heart warming story about a family group snowed in for Christmas with two uninvited guests - Charlotte and Alec - wished on them through force of circumstances and a few crossed wires. I enjoyed the mix of generations and the quite distinctive characters who make up the family.  I especially liked Thea herself and Anna her mother.  Emily is a little annoying with her constant worrying about everything.  Charlotte is larger than life with a lack of tact to match.Even if it isn't Christmas yet this is a feel good story which can be read at any time of year with plenty of laugh out loud moments, lots of banter and a few poignant moment to leaven the mix a little.  If you want cheering up and reminding of the annoying things as well as the good things about family life then this would be a good book to read.  The characters are interesting lively and believable and the tensions between family members is very well done.If you had mentally classified Judy Astley as a writer of chic lit then you might need to adjust your thinking as this is a family story with all ages represented plenty to entertain and amuse whatever your age.

"I thought I would enjoy this book but unfortunately it contains characters who are so dislikeable I didn't really care what happened to any of them.  I liked the idea; a house where someone has just died and where his family have come back to clear out the house and hear how he has left his property in his will.  There are ghosts as well as live people in the house and we hear from all of them about what happened to them in the past  in each room and what is happening now.So far so good - I like the idea - it is a little bit quirky and the ghosts have an interesting existence.  But there the good bits end as far as I'm concerned.  The ghosts don't seem to have learned anything about themselves and what went wrong in their lives and the live people are so dysfunctional the word might as well have been coined to describe them.There is Caroline, the alcoholic and child-like estranged wife of the late owner of the property; her children Trenton - physically damaged in a car accident and well on the way to serious mental problems and Minna who is basically a nymphomaniac from whom no man is safe from the undertaker to the delivery man.  Then there is Minna's young daughter, Amy who really seemed to me to be the sanest one of the lot but maybe she was too young to be anything else.I'm afraid I just wanted to shake the whole lot of them and tell them to sort themselves out.  I'm sure the book will appeal to other people but for me it did nothing at all.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDAC1VQ2FTWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062223194#wasThisHelpful","R2BDAC1VQ2FTWN","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Business is not actually booming for the detective agency or for the garage business and Mr J L B Maketoni can no longer afford to pay both his staff and Charlie has to go.  Precious has taken on a case that she is really not at all sure about and her assistant - now partner - Grace Makutsi has decided to open a caf.Will things improve for all the businesses concerned and can Precious solve the case of the woman who apparently has lost her memory without getting into trouble with the immigration authorities.  There are plenty of life lessons to be learned in this thoughtful but amusing episode in the life of the number 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.I do like this series which are really modern morality tales.  Yes the writing is simple and straightforward but how to get on with the other people in your life is the same however sophisticated and grown up you think you are.I didn't think this latest story was quite as good as previous ones but then sometimes they improve on second reading.  I always find them amusing with plenty of food for thought and insight into human behaviour and motivation,  If you want something gentle in the mystery line then you could do worse than read this. While it helps to understand the series characters if you've read previous books in the series they don't have to be read in order and can be read as standalone novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUEPUYA83PWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IA2E6S2#wasThisHelpful","R3LUEPUYA83PWA","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bill is a newspaper reporter.  His editor sends him to Wales to report on a vicar who has apparently had a great many affairs with parishioners and is on trial by the Church of Wales authorities. One person has already successfully challenged an article in another newspaper on the grounds that she didn't have an affair with the vicar and she refuses to have anything to do with any reporters now.  Bill needs a new angle on the story so he wonders whether the lady concerned will speak to him.The book reveals a network of lies and personal feuds as well as the manuscript of a novel which may have been based on a fair proportion of truth.  Who is lying and who is telling the truth and who is manipulating others for their own ends?  Can Bill discover a new angle on the case and keep his editor happy and what is the truth anyway?The book includes the story told in the novel as well as evidence given by the various witnesses in the case - both for and against the vicar - the Rev William Clifford.  I must admit I really liked Bill as a character though I wasn't too keen on some of the others though I don't think the reader is meant to like them.  What I found most interesting was the way the lies, truths and half truths are woven together and it is almost open to the reader to make up their own minds about what is truth and what isn't.Overall this is an enjoyable and interesting read though I found it quite frightening at times the way gossip and rumour - as well as truth - can very quickly distort reputations and destroy or radically change lives both for better and worse.

"This is a totally fascinating story of how gin has waxed and waned in popularity over the centuries.  From its origins in the Dutch drink 'genevra ' to modern 'limited edition' varieties.  I don't actually like gin myself but having read this book I wonder whether that is because I haven't yet found the right flavour.I did disagree with one statement in the book - that there is no scientific proof that gin makes drinkers depressed.  The only time I have drunk gin I felt very depressed afterwards in a way that no other form of alcohol had ever made me feel.  I'm willing to try it again to see if it still has that effect or whether it was a particular combination of circumstances which led to the depression.  I wasn't too keen on the taste either but I have learned from this book that there are many different flavours and combinations of flavours available.The book covers the early days of gin in England and how it became the drink of choice for many poor people.  There were many - largely unsuccessful - attempts by parliament to prevent the excessive drunkenness which plagued not just London but other cities.  Gin was cheap and could be produced by anyone with the equipment to do so because restrictions on who could produce it were largely ignored.From its heyday in the eighteenth century when Hogarth drew Gin Lane to gin's current popularity as the basis for all sorts of cocktails this is a roller coaster of a story taking in a great deal of social history which is fascinating to read.  There are brief histories of all the wel known distillers as well together with details of gin varieties currently available and distilleries which welcome visitors.If you enjoy reading social history - even if you don't like gin itself - this is an interesting read. It is well written in a lively and entertaining style and it is well researched too.

"The book is described by its author as a polemic.  It isn't only about women it is about bigotry and prejudice and about how those affect everyone in their daily lives.  It is about rigid gender roles and how they affect the choices of everyone.  Rigid roles affect those men who want to be nurses and carers just as much as they affect women who want to be engineers and airline pilots or computer programmers.  Rigid gender definitions of qualities and aptitudes stop people taking on the roles they as individuals are best suited for.The book talks about issues which many people hesitate to voice and it talks about people being individuals first and foremost before they are either gender - or somewhere in between.  It talks about cyberbullying, trolling and stalking and how it seeks to shut women up on the internet.  Women should not speak out about anything and need to be silenced because good women and girls - rather like children - should be seen and not heard.  To say you disagree with someone is to invite a tirade of abuse.  Freedom of speech is fine for everyone except women because if they exercise their right to free speech they are 'mouthy c . . s or whining women always moaning about something'.  Or there's nothing wrong with them which plenty of sex wouldn't cure. This sort of treatment on the internet - you rarely meet it in real life - makes my blood boil and it clearly does the same to the author.  Freedom of speech is a right but with it goes the responsibility not to abuse, insult or denigrate others.The book covers subjects such as the beauty industry and the celebrity culture and how it tries to impose certain rigid parameters on the appearance women and girls present to the world.  I must admit that having grown up in the 1950s and 1960s I realise I would hate to be growing up now.  There seems to be so much pressure on young women to look and behave in certain ways.  I wasn't conscious of this at all when I was growing up and differences were welcomed or at least tolerated far more than they are today.As well as focussing on women- she also looks at how men and boys are treated these days and finds they are not served well by stereotypes imposed on them.  Not all men want to be into violence and what tend to be thought of as traditional masculine stereotypes - real men don't cry and real men definitely don't do the housework.  Some men enjoy the housework and want to give vent to their feelings by crying. We need to be less rigid in our expected gender roles - in fact why have gender roles?  What is wrong with looking at people as individuals?I think for me one of the most frightening chapters was about sex and the internet and the way violent pornography is so much a part of it.  There are plenty of men in real life who are not interested in being violent towards women and yet so much of pornography contains violence towards women.This is an angry book as you might expect but it also contains plenty of references to other sources - comprehensive notes on each chapter and a bibliography.  It contains rather more uses of the F word than I am quite comfortable with but that is a personal preference.I think the sentence which made most impression on me is this one from close to the end of the book:'Feminism and radical politics are about demanding more than a choice between one type of servitude and another'That pretty well sums it up for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28HFZGH1E6LR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRDKH2G#wasThisHelpful","R28HFZGH1E6LR5","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book a little strange to say the least and it seemed more like a vehicle for the author to showcase her writing skills than any sort of story.  I felt there was perhaps a bigger more complex and potentially more interesting story trying to get out.A woman writer, who narrates the story such as it is, travels to Athens to teach on a writing course and the various people she encounters tell their stories - which may or may not be true.  Much of it is told by means of reported speech though at times this switches to dialogue for a short period and then back again.  I was most disturbed by the man she met on the flight out - referred to only as 'My Neighbour' throughout.  On the strength of a few hours on a plane she agrees to meet him later for a trip on his boat.My Neighbour appears several more times in the book and each time I found him slightly more sinister and the narrator's behaviour nave in the extreme.  Would you really go on a boat trip with a stranger?I thought the writing was good but I despaired of the story line because really there isn't one.  It's a series of conversations held together by the fact that each conversation features the narrator. Others may enjoy the book but I found it a little tedious and I couldn't work up any enthusiasm for the characters at all.

"The shelf wasn't quite as randomly chosen as the blurb for this book implies.  The author wanted to pick a shelf which contained one classic she wanted to read and no more than five books by any one author.  The shelf which went from LEQ - LES fitted her criteria and she embarked on reading the books contained on that shelf.  She decided that if there were five books by a particular author then she would only undertake to read three of them.  As the library she chose for her adventure in reading is a lending library she ran the risk of the shelf changing while she read but she managed to accommodate the changes.I found it a fascinating book to read as it didn't just cover the books she read but also took a look at libraries and how they decide what to keep and what to buy in the first place.  She discussed different formats of the various books and found that in some instances she found the format of the book got in the way of her enjoyment of it.  If the book was very old and tatty or was printed in a very small font it was easier and much more enjoyable to read an e-book version where there was nothing to get between the reader and the text.I particularly enjoyed the chapter on 'Phantom of the Opera' as it takes in not just the original text but film adaptations of the story as well as the musical versions.  I enjoyed the author's comments on literature in translation and how the translators desire to over inform the reader with a plethora of footnotes and explanations can interfere with the enjoyment of the text.  Nabokov apparently did this with his translation of A Hero of Our Time and the author turned to other translations which she found she could read with much more enjoyment.If you enjoy books about books then you will probably enjoy this one.  The author writes in an easy low key style and while she makes references to other more famous authors I think she succeeded admirably in her stated aim of reading outside the perceived canon of literature as taught in schools and universities.  I enjoyed the book so much that I even forgave the author her trenchant comments on mystery and crime novels  which are my particular favourites.  The book contains notes and an index.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N0RT13B9HZT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEU1Q6C#wasThisHelpful","R1N0RT13B9HZT5","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to make it clear from the start that this is a review of the book and does not contain my opinions on the case of the missing Madeleine McCann.  This is neither the time nor the place to express my opinions about what happened to her.The authors have aimed to produce an objective account of the evidence available to the public.  They do look at some of the theories current about the case but only in as far as they can be traced to individuals who have been reliably identified.  No of course they haven't covered everything which is in the public domain - that would take many thousands of pages.  As far as is possible I think they have succeeded in recounting known and verified facts.  They clearly interviewed a great many people in the process of researching the book and waded through a great deal of information and mis-information.What are the known facts about the case? Madeleine disappeared from the family's holiday apartment on the evening of May 3rd 2007.  She has not been seen since by anyone who is prepared to admit to seeing her.  No evidence has been found of her death - or of  her alive after that night.  That is really all that is known.  Many people saw suspicious looking strangers hanging around the apartment complex in the few days before Madeleine's disappearance.  None of those have been traced - as far as is known to the public.The police in Portugal did investigate the disappearance but mistakes were made which could have fatally compromised the investigation.  Mistakes were also made by the British police involved at the time. Probably the biggest mistake of all was to have so many people tramping all over the apartment immediately after Madeleine's disappearance.  The authors do say here this was probably only natural in the circumstances.  A child goes missing from an apartment so of course people search for the child in that apartment before the search moves outside.This is a well written book which covers such issues as the publicity generated for the case and the way the tabloid media especially have sailed rather too close to the edge of libel in what they have published at times. It also looks at how the internet facilitated the world wide publicity for the case and how this may have had a deleterious effect on the ultimate outcome of the case.This would be a good book to start with if you would like a summary of the case up to the point where Scotland Yard started their mammoth investigation.  It only covers the statements subsequently made by the investigation and does not speculate about what that investigation may or may not have discovered.The e-book edition contains working footnotes, a separate picture section with active links in the text to relevant pictures and an interactive index as well as links in the text to relevant web sites.  The full definitive account of this case remains to be written though it is made clear in this book that there is a great deal of information which remains unavailable to the public for obvious reasons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWKPUD3QU9ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M407EGM#wasThisHelpful","RYWKPUD3QU9ME","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Angela Marchmont is on holiday in Italy and has plans to go on to Venice when she receives a telegram from a friend who is married to the vicar of an English church elsewhere in Italy asking her if she can help with a problem.  Reluctantly Angela changes her plans and goes to see Mary.  Her husband, Jonathan believes a local spiritualist is enticing his congregation away from him and wants Angela to investigate.Angela is a little reluctant to get involved but decides it can't do any harm to book a consultation with Mrs Quinn and her daughter and perhaps to invent a dead husband for the occasion.  In the meantime Angela finds herself being introduced to many of the English community and being invited to social occasions.  She is staying in a very pleasant hotel and really quite enjoying herself.  Then she bumps into someone (literally) who she knows under another name.  Could it be that she retains a soft spot for an engaging villain?Humour, excellent characters and interesting plots are the main ingredients of this episode in the Angela Marchmont series.  This is a genuine Golden Age mystery - written in the nineteen twenties and only now being published by the author's family.  The book is well written, as are all of the books so far in this series.  If you enjoy authors such as Agatha Christie then you will probably enjoy this book and this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ2AY1VXZX3X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI0N6ZK#wasThisHelpful","RJ2AY1VXZX3X5","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Old age is regarded by many as something which happens to other people. We try and defy it by means of cosmetic surgery, dressing in the clothes we wore when young or in the latest fashions aimed at people in their twenties. Once they are over fifty many people report that they are invisible to most others and disregarded. The world seems to be organised round the young and the old and infirm are regarded as an unnacceptable drain on everyone's resources.But are there other ways of looking at old age? Having reached my seventh decade and starting to think that maybe I ought to investigate the subject, I find that I don't try and avoid my age. I'm a glass half full person and I look for the advantages and many of the writers quoted in this fascinating study and thought provoking study look for the advantages too. I have had many positive examples of old age from close relatives in my life so I tend to think of it in a different way. I live in an area where there are a high proportion of retired people and I am constantly presented with examples of people in their sixties, seventies or eighties getting around under their own steam and enjoying life apparently to the full.The author writes well and quotes many optimistic views of aspects of old age as well as many less optimistic views. Some even go so far as to say that anyone who can see good things about ageing much be morons or at the very least seriously deluded. This is a life affriming - and age affirming - book and it will cause anyone approaching their more mature years to examine their own hopes, views and fears of and for their own future. However it doesn't seek to gloss over the disadvantages and of course there are disadvantages to every age.There are notes to accompany the text and I'm sure many readers will find themselves launched on a journey of exploration into the subject of ageing and old age in literature, art, politics, sociology and psychology. If you want to find out how our leading writers, philosophers and celebrities have looked at old age - both good and bad - then read this book.

"Father Vincent Ross - a Catholic priest - finds himself in the middle of a scandal where he has actually done nothing wrong. He is accused of an inappropriate relationship with a parishioner. He is sent on a retreat to get him out of the way. He has also heard the confession of a man who claims to have killed the Bishop. But the confessional is sacrosanct and he can do nothing about it and in any case he doesn't know who it was. In an attempt to salvage his own reputation and his life he sets out to solve the crime and to find out exactly what is going on with some of his fellow priests.I started off being enthusiastic about this book - reading the first hundred pages very quickly but after that it somehow lost my interest. I think this may well be an interesting crime series and I will give the next one a chance when it comes out. The writing is excellent and I liked the characters though there were rather too many of them, in my opinion for a book this length. The flashes of humour were well done too.If you enjoy your crime novels with an unusual background then this may be one for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJ0NLMFGW0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IC93UT4#wasThisHelpful","RZJ0NLMFGW0X","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first part of a four part novel which is published between July and October 2014. If you don't like having to wait for the conclusion of a story I suggest buying all four parts before you start reading part one! In this episode, the reader is introduced to the characters and some of their back story but we are left wondering about precisely what it is that Martha wants to announce at her eightieth birthday party which will tear her family apart.I felt there were just too many characters in this episode to really assimilate. There is Martha and her husband, their three children and their significant others and their own offspring plus a few other people who are clearly going to play a bigger part in the rest of the story. I kept wanting to shout 'too much information'! All the characters have secrets both past and present and it looks as though the conclusion is going to be earth shattering when it finally comes.I liked some of the characters - Bill, the doctor for example, though I didn't take to his wife, Karen. I didn't like Daisy's daughter, Cat and thought she was bit flaky to say the least. I was intrigued by Florence and want to know more about her. This is the sort of book where you almost need to read with pencil and paper in hand so that you can jot down notes about the characters for future reference.I am sufficiently interested to read the rest of it but I think I shall wait until I can read all four parts straight through. I'm sure Harriet Evans' many fans will love it as will anyone who loves family sagas.

"Dulcie is studying for a doctorate and combining it with teaching a few students as well as poking her nose into mysteries which don't concern her aided by her affinity with felines. Worrying about whether her boyfriend, Chris, is really a Werewolf and why her friend, Trista, seems to have changed, Dulicie thinks she has seen a very handsome man dragged off the street one night by wolves. In attempting to run after him to try and rescue him she falls and hits her head. Everyone thinks she imagined it but Dulice knows what she saw.This experience leads to her attending a modern production of Ovid's Metamorphoses which leaves her even more puzzled and disturbed than before. Then there's her conversations with a dead cat - Mr Grey - which make her wonder what she's missing and whom she can trust. I wanted to shake Dulcie and try and make her get on with the work she should have been doing. In fact I completely shared her supervisor's exasperation!I'm sure others will enjoy this mystery but Dulice was too much of a flaky heroine for me. I could accept her conversations with cats but considering how well educated she was she seemed not to have very much common sense - or if she did she certainly didn't use it. It was an average read and I didn't actually get bored with it which is why I have given it three stars. It is the latest in a series so maybe if you've read all the others it becomes more enjoyable - unfortunately I didn't enjoy it sufficiently to want to read the rest of the series.

"This is an interesting academic study of how women's magazines have grown and developed in the digital age. It is mainly aimed at an academic readership with plenty of notes, a bibliography and quotes from other researchers in this and related fields.What I found most interesting about the whole book was the evidence which shows that the advent of the internet and the growth of online magazines has led to an increase in print sales as well. In fact print magazines and online magazines each fuel the growth of the other.Online magazines have resulted in even more interaction and communications with readers and consumers and presumably has resulted in magazines becoming more and more relevant to the lives of their readers and consumers.This is an interesting book for anyone who is interested in magazines in the digital age and in consumer issues in general.

"I enjoyed reading this memoir about the author's year working for a literary agency in New York. She'd just left university in London and returned home to the US and didn't want to live at home with her family so she needed to earn enough money to support herself and stay living with her boyfriend - and keep that knowledge from her parents. She got the job as assistant to what turned out to be the head of the agency and at first she just felt she was a glorified secretary but gradually the job got a hold of her and she found it fascinating.I thought her descriptions of office life were excellent. She highlighted something that I've come across in some offices in which I've worked - no one told her anything and unless she asked the right questions she had to struggle to work out how things were done. As you don't know what you don't know this often resulted in trial and error before she finally worked things out.Before she went to work for the agency the author had never read J D Salinger but she soon found out that he was their most prestigious client and there was a long list of dos and don'ts when it came to dealing with him. These were the only things she was told without asking. Early on she was given the J D Salinger fan letters to deal with and a stock letter which she was told to use to reply to them. Salinger himself did not want to see his fan letters. These letters started to haunt the author and she began to reply to them individually - with mixed results.There is something quirky and individual about this memoir and I really loved the way the author gradually came to understand things about literary life and found her original ideas about it were often totally wrong. I liked the glimpses into her home life too - the ramshackle apartment with no heating and no kitchen sink and her unsatisfactory boyfriend who was working on his novel. Recommended to anyone who enjoys biography or autobiography and anyone who is interested in learning about life in a literary agency.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZA9G82NKN5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR9DUDY#wasThisHelpful","RBZA9G82NKN5I","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A sparkling collection of short stories some of which feature Inspector Sloan and his sidekick, Crosby. Others feature an interesting character called Henry Tyler who works for the Foreign Office in the nineteen thirties and who regularly visits his sister, Wendy in Calleshire. I enjoyed them all and would be hard pushed to single out my favourites though I did particularly like the second story in the collection - 'The Hard Lesson' - about the stand-in teacher who unexpectedly manages to capture the class's attention.Another favourite was 'A Managed Retreat' - revenge at its most delightful. 'In the Family Way' was interesting for its family dynamics and 'The Language of Flowers' was extremely clever too. Altogether this is a marvellous collection of stories with plenty of twists just at the last moment when you think you've worked out what is going in.If you enjoy crime short stories then I would recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QP7BZL5234N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K22ZLQY#wasThisHelpful","R3QP7BZL5234N2","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The theft from a museum of a painting of no apparent worth together with a few small items from a display case leaves Sloan and Crosby baffled as there seems no motivation for the crime at all. Then someone sets fire to a house that used to belong to the subject of the painting and the plot thickens. The reader is taken into a dubious world of planning applications, disputed land ownership and threatened takeover bids before Sloan and Crosby manage to unravel both cases and solve the mystery.I love this series with it's wry humour and likeable police characters and this episode is well up to the author's usual standard. The books bear re-reading as I first started reading them back in the nineteen seventies and have re-read all of them more than once. If you like cosy crime series by authors such as Veronica Heley and Hazel Holt then try Catherine Aird.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBO2WE1KINUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFV5DMY#wasThisHelpful","R2UBO2WE1KINUB","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then there's Mr Vere who seems to materialise out of nothing every time she needs someone to rescue her from a socially awkward situation. Set against the background of the fragile and temporary peace with Napoleon, Anna starts to realise that she is intelligent and she does want to know what is going on in France.This is an entertaining short story which can be read at a sitting. If you enjoy a light-hearted Regency romance with a touch of humour and a sprinkling of danger then this might be for you. For those who have read and enjoyed this author's Mountjoy series then this one features a cameo appearance by an early nineteenth century Lord Mountjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18PTDJV2HS7PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KY9UG7E#wasThisHelpful","R18PTDJV2HS7PG","A3KRBW13FWBUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KRBW13FWBUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have a serious case of SAD, I don't think this Happy Light will work for you. If you are looking for something to augment your use of another natural spectrum lamp, or just something to brighten up a winter day, perhaps take it to work for your office, then it is OK. I developed SAD after menopause and it took me a couple of years to figure out what was going on every winter. Once I bought a natural spectrum lamp and used it every winter morning (and increased my Vitamin D3 intake to 5,000 IU daily), I was a new person. As long as I consistently do that during the winter, I do not get intense anxiety and/or feelings of sadness that can pop up out of nowhere in the winter. I have reviewed the NatureBright lamp that I use elsewhere on Amazon. I like it so much I bought a second one for my husband, who spends a lot of time in the basement working on projects.A major shortcoming of this unit is that it is only 5,000 LUX. All the research I have read says 10,000 LUX is what you need, and that is what I use. Additionally, right on the box it states that for this unit, 5,000 LUX is attainable if the lamp is anywhere from 6 to 10 inches away. That is pretty darn close-up and you have to be sitting with it practically in your face. So 5,000 LUX may or may not be achievable for you.The other feature I wish it had was a timer. My NatureBright lamp has a timer on it, so that I don't sit for TOO long in front of it. As tempting as it is to sit there all day with the bright light on, that isn't necessarily a good thing for your melatonin production and your circadian rhythms. It is possible to actually sit in front of a light box for too long, leading to disrupted sleep patterns and even feelings of anxiety.If you have SAD that can be disruptive to your normal life, my suggestion would be to look for a light box that has 10,000 LUX as the standard. The unit that I own has come way down in price over the years and for what you get, is a bargain.PROS:Small, compact, goes just about anywhereHas an on/off switchBrightens up the area it is in quite a bitInexpensiveCONS:Not 10,000 LuxNo timer","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187Z2NZAVVD4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K08ZDBI#wasThisHelpful","R187Z2NZAVVD4H","A2VYA302TO2K1C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VYA302TO2K1C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are looking for a comprehensive book on ophthalmology, this is definitely not the right book. I am an NP in a family practice, and found the illustrations and short, concise text helpful. I also appreciate the ""key points"" and ""warnings"" boxes. I do wish there were more emphasis on which eye injuries require immediate referral to an ophthalmologist and/or are considered emergencies. I was hoping that certain injuries would say, in giant, bright red letters, ""Emergency Condition!"". I suppose that is because I am extremely cautious about eye injuries. Treating an eye problem as less serious than it is could lead to permanent vision damage in my patients. I am lucky that we have a 24-hour eye emergency room in a large specialty hospital nearby, so I don't hesitate to refer my patients if I have even the slightest concern. This is not to say that the book does not indicate when something is an emergency (such as bacterial keratitis), it just seems more laid-back about eye emergencies than I, as a general practitioner, might care for. I was also surprised how little space (one short paragraph and an illustration) was devoted to Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (""shingles"" that affects the eyes), as this really does require a consult with an ophthalmologist and should be treated as an urgent eye problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXVWX2960L6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1405184736#wasThisHelpful","R1OXVWX2960L6N","A2VYA302TO2K1C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VYA302TO2K1C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't think my husband would even try this out on his iPad, but he did. It has been almost 2 months now, and it is always on his iPad. He keeps telling me he loves it. Here's what he likes:- It is very sturdy, kind of like an otterbox. He has dropped his iPad a couple of times with no damage whatsoever to the unit.- It lets him read in bed without the bright light driving me crazy! I have to say, it does darken the light a lot. You might or might not find that an advantage, as others have mentioned they feel they have to turn up the brightness. My husband does not.- It has dependable magnets that keep it firmly attached.- The little ""kickstand"" is great for reading when he puts the iPad on a table. And the ""kickstand"" is also very sturdy.- It protects his iPad's screen.- It does provide privacy when he takes it to the doctor's office and is sitting in the waiting room.Stuff he is not too thrilled about:- There is only a ""kickstand"" in landscape mode. Why call it ""portrait"" then?- If he wants to use the bottom pull-up tool bar on his iPad, he has to flip the privacy cover down/open. He says this is not a big deal, but you might think it is if you use that tool bar all the time.- It did add a lot of weight to the iPad.Overall, he keeps telling me how glad he is that I got this for him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UU3QFA6GODMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4EV0WQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UU3QFA6GODMK","A2VYA302TO2K1C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VYA302TO2K1C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This compound was easy to set up. It was a lot bigger (even just the tent itself) than I thought it would be, so pay attention to the dimensions! I actually use it for my ferals to give them some shade and a sense of enclosure in a place where they can keep a watchful eye on the world. (Yes, they are all spayed and neutered! Some are quite elderly now.)I must point out that a frightened, determined cat could rip or chew through the mesh. No doubt about it. I have had enough cats over many years that I know what a cat is capable of. If you are using this for an indoor cat that you are bringing outdoors, please keep a very close eye on him or her.

"Edit, 8/16/14. I decided I really don't like this unit at all. As soon as I can afford it, I am going to order a second Keystone 70-pint unit. We recently had very heavy rain, where we got 6"" of rain in about 12 hours. My basement took on some water, which I was able to ShopVac up in a few go-rounds. Then I put this unit on and the Keystone unit on, in 2 different spots that had both been wet. The DeLonghi ran and ran and ran and ran. And cycled into and out of defrost mode numerous times. After 24 hours, I shut it off, as the noise level from this unit when it is on full-speed can be exasperating. The pan was only about 3/4 full of water. To boot, it had developed a small leak in the pan, so I had a little puddle on the floor (not enough to account for the pan being only 3/4 full). Meanwhile, the Keystone was running like a champ, filling up, being emptied, and filling up again several times. All while running quietly and only rarely cycling into defrost mode. That sealed the deal for me. No sense wasting electricity on a unit that is highly inefficient, loud and leaky. I will buy another Keystone for those occasions when a substantial portion of my basement gets wet. I have no idea how this unit got an Energy Star rating.************(Original review)Our basement is not normally damp, but in the summer it can get humid (and chilly), so we do run the dehumidifier frequently on summer days. And about 1-2 times per year, we get enough water in our basement to require dehumidifying around the clock in order to get the moisture out. We typically have 2 units, one on each side of our basement. We had 2 Sunpentowns, which were great right up until they both died at about the 18-month mark. So I bought a Keystone and then had the opportunity to get the DeLonghi. That has enabled me to compare them side by side.Full disclosure: I don't care about the pump feature. I am OK with emptying the pan about once a day, because we only run the units when the basement is damp or it is hot and humid outside. If you don't need the pump due to heavy use, then save yourself the money and get a cheaper unit without a pump. Having said that, if you do need the pump, be sure to read reviews of this dehumidifier that mention the pump dying versus the pump doing a fabulous job and decide for yourself.Pros:- Fantastic packaging. Everything was taped down and secured. This unit could have fallen off a truck and arrived safely.- Easy set-up. Really, I just took everything out of the pan (hoses, etc.) and plugged it in. Took me a second or two to decipher the icons on the display, but that was easy.- The unit does dehumidify, no doubt about it. But our comparably-sized Keystone is a much bigger water hog and takes far more moisture out of the air. That's why I would not depend on it as the sole unit in a basement that needs dehumidifying every day.- The pan is nice and solid. The Keystone pan is lightweight.- Some smartie figured out that you can secure the float so that it doesn't tip over every time you dump the pan. Yeah! I have to hold the float in place on the Keystone as I empty the pan.- You can tell it to run until the humidity is a certain percentage, which is a nice energy-saving feature.Cons:- Very heavy. But all of these bigger units are heavy.- The LOUDEST of all 3 brands I have tried. Even on the normal setting it is very loud. On the maximum setting, my husband and I were shouting at each other, just to be heard. Definitely NOT something you want in your living space.- Removes less moisture than the Keystone, as I've already mentioned.- Forgets what your settings were when you power it off, and the settings have to be reset each time.- Goes into ""defrost"" mode far more frequently than the Keystone, and about as often as the Sunpentowns did. Annoying, in my opinion, as that ramps up the noise level and the energy use. And it's not dehumidifying when it is in defrost mode, of course.Overall, it's a nice unit. But for the money, I think there are better units out there. Unfortunately, I have yet to find one that lasts as long as my old Sears dehumidifier that I had for 20 years!","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQBDNDBO23VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEZ7QQA#wasThisHelpful","R3CQBDNDBO23VC","A2VYA302TO2K1C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VYA302TO2K1C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Admittedly, bowl/round back mandolin hardshell case cases are getting very hard to find. So in desperation, I ordered this one. As soon as it came out of the box, I knew it was going back. It is made of thin, cheap cardboard and has NO padding or fabric whatsoever inside. In fact, I would be afraid that the textured surface placed over the cardboard on the inside would scratch the surface of the mandolin. There is a cheap, thin cardboard center storage area that looks like the top would break off from use fairly quickly. I decided to get a gig bag instead for now, and will continue to look for a good hardshell case. At least the gig bag will provide some padding!","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R364I7BHR2W9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WG8VI2#wasThisHelpful","R364I7BHR2W9G","A2VYA302TO2K1C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VYA302TO2K1C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I normally feed my 4 cats Wellness cat food, which they love. So I was excited to get this bag of Nutrience. I must say the ingredient list is impressive, since it is grain-free and has no fillers. The first ingredient is ""deboned turkey"". But my cats will only eat it if I leave it in their bowl long enough. They go over, sniff, look up at me and walk away otherwise. But if I put some Wellness food out, they gobble it up. I've tried mixing the two, and I can see that they pick the Wellness out and eat the Nutrience only when they absolutely have to.PROS:- No grains, lots of meat and fish.- Large size is convenient if you have a bunch of catsCONS:- The ingredient list is longer than your arm, and you will have to read it carefully to see if your cat is allergic to any of the ingredients. Do my cats really need licorice root and tumeric? Apples and blueberries? I like the idea of the probiotics in it, but I question if they are the right probiotics for cats and how ""live"" the probiotic strains are after they sit in that bag for a while.- Large bag is heavy.- VERY EXPENSIVE. Eye-poppingly so. And for some reason, the price is different every time I look at the product page. Right now, it is about $3 less than when I reviewed it, but about $5 more than it was a few months ago.If you want to try this, get a small bag and see if your cats are less fussy than mine.My original review had all the ingredients and nutritional breakdown listed. For some reason, that part was edited out. Pity, because the company does not make it easy to find out the ingredient list.

You can search around their site for a quick comparison of what each one offers..Since this product provides so much for all our computers (I think we're computer junkies--but hey--family of 6) AND phones...it's really worth coughing up the extra money.I installed windows 10 around the time I installed this, and the computer is acting a bit slower. I can't say whether it's windows 10 or McAfee, but it's something to think about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW028TQ4F19PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010P91LYY#wasThisHelpful","RW028TQ4F19PG","A3MWP39R0W9TQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MWP39R0W9TQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, to be fair, there's not some life-changing quality here to send this to the peak of freezer bag perfection. But the quality is excellent for this category. The zippers zip easily and smoothly and hold up when I yank them harshly at the end. Just in case you can't tell which side is locked (it happens), they have an arrow and the word ""closed"".  In addition, there's the popular white label area which makes it easy to write the contents and date becuase it's easy to forget both one frozen hard and piled in the freezer.You get 4 generous boxes here, which makes them a nice value.

"So far, this is a fabulous gate. This is a screw-in gate, so it's more sturdy/reliable than a spring-held gate, however, it does require screwing in to the wall. When baby gets bigger, patching the holes in wood or wall is relatively easy but you'll need paint/stain to match the wood/wall.The gate is quite beautiful wood--it's such a smooth finish it seems almost metal, but it's very stylish/classy. If you have a beautiful home, this will be a big asset versus some of the eyesore gates I've seen.The hardware worked ok for install. But I did end up using a replacement screw for one of the screws. The Hinges have held up well so far and it swings beautifully. the non-toddlers in our house have to adjust to using it, but it soon will be just normal. I love that it can swing two ways.One review complained about the height. Be sure to keep it fairly close to the ground, so baby cannot slide under it, but obviously it be off the ground some. The actual wood is  Tall. And with the bottom hinges installed straight at floor level, it measures  "" to the top rail.

"This beautiful hardbound cookbook is a great modern edition of some of my favorite health-conscious cookbooks made by Alice Waters. Fanny at Chez Panisse holds many favorites and I've kept it over the years for the recipes and the illustrations. I only compare this to Alice Waters because she writes the introduction. Instead of just classic vegetarian and health-conscious foods, we get some innovative new flavors here.The book is quality made and beautiful throughout. The photos are inviting and the recipes are delicious so far. I haven't had a salad like the citrus salad and it's a really beautiful, fun take on having a side salad. Just know, that if you sub blood oranges, the whole thing will get a purple hue (not so pretty).Don't skip the introduction because that's the heart of the cookbook and will help you feel a kinship with the author and the book as a whole.Personally, I love grabbing cookbooks for meal planning, knowing they are time-tested and I can grab and go--planning as I'm stuck in waiting rooms, etc. I write downt he recipes I want to try most on a sheet and store it in the front so I can quickly remember what I wanted to make the most.I don't believe you'll be disappointed with this book and it's going to be a great gift for new wives, new young chefs and anyone who loves cooking healthy foods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162TVST1S4TRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848746031#wasThisHelpful","R162TVST1S4TRT","A3MWP39R0W9TQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MWP39R0W9TQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is something I personally would have loved as a child. And it's fun for quite an age range. So if you need something for your 4 year old and the 10 year old who visits, it would be a good bet.

It can be entertaining in a lot of ways and is very bright and solidly built. I could see myself playing with this while watching t.v. just for therapeutic value.

I went ahead and lit it on the other side. and KABLAM...I had a roaring fire that light my charcoal up with evenness and intensity I don't normally experience. My grill is a smoker grill and it lights this way, but I am highly confident it would quickly light charcoal itself. Maybe as long as 5 seconds.

"Corel Painter 2015 was a decent upgrade with improved the performance speed, new images, papers, gradients, & user-interface palettes. They added jitter smoothing so you could create realistically random brushstrokes, and app support. So, what would draw a person to paying for Corel 2016 which is a retail price of $229 for the upgrade.Thankfully, Corel Painter 2016 kept those useful upgrades they made in 2015, then took a good-sized step forward. They did, however, stop from creating things for you. Yes, that was my little joke.For starters, they added 4 types of BRUSH Upgrades:1. Audio Expression:  This unique feature gives you brushes that react to sound from music played in the background or on the computer.  Play music (or your  voice) and the strokes go along with it, getting larger strokes with louder sounds and so on.  Because it syncs with the  sound, it can create a natural randomness with some rhythm and order, just like music.2. Dynamic Speckles:  Using particle system physics (you'll have ask Corel more on that) and brush thickness, you can control to splatter  the pictures for a different look. This mode works best with Bristle, RealBristle and Particle brushes, to create natural-  media brushstrokes. They are dynamic and generated as you paint.3. Special Media Mixing:  Here they offer new tools such as Liquid Ink, Watercolor, or Impasto to create more realism.4. Paper and Flow Map Rotation:  You can change the angle of paper textures and flow maps, which adds realism and freshness to your design.Brushes:Painter 2016 has a wide range of brushes, which are grouped into different categories, such as Airbrushes, Artists Oils, Acrylics, Calligraphy, Cloners, Pencils, and Watercolor. You can create custom brushes, and can easily see what brushes you used recently.  You can check out the most recently used brushes and create custom brushes. 131 new brushes including special media brushes (more specifically, dab types that can be used for applying media to the canvas: Liquid Ink Gravity Particles, Liquid Ink Flow Particles, Liquid Ink Spring Particles, Watercolor Gravity Particles, Watercolor Flow Particles, and Watercolor Spring Particles), and layer blending for producing brushstrokes without white fringes.Default settings (with personalization):When you restore the default settings, you can set it to preserve your custom features such as scripts, textures, palettes, custom brushes. It's a relief knowing you can go back to ""start"" and still preserve your personal features.Document Views:It is easier than before, to switch between document views and presentation views via the toolbox, Window menu, and keyboard shortcuts. The Single Document View focuses shows the active design, while the Presentation Mode hides the menu and taskbar,  leaving only the main controls and giving you a cleaner, large surface to work with.User Interface:you can now personalize the workspace by modifying the color scheme to Dark, Frost, Sepia & Grey (default). You can also change the background color to any color in the color wheel.Integrated learning:The learning curve for using Corel has been quite high for the average user. To simplify that process, Paint 2016 automatically updates training content as you work, basing on what you have already seen. And gives you ""hints"" in context. For example, the new Brush Hints tool provides context-sensitive brush suggestions, while Visual Tooltips provides illustrations. The Welcome Screen that appears when you start the app, helps you find out information and the tools you need.Content sharing:Enhanced features to help you export custom brushes, papers, patterns, and flow maps via a custom Toolbox file.Faster/Better Performance:New features are great, so long as they don't lag and slow your work. Corel improved performance and stability. Brushes are up to three times faster than the previous version. Painter 2016 also makes it faster and easier to blend strokes across layers and media types. Plus, you can now import the brush stamps of pixel-based Adobe Photoshop brushes for further customization in Painter.If you want to be the top of your game, you'll invest in the newest version. For the beginner, there are benefits in the new Integrated learning. I suspect it's the mid-range users who  will have to think the hardest whether to pay for this upgrade.

"Attractive, medium-quality fire pit. The cover isn't going to last two summers in Georgia, so we'll keep it in the shed when possible. There are more durable canvas covers that will fit. You'll want protection from snow and sun because the finish isn't  as solid as I'd like. I love that it's so open, but you have the mesh to keep stray cinders from spilling out. Once you burn a couple fires in it, it looks pretty used, so the cover should make it more attractive when its sitting in the open. Obviously, the cover is plastic and should not be placed on a hot fire pit (unless you want it permanently attached). The mesh isn't rock solid. It has some bend to it. The lid is good for protection, but won't allow for tall fires, so if you want more height (teepee style), then the lid won't fit.It's sturdiness is midrange. There are less expensive, less sturdy fire pits, and more expensive more sturdy fire pits. So if you are just an occasional fire pit user, this should work well for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTYM5483MT7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GURAD4#wasThisHelpful","R3UTYM5483MT7R","A3MWP39R0W9TQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MWP39R0W9TQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Reinvent Tax spaces (Now, you have an Airport space and First Class space, which do cost money, but are beneficial)4. Replace Street names with City Names5.

"After the game starts up you are taken to the main page where you have a choice between 7 casino games. These include Blackjack, Baccarat, Craps, Roulette, Poker, Slots, and Video Poker. Picking each game is quick and the load screen is pretty fast. When you pick Blackjack there is an initial choice of 1, 2, or 4 card decks. The game plays fast and the controls are intuitive but the initial part of placing a bet and choosing an amount is slightly clunky.With Poker you've got a choice between 7 Card Stud, 5 Card Stud, 5 Card Draw, Jacks or Better, and Texas Hold 'Em. You can place a bet between $3 to $200. The game moves along quickly and controls are easy to understand. For Slots you have a choice between Ancient Treasure, Buffet, Love 2 Win, Easy Money, and Beyond the Stars. There is a choice among $1, $5, or $10 machines. Certain Slots have 3 reels and others have 4. Also some only win on one line while others use all three.And Video Poker has Double Down, Jacks or Better, Jokers Wild, 10s or Better, & Deuces Wild among the choices. Bets are $1, $5, or $10. Lastly you've got Baccarat and Roulette among the table games. Both games are also intuitive to control and plays at a fast pace. The included instruction manual gives an in-depth and thorough explanation of the rules and strategies for each table game or machine. The graphics are mostly sprite-based except for the roulette wheel, which is comprised of polygons.And the sounds are typical of casino ambiance with the spinning slots, token noises, and chatter from gamblers. You can turn off the background noise(or lower it) if it bothers you. And when you exit a game you have a choice of saving the progress if you choose. Overall this is a solid gambling/casino game for the PS1 with plenty of gaming choices and a fast-paced style of play with easy to learn controls(for the most part).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQS4912AL663/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00001TZYG#wasThisHelpful","RWQS4912AL663","A19EKT8H85AKO5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19EKT8H85AKO5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is essentially a photo essay book so the pictures tell the story so to speak. The pictures here aren't meant to glamorize or shock or anything like that .. it is mostly just everyday photos in the barrio or hood(and in this case, in East L.A.). People who didn't grow up or live in and around this area/environment might not connect much with the images in this book. But for those who have been around this type of environment, these photos can definitely evoke some type of emotion or feeling or past memory.The pictures are all in black and white and are centered heavily around the Evergreen set in Boyle Heights(east of Los Angeles). At the start of the book, Ruben Martinez goes briefly into the early history of how gangs developed and evolved in Southern California during the turn of the twentieth century all the way into the 1980's. Nothing new here but good to have as a backgrounder. He also gives a pseudo sociological explanation for why certain things developed or occurred in the barrio(but obviously with his own slant or viewpoint). Don't agree with some of it but it is his own view so I am fine with that.Towards the end of the book, photographer Joseph Rodriguez does a short interview with Luis J. Rodriguez, writer of the book 'Always Running, La Vida Loca: Gang Days in L.A.'. Quick but insightful interview. And if you haven't, I do recommend reading 'Always Running' for a deep and personal journey into the life of a former gang member. And most of the photos in this book are from the early 1990's(92-93), so it is like a time-capsule of sorts too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6SSA5IEDZJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1576870723#wasThisHelpful","R3I6SSA5IEDZJL","A19EKT8H85AKO5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19EKT8H85AKO5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"College Slam for the Sega Saturn is a re-skinned version of NBA JAM Tournament Edition with almost exactly the same goofy play-mechanics and comical graphics but instead of NBA teams, you get College squads. But unlike NBA JAM where you get real NBA players, here you just get to edit the names of your players(no real college players).Game-play modes include 'head-to-head', 'semi-finals', & 'tournament mode'. In 'semi-finals' up to four players can enter their team into the final four and for 'tournament mode' up to 16 players can participate in the elimination tournament. There is also a 20-team season mode. Their are the usual power-ups such as unlimited turbo boost or speed and a new one where your player is temporarily invisible.The game is divided into two halves of 6 mins each and there are 44 teams included in the game. Overall a fun and fast arcade-style basketball game where you can score in ridiculous ways and be ""on fire"". But if you already own NBA JAM Tournament Edition then there is not enough of a difference to really justify getting this unless you really want the college teams.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZJ1H9GKCWHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002STVY#wasThisHelpful","R3MZJ1H9GKCWHN","A19EKT8H85AKO5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19EKT8H85AKO5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One of the main benefits  that I have felt is that it has helped me to feel less off-balanced and also to have a better flow within me when my over-night shift gets a bit hectic and stressful at times.But it did take me awhile(over a week at 2 capsules per day) to begin to feel the affect as it is subtle(the recommended dosage is three per day). Does not contain any artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. And it is safe for vegetarians. Only drawback is that it is a bit pricey.

"7-disc set with all six World Series games along with the ALCS game between the Yankees and Royals at Kaufman Stadium. The unusual thing about this game was that there was no on-screen graphics to indicate the inning, score, batting average, name of player, etc.The seventh disc also contains some of the miscellaneous interviews and extra footage from the 1977 World Series. Overall I thought the picture and sound quality was pretty good considering that the source footage is very old.

The games control well and remind me of the old days on the Neo Geo with the big, colorful and goofy sprites.These compilations were pretty common during the PS2 days but unfortunately we don't see much of it on the newer consoles(now it is mostly single game downloads of the retro games).

Comes with an AC adapter that also includes four attachable power adapter heads for different regions.

"I read Mick's original book 'Have a Nice Day' over a dozen years ago when it was first released and it took me awhile to finally getting around to reading his follow-up book 'Foley is Good'. I originally really enjoyed reading Foley's first book as it was insightful and a one of a kind back then. This second book was also pretty enjoyable, a good follow-up to his best-seller. The only thing for me is that the book felt a bit dated reading it today with references to such things as 'backyard wrestling' and VCR tape machines. And also having read quite a few wrestling books over the years(a few of which were very good), I didn't quite get the same thrill as when I first read 'Have a Nice Day'.

For me though it was a pleasant surprise as I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Nora's early years growing up in Austria and her acute perceptions about food not just as far as taste but also how it related to life and survival and nourishment. I also enjoyed reading about her early marriage and how she developed certain skills and abilities through entertaining guest in her home which eventually led to Nora teaching her first cooking class in her kitchen. Along with her failed marriage this then opened the door to Nora's first opportunity to run a real restaurant and to create a menu that was uncommon at the time.

How can you get up and leave a film that your'e watching part way through?Well, it was the same for this.When someone suffers from Alzheimers, how do you know what they are saying has any weight behind it?So when someone with Alzheimers says It was an accident, does that person refer to something now, the other day, last week, last year or is it all in their minds?Tom is the one with Alzheimer's that is now in a home. His family go to visit him often.This story is mostly told from Olivia's perspective, what is happening, what she thinks and what she feels.She takes charge on many decisions, she has morals, she wants the truth, but just what IS the truth.Basis.Katie left home over 25 years ago saying she was never coming back.She had split from her boyfriend as they were young and he didn't want to settle down but she did.There's a body and Tom knows where, he has Alzheimer's how would he know?Can Olivia just walk away and take no notice?She tells her husband who just do not want to believe it. Its not true, his father was a gentle kind man. He wouldn't harm a fly.It can't be him.Katie left a note, she's not dead, shes gone...shes in hiding she could have changed her name right?Olivia cannot let it rest.The rambling's of Tom haunt her and she has to do something, after all, how can she not.This is a well thought out constructive plot that kept my attention all the way through without wavering one little bit.I really love and enjoy the way this authors writes her stories, she is definitely on my top list of authors.This isn't the only book I have read from this author and definitely won't be the last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FKQN5WTKT07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503947467#wasThisHelpful","R38FKQN5WTKT07","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a short novel with a lot to read in it. Its not so short that you feel you are missing out or something is being hurried. No, because Maggie James is an experienced author so she knows exactly how to weave a plot.Here we have Matthew Stanyer parents, getting along in age. His Mother suffers with dementia, its getting worse and worse and her husband struggles to manage her.They go missing.Then they're bodies are found by Blackwater lake which is known as a beauty spot. Maggie James explains to us the surroundings so that we can visualize it in our minds eye, she also touches on how significant that area was for the couple.A note was left. So its put down to a suicide-murder, meaning, his father killed his mother then took his own life.Matthew doesn't think that to be the case and wants to prove his father's innocence.As Matthew starts to clear out his parents home, he discovers more and more.What was the attraction to Blackwater lake?Clearing out the house is not straight forward because his Mother was a hoarder. What made her hoard so much stuff?They could hardly move for boxes, rubbish and what looked like a burgled storage room.Just imagine the smell that evokes too.But what lays beneath the rubble?What family secrets are buried.This author is excellent at tackling different subjects and this one is no exceptionI could imagine these kind of surroundings, the life that Matthew had before moving out.Now he is back, back to not only sort out the home, but to sort out the reasons for his parents ""deaths""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LLPL59ND4C89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WYIQ4K#wasThisHelpful","R1LLPL59ND4C89","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am going to be honest here [as always] and say, I loved the blurb.Then when I started to read it, I wondered why I had chosen it then it really started to pick up.I am not giving anything away as its in the blurb already, but when it got to the part where Randy Spelling shot someone, it really did feel like I was not going to be able to put this book down.Background.Women find it hard going [even to this day] in a ""man orientated job"" that was of more leaning to the males than females, and even if there are laws and rules in place, there is always going to be some that think women are not best suited for certain types of work.This is not different within the Police force that we read about in this book.We see how women have to not just do a ""good"" job, but they have to be ""perfect and do it above average"" because it makes a woman feel they need to 'prove' themselves.Randy has always wanted to work for the Police and follow her brothers and Fathers footsteps.She did vigorous training both physical and mental to get where she was within the force.Until...She was out on duty and she shot a young girl, a young girl who looked to be pulling out a gun on her.She shot her dead.What transpires from this is something so intense, so mind blowingly extensive and so sad, also so dangerous and so intense, I bet you won't be able to put the book down.I stayed up reading this until I finished it the early hours.I like to keep my book reading material varied so that I can approach a book and not to compare with another in the same genre.This book took me by total surprise.Not having heard of this author before, I am not putting her on a list for ""keep an eye out for further books"" List.*Thank you to Oceanview Publishing via Net galley for allowing me to read and review this awesome book *","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I4EDEMERCPMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011A9LIGY#wasThisHelpful","R3I4EDEMERCPMY","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a true story.In the event that has shocked the world this week with what has happened in Paris, I couldn't help think. The people who do these deliberate acts, killing people. We all feel for the relatives of the loved ones that have killed, children, women and men.But behind the ""killer"" is someone's Mom.A mom that cared, nurtured and brought their child up, not to kill, not to maim, not to harm. Not to have a disrespect for another persons life.But it happens.And here is the account of a Mother who had to come to turns with the fact that her son had gone into an Amish school house [one room] and gunned down 10 girls, killing 5 then taking his own life.How would you feel as a Mom.All the emotions that go come with this.This is an Amish Mom who only knew her son as an honorable man. Not anymore.Shame has been brought upon her.We see her struggles, but we also see how the Amish religion and beliefs can come to the fore in this. Hard to understand, but true, and yes, believable and real.This was a heart wrenching, thought provoking read.

"This is a beautifully illustrated book, I so enjoyed looking at all the patterns in there for these little babies, nothing like knitting baby things. Other knitters will understand that.There are whole outfits to hats and mittens.I especially loved the little sleeveless pullover, I remember using that pattern on an adult jumper I knitted for one of my brothers many years ago.This is a book I will be keeping and constantly referring to.Its got some easy instructions there and graphs to follow to create pictures on your knitted work.I am happy to recommend this book to all knitters who love knitted things for babies.Thank you to Storey Publishing via Net Galley for my copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X6WXY4VBX3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612124801#wasThisHelpful","R1X6WXY4VBX3Y","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am such a fan of Steena Holmes book when she writes genres such as this. I know she veers to chic lit/romance on occasion but for me, she is at her best and I get to RAVE about it here and on all social networks.This book is no exception.What would you do if you suspected that a child was being abused?What about, if you had been abused as a child and people may think its your paranoia?Because, sometimes this came over in reading this. Would I have self doubt, could I be seeing signs that really aren't there just because I have past to deal with myself?Alyson Ward is a mom, shes a good mom, but she is an over protective mom. So allowing her daughter to go for a sleepover is a huge big event. Tricia, her sister is the chaperone, and she breathes and lets go and allows her daughter to have a good time.Alyson and her daughter Lyla have a good relationship I thought. There are going to be times when there are tiny ruffled feathers, but on the whole, they are close.When talking about the sleepover Lyla reveals something that just doesn't sit right with Alyson, and there the story ensues so rapidly you need to stay with it.I read this book in one sitting. My eyes were dropping but I was compelled to stay with it. My eyes were sore, but I made myself a cup of tea, walked around with my Kindle and then felt refreshed to read more and finish this book.At the end, I am saying 'this is the best book this author has written'I say that to all her books I have thoroughly enjoyed and no doubt, I will saying this again and again and againSteena Holmes is dealing with a delicate subject matter here and its so sensitively written. From each sisters viewpoint to right down to their moms.Each character in this book became so real to me I could have reached out to hug them for their pain, laugh with them through the fun times and shared a cup of tea and biscuits around the kitchen table.I would recommend this read to all my friends who love books like myself or trust my tastes.Thank you Steena Holmes for another GREAT book and to Lake Union Publishing for my copy via Net GalleyI received this as an advanced copy","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM97UQJNHJ5ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V1YIYF2#wasThisHelpful","RM97UQJNHJ5ND","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was eager to read this book as I have heard a lot about it so, when I was granted a copy from Bookouture via Net Galley in exchange for my honest review, of course, I jumped right in.Kelly Rimmer the author doesn't mess about, she tells it like it is, and draws you without you noticing it. I sat and finished this book today, I had only started it late last night, but I just had to pick it up and carry on. I did text my book buddy to say 'you gotta read this', she looked, and she has it to read on her list. I am so glad of that because I just know she will love it.What must it be like to be in your 30's. Married. Expecting a child of your own and then being told by your parents that you had been adopted. This is what happened to Sabina.Can you imagine the impact?Ted her husband is stood right beside her, he has her back, he has her emotions, he is a great help to her, solid and factual. But Sabina cannot come to terms with this, OF COURSE NOT, its a SHOCK to the must amazing degree. Her life [as she knew it] was now in pieces.Its not easy to think ""well, these are still my parents, they brought me up"", its the big heap of questions that go around in your head and one of the big ones is: Who is my Mother?She finds her parents very cagey.Now this is where it got so addictive for me I was solidly glued to my Kindle.Just what were the parents hiding?Just what more shocks were in store for Sabrina.Then I had a sudden thought......she is pregnant herself, what if the shock makes her loose her unborn child?I did take note of when Ted was pointing out things about her family. I related to that as my husbands Father was controlling but my husband couldn't see this until many years later into our married life. I felt for Ted as its hard to point out something you see without causes offence but its for a persons own good.There is an awful lot packed in this book.I love how there are chapters that appertain to the biological Mother writing to her lover. How the book goes back, you can FEEL that poor girls anguish.I felt quite choked up at times.Sabina's emotions came out from the pages and completely smacked me between the eyes, I felt it, it was real.As I got more into the book, I really wondered how parents could do this to someone. Keep this huge secret and not tell, how can someone do this, its messing with someone else's choices. THEN I got more information and it sort of altered the way I was thinking.ABSOLUTELY A 5 STAR I would definitely give this more if I could.*Heart renderingly real.* (","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I070Y3QGJU84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910751081#wasThisHelpful","R3I070Y3QGJU84","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Angela Marsons is an author that I followed from day one. Her first book, her debut novel was just so well written, so professional, just like any Best Seller book I have read that had been published over the years that I had to come back, I read her secound book. And now, I have read this one.Kate StoneShe is the DI, the main character in this series. Although they can be read as stand alone reads, I would urge you to read from the first one as you get a better insight to Kate Stone and the reason she acts the way she does.More and more I am liking Kate.This book was about children, two little girls who were taken.But where are they?Who has taken them?And most importantly...why.This is a story unlike one I have read before. The plot was so well written I didn't know for sure where it was going to lead to.This author has a way of surprising you.This author also has a way of bringing you into the fold and company of each character, you get to know them, you see their faces in your minds eye.The descriptions, they details and how she writes help you to form the drama in your mind. You can see the people, you can see the little girls, the details are there.There were some gruesome bits, when the nasty man killed a cat making the girls watch. Now this, it was stomach churning yes....But it had to be. But the thing was, it was not me I was thinking about, it was those poor little girls sat there being made to watch. I could just picture their little faces and hear their loud screams and cries.I absolutely love the way this author writes. She brings me right into the story and I just lap it up.Each time I feel shes going to run out of stories, she surprises us with yet another WHOPPER of a read.I was sorry to finish this, because I just don't know when her next book is coming!!She cannot write fast enough for me to devour her books.I have to thank ""Bookouture"" via Net Galley for my copy.

"This is Sarah Ward's debut novel, you wouldn't believe it if you read it, its so well written.I found the first bit hard going, but that isn't any reflection on the author because sometimes the very best of the best books I have come across have been slow picking up and then WHAM this one is the same.Two girls kidnapped, one escapes.The one that escaped is now many years older, but she still reflects on what happened and wonder where her friend was, no one knew, did she live? did she die?The mother of the missing child takes her own life.There are the best hidden secrets within the pages of this book that will leave you flicking page after page into the early hours trying to solve what happened.Its an excellent first book and I am looking forward to many more from the great author in the making.*My thanks go to Faber and Faber Ltd via Net Galley for my copy *","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9QAGWIEEQ7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDE2LNU#wasThisHelpful","R2V9QAGWIEEQ7A","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Why is Leah living a lonely life away from her friends and her Mother2. Why doesn't she have any friends anymore3.

"I saw that one of my book buddies was reading this the same time as myself, so we agreed to read it together.Ruth Dugdall only came to my attention after reading Humber boy B which just blew me away. So when her PA asked me if I would like a proof copy of her coming new book Nowhere Girl, I jumped at the chance. I saw it was on Net Galley too and was sent a widget. So I decided to read it on my trusty Kindle.This starts with a trip to the fairground. Not just any fairground, its the Schueberfouer Luxembourgs annual event. Its something everyone looks forward to.Ellie's mother is a close friend to alcohol. And she had been drinking on this occasion too when at the fair with her two daughters.Ellie goes missing, but we don't panic at first as we hear that she has gone missing before when staying over at her boyfriends without her parents knowledge.Ellie was told to 'dump' her boyfriend and her Iphone was taken from her.To a teenager, this would be like taking their life blood away from them, they are connected to their Iphone.But Ellie has gone missing .....again. At the fair.We are seeing different characters around the fair so we are not sure who is connected and who is not to whom.We just aren't sure who is tangled up in the plot.We meet Cate too, she has moved here with her boyfriend. Cate used to be a Probation Officer. Good at her job, but for reasons and personal reasons she has moved with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend Olivier is a Detective and we see how he becomes enmeshed in all of this as the story unfolds.We meet Amina and Jodie also connected.Just how they are connected, you will see.There are some dodgy things going on here seemingly to be hidden behind a beauty salon to get your nails done or get a tan. Very mysterious.This author really does a fantastic job as pulling the reader right into the web.Ellie's father is of high standing so.......has she been kidnapped for a ransom?Her Mother is distraught with worry.Her little sister just wanted Ellie to take her on a fairground ride.Cate gets involved with the case in more ways than one.I loved how each chapter was allotted to a character and told what was happening for each of them.Well laid out. I could follow it with ease.I just don't know where this author gets her stories from but after Humber boy B I bought other of her books, now that I have read this one too, I am just so awaiting each book she write. I don't think this author could write fast enough for me and without ***Legend Press *** I may not have come upon her. Or at least it may have taken me some timeSo my thanks go to the author [who I am in contact with] and her PA, plus Legend Press and Net Galley for my advanced copy which I will treasure for a life time.This is truly a top rate read.Did you read Humber boy B?Well, this is awesome too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8EIIWGTMBZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQWT59C#wasThisHelpful","R3N8EIIWGTMBZ4","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"reviewI have loved each book in this series. But this book 4 literally blew me away with the indepth characters, they're troubles, strife and woes.The Estate is just it. Its an Estate where families live in different homes, some poorer than others, and each from all walks of life.Some dysfunctional families that have terrible problems to some with everyday family problems.Written In the Scars was a story to me where there were different individuals, some friends with each other, some related. All with Scars.There some scars that can be seen. There are some scars that lay unseen by the human eye.Lewis He had scars that you could see by his personality and his reactions in life. But they were not evident scars on the body. Oh no, not ones that could be seen for you to meet him and realize that he was scared. You would have to have known a little about him first. Otherwise, his reactions, his behavior would simply come across to you as a thug, a bully. But he Lewis was sad. He had a secret. He went through something that he couldn't cope with when in the Army.He has PTSD symptoms.He has lost his wife, he hardly sees his child.He's determined to get them back.Donna she has scars. The first half of the book you can't see her scars. They are emotional scars left over from her marriage.She falls in love, another chance...she thinks.Later though, she gets scarred.Scars you can see, scars you can hear from her sad lips.I cringed for Donna.Donna has all her families burdens and worries on her shoulders as most Moms do.She also is worried about her own Mother in the care home. Her Mother has dementia and she doesn't know what to believe or not, but is her Mother being badly treated? Another thing for her to worry about.Then there is Sam.Then there is Megan. Megan works at the hospital where Sam has had his operation.Megan has scars, Megan has visible scars. But no one can see them under the heavy make up.I don't know why, but each time I have read one of these books from The Estate by Mel Sherratt I feel like a nosy neighbor. Someone twitching at her curtains and peeking out after dark, watching the neighborhood and wondering 'just what is gonna happen next'. Its that kind of ""feel"" to me.I am not sure if that is how the author wanted a reader to feel, but it certainly did that for me.A kind of 'sit down at the table over a cuppa and a gossip about this one and that'I also took away something from this book about ScarsWe all have them.Some are hidden.Some are visible by the naked eye.Some are known to us by the actions and thoughts plus decisions we may make in the future because of them.We can be an acress/actor, and we can cover up our scars, we can invent ourselves and pretend they are just not there...but there they are...beneath the surface of:Make upA smileA laughA thoughtA frown.And some need help overcoming the Scars.Thank you Mel for a wonderful read that kept me up last night :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1734S108K8O2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YL33R8#wasThisHelpful","R1734S108K8O2T","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What have I just read. Just what have I devoured over the past two days.This has been one of the most powerful books, the most 'peek through my fingers' type of book I have read for a long time.This story starts out very very well indeed. It brings you up to the time of the big storm, we are not talking just a little bitty storm, oh no, we are talking big trees falling down, roofs off houses and destruction.Matthew is just a boy.Twenty five years on from that time, Matthew is discharged into the community from a Mental Institution where he has liberty, where he is free to make his own choices. BUT somethings from the past can shape our future right?And Matthew is not immune from this fact.Matthew in on tablets, he has to take his psychiatric meds, some very strong meds for his psychosis.He has Tammy who comes in twice each day to administer his tablets and she has to make sure he takes them.Tammy is a care worker. She has other clients she visits on a day to day basis. But with Matthew, he is different, she is not used to mental health problems, she is not used to caring or seeing to a person with a psychosis.Tammy had her own problems. Tammy has her own issues.Matthew has his.Matthew and Tammy become attracted to each other.Matthew has a problem with tramps.Tammy has a friend who is a tramp.There is a bit of gore in the middle of this story and I have a vivid imagination that took me beyond what I was reading so I skimmed some. Not because it was awful, but because I am like someone who closes their eyes when the gruesome bits happen. I'm a scardy cat.There is a piece written in this book where Matthew is pulling something that looks like a twig from his body, the way the author writes it, I could feel it myself even my bum cheeks were tense!This is so well written, that I am amazed it doesn't have more reviews.If you are reading this, you are missing out [truly] on a very good addictive read.None of us know how the brain works, none of us know how others would react in certain situation or even yourself.At times I was on the edge of my seat wondering where Simon Law was going with this.The final chapter will leave you speechless.*My thanks to the author for this copy because without it, I just wouldn't have seen it and would have missed out on an awesome read....tension build up read""!*Can I just say though, I don't much like the cover.

"Roybenshas this Iphone wallet for sale, genuine leather and very good quality. As soon as I had taken this from the box and held it in my hand I could feel the leather and smell it.When fitting in my Iphone it slotted it a good tight fit without fear of it becoming loose or falling out. You spend a lot of money on an Iphone, you need the best protection, high quality wallet/cover for it.This is much more than a cover, because it has a compartment where you can store your cards. I especially like that as its hidden from view when you are using your Iphone. What with theft and our need to be stringent on our protection of our goods, this is ideal. The cards are not then visible to the eye of others while you are taking or making a phone call. This is one of the best features I have found compared to many other Iphone covers.All the slots are cut out in perfect place so that you do not need to remove your phone from its cover. You can still take photos, charge your phone up. And do all the other many things you use your phone for as well as leaving the phone cover on.It also has a nice detachable handle. You can either clip it on or if you want, not use it, this is entirely up to you.The stitching is very neatly done and I noticed that the stitching is on the outer side too making this more durable over time.This is finished off with a magnetic strip which holds it all in place.It has a matt finish to it, its smooth and lovely to hold.I would definitely give the thumbs up to this compared to others I own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZEVY834VF9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014W3RPJO#wasThisHelpful","R3NZEVY834VF9E","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was contacted by email from this author to see if I would like to read and review his work for an honest review.My review is mine and mine alone and I am finding this very hard to write.I contemplated for several days and agonized over if I should just not leave a review at all because its below a 3 star.After chatting it over with a couple of book buddies I felt that I had a duty really to write a review, as the reviews are not for the authors alone, they are also for potential buyers of a book or product we write reviews for...right?I REALLY was going to settle down and read this. I love a good ""stalker"" book at times. But this is riddled with typing errors. I am not just talking of your spelling mistakes now and again. I read a lot of Indie authors books and I beta read and proof read, so I am used to over looking errors and concentrating on the story knowing this will be picked up at a later date by the editor.I am seriously wondering if this book has had its final proof reading or even a check of spelling and grammar.Its very difficult to concentrate on the story so I tried.Believe me, I DID tryI gave this every effort and concentrated very hard but the story was very choppy.I couldn't understand why there were so many good ratings on this book, so I thought I would check as maybe I was sent a wrong copy??!!When checking the members who read this book and left reviews I could see that they are new to Goodreads, only this coming month or two. AND they have no other books some of them on their shelves.One is actually giving away a copy of this book.I couldn't help but ponder on that.Readers are not silly.The characters were flat.The story jumped so much I just was sighing and getting more frustrated as I tried to concentrate.Maybe, just maybe with some help and a lot of tweaking and help from others this book could appear on more readers shelves. However, at this presentation, I would give it a pass.**This is not an easy review for me to write...so I hear you ask...Why write it then.Because, I read and review. I cannot recommend a book that is as badly written as this.I could ignore and forget I tried to read it.But this is a diservice and I feel not an honest part of me, and seeing that I say I am ""honest"" I would hiding something.I telephoned Maxine who is a book buddy of mine and we talked. Because I had already read the book. I had been hesitating adding my review. When I saw hers, I was WOW, yes, I felt the same way.Thank god, relief.Truly sorry for the author as Michael has not got the review he wanted and hoped for.

"Let me thank Bookouture via Net Galley for allowing me full use of its library to feed my habit of good books.And also to this author Renita D'Silva as I have become a stalker of her books. She cannot write fast enough for me. Her last book blew me away and this one is just as good, if not better.She has such a warmth when writing and has the talent of breathing life into her characters.Just look at the cover, doesn't that tempt you? It does me. Then look at the background.We get a huge taste of India surrounding this story too.The blurb lives up to its name and the hype grapevine is alert to her books, many of us avid readers fear we may miss one, so we keep constant watch.This is the promise both sisters make:Sharda and Puja had made a promise to each other.We will always look out for each other and love each other best.But not all goes well.The sisters have are divided and not all is as it should be.But many years later, one of the sisters needs help.I am reading on and on, so sucked into the story, my question remaining was :What tore these sisters apart for so long?When this author writes the scenes surrounding India you can smell the aroma, you can taste the food, you can breathe in the air. She has such a talent for story telling she grips me each time she writes.May she write many more books and may I be able to read them.....that's all I can say.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REX8L1K2156KS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910751146#wasThisHelpful","REX8L1K2156KS","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good one from Jane Casey, well, I enjoyed it.Jessica she just always seems to find herself in the middle of things, although its a very quite place to live where nothing should really happen, well, at least not much, it does in this town. And each time we find Jessica drawn in.Jessica is curious she's helpful and wants to be kind but it seems to lead her into a pickle each time.Her boyfriend is getting frustrated with it all and his Father is at his wits end.I admire this author as she has written this for YA which you can see and has that 'feel' about it, an innocence if you like, however, it was sometimes a breath of fresh air for a mystery that lead me in places.

" 2:24 Mins DBPOWER headphones are not just any headphones. I was very well impressed with these.The packaging was superb, there is no way these are going to be damaged upon arrival.Upon opening the box I found the folded up headphones. That was impressive due to my first thought being....I can slip these nicely into my bag or coat pocket when not in use.The secound thing that impressed me was the high quality of the headphones themselves. Around the ears it is so very soft and well padded that you forget you are even wearing them. The top of the headset itself also has padding. Compared to some I have seen, its been just cold metal upon your head, but no, not these.They are very easy to adjust to fit your head. Slide up, slide down. Its as simple as that.The control center is on the base of one of the ears. Power ON> Power>OFF.To connect to your Bluetooth device, its made so easy, just depress the power ON button and a blue light appears. It only takes secounds to connect.YES you can listen to your music via these headphones.Because of its built in microphone you are able to speak on the phone using them too.Whilst trying these out, I started off listening to my music. It was clear, pure and just. No interference. THEN my Iphone rang, I learnt by depressing the power button I could answer my phone and talk to the person on the other end via my headset. Its only a simple thing, but this makes life simple.I have tried them out in my car too. I connected it to my car Bluetooth and had no problems. Not problems connecting my Iphone to my car and my Iphone to the headset.We have a Smart TV too, so I tried them out on that. OH WOW I am so impressed that if I could give these a 10 star review I would.My older son and daughter are now wanting to ""borrow"" them. I don't think so.As you can tell, I am very impressed with these. I have other headsets that were OK, and I used them, but they are now being ditched as these are my regular ones from now on.If you had to wear these for a length of time, you do not have to worry about hurting your ears as they are soft and luxurious. comfort themselves.Personally I think this company has put a lot of thought behind the producing of these for sell.Let me get onto the cost.I have seen in stores cheap looking headphones with all the Bluetooth and promise of a good all round sound only to be disappointed with my purchase, and they have been much more expensive than these.The are good value for money.Did I mention they are light weight? Yes, and the folding part is great, they just ""click"" into place with no fear of breaking.There is a  Build-in 400mA rechargeable battery which allows a lot of time for listening to music. Up to 12 hours.Talking time up to 15 hours.The quality of the built in microphone is clear and I had no problems in being heard when using it.They are so versatile as they can be used with your Iphone, Ipod, PC, and many other devices. I have to say, I had to use them and try them out on my Ipad.The controls are at the bottom of the ear section on one side. Volume control is instant. You can turn the volume up either on your device or on this headset, either way, its clear and the balance is superb.This is what you get along with your package of the headphones.1 * Bluetooth 4.0 Foldable Headphones1 * 3.5mm audio cable1 * USB charging cable1 * ManualI found they were so easy to use that I didn't need the manual, but I did read it just incase I missed anything and also the care of my product.Mine came already charged so I was able to use them right away.I don't much like earbuds so these are ace.I hope you like them as much as I do.DBPOWER as really given this a lot of thought.If my review has been helpful can you please click the helpful button as I work to improve my reviews","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R59G9CEPL5K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150ZM5C0#wasThisHelpful","R59G9CEPL5K5","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:06 Mins When opening this package and finding this fantastic quality Ipad Pro Case inside I was very taken aback with the workmanship. I have a few covers for all different devices I have and my two grown children have for theirs too, but none of them match the superb quality and work that has gone into this.They say 'less is more' and although this is a straight forward no fuss cover, it has a feel to it that takes you seconds to realize this is surely been well thought out.As you can see from my video, the flap over lid has two velcro fastenings. They are tight and hold on well.The back has a compartment which is so handy to put USB cables and things. Its very deep. So no problems getting in what you need side by side with your Ipad pro.If you look closely at the seems, they are well sewn, very well made and strong. This is hand made and you certainly can see the difference between this and something manufactured on a conveyor belt system.I really love the leather effect of the flap and back panel. I prefer this than the flowery ones that are on sell. I think it looks more professional.I hope you have enjoyed reading my review, and if it is helpful to you could you please press the helpful button so that I can improve on my reviews through feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RSWNC3UZUKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R30SBA#wasThisHelpful","R10RSWNC3UZUKN","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a bit of a sucker for reading books with children in it, either missing, kidnapped etcThis is one of them that caught my eye.We have a young couple, young in age, married, with a child of their own.The one thing that made me cringe each time was that their son had Down's syndrome and it was a problem for the Mom, I think it was her attitude that wanted me to slap her and appreciate the child she had.The trouble was, he was only a little toddler and on a hot summers day the Mom left the door open, the toddler was found dead in the pool.They were always meaning to fence it off, but they never got around to it.But not all is what it looks to be.The story did thrown me on and off the scent at times to whom I thought it was, and although I was correct in the end and for the reasons it was still a jaw breaking plot that left me gasping to the end.The couple were portrayed brilliantly.The young Mom got really on my nerves and I wanted to shout ""grow up for goodness sake"" but as we read on, we can see why she is like this, why she is self centered and at the end, I was questioning her sanity.Her own Father has quite an influence on her.Her poor husband, the heart broken lad of this dead child was so well written I wanted to put my arms around him and comfort him.We each grieve in different ways, so I thought Mom was just ""coping"" the best she knew how....I thought Dad was in bits because that was how he was grieving.But Chief Inspector Sejer who is 'on the case' has picked up on some troubling parts of Moms story.I would have given this 5 stars but for some repeated paragraphs in this which annoyed me, I thought I was re reading a section all over again...Karin Fossum is a wonder author who really knows how to spin a tale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB0G5DHQZICJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5H3XTO#wasThisHelpful","RB0G5DHQZICJF","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another fabulous book from the Estate Series.I just love this series.Have you seen these ""real life"" documentaries lately on the TV? Like Benefit street and such? If you are in the UK then I am sure you have heard of it if not watched it.There are the lower poor, the middle poor and the 'upper' poor. Like on a lot of Estates there are ups and downs and arguments, things going on in the street, things going on behind closed doors. I felt like I was chatting to someone over the garden fence whilst reading this and getting the ""gossip"".Every Estate has an Housing Officer that 'sorts stuff out' and we see this in the previous books as well. Or least, they try to.As with all Estates, you get all kinds of people living all different walks of life and this is told through the this series. We meet Caren who has returned [reluctantly] back on the Estate she so dearly wanted to leave far far behind. Only to come face to face with Gina Bradley. The nasty pasty!And as human nature has it on these Estates, there is always the ones that think they rule the roost and Gina and her family are ITWe see a battle going on here, not with fists, oh no, with a ploy to get someone's husband and its now PAY BACK TIMEMel Sherratt knows just how to make this kind of life real. If anyone has lived on this kind of territory in their life, this is so true to it. As near.When younger, and married with my first child, I lived on an Estate and I tell you, the goings on there were just unbelievable. I was twitching my curtains 24/7 wondering who was going to come out fighting next in the street.Thank God I don't live in such an area now I am older. So relating to this series was easy for me, its real.Its human and I know plenty who live in places where they just don't know what on earth is going 'down' next.Brilliant read.Now I am jumping into her next book.

"This was a great story to sneak under my duvet last night as start to read. I didn't expect I would be still reading and hearing the birds tweet outside my bedroom window telling me it was early morning. I got so carried away with this. Needless to say, I slept in later.This has all the elements of what I would call, survival suspense.After the plane crash and before the plane the plane crash, those are the main themes of the chapter through the book.I have to say that at times I got a bit frustrated, I wanted to 'gee it up a bit' because some things were taking ages to pan out. But we got there in the end, as you do.A plane crash changed not only the survivors but also the relatives of those that were involved, we see that plainly from the event.We see secrets and lies too.Lillian and Dave were marooned on this Island, they didn't feel they had much time left to live. That was poignant.Also, I think the thing that enriched this read, well.....there were several really, but this is a gentle love story, the romance was exquisite.This is not a straight forward tale of a woman who was a survivor of a plane crash, this has a much wider scope, far more than is in the blurb.I am definitely looking forward to reading more from this author.** Thank you to Lake Union Publishing via Net Galley for my copy **","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONW9YKPVXW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAJZDIM#wasThisHelpful","RONW9YKPVXW5","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the author contacted me and asked if I would like to read this in exchange for my honest and open review. I looked at the blurb and it enticed me in.We have a young women here, she is in a marriage that becomes abusive, frightening, she decided to flee, to escape. Get right away from him as far as she can.However, is this going to be as easy as that? You bet not. Men like that do not just let that happen, so he pursues her and she is on the run.She meets Bill in New Zealand. She has a a shoot there which involves her work.Sometimes I found this quite confusingThe first half of the book too me to places in my mind wondering what I was reading. I have to be honest in that it failed to take my attention until the second half of the book. I would have put this down but for my stubborn attitude to finish this. I won't give up without a fight.I adore the cover. I loved the plot, but not unlike some similar ones I have read, just tweaked a bit.Its got some real room for scope and a bit of tweaking, but.......that is only MY opinion and you the reader has to decide.Its not a WOW book for me, but its an OK book once I got into the 2nd half.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140FNRZOLH3EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01023C8XQ#wasThisHelpful","R140FNRZOLH3EL","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't you just love people who have it all and want more.I am aware that not all marriages are what they seem to be , but I also know that when you have a loving husband and children, you are rich.None of us have all our ""needs"" met, no one. No matter what those ""needs"" are. But we hopefully balance them up with what we have which is goodNope, not Karen, she is a selfish woman. A woman who has a husband who loves her, twin daughters, a gorgeous home and a successful job.But Karen is unhappy right. So what does she do? She has two lovers, yep, that's right, she has two lovers. Its all a secret .But of course, you can't have one affair let alone two without something about to give. And Karen is becoming more and more distant from her husband.There are some RED hot sexy scenes and some MATURE talk so be aware of this. Its paramount to the story though, shows Karen in her light.Of course, this life style of Karen's is not going to hold and her extra marital affairs are creeping over into her daily life. She's coming home later and later, things are getting neglected. At times, I thought Karen lost the entire plot except when she was in the arms of her lovers.Her husband then suspects his wife.Something happens, an important ""something"" that has dire consequences for their future.Secrets can never stay secrets for long.But once its all out there in the open, can they rebuild their marriage, their family life?Some do, some don't.You have to see what happens and what occurs.My hat goes off to Ben Burgess, this just shows a man can write a story like this just as well as any female author [which I have read plenty like this] and he has written this beautifully. Created real life like characters that are believable, there is a ""Karen"" out there somewhere, maybe several. That is what makes this story stand up, its reality to some. Unfortunately this is the sad case and the sad world we live in now. Morals are all over the place and Karen's was way off the scale.I know there are a few of my buddy readers who would love to read this so I will be recommending this to them.My thanks to this authors Publicist and to the author himself for my copy.I will be looking forward to future books from him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZZU489I6DGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WNRZ6HU#wasThisHelpful","R1WZZU489I6DGL","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful story, its well written and easy on the eye as well as not too deep.We get to meet Freya. She is devastated, her husband and son are lost at sea. She doesn't know how to cope or how to move on.She feels that returning to the Lighthouse cottage they used to stay in will help her, so that is where she goes to stay.Her memories are poignant and emotional.This author really can write clear emotions, grief as it comes to you from the written word.Freya's mind has 'flashbacks' which we are readers are given privvy to her feelings, her thoughts and her emotions.There are letters involved in this too which seem to enhance the story and Freya.I was shocked by the mythology as I wasn't expecting that, it was so well done and just added an entire different dimension to what I was reading.A stranger gets washed up on the shore, this leads to an entire different route which was leading me down somewhere that I was wondering ""What on earth is going to happen now""She also has in her possession her son's diary. How that made her feel......well, you will need to read this to find out.Its full of emotion, raw with grief and a dip into the past where the letters are concerned.This was a book that stayed with me yesterday until today and will stay with me in the future.Melissa Bailey writes a very heart felt story that will entice any reader into its web.I was totally lost within its pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LRONSL6DTMRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFALYU8#wasThisHelpful","R1LRONSL6DTMRP","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She died early on in the book and we get to see how he has custody of his child and how the Grandparent also get visiting rights.The thing is, the Grandparents didn't used to be interested before his wife died.It moves along quite nicely and the plot is tight and interesting. You feel for the guy and also for the kidnapped daughter. However, I did feel the Mom took a back seat too early, but it had to be the case I guess so that the author could move the story at a faster pace and into the next area of this story.I guessed where the daughter was. Its not hard. You don't really need a degree to gather who kidnapped her. That being said, it still doesn't minus anything from the story. Its still a good read.What lengths would you go to for your child if she was kidnapped. What lengths would you go to so that you could keep them safe. No different from this chap.Oh yes, did I mention a murder.........Yep that is in it too which made it intriguing.I liked this story, a lot. Just some things that lacked a bit of backbone, but all in all, I would recommend this to those that like a bit of murder, mystery, on the run, kidnap, religious beliefs and a bit of political anarchy thrown in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34Y4WHD4BFH4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3B0SN4#wasThisHelpful","R34Y4WHD4BFH4O","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh Yikes.I haven't read such an unusual way such as this in writing a psychological thriller. Its really interesting....Once I got into the first couple of chapters.It was a bit of a slow burning for me, but the fire was flickering all the time below the surface telling me that I should stick with this.....so I did, and boy oh boy I am so glad I did.This has got narcissist in this most definitely. Self gratification with every measure. Lots of egotistical elements that just surround SETH he introduces actress Rebecca to the Friday Folly's.They meet regular discussing their talents, life, drinking and getting quite leery.Seth definitely likes endless praise, hence narcissist to the max.Then among the Friday Folly's club one night things take a turn......for the worse.....and not all seems as it should be.THEN SETH GOES MISSING and things begin to change....This is written in such a way that it could be enacted like a play, its very well crafted and I will certainly be wanting more from the author.

"Blind Trust has a lovely cover doesn't it. I am a sucker for a good book cover. To me, its presentation to a book, so 10/10 for that.The story itself has reached a 3.5 for me, it was a very good storyline, good plot, but sometimes fell by the wayside a little for me.Kyle Shultz is/as...an assassin , hard, dedicated and good at what he did.But something happens where he decides to go off the radar. Can that happen with an Assassin? no. Of course not.There are many after his blood.Valerie Harper has a mission to fulfill. Mark who she needs, do not fraternize with your target and never speak or get involved with the enemyOf course, that doesn't happen and all sorts of complications erupt from this.My personal thoughtsGood well thought out story.I could see upfront what was going to happen, there are a few twists in here but a little predictable, not a bad thing, but would have liked to have been kept lurking for the answers sometimes.I found Valerie at first having all the attributes and horrid qualities that go along with her ""mission"" then she seemed to change from a bad ass to someone weak and needy [or was that just me?]It was a little bit like James Bond stories. However, look how far and how many films have been made of that.I have a feeling there are going to be varied degrees of reviews on this and I can't wait for others thoughts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HLQZUALLWID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OGEEH6#wasThisHelpful","R25HLQZUALLWID","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So why haven't I read one of Tim Weavers books before? That's going to change!I have been so enthralled and so deeply enmeshed in this book it would have been hard pressed to move me in an earthquake.This really did grab me right from the start.The storyline in this is so good, its nothing that I expected and much more, very much more.I thought it was going to be all about this detective who couldn't pull away from an unsolved crime [see authors blurb description] but its more detailed than this and included the detective himself.This has so much RAW emotion inside it, its unreal, I didn't expect to feel anything like the emotions I felt, not at all.The detective becomes a missing person and you are on the edge of this for its entirety so, turn your phone off, don't answer the door, put up a DO NOT BE DISTURBED sign on your location. You really need to read this from start to finish. My kindle said 11 hours........so either get someone else to cook dinner, throw something in the slow cooker and get them to help themselves or get them to phone for take out.Did I love this? You bet.If you've not read a book by this author can I urge you to read this.I so want to read the rest of the Rake series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PCVLYVIDS41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718181670#wasThisHelpful","R22PCVLYVIDS41","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mudder Infuser Water Bottle.This bottle Infuser has saved me money. I am into drinking more water in aide of my loosing weight and keeping of fizzy drinks. This is a natural way to get the infused flavor from any fruit or a mixture of fruit I fancy.At the top of the bottle there is a flip lid. I have to say that the seal is very tight compared to another brand my son has in his possession. I have tried this out and it doesn't leak. Its firm in place.When you tip it to drink from the flap doesn't come down on you and flap you on the nose like some I could mention. It stays firmly erect. Until you manually cover it.At the bottom you unscrew it and inside is a tube. The tube has slits in for the infused areas.The slits are not big, so this means you won't get bits of your fruit seeping into your water.This company has put a lot of thought into this creation.Once you fill this up with fruit of your choice, add the water that surrounds it and seal it. I then put mine in the fridge for a couple of hours.I love pineapple so that was my first choice. I have to say, I am very impressed with mine and intend to purchase one for my son as he is always complaining about certain things with his. I don't think he will have a problem with this one!It is solidly made and molded well for holding.There is a little tag where you can hang this onto a bike or an area you need to leave it, maybe a belt.Its made of Eco Friendly material which we need to be more aware of these days, so that's 100% thumbs up for me too.Its very easy to clean. That's another thing about this product.Although this may look flimsy in the photo's, may I assure you that it is not, its solid and very durable.I am very happy with my Mudder Infuser water bottle and the added bonus is, I have not only chilled flavored water but a healthy snack that is left from my fruit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBTSSCUP7PN0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PV05EE#wasThisHelpful","RBTSSCUP7PN0L","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this story would appeal to us middle aged bracket women who feel they are in a rut. You get to that age where all seems like drudgery and hard work and you forget about the rewards and achievements you have reached and what you have gains by experience and attained.A ""plan"" is drawn up between herself and her husband, to work abroad and gain some financial security while she stays home rearing the kids and seeing to their home.But as we know, all the best laid plans.............I read the long blurb on this and was expecting more than what I got I think.There is an awful lot in this book, maybe a little too much with her coming into contact with two of her exes?One would have been enough for her to struggle over I thought.You may enjoy it, so don't be put off with my review because on the whole is was well written but I just think with the long blurb I was expecting much more than I got.My thanks go to Cameron Publicity & Marketing Ltd via Net Galley for my copy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38KAQJW9W5EVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784624128#wasThisHelpful","R38KAQJW9W5EVK","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hadn't heard anything about this book or author until I agreed to read it for Red Adept Publishing, and agreed to be on the tour.Having read what the book was about it seemed I had a good chance of settling down and enjoying it.I need to say though, its on a slow burner for me at the start and didn't start picking up and get my full attention until half way into the book.I am not much into boats, fishermen and lobster catching, but I have to say, I did learn a lot along the way, so I guess that was a bonus.When this book took off for me I really threw through the pages as it was then starting to get very very interesting.James is married to Maya. James is a Social worker who used to be 'hands on' working for the abuse children protection side of things, now he is on the telephones and works mostly in the office. We learn about James past as we read along which was surprisingly heart rending due to him going back in his mind and we see how the author actually showed us readers the experience he had when young.I really felt for James.Maya works as a Detective for the Police force. She is strong, hard and needs to be all what she needs to be when working among her peers. Only James gets to see her ""soft"" side.James gets to meet a lad named Kevin. He notices he has bruises in places and is concerned about him. But when he gets to meet Kevin's father and mother, his suspicions change as they seem a lovely couple so James relaxes. As time goes on the two couples bond and spend time together.Maya has a big job going down, she is on the case of a drug related crime.This story goes to an unexpected turn of events that really enthrall you. You then get to grasp all the characters involved.The author David Rawding has really pulled some great characters out of the bag, so believable and as for the fishing? Well, let me say that I even got used to that and the lobster catching. Learnt a lot about the sea Police and the nets.Secrets. Secrets and lies. Doe they really stayed buried? And if they did, should they? And if they didn't, do you wish they had!I loved reading this despite the slow start and take off for me.So my thanks to the author and Red Adept Publishing, LLC plus Net Galley for my copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ODJAKOELRC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940215552#wasThisHelpful","R15ODJAKOELRC0","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First let me say this is an 'unputdownable' read.Secondly let me say, you need to put time away because you won't be able to leave this book until you have read it from cover to cover.Well, this was what it was like for me.Stella [her real name is Grace, but in the escort business she likes to be called Stella] she pampers to the whims, needs and sexual appetites of her clients. For money.It wasn't always like this for Stella, she was a respected member of society but something happened, and you will need to read this to find out.One of the girls is found murdered and Stella finds herself enmeshed in this. And as Stella becomes near to the truth uncovering endless things, its starting to look very very dangerous for Stella.Let me say, if you are adverse to sexual scenes and graphically written, then you may find this disturbing. I need to say though, they are vital to the writing of this book, the author doesn't keep back any punches and its realistic to the core. Not showing, not for tittilation its paramount for our understanding of the charactersThis is a story with many layers, layers that are revealed in stages, its really really addictive reading.I can't believe this is a debut novel.

"I was contacted by the author Taylor Kitchings to ask if I would be interested in giving my viewpoint on Yard War as it was up on Net Galley and seeing as I am a member, maybe I would like to 'give it a go'.So I did.I am really glad that my attention was brought to this book because its a very profound read.Its set in the South in the 60's. Its paramount subject matter is racism.We have two young youths named Trip and Dee, they form a good friendship. A bond.Trips family employ a maid. This is quite common so not unusual at all. but her son is named Dee.So this is where the problem lies.This is also based around the time of the Civil war movement. So its a good history lesson for any YA who wants to become familiar with aspects and race hatred around that time.Trip leads a privileged where he lives in Jackson, Mississippi. His father is a doctor and his Mother is of high standing in society from a well breed background.Dee and Trip are kicking a ball around the yard, nothing wrong with that, but remember, this is in the South and the year is 1960's, there is everything wrong, one is white, one is black.Neighbors looked down on this and lots of fuss and bother ensue.But Dee and Trip's bond is not to be broken.At times I found some things not to be realistic. Let me explain.Tim had a teacher which was quite liberal in her teaching and her emotions and own personal thoughts did get in the way of teaching. Could she remain in that teaching profession unnoticed to be biased? I just wasn't sure.The I could well imagine the segregation of the blacks from the whites, the prejudices that were so well documented.I personally am not racist so at times found this hard to read, and I had to keep reminding myself that this is FACT and this is really how it was. And in some cases still is.I thought this author did a superb job in keeping it inline with historical events as close as could be [this it to what I had read about and not from this book, or media news from the past]I can imagine this book to be a good read for a book class to open a great discussion that could lead to great essays etc.Thank you to the author for drawing my attention to your book.

"This is the third book in this series [which I didn't realize at the time] but after saying that, I don't think it made a difference, well, not to me, I seemed to be able to pick the story up well. Maybe its one of those 'themed' series which have the same main characters but issue different story plots.This is what you call a 'cozy mystery' its nothing too deep, bit like Miss Marples, or a 'whodunnit' you watch like a little drama on TV on daytime telly. The ending not being finished and you need to watch the next episode.However, I read a lot of books and leaving cliff hangers can be awesome if you get the complete series at one purchase, however, realistically it may be a year before you get the next book, by that time, I would have read so many other books I would have forgotten and had to recap.If you don't read many books, and just pick one up now and again on your bedside table to read lightly before going to bed, then I would say, go for it. By the time you read this then the next book may be released, but for an avid reader like me I was left hanging, and now I shall want to know who it was........until.....another book grabs me and this one will fade into distant memory.I would gladly read books by this author again and again, but with cliff hangers like this and having to wait ages for the next book, I would have to refresh my memory!A first class Cozy Mystery.*Thanks to the author and to Kensington Books for my copy to read and review *","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30MIYLTKKKOPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53BX30#wasThisHelpful","R30MIYLTKKKOPS","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is set on a low income estate where in itself reap problems and we hear there are more crimes committed than anywhere else.This book opens with a 'grab you by the throat and pulls you in' kind of start, which I absolutely loved, that being said, I had to sit and read it in one sitting with hardly leaving my seat until I finished it.I had an inclination as to who the culprit was, but to be sure, I just had to read to the end as you get left in doubt with your suspicion now and again saying ""am I wrong? am I right?""I don't think comparing her to Angela Marsons [author] was a great move, because Angela's books are just a little more 'accepting' for me as she does write very well and I do find Helen's books sometimes a little too far explained instead of realizing that the reader has a brain and can read between the lines, sometimes things are just a little too far explained.There is a good introduction to the 'flawed' characters that will be around in this series and I am sure we are going to learn a lot more.I just found some explainations a little irritating as it was just over done.

"Just now and again you come across a book that just 'blows your'e socks off' and this is just the one for me. I have a few new debut authors this year that has surprised me SO much with their talent, its just Unbelievable that this is Gilly Macmillan's FIRST book.My kindle says it will take around ten hours for me to read it. Well, the time just flew by.I also need to say, it was fantastic to know all the places in this read as it was based in Bristol where I live.This is an emotive read, its an enthralling read, it touches you in places in your heart that you just cannot step back from and refuse to actually feel not only for the Mother of the missing child, but also for her ex husband, and, I have to say, the DI and the Police all surrounding this story.You can tell this author has really done her homework.As each chapter passes you from Mom, to Dad, to DI and to manuscripts, phone calls, and interviews, its one hell of a journey.I really cannot rave about this book enough, I am utterly astounded that this author has just this one single book out and that she is not a long standing author with heaps of books out there on the shelves. I hope I get to read many, many more of her books if they are anything like this.Its not just the subject matter I am writing about, its her style, its her indepth ability to be able to put into words the characters feelings, suffering, emotions that reach out to you and make you actually feel them too.Its not often a book brings a lump to my throat, but the ending certainly did. Not just in the final chapter but the Mother's words towards the end.The feelings of her ex husband and what ripple effect it had on him.This is like stories we read about in the newspaper, this is what we Twitter......Facebook.....""Has anyone seen this boy"".....And we even get an insight to the media attention not only from the paparazzi, but also from someone like you or I making comments on blogs, or social media about it all.I want to tell everyone, if you like a good story that you can really get lost into and have umpteen suspects running through your head but not know for sure who is can be......THIS IS IT.I want to thank Little, Brown Book Group UK but also the author, because this book gave me endless hours of suspense and escapism.A truly amazing debut novel.

"Although this is classified as YA, I personally think anyone can read this. I am middle aged and I loved this book. Its definitely a WOW what happened there....This is jam packed with an emotional read, two friends, Delia and June. Both are so very different in character. Whilst Delia comes across wild and out of control at times, June comes across as more mild. I think Delia brings confidence to June, until......Delia leaves a suicide note.This is where action starts to happen. June knows the fear Delia has of a fire so, why would she commit suicide where fire is involved? It doesn't add up.Then, she gets to know that Delia's boyfriend feels she was killed and not that Delia took her own life.The hunt is on..I feel so differently about this story compared to some reviews I have read, I liked this book, I liked it a lot. It kept me thinking, it kept my attention and I thought the author did a fantastic job with the plot.It didn't appear messy or confusing, I followed it very well and the ending was a surprise to me that I didn't expect, which is another plus for me.I would certainly read more from this author and say, read this for yourself, because I thoroughly enjoyed the writing and the plot.**Thank you to Egmont Publishing via Net Galley for my copy**","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6SNNLB8VVFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148141853X#wasThisHelpful","R3I6SNNLB8VVFP","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very powerful read from Fern Michaels which I thoroughly enjoyed as it kept my attention from start to finish.Its not your usual chic lit, its got suspense, mystery and will keep you wondering throughout its many pages.I saw a different style to this authors writing in this book, it was verging on the thriller type of read.It starts off with something happening, but quite what, you just don't get to the exact bottom of it.Then Casey is in a mental institution after being found wandering. Shes been in there now for ten years or more and no one knows how she got in this state, what happened to her. Only the person concerned, which is of course Casey.Casey has amnesia, which means there are several flash backs to keep up with.Its not difficult to keep moving along with it as its very fast paced.When Casey has to relive her past over again its a tragedy that no one wants to go through.This is a thriller. Its not a romance, not her usual kind of stories and I tell you what, I loved it because I love dark reads like this.I do hope she writes more like this with this style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDE7NK12HB4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53BXR6#wasThisHelpful","RCDE7NK12HB4J","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never wondered what it would be like to never go out. To not socialize with others, shop, walk to the car, catch a bus.Ava has an illness. It disables her in life. She has a crippling anxiety disorder that no one can see. Inside is a woman who is sensitive, emotional, reasons and has a good sense of well being, balance and quirkiness. All but for her disabling phobia.She lives in Iowa, but her aunt has just died and has left her the house in London. She has several tasks and things to follow that her aunt has left her to do. She actually won't own the property until the tasks are completed.We have an insight to how strong this women really is, we also see how emotional strength can come to the fore when needed. We experience the inside fight Ava has with herself. Its not easy, none of these tasks are easy for her.The best part is when Ava becomes friends with drag queens! This really has a good side to this story too, and I laughed out loud [in a good way] on some of these quirks and what Ava finds herself getting into and who she thinks she is in love with.Its a 'gotta read' as its much more than meets the eye.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSYB8QUSWR3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53E0EY#wasThisHelpful","R2GSYB8QUSWR3L","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love this author, and I have read several of her books now. I was sat, ready to devour this one, its over 400 pages long. I thought and imagined there was a lot inside to read about.I have to say, its an OK read but compared to the others I have read it just didn't seem up to her standard.Ellen has ran to Ireland to stay with her aunt Peg, Peg is just someone she recently heard of because her Mother had kept secrets from her about her roots to Ireland.Ellen has ran from her Mother and her fiance.Her Mother has several secrets, but I just wished they weren't revealed too early on in the story as I felt the rest of chapters lost interest for me from then on.As she gets to know Aunt Peg and the large Irish family, she is in awe of the relaxed happiness she is feeling being with them, her brand new family.She has time to reflect on her life and what she wants from it.Her Mother rejected this family years ago. Why?And does she want a life with her fiance?She meets a widower, his name is Connor, there is an almost instant attraction.Ellen has to decide what to do.And what are the other secrets in her life that are being kept from her?I did enjoy reading it, but felt I had ploughed through a large book that really could have been condensed and just was enlarge by writing that was not needed to be there.Of course, these are just my thoughts on this book, read it for yourself and see what you think.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF5X9LC30UPX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476735387#wasThisHelpful","RF5X9LC30UPX1","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My thanks go to Random House UK, Cornerstone and Net Galley for my copy.We meet Axi, she is an altogether girl, works hard and studies hard, never in trouble and a perfectly ""good Girl"" however, she has this deep yearning inside herself where she just wants to pack up and get away from it all.She is also in love with her best friend.Robinson.The thing is, should she tell him and risk loosing his friendship if he doesn't return the feelings? Or should she wait and see and accept what is meant to be?They both come from dysfunctional families.Robinson thinks they should just ""get away from it all"" wherein lies the Bonnie & Clyde type lifestyle.They are on the run from the Police.Then things take a turn, and when all is revealed about feelings, you will have to read and find out.But then something happens which reminds me of Fault in their stars, I saw the Movie and read the book.

"Yes! This author has left me wanting more and right nowThis is book 1 in a brand new crime series by Joanne Clancy. I have read other books by this author and she never ceases to astound me, her writing is always spot on for a reader, she starts off at a tremedous rate that only keeps you gasping for more as each page you flip.Ross Campbell vanished from the face of the earth. He was wanted by the Police. He was a Serial Killer. TEAR DROPAll becomes clear why he is nick named Tear drop as you read on.Elizabeth Ireland, a former detective with The Metropolitan Police [now turned Private Investigator} was the main lead Investigator back then.Then it seems the Serial Killer has come back, ready to start again.There is an Irish reporter working for an Irish newspaper who receives a letter, this points to all and sundry that Ross Campbell is back and starting his killings again.Everything points to the fact and there seems to be deaths mirroring the same type of crimes.Elizabeth is invited to come and involve herself in the case as she was vital to the role before several years earlier. Which she takes up. However, not all goes to plan.Elizabeth has a secret of her own. Its a secret that I can feel many times within the book, I can feel Elizabeth sweating it out, as she changes the subject many times, I don't know how she coped with the secret.Someone else is brought back to, he is now what you call a Profiler. He takes all the facts and makes them into a profile of the Killer. Not all the Police are welcome to new ideas, however, there are those that can see the logic in it.Preston though is part of Elizabeth's past, there is some tension to be had.The author has thought this plot through and had me fooled. I had three suspects, then it was two. I was completely wrong on all counts.Personally I really do not know how she came up with the superb storyline but I really need book 2 and fast.How did it make me feelThat I was breathing this book. I didn't even go to sleep until the early hours because I wanted to finish it. I wanted to carry on until the conclusion because this is how this author makes you feel. You can't rest until you have read the entire book, I kid you not.I would definitely recommend this book, its a 5 * from me because it had all the elements for a thriller.Crime, intrigue, edge of your seat, biting my nails, making the reader think they 'got it and worked it all out', only to find you are off the mark.The flow of this book was fast paced, no dips, or no dull moments, well, not for me anyhow.I want to thank the author for my copy. Superb piece of craftmanship.I need the next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZE68JFSRZ1IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515187993#wasThisHelpful","R1ZE68JFSRZ1IZ","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can certainly see why this book won awards, ** numerous awards and 2015 Beverly Hills Book Awards finalist in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Non-Fiction category. It was also a 2014 National Indie Excellence Awards finalist in the LGBT Non-Fiction category; and the 2013 New England Book Festival winner in the Gay Literature category.**This is a book that I had to read in one sitting.We see how Alex meet Adam, we read how they totally loved each other. Alex was so smitten with Adam, she was looking forward to marrying him, starting a family and living a lovely 'normal' family life together.We can 'feel' the love coming from the pages as you read of her experiences and her feelings.This is the story of Alex, this is the story of her marriage, this is the story of her husband's revelation, this is her lifeI totally had a 'gobsmacked' moment with the way that she discovered her husband's ""secret"". How heart wrenching. I felt her world collapse around her.I also felt for Adam in the way he has had to hide his gender dysphoria.I did wonder that once the shock had settled how and why Alex took a different view on her relationship with Adam. Love cannot be switched on and off. I was expecting them to remain together, but is that more like reading a fairytale? Who knows, but there are marriages that did sustain the gender change and also keep the sexuality. After all, it was just the body that changed.Then again, I had second thoughts, could I? I am not sure, we cannot judge something that we haven't been through ourselves can we.Society is a horrid place, people do judge you, and I really think that won't go away. What needs to happen is for that person to be helped to be strong enough to cope.This is a well written book, she really knows how to tell her story with feelings.My downside was; there were far too much detail at the start of the book, I know the foundation had to be laid but it took almost half the book up and for the ""inquisitive"" reader with a window into someone else's life, we want to get to the core of it much quicker.I think one sentence will stay with me from this book:""How do you grieve for someone who isn't really dead?""Grieving for a marriage that once was in your hands to have, grieving for a partner that looks like someone else, grieving for a family that won't materialize. Hopes and dreams shattered.Media attention.I really do hope that Alex finds a partner to love and be loved in the way she needs.And Adam, I am glad he found peace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7X96DWPDQUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609115384#wasThisHelpful","R3K7X96DWPDQUL","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading the blurb, I was looking forward to getting 'stuck in' to read this.I thought to myself, this won't take long to read as its only a short novel.Well yes it is a short book, but WOW it has so much body to it that I felt I had just read a full 300 page novel. Its full of 'punches, blows and OMG moments'.I can't believe this is a new author in the making they write so well that you would think they were established in their field for many years.This story had my attention right from the start.IVY and her envy really does deliver a punch.One thing I have established so far is, I do not want to meet Ivy. I'll read about her in a book [safely] but I do not want to shake her hand! That is for sure.How can she think those thoughts and do what she did.I loved how the statement of her Grandmother came back to haunt in through the pages.The Grandmother's words certainly came back and bit her on the butt.OMGThe ending? In one statement of abbreviation sums up my thoughts of the ending OMGMany times we readers say ""I didn't see that coming"", well, I am going to reiterate that and say.....neither did I.Would I recommend this book to you?YESIf you like love, envy, suspense, biting your nails, not being interrupted when you are reading and the shock factor then yes, I definitely recommend this book to you","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15JS1Z5W2LXX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVFYYTM#wasThisHelpful","R15JS1Z5W2LXX0","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to start off by thanking the author and the tour host for allowing my request to go through and for me to read this. I don't often read blog tour hosts books, I just tend to promote them as I am not sure I can schedule them into my reading matter, but this one I just had to squeeze in as I was attracted to the opening words. I am a sucker for a sad story.Ryan is left with his twelve year old daughter to bring up. His wife, the love of his life, his forever love and soul mate had died tragically. A gallbladder operation that left fatal complications.He mourns his wife along with his daughter.Olivia his daughter and him have a GREAT relationship and there are some really crazy fun moments when they are ""messing around"" and teasing, but there is equally some proper Father and daughter chats that are there, especially the teenage rebellious times.I thought Ryan a great fantastic Father, he did his job well.Amber moves into town, she takes over her Grandmother's bakery.When Amber meets Ryan, just watch out that spark that ignites from the pages doesn't burn your fingers as you turn the pages, WOW, instant........sex appeal.This story shows, that you can find love after loss, eventhough you may not feel that possible.When Ryan's world collapsed at the loss of his beautiful wife, leaving him with their daughter, who knew what life would have in store for him and his daughter.Many a tear can be shed, many a lump and hard swallow in your throat and many a 'pass me the tissue' moments.I loved this style of writing and I do believe this is the first book I have ever read by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AATYJAXOD4U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1680582437#wasThisHelpful","R3AATYJAXOD4U5","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying, I hang on every single book this author writes. I just love her work, even before I got a Kindle I was a regular reader of hers.Now I actually years later get to understand what the importance is of leaving a review.She just cannot write fast enough for me.Her last book was so good, I haven't forgotten it at all, even though I have read many more books in between. I am sure this author excels herself every time; just when I think she is going to run out of stories she comes up with another brilliant plot.Justine is the Mom of a teenage girl. Like all teens they can be up and down in their moods, but her daughter has set her heart of becoming ""famous"" and apparently has the talent for it.I loved the daughter and Mom relationship between them. I thought Justine handled her daughter so well.Justine also has a son. Ben.Ben isn't your typical son though and is very hard work to the point of being odd which can most times be put down to being a teenager .At the start of the book we are taken back and forth. This is vital to the story, so please keep with it as its paramount to what its leading up to.You read what is going to happen and what has happened.Justine has a friend Cheryl. Cheryl has problems of her own, but the two women are very close.I loved the dialogue between them.Going back to Ben. He is an odd he doesn't get along with his sister at all, and I am not sure at first who wound who up, but it was obvious towards the end.Some of the things they said and called each other, I do feel Justine or her husband Matt should have been much stricter about and stood no nonsense.Matt and Justine have a solid relationship. They have experienced two miscarriages.Justine finds herself pregnant again.Not sure how the two oldest children will take the news she is quite apprehensive as you can imagine.Meanwhile Ben is acting odd. He's up in the tree casting stones at cows. Doesn't talk to his parents if he can help it.There is a part of the book which takes us forward to when Justine has had the baby and gone to a part of her past where her Grandmother used to live. No longer living with Matt.The two sections are confusing at the start, but once you get your head around it, I tell you truthfully you will be hooked from chapter to chapter like I was.There is so much more to this book and this story than I can ever let on to you.If you asked me if you should read it. I would definitely say YES.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LJNEUGQNQE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549554#wasThisHelpful","R12LJNEUGQNQE9","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has it allMystery, Tragedy, Trauma, Abduction, Abuse, Romance and a huge big enormous amount of energy in its pages that keep you hookedAbuse and abduction is not the most ""nicest"" of subject matter to read, but there is nothing explicit. More the 'hint' factor.BLURB says :Sixteen-year-old Laura Macnamara walked out her backdoor and disappeared without a traceBUT why?We get to understand why later in the book.Mitch Saunders is a Detective. He takes some time off because his sister is missing.He remembers the case of Laura years before, he was actually the lead in it, but it was shelved as a ""cold case"", no sightings, no body, no conclusion.Now his sister is missing.He knows she is a drug addict. His Mother and himself have tried all kinds of help to get her off of it, rehab didn't work. Near death experiences didn't either.We see Mitch hunting his sister down relentlessly throughout the most down and out druggy places you could imagine.Mitch discovers a familiar connection between the disappearance of Laura years ago and now his sister. There is one person in common with both.Mitch comes upon Charlie. We learn early on that Charlie is in fact LAURA. The missing teenager from years ago.Mitch has grown fond of Charlie. But will his relationship with Laura [Charlie] stop him from finding his sister?NOTHING will get in the way of him finding his sister. Nothing at all.Not even Laura's secret.Not even Laura's hiding.Not even Laura asking him not to.What will Laura do?Laura has more than one secret herself.This book turned out much better than I was expecting , I am not sure what I was expecting really, but I certainly wasn't expecting to be kept awake most of the night finishing this book because I couldn't leave it alone, truly, I stayed up to finish it and was hanging the next day!If you get a chance to read this, I urge you to as its certainly a full blown story, plenty of action in this one, plenty of things to think about and plenty of different slants on many avenues within the book.Mitche's mother had my full sympathy when she was blaming herself for her daughters drug addiction.Like all us Moms, we always blame ourselves don't we.Fabulous book that brought out emotions within the characters personality that you could visualize. I think that is another reason why I loved the writing so much, the explanations of how the body language was with each feeling with each emotion, yes, this book is high ranking at the top pile.I'm off to see what else this author has written.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRYA08NT1AM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAM9NUG#wasThisHelpful","R3HRYA08NT1AM","A103M7E0BSFC83","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A103M7E0BSFC83?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When reviewers say ""I couldn't put this book down"" I'm like....Okay Okay.Now I am going to say it...I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!I really couldn't leave this book alone today, I was glued to it. Honestly. NO I haven't read book 1, and I still didn't think that I have lost anything by it. Well, no excitement wise or edge of my seat wise.A young girl, on her bike goes swimming, on the way back gets a flat tyre.A man sees her struggling and is heading the way she is, maybe he could give her a lift? She refuses.He drives up further seeing her struggle with her punctured bike, maybe he could take the bike for her and she could make faster pace by walking instead of being hindered by this bike?OK, good idea.That is when she gets kidnapped.I love a good start to a book! I'm an addict for a book to open well, I want to be literally THROWN shoved and mixed right up within its first pages, wow, this one did it for me. At the ending, it spit me out!The intense feelings within this, the raw emotions, you could smell it. You could feel it. Honestly, it GRABBED you.

Its sorta creepy.

"For all the thousands of books I've read, I can count on one hand how many I haven't finished.  Too my surprise and sadness, I'm adding a Maya Banks novel to that elusive little collection.  I made it, albeit barely, through 60% of the book and the bottom line is I simply don't care what happens, which speaks for itself.  I truly love the KGI series, so please don't vote my review as unhelpful just because you love Maya Banks, I normally do too. She's among my favorites in romantic suspense along with Pamela Clare, Christy Reece, and Cindy Gerard, but this book is just so wrong on so many levels.  When I learned this book was about Hancock, I thought he'd make a worthy male hero even though we had proof of his less than honorable actions in previous books, I figured there was a really good reason behind it.  So I find myself at a loss that to summarize this book, we find ourselves reading about a serial killer from a terrorist cell, who's selfishness and fanaticism is equal to the terrorists he's hunting down and the prisoner, who's suffering from a major case of Stockholm Syndrome, he falls in love with.  I know it sounds harsh, but if you break it down to its simplest elements, it's truly what you have here.  I imagine there's an HEA in there, but I don't want to read it, because quite frankly, he doesn't deserve it.  Spoilers are included.Honor Cambridge is the sole survivor on an attack at her aid camp in the Middle East by a fanatical group called ANE.  To show their strength, they'll stop at nothing to finish the job so the hunt is on to find Honor.  Meanwhile, other uber bad guys are also looking for Honor to show their strength over ANE, starting with a guy named Bristow, who wants to rape and torture her before he dangles her before another baddy named Maksimov, who also wants to rape and torture her, but will also ultimately hand her back over to ANE, where she will, you guessed it, rape and torture her for as long as she can last before dealing the final death blow after much begging. Where Hancock and his team come into play is that they've taken it on themselves to take out Maksimov and they haven't been able to get close to him yet, so they see this as an opportunity by capturing and turning Honor over to, first Bristow, and then Maksimov.  Ugh.The more than 200 pages I read can be summed up in one word.  Repetitive.  It's a wash, rinse, repeat of the same inner dialogue of what a bastard Hancock is for sacrificing Honor, literally and metaphorically.  We get it, it's a s***ty thing, so why are you doing it?  Therein lies the serial killer bit.  It's not his only option, but it's his easiest option.  I always wondered why they had to shoot Resnick IN THE HEAD when they only needed access to his files.  Couldn't they simply incapacitate him?  Nope, they're serial killers.  Unfortunately for all of them, Honor is, well, honorable, thus ensuing 200+ pages of inner torment.  I wonder if we'd even have a story here if Honor were simply a whiny bitch?  Does that justify it?  To make matters worse, even when Honor learns of his plans for her, she forgives and falls for him.  Say What???  Less than 24 hours after being beaten and bitten so savagely that she slit her own wrists, and still recovering from being shot and having a building collapse on her, she asks her tormenter to make love to her with her only goal to please him. That's just downright creepy. I actually got a little nauseas trying to read the sex scenes.  And this whole story comes down to Hancock and his vision of a better world, of sacrificing a few for the many.  He's not on a sanctioned op.  There's no UN committee giving a green light.  Hancock and his men are judge, jury and executioner because they believe their actions are for the greater good.  Hhhmmm, isn't that what all terrorist groups believe?So no, I won't be finishing this story.  This guy needs to be locked up in a psyche ward or sitting on death row, I don't care if he can't go through with it and changes his mind after taking Honor's virginity.  A better story would be to have KGI go after him and take him out, rescue Honor and pair her up with someone worthy, but romance and an HEA for Hancock?  Wrong, just wrong.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT59I5HSHAZKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425276996#wasThisHelpful","RT59I5HSHAZKQ","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is clearly one of those stories where you need to pay close attention to who is writing all these positive 5 star reviews.  As I clicked on each reviewer, nary a critical review in sight in their portfolio which leads me to believe there really are people who get paid to write positive reviews.  Honestly, everything we read cannot possibly be 5 stars, but I digress.  Needless to say, I was personally not enthralled with this 6 episode story.  It's about the length of a full novel with all the episodes, but I felt that it was absolutely too long with a bunch of unnecessary turns and descriptions along the way that really dragged it down.  The writing style is actually very good, it's the story itself that I had a problem with and unfortunately minor spoilers will ensue.Ainsley Connor experienced a major childhood trauma involving her wolf and has denounced anything to do with her heritage and home, Tarker's Hollow.  She moves to NY to become a real estate mogul and hasn't been back to visit her loving parents or best friend for years because of it.  When her parents are killed in a car crash, she grudgingly comes back to Tarker's Hollow to sell off all of her parents property and assets and along the way is wooed to within an inch of her life because apparently her father was the pack alpha and it's up to Ainsley to choose the next alpha by mating them.  She wants nothing to do with staying or with wolves in general so avoids attachments and tries to work around the system so she can leave as soon as possible.The first major problem I have with the book is that I didn't like Ainsley even a little bit.  She was easily the most selfish character I've read about in this genre and there was nothing likeable about her.  She's rude, demeaning, stuck up, and hey, hasn't seen her parents in years who are described as the best people in the world.  She disses her closest childhood friend and wants to hook up with about anything on two legs, and tries for that matter.  In way of romance, there's nothing romantic about this story either, since the author wanted betrayals so we have to watch Ainsley hook up with several characters before we get to ""the one"".  Along those lines, the sex scenes were steamier with the first hook ups so by the time she gets to the last, it wasn't anything particularly special.  Also a warning for those of you who aren't into it, there's a graphic sex scene with Ainsley and another woman, which didn't do anything for me.  I guess I'm more into the concept of self control and fated mates than trying anything on for size.  And to finalize with major problems, I am still struggling that no one, and I mean no one including loving parents and alpha of a wolf pack, taught Ainsley anything about being a wolf when her role in the wolf hierarchy is so critical and the need for secrecy important.  It was even a running joke throughout the story that Ainsley knows nothing about wolves.  I appreciate the humor, but not the explanation.  Overall, the story was fairly predictable and leaves just enough for a sequel which I won't be reading.  Instead I would recommend Suzanne Wright's Feral Sins if you're looking for a steamy paranormal saga not laden with issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAKPYZZCXZQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQWJQGG#wasThisHelpful","R2PAKPYZZCXZQQ","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to romantic suspense, you cannot find better than Pamela Clare.  Of my favorites in this genre, which include Christy Reece, Maya Banks and Cindy Gerard, Pamela Clare is ranked #1.  I have loved her ITeam stories from the very first, Extreme Exposure, and patiently waited for each new installment which somehow maintained the same great quality of writing and storytelling, if not improved.  I laugh, I cry, and I'm generally at the edge of my seat, waiting to see how it all turns out.  Even the novellas by this author are better than most novels you'll find and they still manage to wring out just about every emotion possible. I've also waited a VERY long time to read about ""Horny Holly"" who has been so supportive throughout the series and is simply too much of a character to not have some terrific story tied to her.  So it's no surprise, that's what you'll find with Seduction Game.  If you haven't read the previous books, I recommend you do to keep up with the characters, but really, it's okay if you haven't.Holly Bradshaw is an entertainment writer for the Denver Independant Newspaper, or at least, that's what we've all thought for 6+ stories.  She's stunningly beautiful, redefines high maintenance, and just about every man in the world wants to bed her.  I won't even go into how inappropriate some of those men are, but the fact leaves Holly in a very unique position to get close to certain men for her second job.  Nick Andris is a CIA agent who's been ordered to tail Ms. Bradshaw, based on her latest relationship with a terrorist, human trafficker, and all-around baddy.  He's been told she's a traitor to her country and given the green light to terminate her if necessary.  As he watches Holly, he can't believe she's anything but the vapid, entertainment columnist she appears to be, until he's outwitted during the most personal op of his life.We always knew that when Holly's story came out, it would mark the end of the series and that's a very sad thought indeed, but I can easily say this story goes out with a bang and Holly is one kicka$$ heroine you wont' be disappointed to read about.  The entire cast of previous characters are back and.or mentioned and it's great to see how they all rally around Holly.  No way are all these hot alpha males sitting back while one of their own is in danger and it adds great comic relief and keeps the story grounded.  No surprise, I laughed, I cried, I got mad and was sickened, and was also riveted to the steamy sex scenes as well as the danger lurking in each corner.  Thank you Pamela Clare for giving us a great installment to an amazing series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IRJQ43TJN8K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KUWWAM#wasThisHelpful","R3IRJQ43TJN8K0","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm rather embarrassed to say that it took me so long to write this review since I couldn't set the darn thing up properly.  Having said that, my experience getting this up and running was not a pleasant one.  I've heard so many great things about the fit bit and when this came along as an Amazon Vine selection, I jumped at the opportunity, but couldn't manage to turn the device on after charging overnight.  It seems rather simple since the charger works like a magnet to the watch, but the slightest bump against it can knock it off the charger so at first, I was blaming myself, but now I prefer to blame the design quite frankly. That, and it's not a very long charging cord.  I'm also not sure that I didn't have it fully charged the first time around anyway, since apparently tapping the screen works only intermittently for me.  I'm not exactly sure what it's supposed to do, since it was new, but it lit sometimes and not the others. I kept thinking surely there must be a button I'm missing, but that wasn't the case.Once I got a battery read, I tried to sync it with the iHealth app for Android and got a device not found.  I then called in reinforcements of friends with Fitbits and other devices to help me with setup and ultimately got my most computer literate friend to complete setup where even he was baffled at how convoluted the device was.  I can now track my steps, but I haven't been able to sync up with my sleep behavior which was really more of what I was interested in.  Although my friends religiously like to know they've accomplished 10K steps a day, I'm more concerned about my quality of sleep.  Since I still haven't figured that out and will try one more time with my buddy to help me get that information, I can't say that I've had a great experience overall.  I am willing to admit that part of the problem must be me, but then I can deduct stars to iHealth for not making it for the average user.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38PXFTE0ITY28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPUEWD2#wasThisHelpful","R38PXFTE0ITY28","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried several Epson Workforce printers over the past and this printer overall has the best concept on the market, but truly only time will tell.  Let's start with setup first.  I love how easily accessible the ink cartridges or rather wells are. Instead of having to flip the beds searching for it and closing it properly, these are stored on the side and filling the wells was pretty simple.  I did manage to make a small mess, but it wasn't over the top and was completely user error on my part. My wifi devices had no problem finding the printer where often I find myself having to work for the internet setup.I also enjoyed the much smaller footprint since some of my printers have been towering since I prefer duplex printing, but this certainly accommodates that.  The print quality is excellent, as you would expect, and the multi-function capabilities are all fairly standard.  I wouldn't say that the scan quality is better than my other printers, but it's no worse.  Printing is also quick, fairly quiet, but in terms of it's uniqueness, only time will tell.  I don't print much since I work in an ecommerce world, so I can say how long the ink will go without drying out, but supposedly, the ink is supposed to last a very long time.  I am curious if the ink will ultimately dry inside the wells causing problems in the future, as opposed to simply ejecting the cartridge and throwing out.  I do appreciate the replacement cost and length the ink is supposed to last, but only having it for two months, I won't really know for a year or two.  Overall, the concept is great, but it's time that will tell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBFTWZIA21VVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFSM#wasThisHelpful","RBFTWZIA21VVB","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this book, even with the overwhelmingly bad reviews for one reason and one reason only... Molly Harper.  I love her books, I love her characters and I love her sarcasm.  I find that this story is no different.  I had to ponder why it received so many negative reviews and can chalk it all up to whether you read the book or you listened to the audio version.  I click on the sample of the audio and it's downright terrible.  People wrote that the expected snark isn't there, but I've got to tell you, if you read the story instead of listening to it, it's plenty sarcastic, cute and fast paced as you would expect it to be.  I read it in one sitting and enjoyed it immensely.  I'd be willing to bet the farm if Amanda Ronconi were the narrator, these reviews would be completely different.  I hope they can get her for the next audio book since I have a feeling it's going to need it, but I'll explain that later.Galina Sudenko is the youngest werewolf daughter to a powerful Russian mafioso immigrant family living in Seattle.  She's very loyal and has grown up living a great life in some respects, but a very difficult one in others.  Although she's been pampered, women are seen as arm candy and not known to run the family business or make choices for themselves, but Galina is hell bent on breaking those traditions, starting with canoodling with the ever forbidden, competing gangster family, Romany leader, Andrey Lupesco.  With these two, the sparks fly, but their lives are turned inside out by Galina's well meaning but ignorant father as well as her maliciously insane eldest brother.Although Galina's actions throughout the story are decidedly predictable, the curveballs thrown her way are anything but.  This reads almost like a Shakespearean Dramedy, oozing with sarcasm, violence, and most especially dirty sexy times.  I have to believe adding Jacey Conrad to the writing mix amped up the sex scenes significantly from what I'm used to from Ms. Harper, and believe me, I'm not complaining.  Overall, it's a great standalone read and very satisfying, however I'm a little hesitant to read the next in the series for the only reason that it focuses on Galina's sister, Irina, and her story.  The problem of that most of Irina's story is already told in this book and I'm not usually a fan of reading the same sequence of events based on someone else's perspective.  S.E Smith made this tragic mistake in her Spirit Pass novels and I simply couldn't get past the first half since it was all repeat. Needless to say, on audio, it's going to take a great story teller to make it interesting. Let's hope that's not the case, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.  For now, this is a definite recommended read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9WMK4S2DDX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGZNEPC#wasThisHelpful","RI9WMK4S2DDX8","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, this portable floodlight turned out to be a disappointment.  Setup is definitely a two person job and the overall design seems ideal, however the center pole that holds up a substantially weighted lamp is inflatable.  Out of the box, we had two pin prick holes in the inflatable pole so we had to use duct tape to patch it up.  Once we inflated it, it was not particularly sturdy and a gust of wind ended up collapsing the entire thing with children around.I'm not sure why they didn't use stackable metal pole pieces, much like a Swiffer handle, to hold the top heavy lamp together, but I believe it would have made this a much more effective lamp for camping or for outdoor field games.  I'm assuming they went the inflatable route so that it's easy to break down and contain in the travel bag that comes with it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G4773YXE6O8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRD1CEK#wasThisHelpful","R3G4773YXE6O8M","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is truly the cutest little truck and yes of course, my 1 year old nephew loved it, however I would say that although the size of the Power Wheels PAW Patrol is sized perfectly for a one year old, the functionality is definitely geared more towards the two to three year olds, so we'll see how big my nephew gets in another year to see if he still fits it.  In terms of functionality, it's pretty simple.  There's a button on the steering wheel and when  you press it, the truck runs.  The unfortunate reality at one however is that they haven't mastered cause and effect so he randomly pressed the button like most one year olds do and nearly got whiplash every time since he would move in short bursts.  There's an additional button that's mounted on the hood that makes sound, but I thought it was rather quiet overall and was hoping for something that made more noise if you can believe it.  At least no one will get a headache with incessant patrol noises.In terms of the setup, I struggled a bit and a Phillips screwdriver is definitely required.  One key feature that I found most inefficient is that in order to charge the vehicle, you have to unscrew the back cover.  I was hoping once it was assembled that you could plug in easily for each recharge but that's not the case so I can see this thing not getting charged as much since I'm always losing the darn screwdriver.Regardless, it's a fun and impressive toy for ages 1-3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZIPLYN4INK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQRVHOG#wasThisHelpful","R26ZIPLYN4INK2","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start by saying I'm satisfied with the conclusion to this unique four book story, however I have to qualify that there were certainly loose ends that needed to be explained but weren't.  I'm almost curious if this will somehow get extended into more books based on people's reactions, but as for the moments we've all been waiting for, it certainly takes place in this novel.  If you haven't read the Charlotte Stone series, you definitely don't want to start here.  I was hooked from the first book, but I know many other reviewers at the time were completely disgusted.  If you were turned off by the first, I'd still advise to give it a chance.  It certainly isn't your classic Karen Robards romance, but a great paranormal romance for the ages, nonetheless.This book picks right up where we left off with Charlie believing she's spotted Michael at a cemetery, only to find out that it's not Michael.  The resemblance is so close, they could be twins and Charlie not only believes they are twins, but that this could be the true Southern Slasher.  With Michael no where to be found, she jumps headlong into trying to investigate this potential evil twin, but when she meets with him at the prison she works in, they're both caught up in a nightmare of epic proportions.  The serial killers Charlie spent her life researching staged a prison break and Charlie finds herself a hostage with some of the countries most ruthless killers.Once the prison break takes place, this story is simply non-stop suspense and very entertaining.  All the characters are back and go through a roller coaster of emotions.  The ending is not predictable since it really comes out of left field and quite frankly opens the door for much speculation, however it does provide the HEA we were all looking for so I'm not going to complain too much.  Just enough to knock off a star on the rating.  Overall, you'll either love this series or hate it.  I don't see much in between due to the subject matter of serial killers and romance, but I'm definitely in the love category.  I found it fast paced, emotional, suspenseful and ultimately satisfying and I, for one, wouldn't mind reading more about this truly unique and tremendous couple.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8M4HVPZIKOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP3DN7Y#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8M4HVPZIKOG","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great and surprisingly compact (for a pressure washer) model that is perfect for projects around the house.  We already have a gas run 3000PSI pressure washer and there's no comparison to the power of that model since it's nearly double the power, but for quick projects and even to spray down the home, I thought this model worked extremely well without worrying it might take off the paint.  It was easy to attach the water hose and plug in for use.  I like how the power hose and all of the attachments can store directly into the unit, however with about 15' of power cord length, you definitely need an extension cord.  I always get a little squeamish about power cords and water, but it can't be helped.Other than that, there is a receptacle for soap when washing things down, but when it came to the tough caked on dirt and waste of cleaning out the old trash bins, we had to bust out the gas washer since this could only take off the surface grime.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCKDX4PFHX8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIK5TQ8#wasThisHelpful","R2MCKDX4PFHX8X","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've since seen him use this for a daily skim across the face and he's ready to go.

"Although this is technically the 8th installment to this series, this truly is a new beginning to a story arc that I'm very much looking forward to reading about.  With all of the wonderful Urban Fantasy stories out there, the Kate Daniels series has been my favorite because not only does each book have an intriguing, fun, often emotional and action packed story to tell, but each book also contributed to an overarching storyline that makes  you that much more crazed to get your hands on the next installment.  I'm thrilled to say that this book continues that legacy, however for a while there, I actually had my doubts.  As readers journey into the next chapter of Kate, Curran, and the gang, it was anyone's guess as to where team Andrews were going to lead us, but once again, they do not disappoint.The story starts with Kate and Curran adjusting to ""normal human life"" living in a Pleasantville neighborhood and making a living with Cutting Edge, however dreams of peace and quiet are immediately and constantly interrupted in this book as Kate and Curran are deeply embroiled in the after effects of leaving the pack and trying to help their friends.  Through a deeply intriguing and unique investigation, Kate and Curran come up against a power more dangerous than they've ever dealt with before and after the first 100 pages or so, the action is nearly non-stop.What I loved most about this installment is that the story has shifted to Kate and Curran as a team and you get to see them working together more than ever and growing more in love and respecting one another.  I'll admit that historically, I haven't felt there was enough Curran, or many other characters for that matter, that I wanted to read about.  Now that Kate's secret is out of the bag, we pretty much get a glimpse of everyone's reaction to that juicy morsel and no characters were left behind, although I wasn't thrilled with some of their reactions. There is a lot more humor and especially sarcasm with Magic Shifts and I found myself laughing out loud several times as well as dealing with an added depth and emotion to the story.  I can only speculate, but it does appear there is an overarching story arc that I loved so much in the first seven books, but only time will tell how it develops.So why only fours stars overall?  It all comes down to the first 100 pages, where much of the previous events were recapped and all the characters were described as if we didn't know them.  Although thought provoking, I did find the beginning rather slow, especially in having to read every character's physical descriptions and bio's as if I hadn't already read 7 books about them before.  Even with the release of Magic Breaks, they inserted bios about the characters so it didn't necessarily take up story time, but alas a fresh start apparently means revisiting their roots for new readers of the series.  I for one, would not recommend starting with this story, however, if you choose do so, this is still a great standalone and you'll eventually find yourself at the beginning wanting to learn more.  The series remains extremely clever, action packed, and addictive and I'm already looking forward to the next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23C64Y3FMFAJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042527067X#wasThisHelpful","R23C64Y3FMFAJC","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm generally satisfied with Panasonic electronics as a rule, and this multi format DVD/MP3/CD player works as described, but in terms of setup, this DVD player is practically a dinosaur with a single Analog RCA connection.  Apparently if you're looking for HDMI, then you need the next model up so it's something to think about depending on the connection options you have available on your TV.  There's also no Component hookup, so again only the Red, white and yellow hookups are available which from what I understand, already diminish the overall picture quality.At this point, most people buying one of these is probably looking for something simple, which this certainly is, but if you already have a lot of devices on your TV, make sure you still have the RCA option available and that it's not already connected to something else.Having said that, the DVD player is very compact and about the size of a laptop computer.  It plays music and movies as advertised and has a USB cable input for MP3.  It comes with a remote that works specifically with the DVD player and is not a programmable universal remote.  It's perfect for a smaller television, perhaps something you might put in a guest room or something you can use for the kids without worrying they might wreck a high end piece of equipment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJSQDFPHLRG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IN4YWGS#wasThisHelpful","R2VJSQDFPHLRG5","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great little honeymoon escape with Jack and JJ to tie you over to the next full length novel.  For those who haven't read the fine print, this is a very short story, advertising 68 pages, but it's really more like 50 or for Kindle users, 930 locations and I finished it in less than an hour. If you haven't read the series before, this is not the best place to start, since our protagonists are on their honeymoon, but the murder mystery is a good one and the dialogue between Jack and JJ is exceptionally well done this go around.While on a remote and tiny island for their honeymoon, a local 99 year old man is murdered with an elaborate knife through the heart.  The island has never had to deal with murder before so their only police officer asks Jack and JJ to help with the investigation.  Apparently ""help"" means ""lead"" the investigation and Jack and JJ find themselves in an intriguing mystery with both moral and ethical repercussions to it.Jack and JJ are absolutely wonderful together and the time they have away with one another shows how much these two are in love.  Their banter is funny, witty and sexy all at the same time.  The mystery is entertaining, but considering the length of the story, there was a bit more development of the characters that was needed to make this a five star story. The last story fell slightly short due to the length and lack of development in some areas, so I hope this doesn't become a trend.  Nevertheless, I love these two characters and I love this storyline and look forward to the next in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRO3M6ZL6FSXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0118BP0M2#wasThisHelpful","RRO3M6ZL6FSXU","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know how they managed a dry snorkel, but I was pretty amazed by it.  With all your gear on, you can fully submerse under water and the snorkel stays dry providing only air and no water so you don't need to blow like a whale to get the water out.  That alone rates this a great product, because let's face it, if you're in the water, the waves, no matter how small, always encroach.On to the rest of the review.  The snorkel itself is very comfortable as is the face mask.  I also noticed that it doesn't steam up due to poor sealing around the skin.  Of course the mask is adjustable and I didn't need to over tighten it for it to work well.The fins are the only other component to this besides a handy mesh bag to store all of the equipment.  The fins work fine and as I'm a size 9 shoe, these fit perfectly when adjusted properly.  The only thing that knocked this kit down one star is that the hard plastic where the foot goes in, puts a little too much pressure on the bone of my big toes.  If I wore this too long, it would definitely create a blister or callous so the only other improvement would be to soften the plastic where your feet slip in.  Other than that, it's the best snorkeling kit I've used so if you have plans to go to Hawaii or somewhere else tropical, it's definitely worth it to buy this ahead of time and doesn't take up too much space in your luggage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LWOA3UFSGX9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLE3GMA#wasThisHelpful","R1LWOA3UFSGX9U","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, this is an easy way to get a dose of protein and amino acids into your diet. Containing 20-25% of the recommended daily dosage of 15 vitamins and minerals along with 12 grams of protein and 24g of carbs (20g sugar, 3g fiber), this essentially flavored water drink tastes good and quenches your thirst.  I was surprised to see that the protein compound has milk in it as well as soy as part of the artificial flavoring, since, again this tastes like your standard variety flavored water. So if you have dairy or soy allergies, I'm not sure this will work for you.The only downside I have with it, is that like most flavored waters, there's an artificial flavor taste to it, basically because there's artificial flavoring in it as well as natural and unnatural sweeteners, Dextrose and Sucralose. If you like flavored waters, this is a win in my book, however I'm not a fan of flavored water in general, but would be willing to drink this for the benefits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNKA9SYMH379/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG7NS4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1NNKA9SYMH379","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy Maya Banks' stories and I really like this particular series in general, but this third installment to the series was a shorter than usual novel that went nowhere for a long time and then, BAM, a sequence of events start taking place with plot holes galore and TSTL moments to boot.  At best, there was enough content to make a novella and the rest of the book is simply filler and side characters.12 Years ago, Gracie and Zack were madly in love. At 20 years of age, Zack had plans to go into professional football to take care of 16 year old Gracie and their future children.  He had it all planned out, but one day, Gracie disappeared from existence and Zack spent 12 years looking for her.  From Gracie's perspective, 12 years ago, Zack had committed an unspeakable betrayal, literally unspeakable since no one would say what he did for almost the entire book, and she lives in terror of ever seeing him again. That incident also robbed her of her gift of mindreading, the extraordinary ability Gracie had, which falls in line with the series.  A chance encounter at an art gallery brings the past crashing to the present and the two have to uncover the truth of what really happened.For starters, the premise was actually quite a good one and I'm a personal sucker for second chance love stories, which his why I gave it two stars, however the execution and writing of this loosely called novel is so bad that it was almost torture.  For 80% of the book, Zack is trying to figure out why Gracie left and why she's so terrified of him, but because of her terror, they don't actually talk and all we get are repeated speculations.  Once the truth, or one version of the truth, is discovered, Zack works to get the proof he needs to convince Gracie she's wrong.  While he's away, Gracie works with a bunch of strangers of DSS on a rescue mission.... wait what? Therein lies the problem.  Any interesting aspects of this story are stolen by side characters whom Gracie may or may not have met during the story and the only time the two main characters have together is spent in tortured accusations without explanations.  The underlying threat of the story, since this is romantic suspense, doesn't feel threatening for the whole novel and then gets complete attention for the last 10% of the book.  Also because of the content, there isn't any of Ms. Banks standard sensuality.  The story was completely unbalanced and if the protagonists had at least come to a resolution halfway through, then there could have been chemistry building for the second half as well as facing down a threat.  Unfortunately, that's not how it went down.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16B5GCVAAB2NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062312502#wasThisHelpful","R16B5GCVAAB2NP","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first supersoaker I've had problems with from the start, unfortunately.  I thoughts I was doing something wrong but a bevy of people couldn't seem to get the pump to work.  Seeing as how I have over a dozen super soakers in general, I believe this to be a fluke.  I realize that this holds more water than most super soakers, but for the size of it, it doesn't actually hold much water by comparison.  From the picture, the water reservoir is only the green section and doesn't fill the gun completely.Other than that, the direct hose attachment is a nice feature, but then you need to remain stationary or within the limits of the hose extension and that's not realistic in a water battle.  The other issue is that it leaked constantly, getting me almost as wet as my target.Overall, I would recommend any of the other super soakers available over this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIBLBNSTBYZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXT4T94#wasThisHelpful","RAIBLBNSTBYZ2","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The major product I can compare this to is Origins Spot Treatment which has Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient and comparatively speaking, this product worked very well with 5% benzoyl peroxide.  What I was most impressed with is the inactive ingredients blended with the BP to make it fast absorbing and somewhat moisturizing for a product, that in essence, is supposed to dry out your skin. The smell is a clean soap smell and when I washed my face afterwards, it didn't feel slimy or crusty like the Origins tends to be.I used it during the first sign of acne and the next morning, disaster was averted and I had no signs of breakouts.  I have tried other 5% BP products although I cannot recall the names of them, but didn't care for the flaking, smell, or texture.  We seem to have a winner with Proactive, however based on the price, I would expect no less.  This is about double the price of even the Origins, never mind over the counter products like Neutrogena.  Regardless, if it works, then it's worth it to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCA9IWFS4YTFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI6TSLO#wasThisHelpful","RCA9IWFS4YTFM","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't had a lot of luck with the flexible Hefty bags, but I thought I would give this a try since it appears to be a new and improved item.  The concept is fantastic since the bag has a lot of leeway for trash that isn't quite so compact and collapsible, however the weaving of the bag compromises the resiliency and they are very easy to tear or rip.  If you have a lot of heavy trash or are looking to put glass in them, this is not the bag for you.  We do a lot of recycling at my household so don't necessarily need to throw bottles and jars in them, but even when they're completely full, I use care when handling them and never put liquids in them.Overall, the quality is better than previous generations of the bag, but many of the initial concerns remain.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GT3NPWVL2F9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028LQ4U4#wasThisHelpful","R3GT3NPWVL2F9I","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am completely impressed with how clean my dishes came out after using Seventh Generation dishwasher liquid and in general am a firm supporter of the Seventh Generation line including their laundry detergent, especially for poopy diapers.  After just one use of Seventh Generation, my glasses came out sparkling, there was no caked on food or residue from what was on the other dishes left inside the cups like I sometimes experience and there were no spots much to my surprise.

"As far as hand creams go, the Ahava Dead See Water Mineral hand cream is definitely on the thicker side of moisturizing and protecting your skin.  Overall, it takes a good minute and a half to truly penetrate and dry to a level where you're functional instead of slippery, but once it did, my skin was dewy soft.  This is the perfect winter time hand protection, but I likely wouldn't recommend it for the summer months.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the smell.  Quite frankly, it smells a lot like Vaseline brand lotion which is the worst lotion in protection and smell as far as I'm concerned.  I wish they could have put out a better fragrance, but alas, it's like a medicinal flower smell.  The good news is that it isn't overwhelming.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAAVH391VH5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052OUDLU#wasThisHelpful","R2PAAVH391VH5J","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This particular super soaker is easily the best for ages ten and under since it only requires one hand and is a single trigger shooter.  I noticed many of the children  between ages 5 and 10 were struggling with the dual handed pump action.  It does shoot at least 15' feet however it only holds 4 oz of water so requires frequent filling.  Regardless of how long you can use it until it requires refill, the children didn't feel left out of the fun struggling with the larger models.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZPHWCGGBYGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXT4TP8#wasThisHelpful","R2GZPHWCGGBYGW","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of all the fantastic choices in Supersoakers, I have to say that this is my least favorite of the bunch.  It's supposedly shoots water from up to 38' feet away, but I'm lucky if I got 20' when I tried.  There are two different ways you can shoot, one is the bottom pump action spray which gives about 20' of water spray that's pretty target specific.  The other method is the FlashFlood feature at the top which was not ideal in a fast paced shooting game since you have to pull back the top handle to fill the receptacle with water and then push it as hard as you can to force the water out.  It's a bit of an effort and although it does dump water, it only shoots about 12' at best  I also found that the Flash Flood trigger, being as arduous as it was, is not ideal for under 10 since they don't appear to have the strength to keep loading the water and dumping it.  It's an impressive looking Supersoaker, but when you're in an actual water attack, it doesn't work as well as the others to defend yourself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QV31217AS31I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXT4SZ4#wasThisHelpful","R3QV31217AS31I","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This super soaker arrived just in time for Memorial Day weekend and was a favorite with kids and adults alike by the pool.  What else can I say in general about super soakers except they are loads of fun.  This particular model delivers four streams of water at once and has a very easy pump action trigger.  I would say that the distance for firing is more around 25' as opposed to 30' and after a couple of pumps, the bottom water stream doesn't fire.  It apparently only fires when the gun is completely full, however the other three work consistently throughout and you have a pretty accurate shot since the water doesn't fire in all different directions like the crossbow version.  Either way, you can't go wrong with any of these options.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KM5EURLZLKWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXT4TDK#wasThisHelpful","R3KM5EURLZLKWD","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can I say , except Ms. Jones has done it again.  This remains in my top 5 favorite series of all time and a lot happens in this installment.  If you've never read the previous books, you can't appreciate the characters and their nuances and you definitely wouldn't get the full blast of fun this series often brings since this particular book is much deeper and darker than her previous installments.  The story starts off much the same way with a fast forward of 8 months and the usual light bantering, but quickly spirals into sinister plots, schemes, spies, and an epic reveal.  Unfortunately, it also ends on a bit of a downer as well as a cliffhanger which knocked it down a star in my estimation.It's very difficult not to give the book away with a synopsis, however the story begins with Charley and the gang preparing for the wedding of Cookie and Ubie while Charley is 9 months pregnant and ready to pop.  They've been living on sacred ground for 8 months and have a touch more than cabin fever, but are making the best of things.  Charley gets involved in an investigation remotely of a missing niece to an FBI agent and does all she can to help, meanwhile she's secretly investigating several personal issues on her own including looking up Reyes' real parents, to which she was told not to, as well as investigating who killed her father, to which she was also told not to.  In classic Charley and Reyes fashion, they are keeping many secrets from one another that culminate to an ending that will leave you blindsided.Overall, this was an epic installment that brings every character ever featured in past installments, WOW Mr. Wong, as well as some new characters including Lucifer himself.  It also features many major reveals and kick starts what could potentially be a spinoff or Charley Davidson 2.0, but don't think that all your questions will be answered.  For now, I'm feeling rather maudlin at the end of book 8, with reservations about book 9, but it hasn't prevented me from already having it on pre-order.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AIXADGY5DSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250045657#wasThisHelpful","R9AIXADGY5DSE","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to be honest and say I'm not sure what the overall effectiveness of the product is, but I can say that I enjoy the smell and plan on using these this winter which will be the real test.  We live near deep woods and of course in an old house, there's bound to be mice to which we've seen the evidence.  Since using these, I haven't seen any new evidence of mice, however, it may also be due to the time of the year with spring, they likely all went outdoors.  The scent starts out strong but turns into a pleasant and fresh minty air freshener within a week.

"It certainly took me long enough to write a review for this because I fell into the category of those who's brains shut down when trying to get started.  I have no experience with either sewing or embroidery, and although I'm quite handy, I'm not crafty.  That spoke volumes as I was setting up the machine.  Snapping the two primary pieces of the machine together wasn't an issue and is really simple.  It was getting the threads setup and through the needle that took me a bit of time.  The one piece of advice I can give is do not bother with the ""Quick Reference Guide"" if you've never used an embroidery machine before.  The instructions come in four languages and although one of them is English, it might as well have been Chinese for me.  I did well enough with the operation manual and once the threading was complete, the instructions for setting up an embroidery pattern was like using a combo printer where you can select letters and designs.Overall, I suspect that it will get easier with time.  My first attempt and I had too much tension on the fabric which didn't turn out right, but if you hold it still and leave it a little loose, it works much better.  I haven't worked up the bravado to actually try it on a shirt since I don't want to ruin them, but my husband loves initials on his shirt cuffs so I'm working my way to it.  Overall, it's an easy machine to use and if you have some experience, it's probably a great value.  I did notice that Brother also makes a sewing machine and embroidery machine in one and think overall that is more reliable.  Also, if you're looking to do this professionally, the 700 series seems to be the machine of choice and I've seen them stationed at several arts and craft fairs, but this certainly gets the job done for an amateur like myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6XZ0HLR50ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW39OCC#wasThisHelpful","R2B6XZ0HLR50ZV","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What else is there to say about a super soaker aside from they're hours of endless fun for kids and adults alike?  This particular model is a about 18"" long and requires two hands, one to hold the device, and the other to pump the water. It emits three streams and would work on multiple targets but if you're looking to soak a single person, then only one of the three streams will likely hit its mark.  The middle stream blasts about 20', with the two side streams about 15'.  We love these for the pool area and for some unknown reason, even though everyone's already wet, a blast from the super soaker always jump starts a bout of screaming and laughing.Super soakers are also a great training device with cats and dogs, but not this particular model because of the three streams.  If you're looking to discipline your pet, it's best to go with a single stream.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LE9QDH76JTW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQ7MPCS#wasThisHelpful","R1LE9QDH76JTW0","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cover fits over just about any set of stacking chairs with a lot of give to accommodate stackable chairs with a wider arm dimension and the cover is a well made burlap material.  This is the third outdoor cover that I've received in the last four months to prepare for winter and the rainy season and although I have to say this ranks #2 in the quality department.  The reason is that the inside is almost a rubbery coating on the burlap and although clearly waterproof, it doesn't have as much slipping to easily go over the chairs but rather clings to it which requires more adjusting and pulling down the cover over the chairs.  On the plus side, it's not easy for this to slip off or blow away.With that I prefer the Ravenna covers that have a thick burlap on the outside and a smooth waterproof plastic on the inside that makes it easier to adjust and slip over furniture, but this is still better than my first purchase which was basically a plastic cover that isn't as durable.  This will easily last ten years and is very hard to tear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37UF7GH3EXKTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8C13QK#wasThisHelpful","R37UF7GH3EXKTS","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice mattress cover but I wouldn't say it's anything to write home about.  It's nice and thin and the weave does keep the bed comfortable and cool, but I tend to go for slightly thicker covers and cooling the mattress is not usually a goal of mine.  The website description says this fits 22"" mattresses at certain places, however the packaging states that it fits up to 20"" mattresses.  Regardless of what you have, the elastic sheer sides will easily fit over 22"" and there's no struggling to get over all four corners.  If you have the older slimmer mattress, this is actually going to be too large which would contribute to shifting.  The cover will certainly protect the mattress from everyday wear, but it has no waterproofing properties if that's what you're looking for.  The upside of this is that the materials are not only machine washable,  but it will survive the dryer which has managed to demolish many a mattress pad for me in the past.One thing to mention in terms of wear and tear is that the underside is a scratchier material that will prevent shifting and movement, but it also tends to pill and collect all residual lint and hair, but only time will tell how this all holds up.Overall, It's a decent quality, but I've seen better made covers and around the $50.00 price tag, I find this cover to be more expensive than what you may be able to pick up at Homegoods.  It's also designed in size for newer thicker mattresses and strictly designed for comfort, not protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZYKWBSBRWWG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN72W2S#wasThisHelpful","R1ZYKWBSBRWWG0","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say I'm impressed with this Micro Magic Microdermabrasion and it works very well for evening out my complexion and eliminating dry skin.  I've been disappointed in general with most microdermabrasion products since they're so mild, you don't feel the grains working on your skin.  The only exception would be Kiehls which is easily the most abrasive product I've used, but my skin type warrants it and when I'm looking for something slightly milder, I can always water it down.  I still love my Kiehls, but this product, which is comparable in price, is just as good without the harshness.  The grains are much smaller and with the addition of vitamin E and a minty essence, it felt more like it was polishing my skin and it left my face smooth and refreshed.

"This is a pretty sturdy and reliable juicer that is easy to use and easy to clean with the maximum amount of juice to be had from the fruit, whether big or small.  I noticed another review said that it didn't work well with limes because they were too small, but when I used this, it squashed my lime practically flat and breaking the peel to ensure the juice came out.  I also did not have any issues with seeds coming out, although there is little splinters of smaller seeds that I would drink anyway as part of the pulp.What you see if basically what you get.  The juicer is not adjustable in height so you have about a 5"" clearance for a cup which doesn't fit my standard kitchen glasses.  It's heavy duty and supposedly has suction feet, but although it has sturdy rubber feet, they don't provide any suction, so if you're overly eager in pressing the handle, it can be a little tippy.  Not enough to actually tip the juicer since it's so heavy, but it will wobble a bit.Overall, it's a great juicer for a variety of fruits and is large enough in size for grapefruits, and although I haven't tried it, you could very likely throw a bunch of grapes in here as well to smash the juice out.

"Like all reviews, this one needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  First and foremost, I was able to setup this up on my Ipad seamlessly, however still cannot get it to sync with my Samsung S5.  For the Ipad the setup is fairly easy after some initial annoyance.  I had to read the directions to find the actual place to charge the device.  You need to peel back the ear bud rubber cover to access it and my concern is that constantly pulling back the rubber will cause deterioration.  Also, when I plugged it in, the connection doesn't insert all the way.  It looks like it's only half way in, but the red light came on so I knew it was working.  A complete charge took about 2 hours and the light changes to green.  Once the device is synced, a popup message links you to the app store to download the appropriate app, but that didn't work. When I searched for the app, I couldn't find it either, so had to go to the website to search for the app, link to the app store, and finally download the app.That done, everything else worked just fine for me.  The ear buds themselves are extremely comfortable.  Probably the most comfortable I've worn and as I jumped around and ran like a maniac, they remained secure.  Although the heart rate monitor sporadically spikes here and there, it's pretty accurate on average.  I wouldn't call the sound quality state of the art, but it's decent and has a good range of volume to suit my needs. There's also an additional app that you can download to enhance the overall sound quality.  The short cord that can wrap around the back of your neck is a good length and leaves easy access to the multi-function button which serves as the Bluetooth sync, on/off, and answer call/hang up call functionality.Any instructions and voiceover from the application plays with your music or audiobook in the background so it won't bring your workout to a screeching halt in tempo.  All information comes directly from the app such as heart rate and battery power left so there's nothing on the headset itself that states the battery is low.I can't comment right now on the call answer quality until I can get it working on Samsung phone.

"Admittedly, I am not a avid fan of this series, but more of a lurker, having read the beginning, the middle and a couple towards the end.  These stories are not bad, but I find myself forgetting them, almost before I finish the book and they're not part of my reread pile like Jeanienne Frost or Kresley Cole who qualify for multiple rereads.  That being said, I was very curious how this final installment would play out and although one of the more interesting stories in the series, with a few surprises, I found this final installment to be a rather bland recipe by the numbers for paranormal romance.  It had all the components to a chohesive story, with sexy scenes, some surprises and danger lurking, but I never felt lost in the story or the dialogue.Jia is an extremely naive royal princess weretiger who's paretns and sibling were slaughtered by Master Han.  She's sworn to avenge their deaths and is constantly plotting ways to track him, but the effort is doubly hard since she usually has to escape her cousins who love and watch out for her very closely.  Russell is also Hell bent on revenge, literally, since waking up from an almost 40 year coma to find himself a vampire created by Master Han, but when he gets a shot at killing Master Han after 2 years of covert ops and spying, his attempt is thwarted by a meddlesome woman in dire need of rescue.As far as finales go, this did not go out with a bang, but it did bring all the characters together for a reunion of happily ever after.  The final showdown was bittersweet, if not a bit anticlimactic and the happiness that ensued is stuff of fairlytales.  All in all I felt almost like I was watching a movie instead of losing myself in a story, and although I liked Russell's character, I was not enamored of Jia, who although competent in skill, was generally feather brained.  That being said, fans surely won't miss out on this final installment, but as far as a recommended read, I could have taken or left it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I1J2458CCLE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062107771#wasThisHelpful","R2I1J2458CCLE2","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cute apron and although many reviewers are not happy with the lightweight cotton, it's actually one of the things I like.  I have several aprons and they're a very heavy material, but really all you need is something lightweight to prevent splashing.  Since it's such a thin cotton material, it will cinch at the waist to give you a dress like look and feel, but it's also on the smaller side if you're a larger woman.  I am by no means petite at 5'8"" and 160lbs with an ample top, but the apron covers me just fine.  It may not look like a cute dress on me as displayed in the picture, but I suppose that to be more my problem than the apron's.  I had no problems with it covering my entire front to keep me clean, and it still looks cute.Since it's cotton, it does shrink in the dryer, but not by a whole size.  The ribboning at the skirt also came out wrinkled looking after washing and drying, so if you want this to look meticulous, you will need to haul out the iron.  Overall, I wouldn't call it a top quality apron, but it does the job and I like the lightness and colors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU19VYI0G10MK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYGP85I#wasThisHelpful","RU19VYI0G10MK","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a complete change of pace coming from Darkness into Smiley, both five star reads, but the names are synonymous of the stories themselves, of course, since the heroes chose these names for a reason. 13 books into the series and it is still going strong while each story is completely unique and satisfying.  I would say any of these books could be read as a standalone, but they're just so good, I would recommend starting at the beginning with Fury, which to date, still remains my personal favorite and lays the foundation for all other installments.  Smiley is the first primate species featured in the series and overall, it was great to discover some of the differences about them, but what stood out the most is that is the most romantic and tender of all the books to date.Vanni is tricked by her fiance into attending an important benefit for her soon to be father in law's ""church"" which very specifically targets New Species as not only an abomination but a threat to the world.  When she discovers she's not there for a romantic weekend getaway, she's seriously pissed off and instead of going to her room, she heads off to the bar where she meets Smiley, a new species.  At first, Vanni is nervous because she doesn't want Smiley to know she's with people who are anti New Species, but as the night progresses, they end up connecting really well, until Vanni starts experiencing hot flashes and dizziness.  Smiley soon realizes that while they've been sitting together with drinks, they've both been drugged, very specifically with the breeding drug from his Mercile days.  From there all hell breaks loose.  Smiley is drawn to Vanni and although she seems to be the primary suspect for their drugging, he can't help but believe her innocent.The story has a kick start and things progress rather rapidly, with plenty of mistrust and danger past the half way point, but then things slow down and progress into a lovely courtship to win Vanni's heart.  Smiley remains stalwart and completely supportive of Vanni's innocence and he'll stop at absolutely nothing to protect her.  This is not a story of miscommunication or stubborn denial of one's feelings, but a slower progression of getting to know one another and trusting one another to build a lasting relationship.  It's a different pace than Ms. Dohner's typical Alpha male role since primates are evidently much more sensitive than canines or felines and quite frankly, this makes me even more eager to read about Jericho. We have a short reunion with Fury, Justice, and Slade along with a quick cameo of Darkness, and I loved how supportive the New Species were in this installment overall.  All I can say is, thank you and please keep them coming!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O4PW2ND3FCN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NET52UW#wasThisHelpful","R1O4PW2ND3FCN2","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book 2 of the Tales of the Djinn and I was pleasantly surprised that the second story remained on our main characters from book 1.  The way the first book, The Guardian, was laid out, I thought for sure we would have a total of four books based on the foundation of four main characters, The Guardian, The Magician, The Artist, and The Sultan, who duplicated part of themselves so they could escape to come back and rescue their city from an evil sorceress.  That being said, you do not want to start the series here and should go back to the first book which I found to be a five star read.Elyse Soloman was your run of the mill landlady of a brownstone apartment in New York when she met up with two very strange new tenants, Arcadius (Cade) and Joseph, and found there was a whole other world of Djinn that she has very close ties to.  Elyse ended up falling for Cade and helps them to save their people who are frozen in stone, but they only managed to bring back half of the people so far.  One such person brought back, was Arcadius' original form.  For some reason, when the curse was lifted, the two Arcadius' did not merge back into one and when the three of them work together to help find missing teenage Djinn, Elyse finds herself not only falling deeper in love with Cade, but she can't help but fall for his double, Arcadius.The premise of this story was absolutely fantastic and I was completely prepared for a magical journey into a scorching threesome, but although technically it worked out that way, it wasn't quite as hot and spicy as I'd hoped.  To be honest, there was too much insecurity and awkwardness  and overall I found the two badass Arcadius' turned into marshmallows, instead of the take charge studmuffins they originally were.  Joseph, the magician's story was progressed a bit and I found I would have rather read about him and his angst versus all the angst that was attached to Elyse, Cade and Arcadius.  Mario and Cara are back for round two, but this time they seemed more like a nuisance than true villains.  I was also hoping we'd get a little more on where the Sultan and the Artist are, but the story never even touched on them.  Regardless, I enjoyed the book, but was not caught up in the magic I felt from the first book.  I'm still looking forward to reading future installments and hope they'll be more action packed and progressive with alot less angst.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39LZYJPR1OF1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NKWB8Q0#wasThisHelpful","R39LZYJPR1OF1S","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost, I had never heard of Viva Labs, but apparently it was formed in 2011 by doctors and homeopaths to build all natural health aids.  3 years isn't long enough to know if they are simply a trend or if they're in it for the long haul as a trusted provider, but I've yet to see any negative press on their company.In terms of the prenatal DHA, like so many others, I am actually not pregnant, but the source of DHA from small fish like sardines and anchovies is safer and contain less mercury than fish like salmon which seems to be the go to source for essential fatty acids.  What I truly liked about these softgels is that there is no strong smell you'll get from many others and they did not upset my stomach.  When taking other prenatal vitamins with DHA, some have actually made me naseaus which is not the case here.In terms of ingredients, this contains sardines, anchovies, vitamin E, vitamin D3, gelatin and glycerin, and although it does give you the does EPA, DHA, and other Omega 3's, there is no recommended daily allowance so it's not proven how much is enough.  What I didn't like with the addition of vitamin E and D3 is that it doesn't tell you how much is in there.  I have no idea if it's 100% daily value or if it's so insignifcant you need additional.The supply will last you 3 months, with two pills per day and seems comparable to Nordic Naturals in dose, but much higher than Nature Made multi-vitamin with DHA.

"This is a very cool gadget and when I saw this as a vine selection, I wasn't sure if I really needed it, but thought it would come in handy to confirm the laziness factor of my dogs.  I typically work from home, but when I'm away, I wondered if my dogs would act differently.  The setup was fairly easy with wifi, however I did have some issues.  The footprint of my house is very large being a non traditional ranch and we actually have three wireless routers setup throughout, all with different names for the rooms they're in.  This device essentially let me hook up to one of the routers consistently and did not automatically switch to the best strength connectivty, but my dogs have their favorite spaces and apparently they don't move much when they're at home.  My bluetooth also works intermittently, but I have often have this problem with a lot of devices since we have so many bluetooth connections setup through the house as well.The capabilities of the monitor are pretty expansive to allow you to manage your dog's daily activity, medications, and overall well being, but with my youngest being at 9 years old, they're so set in their ways, that this device ended up being more of a curiosity resolver than anything else.  It has pretty much proven that my dogs do not move for much of the day and I can only assume that when the mailman or a random delivery person shows is when we have any activity at all.  If you're serious about ensuring your dog receives a minimum amount of exercise each day, this is the perfect way to track and adjust when you're spending time with them, but if you're like me, who's probably more lazy than the dogs, and have no intentions of doing any regimen based on the results, then it's probably not worth it.  I'll definitely hang on to it, though since we're constantly fostering pets for adoption.  One work of caution, is that it is a decent, slightly smaller than hockey puck size so it's really not idea for small dogs.  Although people have been successful with 15lbs or up, I'm actually thinking it's for 30lbs+ for it to be comfortable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E46H9569E230/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNEII0A#wasThisHelpful","R3E46H9569E230","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything about this product was designed right, with one exception, the size.  The bed protectors are clearly made extremely well with a waterproof, slip proof covering on the back and a soft absorbent and actually pretty striped material that absorbs a lot of water at a fairly fast pace.  I tested with two, three and four cups of hot water and it essentially absorbs into the pad and disperses evenly.  When I lifted the pad, there is water run off on the short side so you would want to fold this up to dispose of, but the the back was bone dry.  It's true that when pressed, water will pool but with the weight distribution of a body it will leave a body moist, but not wet.  That would go without saying in any accident situation, no matter what you try.  The bottom line is that this is made to protect the bed, not the person, necessarily.As I mentioned before, the only real problem is the size.  It measures about 35'x20' and quite frankly, the 20"" length is much too small.  If you so much as roll from one side to the other, you'll very likely ""fall off"" the pad in some capacity.  My father is bedridden and partially paralyzed and even with his limited motion, would manage to flail off the space.  For him, I actually use, the Sofnit 300 Washable Underpad,34x36 or even better, the Champion Washable Underpad 2X-Large, 36x60, which last about 300 washloads and it is a sturdy material so that it can be used to move him around and readjust him on his bed.What I see this being used for is actually a chair protector.  My mother is accident prone these days, and although she wears protection, there are always leaks, so she uses these on the sofa, in the car, and even at the dining table for extra protection.  Overall, the quality is fantastic, but they are going to have to make this available in multiple sizes or simply a larger size for it to truly work for nightime sleeping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TE7OBU15WWUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFDI2KG#wasThisHelpful","R2TE7OBU15WWUL","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I finished reading this book, I thought to myself, how did this book get even better than the last?  I'll leave the credit all to Ms. Darynda Jones who clearly has one Hell of a plan for this series, pun intended.  If you've never read the series before, you do not want to start here, and there's no reason for it.  You'll start at the beginning and won't come up for air until you're all caught up in no time.  The Charley Davidson series is easily the most unique story around, that is also clever, funny, engaging, entertaining, fast paced, and simply magical which rides on the fringes of urban fantasy, paranormal romance, and mystery.  If you haven't read previous stories, then this book will have spoilers of previous installments, so if you don't want to know, stop here.Book 7 picks up right where we left off with Sixth Grave from the Edge and Ms. Jones does not drag this story out but moves full steam ahead in her usual fashion to progress the story forward.  Charley is now engaged, expecting a baby girl who's prophesized to be the fall of Satan, and is being hunted by the Hounds of Hell, but she still has a job to do and it seems more and more people keep getting in the way of her living her life. There are several mysteries taking place once again, but Charley manages to clear some up early on, while others take place throughout the story.  Most prominent is that there are a string of ""suicides"" where no bodies can actually be found and Charley hasn't received any visits from the dearly departed to truly know what's going on.  As she tries to investigate, she has Reyes on her heels at every step, and although they are constantly clashing wills, I still find the relationship between the Son of Satan and the Grim Reaper to be the most compelling couple in fiction, and that's saying something for you Kate and Curran or Cat and Bones fans.The story is written in its typical Attention Deficit fashion where Charley is easily distracted by caffeine withdrawal, practicing motherhood on a goldfish, and other stray thoughts that constantly pop into her head, that always keep me chuckling and with the deeper than usual revelations, sacrifices, and, yes, losses, the style of writing was very helpful in keeping me from weeping.  Charley learns alot more about her abilities and we as readers, learn alot more about the other characters from Amber to The Dealer that are clearly in Charley's life as part of a much bigger picture.  As the events unfold, we're left with a very different Charley Davidson and I cannot wait to see how her vengeance will unfold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JDHUUHFNWXZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKS1BFE#wasThisHelpful","R2JDHUUHFNWXZK","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This truly is the best tasting coconut water I've had and I've tried alot including Vita Coco, C20, and ZCO.  I especially enjoy the pulp which are soft chunks of coconut and not a lot of mush.  Like another reviewer, I would prefer these in a smaller can since 16.2 oz is a lot to drink in one sitting, and the company does make a 9.5 oz which sounds perfect, but the cost of the smaller bottles is a lot more expensive than the larger can and quite frankly, more than $2.00/can is already a lot of money for a single non-alcoholic beverage.  Amazon has a vendor that sells a 24 pack which saves you a little more than the 12 pack as well.If cost is not a concern, I recommend you give it a try.

"I feel like I'm cheating a bit here since I haven't read all of the books, and essentially gave up after Spirit Dances even though that one was my favorite up until that time.  These stories clearly got better and better with the passing of time because you have a some ground rules on the story that hops back and forth from the real world to the otherworld and I have to admit, it took me alot of time to digest the goings on, since I would read things incorrectly and then have to go back and reread it to understand parts.  What I can truly say I enjoyed with this conclusion, is just that, I finally have a sense of completion whereas before, I never felt satisfied, mostly with the cliffhangers or a determination to battle things to come, but never getting there.  If you haven't read the series before, you get a brief summary of each of the books that brings you here, but it's not nearly enough to grasp the magnitude of the final battle between Joanne and her friends against the Master.  I would recommend starting from the beginning and have you decide if it's enough to keep your attention till the end.For those of you who, like me, enjoy her smexy scenes, you're not going to get much of that.  This is pure Urban Fantasy and although there's romance, it's not to the level of details you'll find in comparable series.  For many, that's what makes this so unique and special, and for others, falls a little flat.  Although I fall into the latter category, this book certainly pulls on the heart strings and does not disappoint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2AVLZBUIZZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778316912#wasThisHelpful","R1W2AVLZBUIZZG","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously read the first in this series a long time ago, but as I was searching for an audiobook to purchase for a long drive, I thought to give this series another try.  I recall enjoying the first in the series, but wasn't completely hooked.  After listening to this book, I have to say, I'll go back and give the whole series a try again.  I was a little hesitant after reading one and two star reviews claiming this is nothing but porn and there was no story, but I guess that's where people's opinions can truly differ.  I personally enjoyed the book because of the interesting story line that went above and beyond just sex.When the evil opposing pack, the Centrals, kidnap Hannah a powerful earth witch, as well as Reed, one of the Red Wolf Jamensons, their plight truly seems hopeless.  It's been days for Reed and weeks for Hannah, with nothing but torture to look forward to.  Reed is especially tormented by the fact that Hannah, whom he's never met before, is his mate, and there's nothing he can do to protect her.  When former Navy Seal, Josh, learns of the two missing persons, he gets a flash of who and where they are.  He's always had this power to help find people, but only if he's met them before.  He knows there's a reason he was sent the image of these two and he makes plans to help them escape.  As the three come together, they realize there is a powerful bond between them, but all their conceptions of fated mates and rules of attraction get completely scrambled as they struggle to not only survive, but to figure out the importance of one another in their lives.Let's face it, if you're reading a story about witches and shifters, the power of a fated bond should not be an over the top concept, even if it does involve men who were not previously bisexual.  That being said, although there's certainly some yummy sex scenes that include man on man, threesomes, and of course back door action, it did not overpower the story.  The bad guys are really bad, and the side characters who are all eventually spotlighted in their own novels were engaging and interesting.  If threesomes and bisexuality are not your thing, then I wouldn't bother with this book.  Otherwise, I found it a fast paced and entertaining story that makes this series overall unique.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J3TWS0BGL3Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2FDF88#wasThisHelpful","R2J3TWS0BGL3Q8","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I truly enjoyed this film.  Being a longtime Koontz fan, when we hosted a movie weekend, I nominated this film and my friends grudgingly obliged.  Of the six of us, two read the book and 4 did not.  Unanimously, whether you've read the book or not, it rated a solid four across the board for differing reasons.  Why share this?  Well, essentially whether you've read the book or not, you're in for a special treat.  The movie stays very true to the book which is a wonderful thing since I gave the book a five star rating.  The special effects were surprisingly good and with such a good story to tell, Hollywood didn't flub it up.The stories of Odd Thomas have always been dark, with lots of quirk, humor, sadness, tension, action, and interesting characters.  That being said, I enjoyed who was cast as Odd, but I have to say, the only transformation that disrupted my enjoyment was the portrayal of Stormy.  Is it me, or did she seem a little slutty?  She's such a focal point of sun and smiles in the story but not in a midriff baring, sultry sort of way. Don't get me wrong, if you see the reviews I write, they're mostly about smutty romance novels, so I'm not a prude.  I just didn't appreciate the transformation of such an innocent and beautiful character.That being said, it starts off a little campy and I got concerned, but it really pulled together into an entertaining, action packed, and satisfying film.  I would not hesitate to watch the sequels if they're ever made.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29EMX1BF7ZPVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHYF570#wasThisHelpful","R29EMX1BF7ZPVL","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a conveniently sized printer that doesn't take up too much space but I found it limited in it's functionality and the wifi was spotty depending on the computer.In terms of setup, there was no auto-recognition of any kind.  For twoof the laptops I had running on this printer, each one forced us to perform a manual install of the software to recognize the printer and then only one would actually detect the wifi, even though the other laptop had no problems connecting to our other hp printer.  The quality of black and white as well as color printing was much better than the HP, so there were no concerns with the quality when it did work.  When I wired the other laptop to this printer, it also worked fine.Both scanning and fax capabilities were of good quality and overall for the price point, I would prefer Epson printers over HP.

"I'm a big fan of grilling and although we have natural gas piped directly to our grill and use it year round, sometimes I just get lazy and want to stay indoors.  That and living in New England, there's snow to deal with.  I thought this pan looked pretty interesting, even though I have a George Forman and an Indoor grill, they tend to cause a lot of smoke and the only place where I have a vent is right on the stovetop so I thought I'd give this pan a try.  All I can say is wow.  This worked really well.  I was completely impressed with how well the heat distributed evenly over the entire pan so the steaks on the edge cooked at the same timing as the steaks in the middle.  Leaving them on five minutes each side cooked them to medium rare - medium perfection and they looked cookbok cover perfect with even browning and beautiful ""grill lines.""  Vegetables cooked just as well since the rivets actually create a steam that manages to steam them while giving that grilled pattern look.All this and the clean up was practically non-existent.

"I have to say that this is one of my top three favorite New Species for a whole host of reasons, starting with loving the kick butt heroine, the pace, the intermingling of new species we know and love, bringing the overarching storyline full circle, as well as a truly damaged new species who's been more damaged than most.  If you haven't been reading the series, I wouldn't recommend starting here since the storyline has its roots all the way back to book 1, Fury,  through the last, True.  You could skip some books in between, but those two are the most important to this particular book.Kat is an FBI agent who's been sent undercover into Homeland under the guise of instructor from a forensic crime lab, except she blows her cover immediately by kicking some serious a$$, as this book starts with a bang... literally.  She's really been sent to search and recover someone for her boss, but Kat knows something is not right about the operation and uses the opportunity as a break instead, with all intentions of returning empty handed, except now she has to tap dance her way around her impressive combat techniques.  After the NSO discover she's with the FBI, they decide to play along with her pathetic story to see why she's truly at Homeland.  Something along the lines of keep your friends close and your enemies closer, Darkness is determined to uncover Kat's secrets by any means possible.The lowdown is that there is a significant amount of angst, but it felt right in this context.  Darkness has been through some pretty bad stuff and I felt the story explained well enough why he is the way he is.  Kat was certainly a strong enough character to handle the crap he kept dishing out and at the end of the day, he didn't quite get to three strikes, so I'm okay with the patience and forgiveness Kat specifically had to demonstrate.  I especially enjoyed the dynamics between Darkness and all the other New Species, especially Fury.  This story, more than most, weaved in a host of supporting, once starring, characters, and it felt nice to catch up with some of my favorites as well as some new characters. Something was brewing with Trey Roberts, and I'm wondering if this is a hint at the first new species female and human male story Laurann has talked about.  All in all, a great addition that was action packed from the start and wouldn't let me put it down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XIC1NZPA663/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAN1MLG#wasThisHelpful","R3XIC1NZPA663","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is definitely a handy product to have, especially camping or as a car emergency pack, but needs to be used through user error since there isn't any instructions for the device. Don't get me wrong, it comes with a tiny user guide, but the guide is for models XGB3, 3L, XGB6 and XGB12, but not for the XGS9.  I have a feeling if it did include the one page of tips, it still wouldn't help me since my device only has two modes to inidcate if it is on or not.  Either a flashing red/green indicating it's charging, and a solid red, which I'm not sure what it means.  Perhaps fully charged?  If so, then it's a bad choice of colors since green is the universal color for go and red usually means stop.  With that all aside, it works, but not without some quirks.I first tried the device on a cloudy day since that was what the weather was like and it did not do anything.  No lights coming on here, so I'm assuming it's not going to work very well without direct sunlight.  I then charged in the direct sun the next day and everything fired up nicely. For my Samsung S5 phone, it charged at the same rate it would have if I plugged it into the wall so it's strong enough to keep your phone working.  I next tried it on my Ipad and while it took me a couple of clicks on the power button, it did start to charge the Ipad, but at about 70% the speed as if it was plugged into a wall socket.  This did not surprise me since charging an Ipad on anything but Apple products is always slow for an Ipad.The flashlight works extremely well and lights up at least 50 ft x 50 ft in the dark and I could see clear into the woods.  The device also has pass through charging so your flashlight is always charging while you charge your device.  One of the quirks is that I couldn't get my Ipad or phone to charge without the flashlight pass through so disconnecting the flashlight isn't an option for me.Overall, it works if not by trial and error, but I have to say that it is rather sizeable and at around 5x13"".  It's not heavy and about a half an inch thick, but will take up some space in a backpack.  I especially find the interlocking velcro a bit annoying since it's overkill and the velcro is always catching the case and closing automatically.  I guess they really want to ensure the charger stays closed and protected.  Lastly, I have no clue to tell if it's fully charged or not once I brought it inside.  There's no measure for how long the battery is draining through usage so i would definitely recommend keeping it in the sun to be safe rather than sorry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33PHA1ZYX98FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XXE4#wasThisHelpful","R33PHA1ZYX98FO","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just to be clear, this review is for the Epson EX-7230 Pro and NOT the 7235.  For some reason, this product page contains both reviews.  The difference is that this projector does not have wifi, but it is wifi ready if you purchase the additional adapter.  I was confused when I read some of the reviews because they noted the wireless was poor, but there is no wireless on this particular model stock.With that out of the way, this is a really good projector for presentations and it's portable enough that it would make a decent, but not great, projection for movies.  The technical specifications are already reviewed so I'm reviewing on user experience.  I do presentations all the time and this projector is the brightest I've used and crystal clear for sharing directly from your pc or tablet.  Be forewarned, that this model comes with a standard VGA connector and a USB connector so it's PC ready, but if you want to use it with an IPAD or other tablet, you will need to purchase additional converters, which I had available to test.  The picture is extremely clear and has some easy slide controls for clarity and to angle the picture left or right.  It also has a zoom feature which is great if you need to place the projector close to a screen.  On the downside, if you're placing the projector far away, it does not have sufficient depth adjustment to make the picture smaller.  In a nutshell, you'll want this about 10 feet or closer from whatever you're projecting to.  I would throw it in the category of small room projection.Another great feature is the sound.  I tried hooking a dvd player to the projector directly with the HDMI connector and the standard audio cables and the sound was good.  It has 10 levels so although you're not getting stereo quality, it's loud enough for a room.  The picture was also bright, but I could see grid-like pixels during the movie.  It wasn't enough to distract me, but long term, probably not great for the eyes.I should also point out that the projector has auto detection of devices so if you only have one source plugged into the projector whether it's a cable box, dvd player or a computer, the projector automatically adjusts the souce setting.  The only thing I couldn't make work is the pointer on the remote control.  The remote has full access to the functions including volume, but I could only make the pointer appear, but not move it around.If you're looking to travel through airports with this, it's still rather sizable so I would consider a slimmer profile.  These are about the same size as projectors from 10 years ago so it's not something you slip easily next to your laptop or IPAD.  It does come with it's own over the shoulder carrying case but the projector and cables are all you can fit it in.  As mentioned earlier there's an option for a wireless module but I can't find the part number or how much it costs, so if you're looking for wireless, you'll want to EX-7235 instead.Overall, it's a really good value and perfect for on the road presentations if you're driving to your meetings.  It's dummy proof so you don't need to use the ctrl functions on your laptop to start projecting.  This can be good or bad if you're starting up and you don't want everyone to see what's on your desktop so you may want to wait until your presentation is on the computer before making the connection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXJUPXXIEOZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8XKAA2#wasThisHelpful","R2EXJUPXXIEOZS","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can see how some of the reviewers may have found this installment boring.  I personally did not find it so, but I can't say there was pulse pounding excitement or danger lurking around every corner.  I mean, let's face it, EVERY installment can't have Eve's or Roarke's life on the line and I would not wish it so.  For those of you who have never read the In Death series, it's not the place to start.  For those who are looking for action, this one's also not right for you.  For those long standing fans of the series who cherish catching up with Eve, her quirks, her family and her friends, then this one is a winner.When Lt Eve Dallas receives a phone call at 2:00am from none other than Trina, the bane of Eve's existence, claiming there's a dead body, Eve isn't convinced the whole thing isn't a joke.  That is until Eve finds herself staring at a dead man, tucked in his bed, apparently bludgeoned to death, along with a knife through the heart.  From then on, Eve's investigation leads her through interview after interview with the most unstable group of suspects who all have a motive to want the man dead.Overall, I would say this is 50% quality Eve time and the other 50% a murder mystery.  There's plenty of yummy Eve and Roarke scenes along with some comical moments of Eve <shudder> shopping, as well as helping with Christmas party preparations after making a deal with the devil.  The story is very matter of fact, slow paced and methodical, but nonetheless enjoyable since I always enjoy reading about these characters.  It's a great holiday edition to the series and I look forward to more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBUMC6XMYIHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIYH78#wasThisHelpful","R1GBUMC6XMYIHS","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not your typical fan of Rachel Morgan and the Hollows as a series, I've had mixed emotions all the way leading to this final conclusion.  My biggest gripe of the entire series is not the writing, the action, the plots or secondary characters, but more of oftentimes whiny, shallow, and inept glimpses of Rachel herself.  I was not particularly patient trying to watch her develop and grow into a person worthy of the power she possessed.  That being said, this book was absolute perfection and the heroine that is Rachel shines through with maturity, bravery, loyalty, cunning, and love.  If you haven't read any of the series, you absolutely cannot start here, however you may be able to start around Black Magic Sanction or even Pale Demon which are about five books back.The story comes to a head immediately with the vampires wanting their souls.  Rachel knows this is paramount to suicide for any vampire, but she's backed into a corner when those she loves are used against her.  With Rachel's prognosis coming true, the elves convince the vampires that all the vampires can have their souls back without consequence, but even though the vampires don't trust the elves, their obsession with their souls is their priority.  With the process of bringing them back, all of the demons are released and the story becomes a clash of powers with demons vs. vampires vs. elves with Rachel and her crew stuck in the middle.With so many loose ends to tie up, all of the major points are covered and where we generally get glimpses of side characters, they become solidly integrated into this final book where Rachel is not running off into danger alone and underwhelming, but with an entourage of support.  In fact, I can't think of a time when Rachel was even alone, giving Jenks, Ivy, Al, and a whole lot of Trent, precious story time.  The results were absolutely magical and the ending did not disappoint.  Kudos to Dawn Cook/Kim Harrison for such a wonderful conclusion to this wild roller coaster ride of a series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Y2194QKH9AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOGB1DQ#wasThisHelpful","R17Y2194QKH9AR","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when I received an ARC of The Last Victim through Amazon Vine and had no idea what I was in store for.  The reviews were mixed, because of all things, the ""hero"" in the story appeared to be a serial killer, which grossed people out, but following the genre of paranormal romance and urban fanstasy, I knew there was more to this than meets the eye.  For Karen Robards fans, this series is very different than what you're used to and some people love it, while others hate it, but I for one, love the series. One of the biggest differences is the frenetic way the book is written.  It's edgy with lots of long, disrupted sentences that give it a crazy, fast paced quality.  The first installment is very similar to Darynda Jones's Charlie Davidson series, which is another fantastic urban fantasy/paranormal romance suspense series, but over the last three books, this series has come into it's own and although I love the journey so far, I do think we need a major leap forward to get this series on sturdy ground. If you haven't read this series from the beginning, you could pick it up here, but the dynamics will not be as fulfilling so it's best if you're already on this ride to pick up book 3.Dr. Charlie Stone is an expert psychologist who profiles serial killers.  She's determined to find a correlation in their nature or nuture that leads to this behavior.  She often helps the FBI in profiling, but since the last novel, where she was almost killed, she's a little slow to join the hunt these days.  That, and she's distracted not only by the ghosts she can see and hear, but also by the gorgeous ghost whom she's apparently falling in love with.This go around, we learn alot more about Michael's past as he gets closer and closer to leaving this earthly plane forever.  Charlie is desperate to keep him with her, but constantly jeopardizes the situation by running into scrape after scrape which calls for desperate measures from Michael to protect her, thus thrusting him out of the human realm of the living.  This viscious cycle is what leaves this a four star instead of a five for me.  Charlie is absolutely deranged and can't make up her mind about what she wants and what is good for her.  This angst dragged on quite a bit and the push pull of her feelings for Michael get a bit tiring.  The ending is definitely a bit of a cliff hanger and I'm curious to see where it brings us, but if we go back to denials or worse yet, the end of Michael, then this series has no place to go.  He is the very essence of what makes this series so good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TFR56XHUVGXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHMF9I6#wasThisHelpful","R2TFR56XHUVGXF","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before writing this review, I had to read what others had to say.  I'm not sure what posessed me to get a laughing monkey, but when I saw it in my Vine selection, I was thinking it would be great for my two year old nephew.  That being said, he did enjoy it for quite some time, but only under strict supervision.  The sensor is very sensitive on this thing and it's essentially belly laughing constantly.  I say belly laughing because it's kicks and flails and waives it's hands around almost grabbing its belly to contain the laughter.  The bottom of the monkey is also ship shaped so that it essentially rocks back and forth on its back.  Each cycle of laughter goes on for about 10 seconds, which although not a long amount of time, seems really long with how obnoxious it is.With that out of the way, it's actually not a plush toy at all.  The motion detector box is actually quite hard so I wouldn't leave this toy unsupervised since you could throw it at someone and it would hurt or if you accidentally fell on it, definitive ouchies there.  It comes with batteries, thank God, since it's a tiny screw cap to get batteries replaced and the velcro opening to access to battery and power panel doesn't open wide enough for me to fudge around in there.With all the logistics out of the way, I ended up scratching my head wondering what you do with it in the long term.  Ultimately, it has its appeal but after a while, I can only see turning this off and putting it somewhere as a fixture since it annoys parents in about 5 minutes or less.  The one thing I have to agree with my fellow reviewers which I hadn't really thought of is that this would scare the pants off anyone if you left it randomly around the house, including critters.  My dogs barked at this thing the whole time I let it run and everytime they went to investigate it, the monkey would start up again, thus more barking ensued. I was also able to scare the pants off my sister and nephew. Overall, it's a good little gag gift, but for the long haul, you'd have to get creative with it's purpose.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J62JBU8S10NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9972NG#wasThisHelpful","R2J62JBU8S10NU","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried this printer through the Vine program along side a smaller version of the 4640.  I was curious about the legal sized capabilities of this printer, having recently gone through two home closings for family members, I struggled with legal document sized copying and scanning and found myself having to go to the bank to get the scans completed.  Well, if you're managing large paper formats, this is definitely the printer for you.The printer, once again, is easy to setup with a step by step walkthrough process.  It's wifi enabled so you can print from multiple devices and the range for printing wireless is pretty easy.  The quality of the copies and prints is fantastic and it comes with four separate ink cartridges for black and colors which makes the colors vibrant overall.The only downside to this printer is that when it says wide format, it means it.  This printer is enormous and takes up a good sized space on my desk, but again, if you find yourself working with legal sized documents, this is the printer for you.  I had no problems printing and scanning legal sized documents and the quality is as crisp as printing letter size.  If you feel you don't need to print or manage large format documents however, this printer would pretty much be overkill.  It comes with an sk and ms slot for photos, although I haven't used them since I don't have these, but I would imagine it could print some pretty incredible at home panoramic large scale photos.All in all, I would say I'm very impressed with Epson's printers and have left HP behind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLTDG1146162/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGELG#wasThisHelpful","RKLTDG1146162","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a manageable size printer in that, although it's large, it's actually tall and doesn't take up much space on a desktop and absolutely cranks out printing.  It's the fastest print job I've seen after going through about 4 printers including other Epson's and HP's.  There's two paper feeders, one that fits a full ream of paper so running out shouldn't be an issue.  I've not run through the ink cartridges yet, and that's saying something since it comes with the smaller sized ink cartridges, but I'd say it depletes at a fairly normal rate compared to other inkjets.  The duplex printing is one of my favorite features since you can print on both sides of the paper and inkjet printers have come such a long way in that there isn't smudging of the ink since it goes through a dual print process.Scanning is also extremely easy and the only quirk is that it will automatically name the file which cannot be overridden at time of scanning, but you can rename the file onces it's saved.  I have not been successful in scanning legal size documents to capture the whole thing, but I'm wondering if that has more to do with my install.  It's just not an option in the scan control panel for me.For a home office and at the price point, this is an extremely efficient printer, copier, and scanner all in one with excellent, vibrant colors.  Even photos come out nicely.The printer was extremely easy to setup and the control panel essentially walks you through the process.  I've been successful in printing directly from my pc as well as from my Ipad so the wireless feature is sound.  Great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IRA8JT53PRMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGETS#wasThisHelpful","R1IRA8JT53PRMX","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No matter what Ms. Frost writes, I will read it and that is completely attributed to the Night Huntress series.  The wit, humor and chemistry of the characters in that series is simply magical, which makes it such a tough act to follow.  That being said, this is something completely different and although action packed with an intriguing new universe of demons and angels, I am not hooked yet.20 year old Ivy is having the worst week of her life.  Her sister went missing a week ago and when her parents went to search for her, they were both killed in an accident.  Ivy doesn't know heads from tails anymore, but she's determined to find her sister.  When Ivy trails her sister's and parent's steps, she finds herself in a creepy town where her delusions are stronger than ever.  Ivy is on medication since she's seen things all her life that weren't really there, or at least no one else can see them, but when she gets caught in the battle between angels and demons, she realizes she's not crazy and she finds herself in a new world that is too horrific to imagine.This is a solid foundation to a new series that is extremely reminiscent of the TV series, Supernatural, which I happen to love.  All in all, there is some very clever writing and Ivy is a likeable, if not overly innocent, protagonist, however I was slightly disappointed by the underlying love story.  Cat and Bones chemistry, this is not.  It would have been better if the hero and heroine actually liked one another as a precursor to falling in love.  The story is very angsty and reads more like a young adult vs. a new adult (whatever that means) novel. Alas, I will be reading the next installment to see where the series will take us, but for now, I have not found myself invested in the characters and look forward to more dialogue and interaction instead of the inner thoughts and angst.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKQVNZPSPAQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IB5D940#wasThisHelpful","R1BKQVNZPSPAQG","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This had a very decent premise, but I have to admit, I didn't really care for either the hero or the heroine.  As the author writes that she loves classic romance such as Judith McNaught and Julie Garwood, you can truly see the influence of the typical damsel in distress romance with a slow building love between the two characters.  What took away from that is that the hero is a tyrannical dumba$$ and the heroine, who was the leader of her people, is a helpless twit who only dreams of love and has no business leading people.  These characters really needed some depth and a demonstration of logical thinking for me to truly enjoy it.Under the tyranny of a wannabe Warlord, Thenl, a planet falls to war and strife under the leadership of a murderer and betrayer.  Three years ago, Thenl betrayed the true Overlord, Vaan and poisoned Vaan and his 15 most trusted warriors. Vaan's mother learns of the plot and manages to switch the poison to a sleeping draught.  With the warriors safely tucked away in a cave, Vaan's mother dies before she can revive them and three years later, Mikayla, ruler of her people, has come under the scrutiny of Thenl.  To save her people she knows she must find the warriors and revive them to keep her safe.  Once revived, one of them is honor bound to mate with Mikayla and unbeknownst to her at first, she chooses Vaan.All in all the premise is interesting, and the writing is good, but right from the start, Vaan is just not smart.  He's wary Mikayla wants to hurt him and his men..... hmmm, she revived them from a three year sleep.  If she wanted to hurt them, she could have done it while they were sleeping!  Regardless, Vaan is attracted to Mikayla and believes they will make many children together and proceeds to mate with his wife, but apparently his cultural belief is for a woman to simply lie still while he takes his pleasure and rolls over to fall asleep.  Mikayla is very sensual and teaches Vaan about intimacy, but somewhere along the lines, the author forgot Mikayla was actually a ruler and she essentially becomes a witless piece of fluff who rushes into danger and causes distractions everywhere she goes.  I wasn't happy with the turn of events.  Eventually, many of the characters grow on you, but it could have been better if the lead characters showed a modicum of intelligence, but at the end, I likely won't continue with the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KUKHO0HRUPL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I6B9C5E#wasThisHelpful","R3KUKHO0HRUPL3","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gerogette St. Clair is an auto read for me.  She turns books out quickly and every single one of them is wrought with humor, tension and romance.  Although a fairly easy and slightly predictable story overall, Ms. St Clair manages to keep this story engaging with a few twists and turns that I was not expecting but enjoyed all the more.  Technically a second story in a series, you can easily read it as a standalone, but the first book is so good too, why wouldn't you read that too?Karen Padfoot is a struggling lynx shifter who's had to raise her younger brother and sister in a world where the name Padfoot is lower than dirt.  Her father is a drunk and a thief and is getting into scrape after scrape where Karen is constantly bailing him out of trouble.  In spite of her no good father, she's put herself through law school, but can't get a job with the reputable shifter firm so starts her own practice.  Ty Battle is a wolf shifter Alpha and he's had the hots for Karen since they were in highschool, but due to his philandering ways, he always misses his opportunity with Karen.  When the Battle family catches her father stealing from them, Ty sees this as the perfect leverage to finally get Karen in his clutches.This is another story where I find the main characters suffering a bit for the development of side characters, but that development is so wonderful, I didn't really mind.  Although there are a few crossovers from book 1, it truly is a standalone read that's fast paced, engaging, sexy, and simple.  In general, this is a short and sweet story that clearly leaves the series open for much more interesting stories with fairly ominous danger around the corner.  Ms. St. Clair's wit, sense of humor and sensuality makes any story a good one and I'm sure this story sets up for many entertaining stories to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0QHF9PQIITX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MD4TX68#wasThisHelpful","R2G0QHF9PQIITX","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A happy day is the day SE Smith releases a new story.  I am never disappointed reading her books and overall, her books generaly get a five star rating.  As much as I enjoyed this latest release, it is true that a certain spark was missing. With a Touch of Frost, we get a truly unique story that ultimately comes down to Aliens vs. Paranormal.  I never would have dreamed up such a universe but there you have it.  I devoured the book in one sitting, but at the end, I have to admit that the characters were not flushed out and developed as well as her other stories.  We have a little back story on some of the people, but not enough for you to feel invested in their well being.Frost is an intergalactic law enforcer who must track down a truly evil alien creature, Taar, who has escaped to the primitive world called Earth.  His mission this go around is to kill Taar and return with the inhabitants of the planet none the wiser, but when Frost tracks Taar down in a place called Magic, New Mexico, both Taar and Frost are in for a total shock when they meet a beautiful young woman named Lacey.  Magic, is a place where there's, well, magic.  Witches, werewolves, vampires, ghosts, trolls, shapeshifters and every other creature call Magic home and it's a place where the unique and special can be left alone.  So when the showdown of Alien vs Paranormal come to a head, Aliens have got nothing on these creatures!One thing that was special about the book is that you have no idea where it's going.  There are so many twists and turns, with danger around every corner you have no clue where the story is going to take you.  When you think the danger is over, more comes at you.  The love story between Frost and Lacey comes much too quickly and there wasn't enough time for you to feel the spark between the main characters, but we clearly sacrifice depth with the protagonists due to the development of many side characters who made up for it.  As many first books go, this lays the foundation for wonderful future installments, but was spread to thin for it to be a home run as a standalone.  This is still an engaging story, but not the best work down by this author.  Still, I will read anything she has to write.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KKJJ8LYXQA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJL51T8#wasThisHelpful","R35KKJJ8LYXQA0","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the perfect little spongeholder and is designed to easily clean based on the fact that most water has a lot of muck that builds up over time.  There are two slots for holding sponges and although the holder is metal, it has slits in the bottom for the water to drain into a plastic bottom.  The stainless steel does acquire a rusty buildup but it cleans off easily.  I also like the clear plastic bottom since it pops apart and is easy to detect dirt as well as easy to clean. Overall, it's a tasteful holder for sponges that doesn't look all cluttered on the coutertop next to the sink.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IH5HWFNJ7ZD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3JXDRM#wasThisHelpful","R2IH5HWFNJ7ZD5","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got these, I thought for some reason that they were border covers, but they only cover the side rails of the crib.  My particular crib has slats on the side so you can only velcro together at certain intervals but it does seem to do the job.  The cotton is extremely soft and although slightly slippery, the covers do not slip around as much as you might think.  Overall, I would have liked to have seen a little extra padding for protection in case my Godson hit his head on the rail.  It's a quality product, but not extraordinary and it appears to provide more protection for the crib from scratching than it does for the baby.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BI89AAIX4ED2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3TVIV4#wasThisHelpful","R2BI89AAIX4ED2","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been waiting five years for this story and as Melanthe describes her own love story, it is indeed, EPIC.  This story was certainly different in that it was sweeping novel of trials and tribulations for Melanthe and Thronos to come together, but at the end of it all, I actually thought it was slightly dragged out and slightly anticlimactic at the end.  It took me longer to read this story than any of her others because at times it was almost on a repeat mode of Melanthe and Thronos about to get together, interruption, fight some peril, and then the same loop over and over again.  At one point, I was really thinking, enough already!  That being said, it was still a really good story with action around every corner and a love for the ages.Sorceress Melanthe has known her intended mate since she was a small girl, except that her mate is a vrekener and sworn enemy to the sorceri.  They had a secret friendship as children and but one night when she's 11 years old, the vrekener attack her family, killing her parents and sister.  Melanthe, a powerful sorceress at a young age, wills her sister to live and thralls her future mate to jump out a window to fall to his doom, except the extrodinairy happens and he doesn't die.  Ever since that moment, they became the enemies they were meant to be and 500 years later, Thronos finally captures Melanthe to exact his revenge.The journey and quality couple time is fantastic if not a bit drawn out.  In the beginning, the two have nothing but insults to sling at one another but over time and through much turmoil, they learn to work together and build trust with one another.  Like many bad romances, there is no switch that's flipped where they're instantly in love, but at the same time, when you realize these two truly belong together, it gets delayed over and over again.  On the downside, neither character is particularly likeable.  I especially didn't care for Melanthe, although I've found her to be dazzling in Sabine's story, when you break down her past, quite frankly, she should be a little ashamed getting her powers stolen over and over again.What truly makes the book memorable are side stories with Nix and finally..... Furie!!  This story trumps the Dacians and Macrieve by a mile, but it still isn't in the leagues of Mariketa and Bowen or any of her earlier works if I think on it.  The series is still going strong and I certainly look forward to future installments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GPXDSOYJ4H8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKKTZZU#wasThisHelpful","R1GPXDSOYJ4H8H","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In paranormal romance, some authors know how to write sexy love scenes and some know how to write an engaging story, but Emma Holly, consistently, does both and that is certainly the case with this new and unique series about the Djinn.  The down and dirty is that this reads like a smoking hot fairy tale that is as engaging as any Disney quest but with graphic smexiness rolled into one.  One of Ms. Holly's strengths is that she knows how to write extremely likable and unforgettable characters and when the story is over, regrettably, you move on to the next set of characters who are also likeable so you get over it quickly, but I've always wanted to read more about the same characters, being the serial addict that I am.  It looks like this go around, I'm getting a happy compromise since this series surrounds, what I believe will likely be four main storylines that all interweave together so we don't quite have to say goodbye to the happy couples.Book 1, The Guardian, focuses on Djinni Arcadius, commander of his great city, who, with his trusted servant and magician Joseph, has come to modern day New York to help save his homeland.  He and Jospeh barely escape their plight and now need to find a way home to overtake a great and powerful sorceress.  His instincts bring him to a lonely for rent brownstone where he meets landlady, Elyse Soloman.  Elyse is still grieving the loss of both her husband and father under tragic and suspicious circumstances, but when she meets these two men, something about them compels her to help them.  From there, we are swept away in a fantastical tale with danger around every corner and literal magic carpet rides.  Although entirely out of her element,Elyse is a believable, brave and smart heroine.  No too stupid to live moments here.  She's in danger and she does what needs to be done to keep her and her friends safe.  Arcadius is intense, honorable and fierce when it comes to protecting what he loves.  And then there's Joseph, who simply steals your heart and although you're wrapped up in the beauty of Elyse and Arcadius, he's never far from your thoughts and all you want is his happily ever after.For those of you looking for instant gratification, there's no ending for this book.  It is definitely to be continued, but it leaves you satisfied and looking forward to the next installment.  Although I'd be more than happy to pick up where we left off with Arcadius and Elyse, being titled the Guardian, I have a sneaking suspicion that Arcadius and Elyse's story will go to the back burner so that we may learn more about the artist, the magician and the sultan.  Regardless, the story is simply magical, with love, laughter, heartbreak, and peril throughout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTYXNSWK08RMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098889436X#wasThisHelpful","RTYXNSWK08RMY","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure there are the right words to describe how fantastic this 7th installment to the series is.  It's what you expected, what you didn't expect and completely mixed with laugh, love and heartbreak around every corner.  Congratulations to team Ilona Andrews on their first Hardcover story, they knocked it out of the park.  For anyone still buying the paper format, this is worth the price in any format and leaves you wanting more, more and more.  For those of you who have never read the series, you can actually pick this book up and read it.  It won't have the full impact us fans have from the building to this moment, but this book comes with a introduction to the series as well as a glossary of characters that is done extremely well.In terms of a book synopsis, all you need to know is Roland has arrived.  Enough said there.  It actually goes down in a way I had expected, but the action, twists and turns on the journey getting there was an absolute thrill ride.  Hugh continues to be one of the most delicious villains I've ever read and his chemistry with Kate is absolutely off the charts.  The quality Ghastek time in this book was filled with laughter and poignancy.  Derek and Ascanio had some great scene stealing moments together that left me grinning hours later. And most importantly, Kate and Curran remain an insititution where, individually, they are a force to be reckoned with, but together are unstoppable.  Kate's magic breaks through in a way we've never seen before and we find many answers to lingering questions throughout the series.  There's also the untimely death of something very dear to Kate that I hadn't realized became a character unto it's own.Overall, Magic Breaks raises the depth of the characters to a new level and you can see how much Kate and Curran have matured.  Once you get into the second chapter, it's a complete roller coaster ride that has you gripped one moment and then lets you relax another.  The ending is what is most surprising and I'm dying with curiosity to see how this series continues with the new dynamics.  I know the authors have at least three more books planned, but this series could go on for ages and I, for one, hope it does.  Seven books and counting have proven this is the best series in Urban Fantasy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PXDX0VZB5YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L6JV4#wasThisHelpful","R28PXDX0VZB5YE","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been hooked on this series ever since the first, even with the repetition and the constant reminders that Gin Blanco is the bad$$ Spider.  For those of you who have read the series, you know what I mean.  Even when I think it's a good time to break away, I simply can't.  As a series overall, it's just that good and I've grown to love the characters.  If you haven't read the series before, this is not the best book to pick up.  It's not that you won't understand what's going on since there's always some back story to help you catch up, it's just that this installment is not the best to get a sense of how special these characters are.In this installment, Gin matches against the local vampire drug lord, Beauregard Benson, who has a special air elemental talent and is not only extremely dangerous, but an immediate threat to Gin's sister, Bria.  Although the story is action packed and Gin comes out for the first time ever as a true player in Ashland's community, there's someone lurking around every corner throughout the whole story who you know is the real threat.  That being said, although entertaining, this installment is really a filler for the next installment, The Black Widow which promises to be as good as the first books.In terms of character dynamics, all the usual suspects make an appearance, but there was something bland about their roles.  Bria is uncharacteristically crazy, Owen was just there and there was no spark between him and Gin, and even Finn was a shell of himself taking a back seat to the family drama.  The ending comes with a not so surprise, but it's still good enough to get you pumped for the next one and I thank Ms. Estep that she writes more than one of these installments each year.  I am looking forward to the next, but this 11th book did not have me in its grip like they usually do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DOVHFW5UDKMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB23K#wasThisHelpful","R1DOVHFW5UDKMH","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm completely in love with the Kate Daniel series and to a lesser extent, the edge series.  I was thrilled to see Burn for Me as an Amazon vine selection and couldn't wait to read it.  I had no expectations going into it and had no clue what it was about, except that it was a romance with magical elements.  So with that in mind, this was completely unexpected to me.  I'll start by saying that this is not a romance so if you've never read Ilona Andrews before, this could throw you for a loop.  It may likely get there the way Kate and Curran got there in their other series, but after one book, I could take them or leave them as a couple.  Secondly, this is a series that focuses on the same characters, but with equal billing.  I had assumed it was a new universe with a new couple featured in each book like the Edge, but that's not the case.  Nor is it about a girl who ultimately builds a network around her.  With the Hidden Legacy series, the two main characters are introduced separately and eventually meet and that's not until you're almost 100 pages in and the meeting is a lot of things, but romantic certainly isn't one of them.  So romance?  Not yet, but it certainly looks promising. For now, I'd categorize it as straight action packed urban fantasy set in modern day Houston.  If you're looking for some hardcore smex, you won't find it here since it will likely build out over an unknown amount of books.With that out of the way, as always, Ilona Andrews is completely engaging, intelligent, witty and fast paced so fans won't be disappointed.  Nevada Baylor is a caring, intelligent, compassionate and talented young woman who is trying to keep her family afloat.  Connor ""Mad"" Rogan is an enigmatic, sensual, unrepetant rogue who we've yet to touch the surface of in terms of all he represents.  It's not perfectly clear who the bad guys are yet, but they're there and they're really bad and the world building is once again, unique, well thought out and well developed.  Although the book does wrap up the main storyline, there's something about this book in particular that leaves me wanting... something that makes it more obvious than usual that this is to be continued and you'll just have to wait.  Since there is an excerpt for the next book already, I hope these are released alot sooner than one year in between.  I'm not sure it would carry the time distance between books as well as Kate Daniels does.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI1TEXUMK09VT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062289233#wasThisHelpful","RI1TEXUMK09VT","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not easy finding shower chairs that have back support and when you do, they're usually over $100.00.  I recently purchased one such chair for my mom and it was over 2ft long and pretty much takes up most of the shower space.  When I received this Moen chair, I was thrilled.  The chair comes in 6 pieces, 4 legs, the seat and the back and snaps into place in less than a minute.  It's very sturdy, has about an 18"" seat size and doesn't take up the whole shower.  The legs screw to adjust the height and it has a niche on each side of the chair to place a handheld shower head.  The only thing that is a little tricky for my mom is that the seat curves upwards making it a little awkward trying to get out of the chair.  I noticed that they have a version that has handles on the side to help you stand up and that would have been the ideal chair overall.  Still, this is a great value, the perfect size and ensures my mom will not tumble over the back while showering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AEY5S1O6T1X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045EFO2Q#wasThisHelpful","R1AEY5S1O6T1X8","A2KY76HK8DYRL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KY76HK8DYRL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bright white fondant is easy to work with. The 1.5-pound size is perfect for covering and decorating one 8"" cake. The fondant can be colored (preferably with gel food colors), cut, and dried to make the stand-up decorations you see on the packaging.This fondant has a much better taste and creamier appearance than the Wilton brand. As such, I would recommend it to beginners.My only complaint is that the packaging box was beat up and open when it arrived. Thankfully, the fondant was well secured in air-tight plastic packaging within the cardboard box. I would recommend the manufacturer switch to the standard plastic tubs most decorators prefer for fondant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDYWQ7KASYUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4N4AN0#wasThisHelpful","R1HDYWQ7KASYUQ","A2AYJJAFNSGSU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYJJAFNSGSU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bulk pack of scissors is great for schools, preschools, and even church classes. The scissors are all the same green color.While the package says they are pointed tips, they are not a triangular point. They have a soft point, more in between a point and a true rounded tip.I found a little bit of a hitch in the action of the scissors, meaning that they are a little sticky when opening and closing them. If your kids have a hard time opening and closing them, you may need to apply something to them like WD-40 to get them moving easier.My daughters are in fifth grade and second grade, and they found the handles a little small.

"These Crayola coloring pages are used the Crayola Color Alive app (free, downloadable app from the App Store). The set comes with the coloring book, Crayola crayons, a special effects crayon, and you download the free app.To get started, your child colors in the sheets using the included crayons. Once they are finished coloring, then they use the app to scan the special effects crayon (take a picture). After scanning their crayon, then they take a second picture of the colored design. The app then pops up a 3D image of their colored Barbie that moves. The Barbie walks like a model, and tosses her hair. My children wished it was slightly more interactive and would talk.

She watches all of the My Little Pony cartoons, so she was thrilled to have a chance to get her hands on this doll.

Her pet comes with a sleeping cap (which also fits on the doll). All of the clothes and shoes are removable.The only thing we did not like about the doll is that she cannot stand on her own.

"Butlers stories are crafted in such a way that I felt like many parts of them happened to him.  Recurrent scenes of abandoned children, evil lurking in otherwise normal small towns, alcoholism and it's results. There are nightmarish scenes and sweet ones too. This is raw stuff and some run a bit long for my tastes and could use some chopping. The set ends nicely on an up-note with Apples, easily the ""nicest"" story of the bunch, but for my money the most interesting story was Western Counties because of the revenge factor. Evil doesn't always win.Synopsis:Chainsaw Soiree:  Lust, greed, envy and rural types mix in what could only be described as bachannal meets annual firewood gathering. Yes, there are chainsaws mixed in. Run away, run away fast!Rainwater: A grandfather and boy experience's in a slice of life wherein the boy's mother is not present and may never be again.Sven and Lily: Two buddies, one is the other's caretaker in bar situations when the other almost crosses a line into adultery.Morels: (play on the word morals) Three old buddies get away with a horrible crime during a dark, drunken, pot-fueled mushroom gathering weekend.Leftovers: A man and his wife clean up the rest of his dead mother's house. The man's breakthrough: realizing he loves his wife but he can easily live without her.Beneath the bonfire: A woman almost meets her end during an eerie nighttime, winter scuba dive. Her boyfriend is a vet who finally finds love but she misreads his actions and freaks out.Sweet Light Crude: Old guy goes off the deep end over an oil spill, kidnaps an oil executive with bad results. Tasty!Western Counties: Abusive, psycho ""fighting dog"" owner slithers into town and corrupts everyone - almost. Lady cop to the rescue!Train People Move Slow: Alcoholic skank with two kids takes advantage of nice guy, moves in, then abandons them all.

"Pristine white, soft, luxuriant feeling (Really, in polyester? Yes!) this is a standard sized shower curtain. As others have stated, it needs a liner and paired with my clear, frosted liner and clear shower curtain rings, this looks very elegant in my white bathroom. I already was going for a total white look anyway and this fits the ticket very well.I got it out of the package and there were some very strong fold marks in it, so I tossed it in the dryer for 20 minutes and they disappeared, much as I expected they would. It hangs beautifully, no odd angles or flaws. It's about an inch shorter than my older outer curtain, but It's not that noticeable.What I like:  The feel is nice, very soft like cotton.  The color is a pure white-white, not a blue-white or yellow white.  The curtain has two magnets at the bottom corners to help keep it in place. It was extremely easy to hang. The waffle-weave puts an interesting texture in the bath where most of the surfaces are either porcelain or shiny tile.What I don't like: NOTHING.

"These are high-quality CZ earrings with a very nice, clean mounting of rhodium-plated sterling silver. The stones are quite large, clear and very good quality for CZ, no flaws on the surfaces from what I could see with my loop. The bezel is very deep and nearly without flaws, although one of this set had a small pit in the very bottom, positioned well as it's doubtful anyone would see it. The connection between the top and the dangle is strong as are the posts. I found the posts to be somewhat long, but if you wanted to go to the trouble, a jeweler could shorten them and re-crimp them for the clasps. They feel heavy and important for a set of earrings of this size and any woman would be please to wear them in place of something far more expensive.All in all this is a beautiful set of earrings and seemingly of high quality for the current price.

"Got this a couple days ago, took it to a friend's pool today to test it out and had fun splashing around and diving. A caveat is needed here, I've never owned snorkel equipment before so I may not be using the right terminology, but it's not rocket science after all.Breathing tube: My breathing tube portion worked fine, did not leak at all.  It held up when I went down to the bottom of the pool, only let air out, did not let water in. Did not taste odd at all. No problems.Mask: The mask felt good and tight when I put it on, but as I got wetter and wetter, it seemed to get more loose. It fit my face well, except around the nose, seemed loose there no matter what and tightening it did not help. A friend tried it on and it didn't fit his face at all, was way too small and he had a lot of leaks. I think this mask was designed for thinner faces or smaller faces, not big or flat faced skulls (and no offense intended, humans come in a lot of different sizes and shapes). The glass in the goggles is great, stayed clear and did not distort images at all.  Stayed tight in a dive, no fall-offs. The plastic is very comfortable, not rough or hard.The colors are nice, helps to find them in a mix of gear. I also like the carrying case which makes a nice travel pouch for these so they're not flopping around loose in your vehicle or your luggage.I think there needs to be some more design done, this mask may be problematic for some people.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNYVA9LOVUDW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWX6DJY#wasThisHelpful","RNYVA9LOVUDW4","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I'm in the mood to be a little nutty, these pistachio nuts are the perfect answer. While these don't hit the sweet spot that salted nuts do, they're still good and the salt isn't good for me anyway. I am going to save half this bag and add them to my banana bread as I know they'll be great in that. I just sat here and ate half the bag without stopping, so next time I'm getting the larger size. A few of these had that ""not quite right"" flavor that you always get with a few of every batch of ANY nut you eat, so I'm not going to hold that against Diamond. It's part of the package deal with nuts, you know there's going to be at least one of those. Otherwise, I'm sure these would be great in recipes (too hot to bake right now) and I look forward to using them and eating them just right out of the bag. You'd be nuts not to like these nuts.

"Making firewood is something that takes up much of my time in the late summer and entire fall. I've used axes, mauls and hatchets of all kinds over the last 30 years of wood stove ownership. I've never owned a throwing tomahawk and have never thrown a hatchet. However, I lost my hatchet last fall and decided to choose this one to replace it.Not only is this tool beautiful, it's incredibly sharp and very well balanced. The end opposite the blade is handy as well for sticking into the end of a small log and splitting it for kindling. The handle seems very sturdy and has a good grip that fits in my hand. I also like the handy case it came in that I'll be able to wear on my belt while using the chain saw. I've already used this to clear off logs of small branches and it whittles them off easily. So far, it's held up nicely with no looseness at all.A very beautifully-designed tool that not only looks stunning but is one I'm sure I'll enjoy using for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R138K6U6RXKKJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3QBYIO#wasThisHelpful","R138K6U6RXKKJQ","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love this range. There's something about the style, the ease of cleaning and the overall operation of this range that feels almost retro and more solid than any gas range I've owned. There are zero electronic panels, which I love because we live in a wooded, rural area and there are tons of power outages here which mess up ANY computerized panels and eventually kill them. This is very basic, electric starters for the burners and a standard ""glow coil"" for the oven. The entire thing is a joy to clean, no crevices and odd places that don't allow for easy cleaning. I don't know who designed this thing but it's a shame that GE has discontinued it's Artistry series. The only thing I'm taking away a star for is the clock. Two things about it seem a little off. The finish is chrome, but the handles and other accents are brushed steel, so it doesn't really match well. And the other, (which many other reviews elsewhere state) is how loud the clock is. It doesn't bother me and actually I've grown used to it, but there is a slight, low ""grinding"" noise that comes from it which sounds a little like tiny gears are grinding away which might get on the nerves of some people. Where I live is totally noise-free so it seems louder on a quiet day than normal. The white color has a blue cast to it, which doesn't necessarily match today's white cabinet styles well, so be sure and keep that in mind if you are doing a ""white kitchen"" look. It's a bit whiter/bluish look, the standard appliance white instead of cream.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30W8390KBKY5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ2EDF2#wasThisHelpful","R30W8390KBKY5N","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been running this air cleaner for about 4 days now and it has really made a big difference. I have both a pollen and dust problem here as I'm surrounded by trees and flowers and there is a lot of construction in the area, forcing me to keep the windows closed most of the time. I'm running it in the bedroom so I can sleep better at night. It doesn't heat up the air that much, which is good and it's really fairly quiet on the lowest setting. I normally wake up and cough about 3 times a night, the last two nights I've slept almost all the way through.Very easy to operate, just pop open the grill, put in the charcoal filters on top of the ones in place, shut and turn on. I run the high setting during the day and the lowest setting at night. I'm still checking out a set of new filters to buy for this because I know they'll be hard to find, but they always are for these things.It's sort of confusing as there is feet on two sides, so when looking at the instructions, just pay attention to the visuals. Not sure why they designed it like that as it's about the same height as it is deep. Otherwise this is a good product and hopefully the filters won't cost too much.

"Valerie Martin's stories are interesting and there are a few in this collection that are interesting and good reads. However, I found the bulk of them to be somewhat unfulfilling in that the endings or plot summaries seemed unfinished or perhaps the author could not resolve things artfully.Back in my heyday we had a line that we'd say to wrap up a story: ""They all became strippers and died.""  In many cases, the author seemed to end her works in this way as if she were bored with the story and wanted to move on. This happens, that happens and BOOM, the end. These are not short stories in many cases, they are ideas and concepts which could easily become novels. Some border on science fiction or fantasy, others could be classified as literature. Some are far too long and could be easily chopped in half.I found the title story to be a little odd, written in a different style and ironically did not seem to fit with the rest. The best story by far was ""His Blue Period"" as it felt the most real for me. The worst was ""The Unfinished Novel"" which weaved to and fro until it's incredibly unsatisfying ending: we never get even a glimpse of the novel in question and it is literally buried. ( I'd sure have written a different ending for that one!)Don't get me wrong, it's quality writing and that kept me in the game. I never had the urge to walk away from her works, but overall felt like this is an author who is emerging (though I know this isn't the case), still honing not her writing skills, but her story creation skills. The concepts were 50/50 for me, I liked about half of these.Three generous stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSDDHZYGD56S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385533527#wasThisHelpful","R1TSDDHZYGD56S","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are office chairs for being comfy and semi-lounging at work and there are office chairs which seem to say ""Back to work!"" and command you to sit up. The basyx chair does the latter and is aptly named a ""task chair"".  The chair is easy to put together, it took me about 15 minutes. The directions are visuals only, zero written instructions, but if you can count the holes on the seat and deduce from them which screws go where (4 small for the center mount, 6 medium for the arms, and 4 long for the back) you will do fine. Once it was together, I rolled it into my office and am now sitting in front of this very review screen while using it. The vertically adjustable arms are stiffly padded, there's some give to them. The back is straight and somewhat severe, it's going to teach me good posture whether I like it or not. There is an adjustable lumbar insert behind the mesh back which helps the lower back. And you can adjust the height, but for my small frame, the lowest it can go is good. There's a knob which supposedly increases or decreases the tilt flexibility, but I didn't notice anything either way.The seat padding is what I have the most problem with, due to a hip injury I'm very sensitive about seats. I had to put my gel pillow down, even with the lack of ""bucket"" shape in the seat (which is not good for me anyway) because the seat is cushioned but extremely firm, my weight hardly puts a dent in it.It's a solid chair, but not for maximum comfort.

"Not being a regular tea-drinker, I do, however, enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon when one's energy levels occasionally start to flag and thoughts of afternoon siestas begin to taunt one's periphery. I normally reach for my favorite, Constant Comment, which I find to be a superior representative of the black teas that are available on the grocer's shelf. From my perspective, Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea is a distant third from my favorite, with - astoundingly - Lipton's standard tea being second in line, which I'm sure many will find rather pedestrian or of low character.Upon awakening this morning, I reached for the kettle and brewed a cup with boiling water for the requisite 5 minutes (my normal steep time). Upon tasting without any additives, felt that it was somewhat bland. I re-inserted the now-sodden bag and heated it up again in the microwave on high for an additional 3 minutes and found that it had a much richer flavor. I also must admit that the flavor changed slightly once it cooled down a bit as it became less sharp and more mellow. This mellowness was heightened further once I added my normal stevia and vanilla soy milk. It is, admittedly, a passable cup of tea in a pinch. However, for my tastes, I'd rather drink my favorite. It seems richer and a bit more exotic than this one, with a few slight notes of orange and spice.Naturally, there are those who would have differing opinions, but tea and coffee are such personal drinks, it's hard to get a solid consensus on these things. Hopefully, I will not be looked at with low regard for my confessions, having a somewhat limited exposure to the world of teas and much less than those well-traveled sorts who I'm sure could offer a well-educated treatise on the various qualities of many teas which I may have never had the pleasure of meeting. Even so, I am tasked with offering my simple, well-worded opinion here and in doing so hope that it is received with open minds and hearts, which is the same manner by which I have elucidated and revealed my thoughts on this lovely product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BKHQKY3YDZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLSXDLS#wasThisHelpful","R9BKHQKY3YDZT","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never owned a piece of exercise equipment before this because I'm physically active most of the time (gardening, construction, lawn care, ect), but I decided to choose this item due to winter and lack of activity which is impacting my waistline a bit more every year.The box arrived while I was gone and it took every ounce of strength I have to get it into the garage. I had a friend help me get the main piece out of the box and then between the two of us reading the instructions and figuring things out, about 2 hours later (with long breaks) we had the unit together. It's not that hard to do, just a little tedious. The main thing (which they stress in the manual) is to be careful to not get any of the wires caught while fastening various parts onto the main unit. (Make sure you build this thing near where you're going to leave it, we nearly died getting it down into my basement!)I've used this about 5 times since it arrived last week and still have yet to get the hang of the programming, but I think it will get easier with time. It probably helps to have some past experience with an indoor cycle or have a friend that has that experience to help you. After adjusting the unit to fit my small frame, it works better for me. I like the instant brake very much. Standing while spinning is about the hardest part, it's not exactly like a real bike as the unit does not dip to the sides like a real bike, your body is forced to work harder. I guess that's a good thing. It's very quiet, you could easily listen to music or a TV while doing your workout. I've also used it without any programming at all and I think I like that the best, just doing a 30-minute ride/workout and once my heart rate slows back down, it's off to the shower. Probably not what a purist would do, but like I said, I'm new at this. I'll read up on the manual some more and try to make sense of the programs through time.  The seat is the biggest hurdle for me as I have a very flat cushioned seat on my actual bicycle, so I might try to get another seat for this unit to make it more comfortable for me. I had a hip injury and the seat that comes with the unit seems to make it flare up and ache.I'd recommend this cycle, it seems like a very solid piece of equipment which will serve well for a nice aerobic workout in the winters.

"While it may seem a bit odd that a man would want to choose a moisturizer such as this one, please let me explain. First, I have a few areas which get extremely dry and I work in ceramics which are very drying to my hands. As well, I'm a sucker for anything that has a citrus or orange blossom smell, so this product intrigued me.Scent: If you've ever been lucky enough to walk through an orange grove while they're blooming, this cream will take you right back to that moment. It's not heavy or cloying, but you'll find yourself sniffing your hand over and over once you apply some of this. While it might smell a bit on the feminine side for a guy, I don't care. I'm already addicted to the scent! I can imagine if this were re-formulated to have a bit of patchouli, bergamot and lavender added, it could be made to smell more masculine, still have the same orange blossom effect and be marketed toward men.Texture: This is almost like a butter. It seems thick at first, but as you apply it, it melts onto your skin and blends right in. Afterwards, it's not oily at all, just a nice even moist feeling.Effects: I tested this on my knees, probably the most dry, scaly area on my body. Of course, any moisturizer is going to feel good for the first hour, but the next morning my knees are virtually as supple and moisturized as if I just applied this product. That has never happened with any product! I also put some around my eyes and my forehead and it has definitely reduced the appearance of the lines in those areas. I also felt pleasantly ""refreshed"" afterwards, for a few hours. Not sure if that is the scent or the cream itself, but it felt really nice.All in all, this seems to be a product that is very specialized and would attract a very high-end customer.  At the current price (5/30/15) of 46 dollars for 1.5 ounces, it probably does! For me, the only detraction is how expensive this is. For nearly half the price, one can purchase many moisturizers and get 4 times the amount in the container.  So for that reason, I deduct one star.

"2 years ago, I built a 2-story house with dormers. One of them has a half-circle window transom over the regular window. On the back are two shed dormers which also have windows. Needless to say, even though these are great windows which I can tilt in to clean, there are two which are in the two dormers over a loft area. So, unless I learn to fly (hey, it could happen, right?) the only way to clean these windows (inside or out) is with a pole like this or a very tall ladder or both. I chose both.So far, this thing has performed really well. Combined with the squeegee tool, I can make my windows very clean very easily. I normally wait for a very wet rainy morning or a foggy one and then just go outside, squeegee off the two windows and that's it. I don't even scrub them. The house is in a very rural, isolated area, so there's not a lot of pollution, but I do get a lot of bug dookie on them, so when they're very wet, that's the time to clean them. As long as you keep it up on a bi-weekly basis, you should have fairly clean windows most of the year.  As well, it's handy to get spider webs from the lofted ceiling and I'm planning on using it to re-paint the ceiling as well. It's a great tool, very badly needed at my house.

"I'll admit it, I have a weakness, almost a fetish for planners and calendars. I usually purchase a Sierra Club calendar for a custom leather binder I had made, but since this planner fits in almost the same way, I decided I'd try it.  I like many things about it.The cover and binding are very nice, very retro style, like an old textbook or novel with a cloth cover. The months are tabbed, very easy to find, lots of space to write in on each day and there's a full 2-page mini-month calendar at the beginning of each month to reference if need be. In the back there's 10 pages of ""notes,"" two of which I think could have better served as a larger version of the holidays' dates which are listed on one page only in miniscule type so small I needed a magnifying glass to read it.

"Having both a Rachel Ray and a Circulon set of cookware, I use a lot of plastic, rubber and other types of non-marring utensils. This is the first time I've been able to experience anything made with silicone and so far, it's a pleasure using the spatula and the pasta fork/grabber.  Just using even a hard plastic spoon on those surfaces makes me a bit nervous because I take a lot of time and trouble making sure the surfaces are never scratched, never washed in a dishwasher, never abused in any way. These tools are perfect.The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the TOTAL lack of any kind of smell. Seriously, there was absolutely NO odor of any kind. That's a first for me, and I have a very sensitive nose. No plastic-y smell, no factory smell, no odd smells... nothing. Wow.Then handling these felt very comfortable, there is an inner portion that is hard over which the softer red silicone is molded. This gives the tools a firmness but also their non-damaging ways. The handles are nice, pierced so that they can hang and fit the hand well.  I did not have a pasta fork and so it's a welcome addition and makes getting a few noodles for ""testing"" very easy considering I had to use a standard fork in the past, risking a scratch on my cookware.For me, the color is a little dull, (not nearly as bright as what they show in the photos) and leans toward a burgandy or dark candy apple red, rather than a nice HOT red or vermillion which I would have preferred.All in all, this will easily be the ""go to"" set in my kitchen for all uses. Great set, good quality and a pretty reasonable price at this writing. Highly Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T8AVMKVWI4QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKQT09K#wasThisHelpful","R2T8AVMKVWI4QV","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't use a cellphone for photos, but I do use my tripod quite extensively for lighting, photographs and more. This adapter/clamp is great for holding lights, gobos, reflectors, etc. for photography needs and I love how it's so small that it doesn't get in the way of anything. The little screw clamp is perfect and the clean design keeps it out of the way. It's tiny but powerful and my only worry is that it's so small that I might lose it in my... um...complex studio environment (read: cluttered). Fit perfectly with my adapter to the tripod I own and I imagine with that screw hole size, it's nearly universal. Great product that comes in at a slightly high price, but when you need something like this (and I did) you need it!

"I cannot commend the makers of this film high enough for bringing to light one of the most odious crimes of the century.When a man makes a trust and a will, he does so thinking that he can go to his grave and have his wishes carried out. These instruments of law, which are normally held inviolate and in perpetuity, are seemingly not worth the paper their written on any longer, thanks to one judge in Pennsylvania. To compound the horror of this act, the knowledge that it was tied to a 100-billion-dollar art collection that was amassed by one man - possibly the best collection of art that the world has ever seen - leaves those of us with much smaller means with a view of life that seems futile at best, given the forces of government, big money and power-hungry social mavens which might work against our own small plans.Dr. Barnes' is hopefully haunting these people's conscious on a nightly basis.

"Reading short stories are one of my favorite pastimes. While I was enjoying reading each of this author's stories, I figured out something. Justin Taylor knows the craft of writing very well. Unfortunately, he does not understand what to write about or that good writing only gets you so far. In order to break into that next level, IMO, there needs to be a great story with a point, a message or something I can take away. A lot of these tales seemed like they were taken from life experiences but lacked any sort of lesson or poignancy. Snapshots of dreary lives, even in the case of an elderly woman (which in my opinion had the best chance to really tug some strings) just seemed like bland diary entries.One or two of these stories almost gets there and just when I thought the author is going to take it up a notch and make some kind of amazing breakthrough or statement...? The story ends. And I felt like there was no point to all that craft in the first place. It's like being told your going to get a cream-filled pastry only to find out that there's not really anything in the center.Cream, Mr. Taylor. I want cream in the middle of my pastry or at least a roach so there's some drama and something I can tell my friends about.Three stars for the good writing, 2 stars taken away for lack of a take-away.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IB1KE2B98EAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062310151#wasThisHelpful","R3IB1KE2B98EAL","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though I don't own an RV, I'll have a hundred other uses for this great product. They can prop up my riding mower to clean the underside, level out a ladder while painting stairwells, prop up a car while changing a tire or working on the underside, especially on uneven ground.The design is great, these can make a ramp without shifting and the style of the carrying ability is pretty smart. They are heavy duty! You cannot bend these at all, even with a lot of weight on them. The lattice design means strength without weight.

"I can see these drapes working well in a rental suite or perhaps a vacation cottage where a finer set might get damaged. These are 100 percent poly, so they'll take washing fairly well (if they don't, I'll report back later.)  The design is nice, a somewhat ""Morrocan"" look (which is on-trend currently) that would work well in a lot of settings.  The white ""see through"" is a nice touch, and I can see these as stand-alone or working as sheers for a heavier set over top.  The only part I'm not pleased with on this set is the side edges which are not hemmed, but instead are using ""selvage"" from the original bolt as the edging. I may end up putting a rolled hem on the edge myself to help make them seem a bit higher quality.  A nice set of drapes for the guest bedroom, cottage or rental.

"...and not as nice as the picture. The bracelet comes on and off easily, but for the money, the weight seems to be a bit light. As well, there is substantial pitting in the metal in places, meaning that either the mold was not very well made or the silver under the rhodium was not cast very well. It's an OK piece of jewelry, but not what I'd call ""fine"" jewelry by any standard.

"Short story volumes are usually a pleasure for me to read. Vasquez' collection was a bit more difficult. There are 6 long stories here (a 7th one is much shorter) and they wind over the course of 240 pages. I would not call these ""short stories"", they are closer to novelettes, but not quite there.""The Return"" is the shortest and ironically, easily the best of this collection. I could see this one being fleshed-out further into a novel. I was intrigued by it far more than the others. I'd rate each tale as follows:Hiding Places - 3 starsThe All Saints' Day Lovers - 4 starsThe Lodger - 2 starsThe Return - 5 starsAt the Cafe de la Republique- 2 starsThe Solitude of the Magician - 3 starsLife on Grimsey Island - 3 starsThe tone of this small collection is somewhat dark and brooding. I was not in a bright, cheery mood after reading these. I'm not saying that all things in literature should be bright and cheery, but a ray of sunshine would be nice once in a while during the dark clouds. It's as if the author is saying ""Hey, have affairs, get mixed up in some sordid business if you want, but it's not going to be much fun and be prepared to pay the consequences.""  There is death, suicide, depression, regret and more.Overall, it's great writing, but the content of the tales is my overall problem. Just not very happy stuff here, folks.

"Accented by a shiny, bright red handle, this ingenious umbrella collapses down to about 10 inches tall and closes easily. I was able to get the cover over it fairly quickly as well. Very sturdy build, not a flimsy, typical umbrella. I love the handle and the weight of it, very nicely stores in a car or closet. I think this will probably live in my car as I'm always getting caught in the rain. Just whip the cover off, press the button and ""BOING"", it opens up.  Plenty of room for two underneath of it and it's reflective to car lights as well for added safety. I truly can't find anything negative to say about this umbrella.

"Put this seed out a week and a half ago on rocky / clay soil in a very shady area on a gentle slope. Raked the ground first, put in seed, raked gently afterwards and put in more on top of that.

"It must be nice to be a publisher while also being a writer. Just think, you can publish ANYTHING you write. And therein lies the problem with ""Muse"", a protracted, long-winded, slow-moving story of an editor trying to solve an extremely boring mystery that involves a long-dead poet's coded notebooks. And be patient kids, it's laborious getting to the meat of this turkey unless you like eating feathers.It literally takes 80-some pages to wade, slog and drudge your way through backstory after backstory, premise after premise, stage-setting after stage-setting to get to ANY sense of a plot, story or action. You'd think a publisher would know better! While this masturbatory mess of mean-spirited missives-in-disguise might be fun to write and think about for Mr. Galassi, it's torturous for any reader other than himself.When you do finally get to the kernel of what passes for a story, it's weak at best. The writing? Passable. The editing? Abysmal.If it were up to me (and sadly, for the general public, it's not) I'd chop the first 78 pages off the book and start it there, on page 79. Then, I'd figure out a way to weave in the over-indulgence of backgrounds and the endless list of characters into the story, bit by bit, so the reader is not overwhelmed up front by all of these unnecessary people, histories and settings which have almost NOTHING to do with the actual story per se.If you are impatient by nature, skip this one. If you like a story to move at a pace slightly faster than glacial, skip this one. If you like a plot to have a bare minimum of interest or start, say, in the first 30 pages or so, skip this one.

It doesn't make sense. I'll continue to use it, perhaps mixed with a much better-tasting paste. However, I'm still somewhat perplexed as to why Colgate, a ""multinational consumer products company focused on the production, distribution and provision of household, health care and personal products"" (from Wikipedia) which has sold toothpaste since 1873 and was the first to sell it in a collapsible tube (!) would not take the time to perfect the taste, since one cannot possibly use the product without putting it in ones own mouth.

On my table, (which is blond) the wood shows through a bit, so I'd imagine that on darker woods it might show even more.Other than that, for the price, it's a very nice table cloth that goes well with my dining room interiors of cream, white, silver, almond and bisque. They have a gray version as well which is a more modern twist to this cloth that I'm sure many would appreciate (myself included!).

"Having seen a few of these stories profiled on ""American Greed"" and other shows, I was anxious to read the true tales of crime in detail.  Amore delivers everything I wanted. The book follows the story of several art forgeries and frauds, including not only the background of the forgers themselves, but also the investigators to some extent. This is a fascinating and compelling book, hard to put down and moves very quickly. It explains the terminology very clearly and even a novice would enjoy reading about this particular subject.  Amore covers the crimes from the 50s and onward, up to the internet age and it's own brand of particularly cunning and devious shysters that prey on innocent (and sometimes greedy) art lovers.His denouncement of some of the institutions own greed (which create an almost ""blind"" eye toward the obvious) is spot-on. These galleries and dealers have a gut feeling that what they're handling is not real, but the siren song of big bucks is simply too hard to ignore and they move ahead into becoming not-so-unwitting accomplices.As an artist, I found it particularly curious that most of these forgers were brilliantly talented artists themselves, yet willing to lend their skills regardless. It's a sad commentary on just how much greed has taken over the minds of even the creative sort, those that used to be satisfied with one meal and a palette of paint. No more. A quick buck mentality rules.I highly recommend this book to all art lovers, real crime enthusiasts and anyone who loves to see justice prevail.

"The Linksys N600 worked right out of the box. While I couldn't connect directly, I was able to connect through their site for my Windows laptop. I wasn't too keen on giving them my network password, but I guess they're not in my neighborhood (to freeload on the WiFi), so it doesn't really matter that much. Was able to walk around my entire house and get WiFi, but once I got past the garage outdoors, it didn't seem to have as strong a signal. It's winter here and although logic tells me otherwise, it may have something to do with the signal being weak outdoors. For most small houses and apartment dwellers, this would be sufficient. The speaker connection port seems a little odd to me, considering that most newer speaker systems are wireless. If the system would provide a signal to the speakers without wires, it might make more sense, but I can't see someone plugging this into the wall and then plugging speakers into it since most wall outlets are not located in great places for a speaker system.A nice little device, not much trouble to install or get going, so three stars for the good, two taken away for having to give up my network information and the spotty signal within 100 feet of the device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4TL90KXH1B38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSSCAZE#wasThisHelpful","R4TL90KXH1B38","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Huan Hsu has a problem.  He's an American-Chinese man who has become interested in his family's history, specifically the fabled porcelain that his great-great grandfather may (or may not have ) buried in his mainland China backyard before the revolution. But hardly anyone knows much about it and those who do seem to want to keep him from knowing more.Thus starts his long, winding tale of travel, employment, language barriers, history-delving and relative-meeting in both mainland China and Taiwan. Hsu's saga not only encompasses his family's past, but also it's present and the diaspora of various members - present and missing. And it also covers China's past in great detail: the history of porcelain, architecture, government and more. While the tale does get off the path now and again, it does so with rewards. We're treated to a compressed history of China and the spasmodic idiocy of the revolution and all of it's crazy outcomes in various eras. To say his family was affected deeply is putting it lightly. But then, who's family in China was not? We're also given a fairly good history of China's ceramic industry throughout time and up to the present. China knows they are the cradle of all things ceramic and they are just now getting that cache back, although in pieces and at high prices.Hsu goes through a plethora of locations, relatives, language situations and shards. Many, many shards. However, the problem I had with this saga is how long it took to get to the shards and the winding, twisting road was not something I found particularly enjoyable and the writer veers off-course into other territories quite often. Many of the first chapters should be chopped down, in my opinion and have far too many examples of minutiae for my taste. Things start to get interesting around page 130, when Hsu starts to actually experience interesting things and places.The writing style is good, if not a bit long-winded. I think the book could easily be pared down to about 250 pages instead of the 360 it now sits at. There is far too much unnecessary information about things not necessarily related to his family or porcelain per se.  While I didn't mind reading about the other subjects, they're not what interested me specifically and the book never actually lives up to it's title other than a few shards of what could have been his families original wares making their way into the author's possession before he leaves. As to how that happened, I won't ruin the story. But be forewarned, it will take nearly as long for the reader to make the discovery as it did for Hsu to actually live it.A good read, but slow going. I recommend the book to those interested in Chinese porcelian, history and culture.

"It's great to find a product on the market that offers non-meat protein and all the vitamins that this product has, especially without dairy.The Chai Vanilla is an interesting flavor, with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. (If you don't like eggnog or cinnamon flavers, you may not like this.) I did not find the taste displeasing at all, and that's a first for me on any protein drink. I tried dissolving a spoonful without using a blender, it's probably best to use the blender if you don't want lumps hanging around the bottom. My next try was more successful and it blended smoothly.  The green color may be offputting for some, but I've had many seaweed mixes and am used to that, as well as yerbe mate, which turns green as it cools.A note to anyone out there who has a sensitive intestinal tract: You may need to start with just a teaspoon of this mix and work your way up to the full amount they suggest as this is pretty ""hot"" stuff and it took me 2 days to get used to the effects. I would not drink this by itself, but instead perhaps have it with your lunch and make sure and take a probiotic with the drink to help ease any problems. I have yet to do a full recipe because just two tablespoons gave me a bit of problems but not that severe.The French Vanilla is pretty good, not as rich-tasting as the Chai, but a fairly good imitation of what true French Vanilla tastes like. I found that it dissolved a bit easier than the Chai for some reason or perhaps I could not see it as easily in the mixture. Either way, I'd recommend that a blender or shake-maker be used instead of simple stirring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSSTW839H9PGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y13K0#wasThisHelpful","RSSTW839H9PGB","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether it's from switching shampoos or the ingredients in this shampoo, my hair has been behaving very well, feels better and doesn't seem to get dirty as fast. This is a thick shampoo which lathers up very nicely, it doesn't take much. The scent is citrus-y, but more in the light orange range than lemon in my opinion, like the artificial orange flavor that hard orange candies had when I was a kid.  It's not bad, I don't mind it much, but don't expect an actual lemon basil scent. Other than patchouli, I have yet to experience a shampoo scent that matches up to what the bottle says, so this isn't a surprise.  Otherwise, a very good shampoo for decent price.

"At first, the unit seems small, like it's not going to really do much. And being used to seeing massage chairs which are covered in moving parts, I was pretty skeptical.  I plugged it in anyway and fired it up.Full disclosure: I suffer from a right shoulder injury that happened in a car accident when I was 18. I have severe nerve damage in that shoulder and pain/tightness 24/7/365. For 3.5 decades. I've been to dozens of chiro / message experts, nothing has really helped that much. Either too light a touch or too hard which just aggravated the injury. So naturally, that was the first place I wanted to test the unit out. And let me tell you... heat, vibration, movement... my shoulder immediately started making little popping sounds, all of the tendons loosened up and after about 10 minutes, I can honestly say I have no more tightness or pain in that area. I shifted my body around to get all the areas in the shoulder taken care of.The darn thing is a wonder!OK, well, so far so good, let's move to other areas and see what it does. I basically put it on a high-back upholstered chair and let it fall about an inch at a time, every 10 minutes, starting right below my skull and all the way down to my tailbone until it couldn't go any further.WOW!  I am totally relaxed now, my back feels great. My shoulder still does not have pain, a full 30 minutes later. After reading another review about it being good for feet, I figured ""why not?"".  Oh man, it's fantastic, my feet are still tingling and feel amazing. I'm going to take a hot shower and use this thing again tonight. I just hope I don't wear it out! The only negative I can see here is that it does not come with any kind of travel/carrying case. But that's a very slight negative considering what it's done for my shoulder.Excellent product!

"A relatively good wiper that is marred by it's lack of simple, complete instructions for installation.  Not wanting my car to look unbalanced, I bought the other side's wiper and began using them right away. Installing them was not easy nor were the instructions large enough or easy enough to understand. They are innovative in that there is a carapace which covers the blade mechanism (presumably to keep ice and snow out) and they are segmented while a single strip of hard plastic runs beneath which can slide during operation. The blade itself rides on this strip. Definitely a new kind of blade, but time will tell how well the rubber wears under a typical mid-western winter's snow, ice and salt onslaught.

"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR ONE, FLOOR-STANDING SPEAKER IN MONO MODE.The Pioneer Elite SP-EFS73 Dolby Atmos-enabled Andrew Jones Floorstanding Speaker not only presents itself in a beautiful way, it performs beautifully. IMO, this is not something that is for the average consumer, but meant more for a more sophisticated audience who appreciates fine audio equipment for either a home theater system or simply listening to music.The physical appearance and size is really very nice, takes up very little real estate on the floor. The faux wood fooled me for a while, but after getting a good look at it, I realized it was a laminate on HDF.  It's a heavy speaker that comes with optional screw-in spikes for carpeted situations.I wanted to test this out in two modes, one in the area of my house that has a cathedral ceiling and one in a typical ""box"" room because of the Atmos effect of having the additional speaker (on the top of the tower) aimed at the ceiling. To do so, I actually went and purchased a 4ohm receiver to wire into the top ports of the speaker to get the full effect. In the cathedral situation, it was not nearly as strong, since it's obvious (from what I've read) they're relying on the flat ceiling to bounce the sound down back at the listener. It did much better in the box shaped room and I was fully surrounded by sound while watching a DVD or listening to standard CD and MP3 music. I can only imagine what two of these would sound like in stereo and am half-tempted to bust out the drachmas to get another one.The separation of sound from the various sets of speakers is phenomenal. There is very little bleed over from treble to bass. Very crisp high end for both classical and rock music and truly incredible bass for such small speakers at the bottom of the ""tower"".  I punched the signal up to 14, which is about as much as I could stand and there was zero distortion. (My system goes to 25, but I don't want to set off an earthquake). To have only one of these deliver all of the sound it was giving me... well, it's pretty great stuff. Once a subwoofer is added, I'm sure it would be mind-blowing.The only negative I can think of is that they come in one color, black. With the various modes of decor happening in modern houses, this is a huge disappointment and there's really not a good reason to limit the colors like this. For that I'm removing a star.Otherwise, this is a very solid piece of equipment that performs very well.

"Having just the bare-minimum of knowledge about the world of fashion and it's fickle ways, I had only heard the names of McQueen and Galliano via TV shows like ""America's Next Top Model"", ""Project Runway"" and other shows which often run through the slew of big names like tossing unwanted shoes to the side at a store-wide sale. But among the greats in fashion, these men apparently own two names that will stick in fashion history. Both came from London's 70s underground fashion world, went through the fashion schooling at St. Martins and then embarked on whirlwind careers that left audiences stunned and enthralled via mega-fashion houses of the likes of Dior and Givenchy.The author, Dana Thomas, comes to us from The New York Times' Style magazine, so she's no hack when it comes to writing about the colorful world of fashion and has a fairly extensive history of writing about it. Her knowledge shows strongly throughout this work, in the descriptions of the artists as well as their creations. The writing style is solid and other than a few odd repeats, the story moves along nicely and is carefully documented in various quotes and snippets from other sources. Ms. Thomas put together about as complete a picture of the two men as possible, including private life details that many other news outlets will either miss or leave out due to shortage of space. It's as complete a biography for both as you'll likely find.Admittedly, their stories are fascinating and I think this book will appeal to many, even those not addicted to fashion. Their stories are excellent examples of success, excess and the ultimate crush/crash that fame and entitlement can have on an artist. It's a very absorbing book and while a bit long (nearly 400 pages), it reads fairly smoothly and quickly.

"After watching this movie for the 2nd time, I'm struck by how much potential it had and how it just fell flat in so many places.  You've got two great stars, a great writer, a great script in part by Francis Ford Coppola... lots of great supporting cast and sets, good sets...  wow, so much here to work with.  What happened?Well, firstly lets look at the flavor of the film. It's set in the 1930s depression era. Yet it feels very late 50s from the beginning. The haircuts, the clothing, the music, the language... it's just not 30s flavor at all. Redford's hair looks orange instead of blond. Natalie is a bit overweight and looks older than the part calls for and her hair is totally wrong for 30s. The music is schmaltzy and not at all in keeping for the period. The camera angles and shots at times look very 60s television (which is not surprising since most of what Pollack had done was TV thus far). The director even threw in a hand-held shot at one point, the only one in the film. Can you say inconsistent? Nothing was blending together to put you into that era or that story.Now, how about the acting? Many people say she was aptly named. There are hints of greatness in the job Ms. Wood does here, but for the most part, it's not happening when it really needs to and over-acted when it doesn't need to. Subtlety is not her strong suit. Redford always plays everything so straight (with absolutely ZERO accent) that it can ruin an otherwise good script. Still, he's almost good in this, because he's still a bit raw - later films are not helped by his presence, IMHO. The supporting cast easily outshines the stars and that's the joy I dredged from this one. Kate Reid is great as a frowsy, overly-selfish Momma and Charles Bronson and Robert Blake both put in good performances. Willy is played pretty nicely by Mary Badham, who resurrects her pitch-perfect ""Scout"" act from To Kill a Mockingbird, however older and wiser.The script is good, but takes a horrible left turn when Alva gets to New Orleans. How is she surviving? Is she working the streets or a waitress or shop girl or what? The bit of money she stole from the husband she left in Mississippi couldn't have been much, he was just laid off. We're supposed to believe that she wanders around for weeks, partially living off of the food she keeps throwing at the pigeons, I guess.  And then, magically, in a city of over 458 thousand people (at the time) they magically find each other. OK, I'll suspend disbelief for a bit. But then Momma, who shows up later to drag Alva away because... well, that's the problem. If Momma has found a new man and is doing OK, why does she need Alva? Why waste time coming to New Orleans? It's a bit much and not very believable.I was hoping to find the same resonance that Splendor in the Grass had or perhaps some trashy, southern drama/fun as in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, but found neither in this film. Three lazy, melting stars for this syrupy would-be drama that drips slowly into the river.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2LYJGAMGQUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045HAF04#wasThisHelpful","RO2LYJGAMGQUH","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I set off two of these in my log cabin to help rid it of wood roaches, which are a common problem there since it's in the middle of the woods. It's winter and they like to come in from the cold. Well, any of them that come in now will get a surprise. I went back in two days later and there were lots of dead roaches on the floor. I'm going to set off the rest of them in my steel barn to help rid it of bugs as well.Many people here have posted that there are more insects than before, but what they are probably seeing is an increase in activity on the part of the insects that were already there. They tend to move around more when their environment has been disturbed and this insecticide is just such a disturbance. It does not attract more insects, it simply makes the ones that are there move around more. It's also a ""contact"" type of surfactant, so they actually have to crawl over a surface that has the poison on it in order to die, so it's actually a good thing that they're moving around. Personally, I would not use this in an area that will be lived in within a week or two. While it most likely is considered ""safe"" by the FDA, I am not into taking chances with chemical insecticides. My cabin will not have any people in it until spring, so I'm not worried about any residual effects at that point. Hopefully, it will keep working until then and kill any bugs that get in.The odor is a lot more pleasant than other ""bombs"" that I've used, so that's a plus since it's going to be hanging around on surfaces for a bit. Four stars for this product, one taken away due to it not being a general air-killing type of insecticide that creeps into all areas but relies on the surfaces being crawled over instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MDB9RO2717NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA8WSQ6#wasThisHelpful","R2MDB9RO2717NX","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tacwise cable tacker is an extremely well-designed tool. Nice coated stainless steel body, heavy-duty construction, fits the hand nicely.  It comes with not only the option of two sizes of staple, but it also has two different strengths to put them in so if you are going into harder wood you can ramp up the shot.  There is a groove in the front and back of the stapler to line up the cable nicely in the tool so that you don't shoot through your cable or wiring.  I can see this being a tool I use not only in wiring the rest of my basement, but also putting up fence as the staples are perfect for heavy wire fencing needing to be fastened to a post.Very easy to load, take apart, etc., had no troubles there at all.

"After receiving it, I tried this unit for three nights in a row. It does smell good but did not make sleep any different for me. The fragrance is very much like the non-natural lavender oil that you can buy which is derived from chemicals rather than actual plant essences. It's close, but not really a lavender smell and I can say this with authority because I grow several kinds of lavender in my garden and have purchased real lavender oil in the past. As far as chamomile, I don't smell any presence of it at all.To be honest, I'm a little leery of plugging something in and leaving it that way when I'm gone, so I tend to use this only when I'm sure I'm going to be present.The pads are easy to install, I'd use one to start and see if that is enough scent after 5 hours instead of installing both.

"In Kelly Link's collection of short stories, the characters are all a bit damaged or failed in some way. Link is a strong writer and these stories prove it, if not in a skewed and formulaic way. It's not hard to pick out the formula: write a somewhat interesting story then add something other-worldly to spice it up a bit. The format is very reminiscent of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. Most of the stories hit the target and are oddly entertaining, others simply aren't worthy of the rest of the collection. My favorite was ""Summer People"" where an unseen family inhabits a cottage in magical ways and give gifts that can either delight or haunt, depending on your past behavior.It's a nice collection overall, but not everyone is going to like Link's style. I did, but not in every case.

"In general, I purchase soaps for what they smell like. I'm not fussy about any moisturizing qualities or deodorant longevity. Simply put, if I like the way it smells, I buy it.After washing my face with this bar (and yes, it got clean) the odor is so strong that I found myself using alcohol to get it off my face and re-washed with a better bar after that.It does NOT smell like mandarin oranges or tiare flowers. I've smelled both and this is not even close.This particular scent smells like cheap bulk-price room deodorizer oil that you buy with the sticks. In fact, it smells exactly like one that a friend has which makes my sinuses close up and I start sneezing. It's incredibly strongly scented to the point where I'm going to simply use it in my linen closet to keep them smelling fresh.Not recommended unless you like to smell like room deodorizer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMAI18SP4TKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70QYW0#wasThisHelpful","R1EMAI18SP4TKJ","A3SZXYX9YEDGT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SZXYX9YEDGT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've always liked bats, and even did some research on them many years back for a press release for the North Dakota Extension Service, so was delighted to find this book in the queue. Dr. Merlin Tuttle, the author and long-time bat conservationists, writes in an appealing and very readable style, and casually knocks aside exaggerated horror stories with facts and anecdotes. He fought against ignorance in the 70s and 80s, and states that the world is seeing a resurgence of the horror stories fed by ignorance, to which he states, ""[Hundreds] of bat researchers world-wide remain healthy despite lifetimes of close association with bats. In fact, even among the millions of people who eat bats or harvest guano from caves, reports of possible harm are exceedingly rare.""Bats provide a service, and a strong economic reason to protect them. A single bat can eat 1000 insects in an hour, so imagine what a colony of hundreds could do! They eat pest insects, some even searching out pests before they have a chance to lay eggs, thereby saving agriculturalists large amounts on pesticides. Nector and fruit-eating bats provide pollination that is much better than birds or bees. Bats are also shown to be highly intelligent and sophisticated, even altruistic, like the vampire bat, which will share food with other bats and adopt orphaned pups. They have proven long-term memory, with bats who have been tamed returning occasionally to the person with whom they have bonded, and remembering how to do various things that had been taught years before.Obviously I could go on for some time, but will end it here. I strongly recommend this book to anyone to learn more about this fascinating and often beautlful animals. My only gripe is that the ARC doesn't have the pictures that will be in the final release copy, which will be available Oct. 20, 2015. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDRRM7MTG99G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544382277#wasThisHelpful","R3FDRRM7MTG99G","A3LF914GG87TWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LF914GG87TWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So yes it is possible to have a YA story without a a love triangle, or love inteest at all. This is awesome, and lack of long spells of brooding over which hunky guy (often one good and one evil) the pase of the story moves along at a strong clip. In fact, about guys:Michael Hannigan was important to the football team. If he could pass with a C average, he'd become important to some university's sports program somewhere, and maybe, ev.entually he'd make it to the NFL and earn a few million dollars a year for throwing a ball around and sustaining head injuries.That's what happened to tall dumb guys.As far as coming up with the name:""We could call her... Princess X.""""Why X?"" Libby asked.""Because X is the most mysterious letter,"" May told her. And things with X's (sic) in them are usually pretty cool.Thus begins the odyssey of Princess X -- created by two lonely girls based on chalk art on the sidewalk, with suggestions from a crowd of youngsters who pause to watch the ideas emerge. The plot is well summarized on the book page, so I won't go into it again.I was disappointed that the webcomics had not been added to the ARC to allow a proper evaluation, though the basics of each missing panel are described. It's just not the same. This why I dropped a stat.However, if you are looking for a YA book that is not the ordinary brood-fest over boys, you should quite like this one. You will hopefully also appeciate that the girls are strong and rise up to the challenge of adversity. This book was released in May, so definitely grab a copy if you can!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLGYF2TQ562H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545620856#wasThisHelpful","R1NLGYF2TQ562H","A3LF914GG87TWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LF914GG87TWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Original 4 star review below.  Reducing to 2 stars, because after just a few weeks,  the flip-out stand broke completely off. It wasn't even knocked around, it was just tipped over by one of my cats. Travel clocks need to be able to stand up to a bit of punishment, so I'm reducing the rating and recommend it only for those who will treat it very gingerly.this is a nice little clock. It can be run on 2 AAA batteries, or by plugging into a USB outlet. If you use the batteries only, then the back light and projection only work when you want it to. Plugged into USB, the projection and back light are always on. The only problem I had was with setting it. It took several tries before the mode button actually kicked in, and I can't figure out how to change the day of the week or the year; when I set this up yesterday, with date of 9/1, it gave the day as Monday rather than Tuesday. As nearly as I can tell this cannot be fixed, so a minor issue there.

"Overall I did quite enjoy this story. The various levels and layers, past and future, the Victorian novel (is it true or fiction?), the mysterious contents of the envelope. Sweeping ideas, but the whole thing didn't quite pull together for me. The ending was confusing, because I don't know if this ARC actually showed the materials in the envelope included with the final copy of the book, so it's possible that I'm simply missing that last bit. I did very much like Zeke's little comments he was always writing in the dust or on smudged glass or whereever he could, such as, ""The truth of nothingness, that is despair."" There ae a lot of these sprinkled through the text.One interesting thing that is covered as a sort of ""moral"" in the story is the notion of history repeating if people don't learn. It's eloquently said here:""We must know where we have been. If we cannot see our own patterns, then we are nothing but a mindless flock of birds flapping blindly in the night, scraping and pecking in the dust.""If you enjoyed J.J.

"I doenjoy these sorts of stories, so don't misunderstand me. If you can lose yourself in the story and ignore details that don't fit, you'll likely enjoy this book. Here was my main problem.When Hank calls in the elders only to have one of the guests die, the Elders hold him as a suspect. They also disbelieve him about the evidence in the briefcase when it disappears. However, it is later stated that the Elders are able to see right through a person and all but know what he or she is thinking. It is also revealed that they are always able to tell whether someone is lying or telling the truth. So why the suspicion and mistrust? Other, of course, than that would be the end of the book.

"I hope to write a more thorough review at a later time, as writing them from my PaperWhite is slow. But I wanted to gush at how much I loved this new book in a new series. An urban fantasy thriller, this book will not disappoint those who enjoy either genre.The characters are great and develop realistically. The two mains - Eleri Eames and Donovan Heath - are excellent. They both have their problems, faults and strengths and develop within the course of the book. Those who know me know how I feel about romance gumming up the works, so won't be surprised to hear I'm particularly happy to report this book as romance free!I noted a number of technical problems with editing, including the consistent misuse of discrete and into when discreet and in to should have been used. There were also numerous run-on sentences that would have benefited from semi-colons. The author also created the word ""sensical"" when sensible would have done fine.However, as I said, these were very nitpicky things that I doubt the average reader would have noticed and they certainly didn't detract from my enjoyment. I am excited for the next book in this series and will be watching for it.Those who have followed my reviews over the past few years may remember that all previous reviews of A.J. Scudiere's books were done off review copies. This one may have been offered too. I don't know since I've been out of pocket since my cancer diagnosis. The point is that I purchased this book myself.

"The ideal reader of this monster mashup anthology would be someone who really loves bad B movies. The worse the better. If you go in with low expectations you'll be good. Most of the stories have bad editing. Wrong word entirely or wrong homonym. Screwed up punctuation. That sort of thing. A few of the stories are just bad. The majority run between mediocre and okay. Two blew my socks off (in a good way). ""Frightening Cliches"" by Bennie Newsome is cleverly written bad, the sort of bad that can only come from a brilliant writer. I plan to find the rest of his work, as well as that of DK Mok, whose ""Keeping it Together"" offers a fresh (and often laugh-out-loud funny) take on zombies, as well as a clever expectation-twisting surprise at the end. Just brilliant!

"While most of the stories were entertaining, the editing left much to be desired. There are errors of punctuation and verb tense, run-on or clipped sentences and everywhere the wrong homonym being used. Compliment and complement are both ussd and both used incorrectly. A small sampling of others:taught - tautlead - ledAlso there were instances when a simple spellcheck would have caught things like wale and dumfounded.

"I absolutely loved the first three books in this series and have been anxiously awaiting each as they are translated into English and released here. This one, however, was a disappointment. The previous books were funny, witty, and provided a good mystery to solve. In this one, the idea fell flat. It's a good idea - Pascha deals with several children - but it just wasn't as funny or witty as the previous books.

"Book Info: Genre: Weird WesternReading Level: AdultDiversity: GLBTQ characters, various religions, interracial relationshipsTense, Person, POV: Past tense, third person, limited POVRecommended for: Fans of Weird Westerns, Lovecraftian books, steampunkTrigger Warnings: murder, mutilation, torture, mention of necrophilia, cannibalismAnimals: at least one horse killedMy Thoughts: These are listed as steampunk, but thus far there is limited steampunkery. To me, this is mostly a Weird Western with strong Lovecraftian influences. There are also very many stretches of interesting philosophical discussion between the various characters that I quite enjoyed. For instance:God simply is, Bick said. Humanity embraced It. They gave It color and gender, shape and form. They put words in Its mouth. They always have, and they still do, perhaps they always will. I always experience God as a 'He,' but God is too vast to be held prisoner by language or biology....What things do you think the Almighty was whispering in my ear all those countless eons? Words of endearment? Of joy and peace and love? No. He dipped his tongue in the blackest blood and he whispered to me of slaughter, of death, of torture and atrocity. That is your creator, Biqa. He built this entire lovely, lovely playground so that he could tear it apart, abuse and neglect his toys and listen to the terrified screams of the monkeys as they tried to understand.Where did payback end exactly? Charlie Upton had murdered Jim's Pa. Jim killed Charlie. One day Jim might get shot or hanged for what he did to Charlie and sometone like Mutt or Jon Highfather might seek revenge in his name. How far back did the blood flow? When was it enough? Could anything ever get square?I'm enjoying the character development in these books. Mutt, for example, has really loosened up, and he's quite funny in this book. Jon is off a lot, leaving Mutt and Jim to take care of business in the town. Doc Tumblety is such a creeper, and of course incompetent to boot. As Jon Highfather states: And that's our first-rate medical care here in sunny Golgotha. He may seem pretty horrible at first, but after awhile you come to realize that deep down inside, he's much worse than that. He's very misogynistic, saying at one point to Kate, Hush now... Men are talking. As for Kate, she makes a great addition to the cast and to the town; I hope we'll see her again! I enjoyed the bits and pieces of Chinese history and legends that Ch'eng Huang provides to Jim as he is instructing him on how to use the jade eye. I was more than a bit troubled by the inclusion of the Thuggee, as their worship of Kali Ma is a perversion. It is true Kali Ma is the Mother-Destroyer, the one who must destroy the world so it can be remade anew, but that doesn't mean that people should be going around randomly murdering in her name.Also, it is mentioned off-hand that Baba Yaga came to Golgotha, albeit briefly. She is not mentioned by name, but a house on chicken legs is a dead giveaway. I do hope that this story will be told in full; maybe the author has a number of these little anecdotes that he could use to put together an anthology of short stories set in Golgotha?Toward the end, Clay and a Professor Zenith have a science showdown that is wonderfully fun as they shout at one another, using very civilized language and high-toned insults. It struck my funny bone and hopefully I won't be the only one amused by it. At the end, Clay says, I swear... anyone with a little copper tubing and a dynamo thinks they're a scientist these days.This is an excellent follow-up and I'm grateful to the author for sending me this ARC so I didn't have to wait until October to read it! I haven't commented on editing because this is an uncorrected proof, so any errors I spotted will likely be cleaned up by the final draft.

A haven for the blessed and the d***ed, including a fallen angel, a mad scientist, a pirate queen, and a deputy who is kin to coyotes, Golgotha has come through many nightmarish trials, but now an army of thirty-two outlaws, lunatics, serial killers, and cannibals are converging on the town, drawn by a grisly relic that dates back to the Donner Party and the dawn of humanity.Sheriff Jon Highfather and his deputies already have their hands full dealing with train robbers, a mysterious series of brutal murders, and the usual outbreaks of weirdness.  But with thirty-two of the most vicious killers on Earth riding into Golgotha in just a few days time, the town and its people will be tested as never beforeand some of them will never be the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4SMV0K3O494I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6TWJAU#wasThisHelpful","R4SMV0K3O494I","A3LF914GG87TWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LF914GG87TWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a short placeholder review until such a time as I can write a longer, more detailed one.This is the second book in The Chaos Born series, after ""Children of Fire.""  While re-reading that one before this book, I noticed that the author has a real hate-on for  horses.  A lot of horses are killed in the first book, but you can't keep track because in two different occasions it was ""all the horses"" in an area.  So I decided to keep track in this one. There were only 5 horses killed in this one, but there were a bunch of dogs killed.There is a lot of character development in this one, although I must say I was most disappointed in how weak-minded Rianna (Vaalar's mother) turned out to be.  Scythe is a mystery still in a lot of ways - she would be her normal self at one moment and the next she'd switch to nurturing for no apparent reason. The group travels to the Frozen North in this book, where we meet Norr's clan and finally learn why he left his people.This is an Advance Uncorrected Proof, so I won't comment on editing. I will, however, mention that this book was pretty messed up physically. It was missing two pages altogether, and on two separate locations there is a page moved past where it should be (example, the first section was page 202, 207, 208, 205, 206. 209). There were also many, many places where the print was faint in patches, and one page where there were actual blank spots on the page. I checked the other Vine reviewers and as far as I can tell I was the only one to receive a proof like this. Doesn't really affect my opinion of the book, but I thought I'd point it out.If you liked the first book, you should like this one. If you like epic fantasy, especially high fantasy, then you should like this. I liked it well enough that I will probably pick up the final book when it comes out next month.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVR67KDM7OOR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549368#wasThisHelpful","RVR67KDM7OOR1","A3LF914GG87TWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LF914GG87TWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Actual rating: 3.5Book Info: Genre: Dark epic fantasyReading Level: Young Adult to AdultRecommended for:Trigger Warnings: murder, killing, assassination, violence, rape (M/M and M/F), torture, mutilation, stealing, slavery, infidelity, sexual assault, cannibalism, danger to child/kidnappingMy Thoughts: This is a general review of the overall series. To read the reviews of the books in the trilogy, go to the individual reviews on each book's page.This is a dark, gritty epic fantasy. The first book of the series feels oriented toward young adult readers, having the typical fantasy coming-of-age tropes. However, by book two the writing is more oriented to adults and the sorts of problems inherent in ruling and judging and generally being adult and taking responsibility for your own actions. While many of the themes remain dark, by the end of the third book in the trilogy there is a strong feeling of hope and redemption.The first book in the trilogy is rife with editing errors, and the third book also has a number of them. Only the second book in the series shows decent editing. I'm not sure why this is. The first book also relied strongly on tropes, but as the trilogy continues you can see the author's vision of the story opening up and also see the author's craft improving. All in all, a satisfying and interesting trilogy, and one I'd recommend to fans of dark epic fantasy.Series Information: The Night Angel TrilogyBook 1: The Way of Shadows, review linked hereBook 2: Shadow's Edge, review linked hereBook 3: Beyond the Shadows, review linked hereDisclosure: I purchased the omnibus edition of the trilogy for myself.

"Book Info: Genre: Dark epic fantasyReading Level: AdultRecommended for: fans of dark epic fantasyTrigger Warnings: murder, killing, assassination, violence, rape (mentioned but not seen), torture, mutilation, stealing, slaveryMy Thoughts: After the first book in this series, it turns more into adult fare. I neglected to mention this in the review for book 2. Also, although not as bad as the first book, this one again has a number of editing errors, including misused words and many missing words. I just can't fathom how this happened; aren't publishing houses supposed to have superior editing staff?However, all in all, this is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The ending is a bit abrupt after all the build-up, incorporating a certain element of deus ex machina, but at the same time it makes sense based on the hints that are dropped over the course of books 2 and 3. The author has said he plans to write further books in this universe, set at a point some years in the future, and I will definitely be watching for those. Many of my problems with the first book, such as overuse of tropes, is cleaned up by the end of the series; you can see how the author has grown in writing. I will, in fact, be seeking out more works by this talented author. If you enjoy dark, gritty fantasy that has elements of redemption and hope, then definitely check this trilogy out.Series Information: The Night Angel TrilogyBook 1: The Way of Shadows, review linked hereBook 2: Shadow's Edge, review linked hereBook 3: Beyond the ShadowsDisclosure: I purchased the omnibus edition of the trilogy for myself.

"I first read this book in the ORIGINAL version in 2011.Book info Genre: Paranormal YAReading Level: Young AdultDisclosure: I was given a free e-copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review. That was the original version. I then edited it, and it was released in a second edition. I do not receive any remuneration based upon sales. All opinions are my own and based upon the original version of the full novel.My Synopsis: Alex Drummond has enough to deal with, really. His father was killed by a drunk driver a few years ago; his mother got remarried and moved them in with her new husband, who is a vicious alcoholic and beats Alex frequently to within an inch of his life; Alex's step-brother, Frank, is a layabout who also beats on him, and his two step-sisters are an annoyance to him; and he's an outsider at school, small and picked on by the larger kids. Now he's developed an alarming tendency - when he touches things that were somehow touching a person when they were murdered, he falls into a vision and relives their death. And the people whose deaths he is reliving expect him to do something about it.My Thoughts: Partly a paranormal suspense book, partly a coming-of-age story, and even including a little bit of romance, ""A Life of Death"" is a completely amazing story! I won't lie to you, it is often very intense - the tension evinced by this book is amazingly well-done and I often felt my heart racing from the extremity of emotions that it raised. It is tightly plotted and suspenseful; the characters are well-developed and realistic - the whole thing just came to life in my mind while I was reading it, and the sudden silence whenever I would look up showed me just how much it filled my mind while I was reading it.The story is bracketed interestingly - the very beginning and very end are Alex as an older man, a police detective, helping his son with a project for school. The story itself is the tale he tells the boy. I thought this was a neat way to open and close the story and it left me with hopes that we might expect a series of Alex Drummond mystery novels in the future. I would certainly buy them!My Recommendation: Fans of paranormal mystery and suspense stories should enjoy this book. Definitely give it a read as soon as you can!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JU4RRULGU6W1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLUE8ZW#wasThisHelpful","R1JU4RRULGU6W1","A3LF914GG87TWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LF914GG87TWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Why they wouldn't have had an editor go through the omnibus edition to check for consistency I don't know but there it is.Things move along very quickly in this book. Kylar learns more about his abilities and Talent, as well as the extras that the ka'kari provides him. I was very happy about some of the people who are disposed of in this book, and also intrigued by some of the new characters that show up. One this this author is very good at is creating characters that will cause a reaction in the reader, be it good or bad. There is a great deal of gray in the series, where the bad guys aren't really evil so much as twisted, and the heroes are often damaged in ways that make them less than perfect. I like this sort of thing.If you like dark epic fantasy, with an antihero and lots of violence, check out this trilogy.

"Book Info: Genre: Dark epic fantasyReading Level: Young AdultRecommended for: older YA, fans of dark epic fantasy who don't mind typical tropesTrigger Warnings: murder, killing, assassination, violence, rape (mostly M/M), torture, mutilation, stealing, slavery, cannibalism, infidelityMy Thoughts: The beginning of this book is pretty typical epic fantasy fare, other than the fact that our hero is an antihero. But Azoth is an orphan, he's taken in against the odds by a powerful man who learns that Azoth is more than he appears, rising up from his poverty-stricken roots, etc. And, of course, the love interest that is forbidden. Still, once Kylar is on the scene, things heat up and I found myself tearing through the pages to find out what happened next. So don't let the typical trope throw you off from reading this book if it sounds like something in which you are interested.However, I was astounded by the sloppy editing on this book. It was released through one of Hatchett's publishing groups, and editing errors were heavily scattered through the book. There is a part where Azoth calls another character by his first name in a familiar manner, even though he has not yet met that character and really doesn't know much about him. And there are a lot of missing words from sentences. I'm amazed that a professional editor working for a major publisher would be so sloppy. If that will bother you, keep it in mind.Still I did enjoy the book, despite how dark it often is. If you like dark epic fantasy, antiheroes, and don't mind the typical tropes and editing problems, then check this one out.Series Information: The Night Angel TrilogyBook 1: The Way of ShadowsBook 2: Shadow's EdgeBook 3: Beyond the ShadowsDisclosure: I purchased the omnibus edition of the trilogy for myself.

Risks like apprenticing himself to Durzo Blint.But to be accepted, Azoth must turn his back on his old life and embrace a new identity and name.

"Book Info: Genre: Satire/speculative shortsReading Level: AdultRecommended for: Those who enjoy speculative fiction and clever storytellingMy Thoughts: I learned about cabinets of curiosities from reading the Pendergast novels by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. One of the novels is actually titled The Cabinet of Curiosities and it explains what these are. Basically, a cabinet of curiosities is a private collection of interesting and odd things, which were quite popular in the 19th century. Whatever the person putting it together is interested in would be collected. In this collection of short, speculative, essay-type stories, the various writers describe the stories behind the items in Thackery T. Lambshead's cabinet of curiosities.This book is not as funny as the book of fake diseases I just read, but it is still wonderfully well done. The various authors have written of their assigned objects so convincingly that I often found myself thinking that I should look up more information on one thing or another, but of course the chances are that they were just making things up. However, there were some fairly funny stories, such as the story Diminutions by Michael Moorcock, in which some men decide to bring the Gospel to germs, and to receive some extra funding:Bannister... persuaded the governors that, if a will to do evil motivated these microns, then the influence of the Christian religion was bound to have an influence for good. This meant, logically, that fewer boys would be in the infirmary and that, ultimately, shamed by the consequences of their actions, the germs causing, say, tuberculosis would cease to spread. [p. 169]I enjoyed the stories by Charles Yu and Garth Nix so much that I plan to look through their available works to find new books for my wishlist. So, yeah, I really enjoyed this one, too.If you are interested in this book, or if you read and enjoyed it, then you should check out the earlier anthology, The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric and Discredited Diseases (review linked here). And if you haven't read this one yet, definitely check it out; it's really fascinating and the stories are very well done.Disclosure: I bought this book for myself. All opinions are my own.Synopsis: The death of Dr. Thackery T. Lambshead in 2003 at his house in Wimpering-on-the-Brook, England, revealed an astonishing discovery: the remains of a remarkable cabinet of curiosities.A carefully selected group of popular artists and acclaimed, bestselling fantasy authors has been assembled to bring Dr. Lambsheads cabinet of curiosities to life. Including contributions from Alan Moore, Lev Grossman, Mike Mignola, China Miville, Cherie Priest, Carrie Vaughn, Greg Broadmore, Naomi Novik, Garth Nix, Michael Moorcock, Holly Black, Jeffrey Ford, Ted Chiang, and many more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6P60PNNFY6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062004751#wasThisHelpful","RS6P60PNNFY6M","A3LF914GG87TWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LF914GG87TWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book Info: Genre: Medical Guide Satire/Speculative fiction shortsReading Level: AdultRecommended for: Anyone who likes a laughMy Thoughts: If you want to know what sort of lunacy to expect from this book, here is just a tiny taste.Discussing Ballistic Organ Syndrome: In rare cases, the Ballistitis virus infects the patient's entire body. Eventually, some event causes one or more cells to rupture, after which the patient's body is disrupted in an explosive ejection of all bodily organs. This manifestation of the syndrome frequently occasions the death of the patient; at best, the loss of all bodily organs will cause considerable inconvenience and distress (as set out in Doctor Buckhead Mudthumper's Encyclopedia of Forgotten Oriental Diseases). [pg. 4]Letter to Dr. Wexler, of whom the writers are not fond: Dear Sir: Kindly send your anthrax-soaked missives elsewhere. And if you want to get serious about contagious letters, then invest in some smallpox like a normal person. [pg. 286]There are also a couple cookbooks mentioned that sound interesting: French Cuisine with Codeine and Mousses with Morphine.I will point out that I would not say this book is lavishly illustrated. Each entry generally has only a single illustration; sometimes there is a second at the end of the section. Now, The Thackery T. Lambshead Cabinet of Curiosities, which I'll be reading and reviewing next, does have a lot of pictures. But this one, not so much.Still, if you like a laugh, you'll enjoy the clever way each author creates a character for themselves, and the creative uses of real information mixed with their own creations that fill this satirical book. I enjoyed it a lot.Disclosure: I bought this book for myself. All opinions are my own.Synopsis: Imagine if Monty Python wrote the Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, and you sort of get the idea.

"Book Info: Genre: Non-fiction, historical anecdotesReading Level: Any who can read it can learn some fun facts about RomeRecommended for: Anyone interested in learning fun and interesting facts about the RomansMy Thoughts: There are a number of quotes from the book in the synopsis, but I just have to add a few of my own that I found funny, such as:Romans on Dealing with Children:Pliny states, in Natural History, Putting goat dung in their diapers soothes hyperactive children, especially girls. [pg. 5]Romans on Solving Marital Discord:Livy reports that about 170 women from leading families were convicted in 331 B.C. of poisoning their husbands. Other sources give even larger numbers. [pg. 8]Romans' Preferred Animal to keep Watch:Marcus Manlius Capitolinus saved the Capitol from the Gauls in the early 4th century B.C. when he was alerted to their approach by the cackling of Juno's sacred geese. [pg. 19]Romans Naming Themselves:Caracalla [ruled A.D. 211217] called himself Germanicus after victories over the Germans, and it was said that he was mad enough and stupid enough to say that, had he conquered Lucania [a region in southern Italy], he would have claimed the title Lucanicus [which means not only Lucanian but also sausage]. (Historia Augusta Life of Caracalla 5). [pg. 21]Romans on Successful Grape Cultivation:Vines should be freed for a few days from the trees to which they were attached, and allowed to wander and spread themselves, and lie on the ground they have gazed at for the whole year. Just as cattle released from the yoke and the dogs after a hunt enjoy rolling about, so vines also like to stretch their lumbar regions. (Pliny Natural History 17.209) [p. 60]Romans on Useful Medical Treatments:Touching the nostrils of a she-mule with one's lips is said to stop sneezing and hiccups (Pliny Natural History 28.57).Sexual intercourse is good for lower back pain, for weakness of the eyes, for derangement, and for depression (Pliny Natural History 28.58). [p. 73]Romans on Proper Disposition of Criminals:A justification for vivisection: It is not cruel, as most people maintain, that remedies for innocent people's ailments in all future ages should be sought through the sufferings of just a few criminals (Celsus On Medicine Proem 26). [p. 77]Romans on Making Friends Through Diplomacy:Cats were regarded as sacred in Egypt. In the mid-1st century B.C., the historian Diodorus Siculus was an eyewitness when an Egyptian mob lynched a member of a Roman embassy who had accidentally killed a cat (The Library 1.83). [p. 121]Romans on Treating Alcoholism:People who drink wine in which eels have been drowned lose their appetite for drinking wine (St. Isidore Etymologies 12.6.41). [p. 151]Roman Graffiti:Apollinaris medicus Titi Imp. hic cacavit bene (Apollinaris, physician to the emperor Titus, had a fine s*** here) (Corpus of Latin Inscriptions 4.10619, a graffito in the Casa della Gemma in Herculaneum). [pg 186]Romans on being Scrooge McDuck:By the end, Caligula had developed a passion for handling money; he would often walk barefoot over huge heaps of gold coin poured out in a large open space, and sometimes he even lay down and wallowed in them (Suetonius, Life of Caligula 42). [pg. 217]If that isn't enough to pique your interest in this very entertaining book, then just consider the sorts of interesting things you might learn! Because this book is filled with stuff like I've given above, and the author has provided below. I highly recommend this book, and plan to seek out his other book about the Greeks.Disclosure: This book was a gift from a friend. All opinions are my own.Synopsis: Here is a whimsical and captivating collection of odd facts, strange beliefs, outlandish opinions, and other highly amusing trivia of the ancient Romans. We tend to think of the Romans as a pragmatic people with a ruthlessly efficient army, an exemplary legal system, and a precise and elegant language. A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities shows that the Romans were equally capable of bizarre superstitions, logic-defying customs, and often hilariously derisive views of their fellow Romans and non-Romans.Classicist J. C. McKeown has organized the entries in this entertaining volume around major themesThe Army, Women, Religion and Superstition, Family Life, Medicine, Slaves, Spectaclesallowing for quick browsing or more deliberate consumption. Among the book's many gems are:Romans on urban living:The satirist Juvenal lists ""fires, falling buildings, and poets reciting in August as hazards to life in Rome.""On enhanced interrogation:""If we are obliged to take evidence from an arena-fighter or some other such person, his testimony is not to be believed unless given under torture."" (Justinian)On dreams:Dreaming of eating books ""foretells advantage to teachers, lecturers, and anyone who earns his livelihood from books, but for everyone else it means sudden death""On food:""When people unwittingly eat human flesh, served by unscrupulous restaurant owners and other such people, the similarity to pork is often noted."" (Galen)On marriage:In ancient Rome a marriage could be arranged even when the parties were absent, so long as they knew of the arrangement, ""or agreed to it subsequently.""On health care:Pliny caustically described medical bills as a ""down payment on death,"" and Martial quipped that ""Diaulus used to be a doctor, now he's a mortician. He does as a mortician what he did as a doctor.""For anyone seeking an inglorious glimpse at the underside of the greatest empire in history, A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities offers endless delights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375N41RSRI3QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195393759#wasThisHelpful","R375N41RSRI3QK","A3LF914GG87TWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LF914GG87TWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book Info: Genre: Literary fictionReading Level: AdultRecommended for: those who liked the movie, those who like very violent stories that are twistyTrigger Warnings: violence, those with arachnophobia beware, making soap out of human collagen, murder, suicidal ideationMy Thoughts: One of the keywords used to describe this book is nihilism. I think this is particularly appropriate. Over and over the narrator repeats things like, Maybe self-improvement isn't the answer... Maybe self-destruction is the answer. Or, At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves. Or, It's only after you've lost everything... that you're free to do anything. It reminds me of a line in a GWAR song: Sometimes you have to burn everything down so you can have nothing at all.I felt I could finally get my hands on everything in the world that didn't work... Nothing was solved when the fighting was over, but nothing mattered.Me, with my punched-out eyes and dried blood in big black crusty stains on my pants, I'm saying HELLO to everybody at work. HELLO! Look at me. HELLO! I am so ZEN. This is BLOOD. This is NOTHING. Hello. Everything is nothing and it's so cool to be ENLIGHTENED. Like me.So, as you can see it is not a subtle message, but indeed one that is pounded into the reader over and over, like punches in the face. It's actually rather brilliant, but ultimately depressing if you take it too much to heart. There is much discourse over the ultimate meaning of this book. To put it out there, I think this book is about modern man's search for his place in the world. Men evolved to hunt and fight, and nowadays are more likely to be hunting for a paperclip and fighting for a good parking spot. It has left them at loose ends (thus the wars), and this book is about men seeking a way to turn the tide back to the times when they were providing more meaningful services to humanity.I've read a few books by Chuck Palahniuk and enjoyed them all, but this one is the best. Which is ironic, since it's also the first book he had published. I've talked to a lot of people who say his earlier work, such as this book, is brilliant, but that it loses a lot of that brilliance in later books. After having read this one, and considering the other books I've read by him, I can see where that comes from. I should re-read those books and see what I think now, if I can find my copies! Anyway, if you saw and liked the movie, or if you like books that will seriously twist your brain, then check this book out. It's a mind-warper.Disclosure: This book was a gift from a friend. All opinions are my own.Synopsis: The first rule about fight club is you don't talk about fight club.In his debut novel, Chuck Palahniuk showed himself to be his generation's most visionary satirist. Fight Club's estranged narrator leaves his lackluster job when he comes under the thrall of Tyler Durden, an enigmatic young man who holds secret boxing matches in the basement of bars. There two men fight ""as long as they have to."" A gloriously original work that exposes what is at the core of our modern world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZEP0PVZ07IBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393327345#wasThisHelpful","R1ZEP0PVZ07IBX","A3LF914GG87TWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LF914GG87TWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Haunting, original, a slow build of fear and freaky goodness. A puzzle that gives you chills. Quite good.I took off a star because I was distracted by the vagueness of the time period. 60s, 70s ?

" 0:48 MinsBernat Softee Baby yarn is just that - super soft and perfect for babies. I've purchased Prince Pebbles yarn on two occasions from a local craft store. I have to admit, the second time purchasing, the teal and gray were much more subtle. So be prepared for the color to vary. Buy more than enough skeins for your project. I loved it both times, I was just surprised at the lighter skein the second time.The skein I bought recently states:120 grams, 4.25 ouncesWeight = 3, lightMachine wash and dry.100% acrylicApproximately 283 m or 310 yards.This looks very nice on its own or worked with two strands of yarn at once - Prince Pebbles and white or Prince Pebbles and a soft gray. Lovely colors blended together.The video is just the Bernat Prince Pebbles - not blended with another color. The top portion of the sweater is DC and the bottom is alternating DC, SC across. The next row down, I put a SC stitch on top of a DC - DC on a SC. It gives it a tighter weave and looks interesting.As you can see, I have a lot of yarn left after making this 3 to 6 month baby sweater. The skein sitting there is what I have left over. I might get a newborn size sweater out of what is remaining - especially if I make the sweater in all DC rows. The DC/SC rows use more yarn due to the tighter weave.Since the yarn is so soft, you may encounter splitting - not a lot, just every once in a while. I was not bothered by it.Buy it. Buy extra. Prince Pebbles makes eye catching baby items. I've received many compliments on my baby sweaters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6CI595VS5MK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KTXSGW#wasThisHelpful","R1E6CI595VS5MK","AXSV2IRQX2C20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSV2IRQX2C20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So festive.The video shows the labelWeight = 3, lightYards = 392Material = Acrylic, Rayon, and NylonThe baby sweater is two strands of yarn at once: Posy Patch and an off white, I believe I used Caron Simply Soft. The smaller piece shows what Posy Patch looks like on its own. The bottom section is DC rows and the top is SC.As you can see, I have plenty left over for a second baby sweater.I will buy this again and hope Bernat brings it out in more colors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9NOSAIPVT60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KTYT3S#wasThisHelpful","RZ9NOSAIPVT60","AXSV2IRQX2C20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSV2IRQX2C20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two thumbs up!! (Because I think it would be a fun movie) This story starts out quick. There is instant fear due to a missing person. The feeling grabs on and doesn't let go for the entire ebook.How can you describe darkness? Curran succeeds in beautiful descriptions of the atmosphere using all the other senses. Sound, and even smells. ""perfectly black"". Ooooh - loved it.Thank you DarkFuse and NetGalley for the ARC of this ebook.The building of fear is accompanied by a slow destruction of everything around Jon.

I had no idea this was a scented product.Why ruin a beautiful yarn with this nasty scent? It smells like 20 year old cheap perfume. It literally makes my eyes itch.LOVE the colors.

"This anthology was published in 1921 by Mary Cholmondeley. She is better known for her novel ""Red Pottage.""  There are eight unrelated shorts in this book. I'll admit I didn't care for most of them. The best part is actually the forward. Cholmondeley tells us of the cottage she lives in and a memorable experience she had during a war. Quite beautifully done. I wish an entire novel had been written on those subjects. It reminded me of Elizabeth Von Armin's ""Elizabeth and Her German Garden."" But unfortunately the short stories were not anywhere near as good as the opening pages. If anything, download this title and just read those.

"Three stars does not mean this story was bad... I liked what was there. Menace was the second title by Gary Fry that I've read. I enjoyed them both. Lurker was my first - a good read. Go look that one up.Menace has an interesting overall concept - one that was revealed a smidge too far into the book for my taste. I wanted to have more time with creepy kids, plotting family members, spooky old mansions, etc. I enjoy novellas - this one needed more scare and action, less build-up.I enjoy Fry's writing style and hope to read more of his work.

"I was quite intrigued to see how the author would reshape an old classic. Turn it from ghostly characters to one using immortal vampires. I was not disappointed. Ms Eden can write paranormal stories with great action and drama. I've read other titles by her and they are all consistently good.Thank you NetGalley and Cynthia Eden for the review copy of this ebook.The storyline flows well. It fit nicely into a novella length, but at the same time didn't leave me questioning areas or feeling rushed.If you like snarky, sexy bad boys, a steamy scene or two, great action, and just the right amount of suspense, then give this story a try.

I knew nothing of this world or of their place in history. I was pleased to learn about it from an inside and emotional point of view.The setting  Jane Lark can paint a scene! We are shown many, many settings and all of them were vivid without being wordy. That is my favorite part of period novels. This book was a wonderful trip into other worlds.The characters - I found myself instantly reacting to all the people in the story: the trapped heroine, the sweet little boy, the bad guys you want to boo and hiss at (or punch). So well done.There is a lot of tension in this story. You will find yourself turning pages just to see what happens next. The storyline is varied and changes  in a good way. I enjoyed it so much!

The backstory of Beth and Kenny, deep and somewhat sad. I was pulling for them... pulling for Katherine, Mr. Thompson and the others.

"This is a calm, easy going story about people daring to go after what they want. I say ""calm"" because it is a gentle and sometimes slow story. Sprinkled throughout are touches of Stella Gibbons' great humor. I didn't want to miss those - but at times the action was so slow I was tempted to skim.We are presented with various groups of people: 1) The ones who always do what they should, follow standard, act appropriately. 2) People who dare to cross the lines of society and challenge norms, people who do what they want regardless of the consequences. 3) the peripheral characters who are caught in the crossfireThis is an easy going story with touches of Gibbons' dry wit.

" 0:48 MinsI was looking for another everyday bracelet and came across this one. I wasn't buying it particularly for the magnetic qualities - I just liked the look of it.It is solid-feeling and has a nice weight to it. It doesn't feel plastic or cheap. The stones are bright and pretty.The clasp is a bit tough to open, but I assume it will loosen up with use.I also was surprised by the prominent cooper color. I did order this style but it appears much more cooper compared to the image. It is all over copper in color, not just hints of it. But... still a nice bracelet.

Thank you NetGalley and Scholastic for the review copy of Rotten.Teen males looking for a book - here you go.Jimmer is a likable character and Johnny Rotten is a fantastic dog - misunderstood, but a character readers will want to cheer for.One aspect I loved about this title, once finished I didn't feel emotionally drained or beat up. The scenes, families, and school segments are all believable and in no way over the top.Students will turn pages quickly in order to find out how the story ends. I feel there are many themes that would work well for book reports. None of it was dull though - a great story.

"I originally ordered this case as a bridge for my brand-new Note 5 until the Verus case was in stock because it was economically.  To my surprise it is actually a good-looking, protective case.  The clear is practically invisible from any distance and really shows off the Note 5 itself.  The material has a rubbery feel and is slightly soft - which is to its advantage as it will not be as scratch-prone as a harder, plastic surface.  You cannot go wrong with this case at a very economical price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6AZ553WMO4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0132ZA068#wasThisHelpful","R1F6AZ553WMO4D","A25WJCAP606YMP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25WJCAP606YMP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While the ceramic blade will last a lot longer, it is not as sharp as a blade and the tip is rounded (which is a plus for safety, but a minus if you need a sharp point).  The 3 positions are very limiting compared to a blade.  The longest position only protrudes 1/2 inch at best.Update 9/29/2015: After using this cutter for a while, I have added a star.  I have found that the fact that it isn't as sharp as a razor blade comes in handy much more often than I first thought it would.  It is more like a retractable letter opener with a sharper edge.

"I just got this book and the break-down of ""Eruption"" by itself is worth the price of admission.  The book comes with a code where you can go online and download the accompanying audio files.  The songs are broken up into 4 or 5 pieces on the audio files to aid with learning particular sections.  The pieces are played at both normal speed and at 1/2 to1/4 speed so that an intermediate can keep up.  These transcriptions are the real deal and even ""Eruption"" is manageable at the slow-demo speed for most intermediate players.  The only downside to this product is that whole songs with backing tracks are not offered like with other Hal Leonard PLay-Along series publications like Van Halen 1978-1984: Guitar Play-Along Volume 50 (Hal Leonard Guitar Play-Along)  I originally subtracted 1 star for not have the full length backing tracks, but decided not to as the author of this product probably had no control over this aspect.You may wish to invest in a piece of music tempo software so that you can gradually increase the rpms of the tracks.

"do not like beets and I do not like the taste of this stuff either. But, I WANT the benefits. So, I invested $25 in a capsule making machine that I bought on Amazon. It is definitely cost beneficial to make your own capsules as opposed to buying them. And, I don't have to taste any beets to boot! The nitric oxide that comes from beets will dilate your blood vessels - and studies show that it can even repair arteries containing plaque. The NO2 peaks about 2 hours after ingesting the capsules for me. Now about this product, I think it works great and I like the idea of buying a brand name and not some generic stuff in a baggy. Beet Juice does stain, so watch out if you are making capsules. Cranberry juice will also mask the taste somewhat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HQE67SGLGMJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPNT878#wasThisHelpful","R1HQE67SGLGMJ7","A25WJCAP606YMP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25WJCAP606YMP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased these bags for my wife prior who is an avid quilter with 3 sewing machines.  She loves these bags, the large bag comfortable fits either of her Pfaff 6250 or Pfaff 7560 with the machine covers on and leaves space on either side of the machine for addition project items and smaller cutting mats/rulers and supplies in either the front or rear of the main compartments and pockets.  The Large bag will also accommodate her Singer Featherweight in it's original carrying case with plenty of room for other project items and tools.  The medium bag fits her Singer Featherweight in it's original carry case as well and is easy to carry.She took her Featherweight in the large rolling tote stuffed with a slew of projects when we traveled via airline this summer.  She found it easy to maneuver through airport and it fit, though very snug, in the overhead compartment of the plane.  On the way home, the airline attendant offered to stow it in the attendants luggage closet which was nice.  The medium bag fits in the overhead compartment with no problem as well as under the seat.  Handles are sturdy for carrying and all the interior and exterior pockets make it a perfect set-up for any type of travel whether for vacation, retreats or just taking to a guild sew-in day.  Bags all fit inside each other for easy storage once home or just leave packed and ready to go for the next trip.  This was exactly what my wife was looking for, a great value for a very functional well-made sturdy product.  Highly recommend, a must have item for the serious sewing machine traveler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRQ4M2J7FV78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3NW4BG#wasThisHelpful","R1CRQ4M2J7FV78","A25WJCAP606YMP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25WJCAP606YMP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bag is lightweight and easy to manage, but forget trying to roll-it, you'll need to purchase yourself a stuff bag - only drawback is that it doesn't come with a stuff bag to attach to your pack.  Easy to carry & lightweight, seems lighter than the 3lb posted on the carry weight specifications. The dual zip and inverted hood make it flexible for easy entry/exit without getting tangled if extra clothing is needed for warmth.  Definitely a spacious bag.  With that said, depending on the person, probably not a true 40 degree bag without extra clothing layers especially for smaller females, yet for a mummy bag spacious and warm enough for a larger man to be comfortable and move or turn.  I usually sleep in a hanging ENO hammock and this fits perfectly head-to-toe in my hammock.  Washes/Dries quickly without distortion.

"This is a nice solid state drive that is very fast - as fast as other SSDs on the market (especially at this price point), and certainly faster than the standard spinning hard drives. Since this comes with cloning software and an external enclosure for copying & cloning (or for just using as an external SSD), the price is actually really good.Assuming that you know the difference between an SSD and a ""standard"" drive, you'll know that the first benefit of the Kingston Savage HyperX is the dramatic increase in read/write speeds. This means that games and programs stored on this drive will start up a lot faster. However, once programs start up, they will only run faster when an SSD is in place if there are a lot of read/write disk operations required for the program - in other words, if your program requires more memory (RAM) than your computer has available, then the program will read & write information to your hard drive, which slows down programs unless they have a fast hard drive.The disk space for this laptop-sized drive is fairly good, but it will work in any machine. I really liked the external drive enclosure that allows the drive to be powered just through the USB connection - I used this for a while before I installed the drive internally, and the external access speed was great. Overall, this is a very nice drive that I'm happy to recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39J7AY43QNWPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W35L6DA#wasThisHelpful","R39J7AY43QNWPU","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Pioneer receiver produces incredible sound quality, has an easy set-up, has 7 HDMI inputs for crazy surround sound, Bluetooth, etc. Too many features to list here; just scroll up to the product info. (No point in wasting your time with a full list when it's already here.) We set it up with four speakers and tested it with some of my favorite, crunchy metal, like Dokken's ""Mr. Scary"" and Accept's ""Balls to the Wall."" It rivaled my Bose speaker for the crisp, clean sound, and it was easy to adjust bass and treble using my husband's cell phone. It instantly responded when I selected another song from his playlist. There are numerous ways to calibrate (i.e. tweak) the sound for your personal tastes. The sound was equally impressive when we watched a movie; it was like being in a theater.The only disappointment was the spotty Bluetooth connection. It cut out on us a few times, with the receiver and the Bluetooth device only a few feet apart. We haven't dug deep into troubleshooting this problem, and it hasn't done it every time we've used it, but it would certainly be a major bummer if it did so regularly (if it does, I will update my review). It would kill a major feature of this receiver.Given the $600 price tag, and the complex fine-tuning features offered by this Pioneer receiver, I'd say it isn't for everyone. The casual viewer or listener who wants surround sound can find it much cheaper without all the bells and whistles. But if you're REALLY into sound quality, and are a gear head when it comes to this kind of equipment, it's a worthwhile investment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQ2CL8GFQULC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V84S1ZS#wasThisHelpful","R2AQ2CL8GFQULC","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I already owned two Travelon purses before ordering this backpack for a recent trip to Europe, so I knew about the high quality and how secure Travelon's bags are. My husband was always carrying a messenger bag and would load it up with too much stuff as we explored, so I wanted to get a lightweight, secure bag. The Travelon backpack fit the bill perfectly! It is lightweight, well padded, has plenty of organizational pockets and sleeves, and it holds a lot for a small bag. We easily fit our sun hats, a cardigan, my camera and souvenirs in the main pocket, with water bottles and an umbrella in the outside pockets, and my husband's wallet, snacks, chargers, sunblock, etc. in the front pocket. When we bought several bags of gummy bears in Europe, it easily handled the heavy weight of them for the flight home. The backpack fits perfectly under a plane seat with extra room for a purse or your feet, and of course in the overhead.My favorite feature, as with my other Travelon bags, is the locking zippers. If we had anything of value in the main compartment, like my camera, we locked the zipper. It takes two hands to lock and unlock it and isn't easy -- which is exactly what you want, to thwart thieves. The fact that the straps are cut-proof makes it a truly secure bag. When we sat at outdoor cafes, we simply put a strap under a chair or table leg so no one could grab it and run.Travelon's bags are machine washable but also clean up quite easily with wipes or dishwash detergent, as we discovered when forgotten bananas in the top compartment got smushed! This bag will be coming with me on all my trips from now on, as my Travelon purses already do. I've already recommended this bag to my friends and heartily recommend it to anyone who needs a secure way to stash their gear when hiking, exploring, traveling, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCCF5STXMOE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DGL6W4#wasThisHelpful","R1JCCF5STXMOE9","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After 2.5 years of antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease, my gut got screwed up (despite probiotics) and I became gluten intolerant. Having to suddenly switch to a GF diet almost two years ago was a daunting, expensive proposition, and I am always on the hunt for good-tasting GF food (a lot of it is just not palatable). One of the hardest things to give up was pasta, including mac n cheese. Most gluten-free pastas have texture issues and some can downright inedible (Ancient Harvest quinoa mac n cheese pasta, I'm looking at you). But I have found rice-based GF pastas to be the best tasting, so I thought I'd give this a try.I was pleasantly surprised by this pasta, although it has a very mild cheese flavor. It's a bit salty, but not overbearingly so. I made it with unsalted butter and plain almond milk, and cooked the pasta for 10 minutes (GF pasta always seems to take the longest cooking time suggested). The pasta held its shape, unlike quinoa elbow noodles that fall apart or really poof up. I like that it's organic, and it has a higher end taste than other GF mac n cheese pastas I've tried. I didn't like Amy's mac n cheese, but the Walmart Great Value one and Trader Joe's are pretty good and the most cost-effective. But I have to add a slice of American cheese or shredded cheddar to boost the flavor to those, and I'd probably add some shredded white cheddar or even shredded parmesan to this Horizon one to boost its flavor a bit. When I reheated the leftovers, they definitely didn't have as much flavor, or saltiness, as when I first cooked them.These are definitely worth a try and I'm glad I did try them. I'll get them again for sure. The sauce is pretty thick, so if you add more milk or butter to thin it out, you'll definitely want to add extra cheese.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK08E4H423FLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTR0S8C#wasThisHelpful","RK08E4H423FLZ","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed when I got these shorts and discovered that they are NOT cargo shorts as advertised. The ""pockets"" on the legs are decorative only -- there is no actual pocket. The description should reflect that. As I needed actual pockets, I am returning these shorts.I contemplated keeping them because they were comfortable at first and they look nice on. Overall, they fit well, but when I was testing them out and sat down, they were uncomfortable in the groin area. The seam wasn't noticeable when I was standing, but it was painful when I sat down for several minutes. Even repositioning the shorts didn't get the seam away from where it shouldn't be pressing! I am somewhat high-waisted so that could be a factor. If you're not, it may not be a problem for you. Since they offer free returns, they're worth a try if you don't care that they're not cargo shorts.

"We have window films on many of our windows, to reduce glare on computers and TVs, and to cut down on the hot sun baking certain rooms. I chose this 3M film kit in the light color because the current ones in our office make it too dark. Well, it might be called ""light"" but it is just as dark as the one I had up there. It blocks a fair amount of light (it says 35% of the sun's rays, which is pretty dark) and I'd consider it medium, not light. When I get around to trying again, I'll aim for something that blocks 20% or less.As others have noted, it's a pain to put up the window film, as it is with every window film. 3M includes a squeegee and a blade for trimming the film, so you don't have to buy them separately. It is really a 2-person job to install this film. My husband has done this many times but he was holding it up to the window to see how much trimming would be needed, before I came in to help, and it got crimped. Once you get a crimp in these films, you'll always see them. So I'd suggest cutting a piece that's a little bigger than you'll need, rather than cutting from the whole roll when holding it up against the window. Trimming once it's up is fairly simple, but go slowly...it's easy to tear it or cut incorrectly when sliding the blade on window films.The quality is higher than many other window films we've used, but I'm still going to be looking for something lighter. I'd only recommend this ""light"" shade if you have a really bright room and need to cut down the light quite a bit. Our office faces north, so it doesn't get blasted with direct sun.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY5FIJFZWMZ4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M4X7I#wasThisHelpful","RY5FIJFZWMZ4N","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The WeMo tunable white bulb starter set is a non-starter...literally. I have an Android 5.0.1 phone, installed the WeMo app, and...nothing. It will not recognize the WeMo device, despite my trying multiple outlets and restarting the app several times. I followed the extremely limited instructions to get this set up and running, but it simply doesn't work. My phone found the WeMo WiFi network, which tells you you won't have an Internet connection with it connected, but it won't find the device. I didnt get a chance to test out if it really would displace my Internet connection, because it only connected twice and never again. That would be another major issue if you cant get online if connected to the WeMo network.When I started the app again, trying to find the device, it logged me into the network, then asked me for my home network password and logged me into that. I tried to find the device again, and the app wouldnt find it. So I unplugged the device again.After unplugging the device again and leaving it that way, I looked at my phone and it no longer showed the WeMo Link network in my WiFi connections list. I plugged it back in, waited, connected when it reappeared...and then my phone screen flashed and it instead connected to my home network and took the WeMo connection out of my list of connections. Sigh.So I plugged it back in  again  and waited for my phone to find the network. It didn't. The WeMo device was flashing green, then flashed yellow, and then the light became a solid green. My phone still wouldn't see the network. Then the light went off altogether. I know for a fact the outlet its plugged into works perfectly, because its where I normally have my Flex 2 phone charger plugged in.If you read reviews of WeMos app on the Google Play store, you will see it has a 2.8 rating and numerous complaints about unreliability, particularly with Android 5.0. For many users who already had it working, it stopped working with 5.0. Im sure if I wait long enough, theyll fix the bugs, but Im ready to throw this whole kit out the window.Additionally, the app requires you give it an alarming number of permissions. I almost didn't install it because of that...I never install apps that require so many permissions. It's invasive and makes me feel like the app is a massive security risk, especially since the WeMo network doesn't display as secure on my phone. Ive already uninstalled it. Nothing about this experience has given me any confidence in the app or the company, nor has it given me any desire to try again if they work out the bugsbecause:Theres also a problem with the light bulbs. We decided to test it first in our office. My husband put the bulb into our wall lamp and turned it on. It flashed three times before remaining illuminated. It does this every time we turn it on. VERY annoying and rather strange. The light is also dimmer than the equivalent bulb we had in there before. If It actually dimmed more than this, it would be too dim to be useful for anything other than lets-get-it-on lighting. I dont know if it would be brighter if adjusted with the app, since the app wont work. But its too dim to use as is and the flashing is annoying enough that I will smack my husband if he puts this damn bulb into any other lighting fixture in our house.If it were possible to return a Vine product (we get them free in exchange for doing honest reviews), I would box this non-starter set up and ship it back. It would be a great gift for someone you hate, or someone who youre hoping will hate you and end all association with you.P.S. And no, in case youre wondering, I am NOT a newb when it comes to stuff like this. Im very tech-savvy.

"This cat door would be a 5-star product if 1) it was insulated and 2) if the door was slightly higher.Our cat LOVES to be out on our screened porch, even on cold days and especially on hot and humid days. Having to open the door several times a day was a pain, and we couldn't leave her out there when we left the house. When we traveled, unless we had a cat sitter who stayed in the house, she only got to go on the porch twice a day for short periods. So this was a no-brainer for us, despite the price.Even though she uses a cat door to go into the basement for her litter box, it took a few days of training (and a lot of treats) to get our somewhat dimwitted kitty to figure out how to use it. Once she used it on her own, she was constantly outside. I'm glad it locks, because when it hit 95 degrees here the other day, I brought her in and locked it. (I also put something in front of it so she would understand she wasn't going out, rather than being confused as to why it wouldn't open!) But she absolutely loves the freedom it gives her! She has been sleeping out there at night too and is so happy to have this door.When we installed it last fall, we made an H-shaped wood bracket to put above the window so that no one could jack open the window from outside and break in. We painted it white and no one has noticed it unless we've pointed it out (we have off-white faux wood blinds so it blends right in). But as soon as it got really cold out, our kitchen was freezing. The metal retains the cold and so does the glass on the sides. So we put together a ridiculous plywood board/memory foam sandwich. We had to duct tape the cut-out near her window to keep her from getting bits of foam in her fur (we went with patriotic duct tape, which amuses visitors to our house!). It did the trick, but really, they need to better insulate this thing. It would be perfect if it they did that and raised the door so the cat isn't scrunching herself down so much to go in and out.You will need to have some kind of table or ledge on BOTH side of the window, unless it is just a few inches off the floor, for your pet to go in and out safely. We had built our spoiled kitty a lounging perch for the porch, and that's on the outside. Inside, we used a triangular cat post (it has a scratching post and self-brushing station!) we already had as well. Our cat weighs about 9 pounds and fits through the door comfortably. A pet larger than 15 pounds would not likely fit; I'd probably say up to 12 pounds would be just fine.Overall, definitely recommend if you have a screened porch or can otherwise keep other animals from coming inside.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDHTN187ZR4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TRBXG4#wasThisHelpful","R2GDHTN187ZR4Y","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We bought our first fire pit a few years ago, a portable one that has a carrying case. It's gotten a lot of use but after being left out in the rain, both the spark guard and the bowl itself got fairly rusty. It's still usable, but isn't overly attractive. Suffice it to say it'll be used to roast marshmallows, since those make a horrible mess when they get into the fire pit! But I don't expect it to last much longer.When the CobraCo copper fire put became available at Amazon, I grabbed it. It's an impressive size, about 28"" wide, but not too big. It was easy to put together; my 13-year-old was dying to have a fire and dragged the box into the backyard, in the dark, and began to assemble it! The addition of his father and a flashlight made quick work of the assembly and before long, we had a roaring fire. I mean, roaring. We used dried branches from a pine tree in our backyard along with some store-bought firewood logs, but I think the copper helped it retain the heat. The bowl also has small holes (maybe 1/4"" round) in the bottom, which helps airflow.If you buy this, be sure to watch it as the first fire glows. It's cool to see the patina of the copper change with the heat. It will change dramatically, even with just one fire. I am a little concerned that the bottom of the bowl didn't just change color, but texture as well, right through to the other side of the bowl. It's now rough rather than smooth. I read in another person's review that you're not supposed to put water in it to cool the ashes because that would corrode the metal; my husband assures me no one did this, so I do hope it's not corrosion I'm seeing. It cooled off fairly quickly.As most other reviewers have reported, our spark guard is dented, and we've only used the fire pit once. We currently have it stored in the garage (base, bowl and lid separately; it takes up a lot of space if stored as it's used), so it could have gotten dented when it was put away, or while the fire was going. I'm not really worried about that. I love that this fire pit includes a poker that can also lift the lid off the pit while the fire is going. It's long enough to keep you at a safe distance from the fire.We haven't used the included cover, but if you are going to keep this outside, I would strongly suggest using it to prevent rust. Since we use ours in the grass, we have to put it away each time.All in all, I would recommend this fire pit if you don't mind the extreme discoloration that results even from just one use, and if you'd use it often enough to justify the price. It's attractive, sturdy and well-made, and it delivers a sizable fire. I personally don't want to roast marshmallows over it because they really do gum up a fire pit, but it's great for lighting sparklers and warming up your outside space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9S0TH2RCVM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096DD84W#wasThisHelpful","R1O9S0TH2RCVM5","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered these in two sizes, as I am a size 8 but sometimes fit an 8.5 better. Neither fit comfortably. Even with the smaller size, my toes slid to the front edge of the slipper after just a few steps. That would be fine if they didn't have a ridge around the edge that's firmer than the slipper bed. I sent both pairs back.It's a shame, because the slipper bed is very comfy. As others have said, if you have wide or thicker feet, they would likely stay in place and you'd be cradled in comfort. I have small bones and even with size 8 feet, they're slender.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLS6H0NPCTQUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKD8V1Y#wasThisHelpful","RLS6H0NPCTQUD","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 17-year-old picked out this cool watch. We couldn't believe the price. Well, it is too good to be true! It's unfortunately a piece of junk.The first one we received didn't work correctly. The second, smaller (round) dial wouldn't keep time if he was moving. I am not making that up. If he sat still, it kept time. But if he was just walking between classes at school or around the house, it would stop working. I called Amazon because the seller didn't allow exchanges, only refunds (even though Amazon fulfills it), and Amazon immediately sent us a replacement. They even overnighted it, as it was a birthday gift. He loved the style and how large the case is (it truly fills up the entire wrist), so he definitely wanted the same one again. Now that the replacement is broken, we're not going to see if three times' the charm.We received the replacement watch about a month ago. A week ago, he was at school and the watch literally just fell apart. The leather strap just fell off the watch case. It was frayed and had torn. Luckily, he was sitting down and the watch slipped off into his lap. When he got home, he sewed it back on (he's handy that way). Yesterday, while in a car riding home from a friend's house, he noticed the face of the watch was cracked, over the main timepiece. He hadn't smacked it against anything and it had been fine when he'd last looked at the watch just a little while earlier. He's never dropped it.So as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. In this case, even less. It is a very handsome and cool watch, so he is quite disappointed. But it isn't ready for primetime, if you'll forgive the pun! Time to search for yet another one...","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GC6SMLPUKL1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JB23X34#wasThisHelpful","R1GC6SMLPUKL1H","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 17-year-old has decided to eat as many of his meals as possible with chopsticks, so we decided to get him a permanent pair. He picked these out himself and he loves them. He says they're a little slippery, but if you're used to using chopsticks, it won't be a problem for you (he is quite adept with these). The squared edges make them easier to hold than, although not as comfortable as, rounded chopsticks. They also wash up very easily. He's used them for several weeks now and they still look brand new. They're simple and elegant. Definitely a good buy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141DPD5Q8ZVMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPJ3LWW#wasThisHelpful","R141DPD5Q8ZVMS","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Blue Point towels are nice and plush. The sage color is very trendy right now and is a great match to my existing bathroom dcor. It is a slightly yellower sage than I typically see, so keep that in mind if you're trying to color match. The color on Amazon, at least on my screen, is pretty accurate.It is frustrating to have to wash them 3-4 times to get rid of all of the extra fuzzies, but hey, that's the price you pay for luxurious towels! (I have another set of towels, a department store brand, that I've had to wash more than 6-7 times to get the fuzzies out.) There is a nice extra bit of detailing before the hem in addition to the border detail. And the size of the towels is just right -- not too big, not too small. Perfect for the average size person. And of course, it's an added bonus that the towels are eco-friendly.

"My middle schooler carries way too much stuff in his binder every year, and used to go through a binder each semester. They'd just fall apart. We started buying the Mead 5-star binders and they definitely last a lot longer. So when this one became available through Vine, I grabbed it for next year. His current Mead binder has lasted through the entire school year (we have 4 weeks left) and I am expecting this one to be just as durable.This 2"" binder has a nice feature in its 6-pocket expanding file, which can be accessed from both inside and outside the binder. This is great for when the teacher hands out papers at the end of class and for papers the students need to remember to show mom and dad at home. They can put their papers into the divided files without having to open the entire notebook. From the inside, this section is accessible behind a velcro tab.On the inside cover is a large zippered pocket, which I didn't notice the first time I opened it because it blends into the background. But it is a mesh, see-through pocket that will hold plenty of school supplies. There's also a velcro-tabbed pocket that would hold a smart phone or calculator.The 2"" rings are round and have a capacity of 880 sheets. The only thing missing is a folder pocket for loose sheets in the back of the notebook, but with the front expanding files, you can slip any loose pages in there.For the money, it's a great value. It would be nice if it had a zippered pocket on the outside for quick access to a needed pen, pencil or eraser, and that's really its only flaw. Otherwise, it's stylish, will hold everything your student needs, and it should last a full school year, if not more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RM9PHRQWMRXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWY2KFU#wasThisHelpful","R1RM9PHRQWMRXA","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My disabled uncle has a really hard time getting in and out of cars, to the point that I literally had him try out dozens of old cars, SUVS and minivans before we found something he could get out of without too much effort (he is on a strict budget, so we were looking at older model vehicles). But as he has severe arthritis in his knees, he still struggles to get up from chairs and from the car. So when I saw the Able Life Auto Assist Grab Bar, I immediately ordered it.On his first try, he couldn't get up because it was in his way. He is 6'4"" and nearly 300 pounds. We had to reposition his car so he could open the driver-side door all the way to give him more room. On the second try, he was able to get up more quickly than usual, and he said it was definitely easier than trying to get up without it. But he had to slide his body around it a bit. It was also higher than the seat he is normally pushing off from, but its firmness (the handle is hard plastic) did give him enough leverage to mostly counteract that. He was happy with it and excited to receive it!I agree with other reviewers who said if someone has a left-side disability affecting the shoulder, elbow, wrist or hand, they wouldn't be able to use this. I have chronic tendinitis in my left wrist, and pushing up on this would flare it up (on a bad day, I have trouble getting out of cars as well due to hip bursitis). I also don't see how it would be useful as an ice scraper because it's so small. You wouldn't be able to reach much. The key holder is a small, narrow channel, so it would definitely only fit a house key or a car key that's not on a key fob.I can also see this scratching the paint in his doorframe. Because the part that goes into the door latch is metal and you have to push it downward (and it's narrower than the opening so it slides around), it will likely scratch the surface. His car is really old, so it doesn't matter. But if you have a newer or expensive car, you may want to put something like a removable electrical tape or a padded adhesive to make sure it doesn't scratch or dent it.I didn't see a flashlight in it either as other reviewers said (5/13 update: the mfr has removed that from the produce description), but that isn't why I ordered it. I am just glad there's something like this out there that can help disabled people get out of their cars more easily. We more able-bodied folks aren't always there to help!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VEJT68LM5EM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I45JJQO#wasThisHelpful","R1VEJT68LM5EM1","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I literally am still using a decades-old and smaller, gray metal version of the Swingline Classic stapler that I stole from my dad so often, he finally gave it to me. When MY kids need a stapler, they always come grab mine. The small plastic ones that fit in their backpacks always break or just don't staple enough sheets together. So now they have this larger black one in their school supply drawer, although I may be stealing it from them on occasion! With its sleek design and smooth lines, it feels better in the hand than my old one.As you'd expect from Swingline, it's heavy duty, both in the weight and feel of it, and in its ability to cleanly staple several sheets together (I have not tried to do 20 at once, but I don't doubt it will). If I am sitting down, I tend to prefer holding the stapler in the air when using it, and some staplers aren't strong enough to work properly like that, because they rely on downward force. The Swingline works just fine whether you're squeezing it together or pushing down on it on a hard surface. Because it's all metal, it would be a bit heavy for a backpack. It's best kept where you'll use it most (and if your child's teacher doesn't have one this nice, it's cheap enough for you to buy it for him or her as a gift for the classroom!).Really, there's no reason to buy any other brand. I expect this Swingline to last as long as my 40-year-old one (and I am glad I won't have to refill it as often...it holds a lot more staples!). There's a reason it's a classic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJLQZ2AZTK5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HUQ9M#wasThisHelpful","R2QJLQZ2AZTK5D","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been casually reading Buddhist books the past few years and have found the Buddhist philosophy to really fit well with many ideas I already had about how I wanted to live my life. My perspective on many things has changed for the positive, thanks to Buddhism, and I want to study and embrace it more actively.When this Beginner's Guide to Meditation became available, I jumped at the chance to explore it. I've never really tried to meditate before; I am one of those people who is an active thinker and easily distracted multi-tasker. I've always thought it impossible to clear my head and have kind of always liked that I am a deep thinker. But I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try, and I began reading this book.Immediately, I could see that it ISN'T a practical guide for absolute beginners. It is instead an anthology of philosophies on meditation by leading Buddhist monks and scholars. Each one offers his or her own perspective, and rather than feeling guided along, I felt like I didn't know at all where to start. Which approach should I try first? What's the easiest way for a newbie to get started? And I haven't been studying Buddhism long enough to know many of the terms and had to keep flipping to the back to review the glossary.I think this book would be a useful guide for someone who's already started to meditate and wants guidance on how to get the most out of it. It's very interesting, but a bit overwhelming for this newbie. Perhaps it seems incongruous with the entire meditation thing, but I wanted something more concrete, more step-by-step, to help me get started. I feel like I would be better served by going to a local Buddhist center to explore meditation with someone who can guide me, and then using this book to explore different avenues for finding what works for me.I did appreciate an early essay which warned us not to become ""professionals"" at meditation but to make it a hobby. We shouldn't take it so seriously that we miss the point. I will keep sage advice like this in mind when I do try meditating, but at the moment, I feel less excited to try it than before I picked up this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15MIGXA4VV2DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611800579#wasThisHelpful","R15MIGXA4VV2DP","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, let's face facts: a gluten-free diet is killer on the wallet. At about $6 for 9 ounces, Jovial's GF brown rice tagliatelle is one of the most expensive GF pastas out there. But I have to say, it is one of the best tasting!I recently got a copy of America's Test Kitchen's new GF cookbook, and they reviewed several brands of GF pasta. Their favorite, at least for lasagna, was Jovial's brown rice pasta. I agreed with their assessments of other GF pastas (Ancient Harvest' corn/quinoa blends are too grainy and taste terrible with any kind of sauce), so I decided to try one of the Jovial pastas. I ordered this tagliatelle because it's the closest to fettucine, and I love making fettucine alfredo from scratch.I did a taste test earlier today and cooked up just a little bit. At 10 minutes and about 20 extra seconds (I wasn't in the kitchen when the timer went off!), it was just becoming mushy. But it tasted great! So tonight, I made the rest and mixed it with my alfredo sauce, and it was delicious! I cooked it for only 9 minutes and 30 seconds and it came out just right. My husband tasted it and said it tasted like an Asian fettucine. LOL. (He is most likely to have brown rice if we're having Chinese food!) But he liked it quite a bit.My only concern was that, as I prepared to pour the rest of the bag into the pot, I spotted a few pieces that had black specks all over them! I removed those and cooked up the rest, since my earlier sample had tasted fine and I didn't get sick. I will be contacting the company and will update my review when I hear what they have to say. GF products tend to get moldy very quickly (I literally bought this a week ago), so I hope it wasn't sitting around and that it wasn't indeed mold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKPLL8196Y36V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJXUNBK#wasThisHelpful","RKPLL8196Y36V","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband had already tried the CLEAR Citrus Fresh scent version of this shampoo, and we liked it better than Head & Shoulders, so he decided to try this scent as well. He uses dandruff shampoo with conditioner to control flakes that occur because of a dry scalp, and H&S shampoo with conditioner has served well to control his dandruff ever since he started using it.The Clear shampoo compares favorably to H&S: it's thicker and lathers more than H&S, and it seems to control his dandruff just as well. His hair feels clean and soft, though I don't think that's any different than before.The Ocean Mineral scent is nice but not as pleasant as the Citrus Fresh scent. Neither is overpowering like the perfumes in some shampoos, so if you like this scent or one of the others that are offered, you won't have to worry about the scent of your hair announcing your entrance to a room or triggering an asthma attack for your sensitive spouse (aka me)! It smells much better, and more natural, than Head & Shoulders. My husband's hair smells good all day long, which it didn't with H&S. I am fussier about the smell of his shampoos and deodorants than he is, so he has me pick them out for him! This one gets a thumbs up from both of us.We recommend this shampoo and he will likely stick with it over H&S, even though it's slightly more expensive.

"A couple of months ago, I bought my husband a new camera that is considerably bigger than what he's had in the past. He used to have point & shoot cameras, as he is not particularly savvy when it comes to the advanced features that the bigger, more capable cameras seem to have (I shoot with a Canon 60D and studied photography). With the new camera came a need for a larger bag for his Nikon Coolpix 820 and a few accessories.This CaseLogic camera bag seems to fit just right for his needs. He needs enough room for the camera, extra batteries, and the connection cables for hooking the camera up to either a PC or a TV. As with many camera bags, the main compartment is divided by semi-rigid pads with velcro on the sides. These dividers can be removed altogether, or just shifted to accommodate different-sized cameras or other devices. One of the dividers comes with a flexible cover that he configured to flip over the central compartment. The Coolpix fits perfectly in that central compartment, and the insulation should keep it safe even if he drops the bag several feet onto concrete (not that he usually does this!). The compartments on either side are large enough to hold the rest of his accessories, with enough room to hold an additional lens or other accessories.There are mesh pockets on either side of this bag that have come in handy to carry a small water bottle on one side and a small travel umbrella on the other.  Larger bottles, umbrellas or other gear would not fit well, but that doesn't bother him because he didn't get this to compete with a full-size messenger bag (I had one for my Canon gear and it killed my shoulders). You can wear this bag like a messenger bag, however, as the shoulder strap is plenty long enough to go over your opposite shoulder.One feature that he doesn't like is that there is no zipper to completely seal the inner compartment. However, the lid flap can be pulled down rather snugly, and it stays closed with a decent amount of velcro. It's fairly easy to pull open the lid from the velcro and take out the camera. When you don't need to be prepared to take a picture, you can decrease the chance of an accident by connecting the two snapon clips that make the lid fairly secure.A last feature of this bag is a rain cover with which you can wrap the entire bag. It took him a couple of minutes to put on the cover, but it seems functional in that you can open the bag and reclose it quickly without taking off the cover (though you'll need to make sure you get it out of the rain before opening it at the start).Overall, this bag is the right size for his camera, it's well-padded and easy to use. We are both satisfied with it and would recommend this bag to anyone with similar needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNNU0E3IJFZ67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZJ11PO#wasThisHelpful","RNNU0E3IJFZ67","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the money, I don't think the X-Mini portable bluetooth speaker is worth it. At full volume, there is considerable distortion and static. I synced it with my iPhone 5 and played some crunchy metal with strong bass and searing guitars (Accept, Dream Theater, Scorpions) to test out how it handled both bass and treble. It only sounded ok at about 60% volume. At full volume, the distortion would only go unnoticed if you were having a loud party and people weren't there to listen to the music. There is no volume control on the speaker; you control the volume from your MP3 player/phone/tablet/whatever.It was easy to sync with my iPhone. You just turn the speaker on and put it near the phone. Open your Bluetooth settings, and once it finds it, tap the name of the device on your screen to connect. It is indeed portable and will fit into a purse, coat pocket, etc. You can use the strap to loop it through your belt loop. I walked around our first floor with it, while leaving my phone in the den, and it didn't cut out until I was on the other side of the stairs and a pantry some 30 feet away, so the reception is good. You could definitely walk around a party with your phone in your pocket and the speaker in a central location and not lose the signal.By comparison, X-Mini's MAX wired capsule speakers offer MUCH better sound quality, and they have a bass boost (I am enjoying a little Rush with them right now!). They're also quite a bit louder. They're not that much bigger than this wireless one so they'd go along with you easily as well. The only difference is they're not Bluetooth, so you need to keep the speaker next to the device.If you must have a Bluetooth speaker, I'd suggest looking at other options.

"I went gluten-free several months ago, and it was a challenge to say the least. I wish this book had been out then, but I'm still very glad it's out now! I had already picked up a few GF cookbooks but when this one became available through Vine, I grabbed it. I didn't realize it was from America's Test Kitchen until I got it. My confidence in the book shot straight through the roof; I know how serious they are about testing their recipes, as a former neighbor was one of their at-home test chefs.I was not disappointed. The book begins with a very well-written explanation of what gluten is and how it works, and why most gluten-free products are dry, grainy and just plain unpalatable. They tested numerous existing recipes with various GF flours already on the market, and although they liked King Arthur's all-purpose GF flour and Bob's Red Mill, neither were perfect for every type of recipe. So they created their own blend and tested each recipe with all three flours, tweaking repeatedly as they went.They also tasted and tested several GF pastas and breads. I have tried a few of the ones they tested and completely agreed with their assessments. I hadn't found a brown rice pasta I liked and have been using the new Mueller's and Barilla brands (which are not discussed in the book, since they just came out and the book was likely already at press), but they use white rice flour. I'm hypoglycemic and would prefer brown rice. Now I have a new brand to try. They also discuss in detail various product substitutes and how different ingredients impact a recipe. With this information, I feel well-prepared to try to tweak some of my favorite recipes to make them gluten-free.Here's what's really amazing: for EACH recipe, they describe it in detail, explain why it works, talk about substitutions, and give you step-by-step instructions. Some recipes take up four pages, but you'll never have to guess what you're doing. You will have complete confidence that the recipe will work out, because they were so thoroughly tested and because they walk you through it (I had mostly stopped buying cookbooks because I preferred to read reviews for recipes online, but with ATK, you know they've already gone through numerous modifications to make them just right). They didn't include too many main dishes, particularly meat or chicken dishes, because many of them are GF to begin with, and if you need to swap regular flour for GF flour in your own recipes, they have tips for that. So they focused on baked goods, side dishes, breakfast, and other items that those of us who avoid gluten normally can't eat (or have suffered through icky GF versions of).I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is THE gluten-free cookbook to buy, period. If you're just starting out, getting a guide to help you navigate the GF diet would be wise (I borrowed the Complete Idiots guide from a neighbor and found it so useful, I'll be buying the new edition). But once you're ready to start cooking GF from scratch, this is the book you want. I've been glad to find ready-made GF packaged goods for easy risottos and flavored quinoa blends, but this book is the first one that makes me excited to truly cook gluten-free.My only complaint? No French bread/baguette recipe. Perhaps that's asking too much, for there to be a quality GF baguette recipe, but I figure if anyone could do it, America's Test Kitchen could. So I'm bummed not to have one, as I love baking baguettes from scratch. Something to keep in mind for the Web site, ATK folks??? Please?!

We met Sam toward the end, when Andi was finally ready to have a real relationship after recovering from the shock of her cheating fianc dumping her for the other woman, and discovering herself as a sexy, self-confident woman, thanks to the ""lessons"" she received from the gorgeous escort Devin.Whereas ""Faking It"" was about Andi becoming the person she was meant to be, ""Ordinary World"" is about her inability to rediscover that woman following the sudden death of her husband on their 5th anniversary. He'd run out at the last minute to get something for their special dinner and was killed by a drunk driver. The novel begins with the funeral. I learned the hard way not to start reading a book like this while my own husband was out of town for work! I ended up putting it down after an hour and waiting until he got home before picking it up again. It's brutally sad for quite some time.And from what I can see from other reviews, that's what a lot of people didn't like about it. Yes, it's a downer for much of the book. And just when you think Andi's finally getting it together, after rediscovering Devin and a bit of herself while on a trip, she keeps taking one step forward, three steps back in her recovery. It's easy to get impatient with her: Why is she holding on so tightly to Sam, especially when there's someone else who adores her too? Why can't she let go of guilt for even trying to move on? Why isn't her therapy really working?But unless you've been through something as devastating as the loss of your husband, especially one who finally made you feel complete and as loved as you'd always craved, you really can't say you wouldn't react the same way. I am very fortunate not to have gone through such a thing, but even as I got frustrated with her lack of progress, I couldn't help but wonder if I'd deal with it any better if my own husband died, and so suddenly. It strikes me that, just like with everything else Lorello writes, Andi's inability to deal with this loss is very much authentic and is probably based on experiences someone she is close to has had, because of how in-depth the insights are into Andi's psyche. It's very real, and that's probably what upset many readers: ""Is this how I would feel? I don't want to think about it.""This is not one of those books you'll put down after finishing it and say, ""Phew! I feel great!"" It does rip a hole in you, and even though it ends on a positive note with Andi finally going in the right direction (I won't say if it's with Devin/David or not), you're still going to be aware of what it took to get there and you'll still feel a bit raw for several days after you put it down. It will affect you all the more if you went through personal struggles with happiness, self-image or self-confidence before finding true happiness with your own spouse, without a doubt. And if you've gone through something like this already, reading this could either help you resolve some of your own feelings, or it could rip your heart out and bring up those feelings again, especially if you haven't moved on sufficiently.I would still recommend it, especially if you enjoy solid character development, emotional growth, and Lorello's writing in general. I have now read all three books in the Andi Cutrone series (the newest one is called ""She Has Your Eyes"") and remain a huge fan of Lorello's gift for creating authentic, relatable characters and situations. I follow her on Facebook and look forward to reading many more of her novels. (But please, can we have some less brutal story lines in the future, Ms. Lorello?!).Have lots of tissues ready, and read it when you have a private moment or place to do so, and then hug your spouse!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1URSC2RMK1WCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935597361#wasThisHelpful","R1URSC2RMK1WCR","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only drink decaf, but many decaf coffees still have enough caffeine to make my heart race. So when we got a Keurig for Christmas, the first thing I did was come to Amazon to find a decaf variety pack so I could try different brands. I'd much rather try one cup without buying a whole box of them, or what I used to do, buy a whole pound of coffee at the store and then discover I couldn't drink it.More than half of the coffees are medium roast, extra bold, which I thought would be problematic but only one of them made me jittery (the Van Houtte house blend). My favorite is the first one I tried, the Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold. I now buy the 18-pack of just that one. The Caribou Blend Medium Roast was almost as good; same for Wolfgang Puck's Chef Reserve and Green Mountain's Vermont Country Blend. I was afraid Emeril's Jazzed Up one would make me jittery, but it was very good and I had no trouble. Newman's Own Special tasted a bit light to me, and the Green Mountain Hazelnut was good, but a little weak. I haven't tried most of the light roast coffees since I found myself preferring the stronger ones, so I will be saving those for guests.All in all, this is a great sampler pack and I would highly recommend it! There are a few flavored ones, and a Celestial tea, so there's some good variety. Great for varying tastes and for finding the ones you'll buy regularly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZT3WDVNOCCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5M8KRC#wasThisHelpful","R3JZT3WDVNOCCB","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first became a fan of Elisa Lorello's when reading the first novel in the Andi series, ""Faking It."" Lorello has a spectacular gift for getting inside her characters' heads, hearts and souls, and creating very real, identifiable and relatable characters. The reader may not always agree with or like what her characters do, but it's easy to see what motivates them. It's easy to learn from them, and their inner dialogue and experiences can help you figure out similar issues in your own life. You'd think she was a psychologist in a past life. Her characters and their life situations have such authenticity, and it really does make you wonder, ""What would I do in this same situation?"" I always feel like I've grown a little bit along with her characters by the time I finish the book.In this third book in the series, Andi and David have finally settled in to a more relaxed lifestyle together, although some of her emotional scars remain from the death of her beloved husband a few years earlier. In the second novel, ""Ordinary World,"" Andi grieved her husband's death so deeply it prevented her from getting a grip on her life for nearly two years (very difficult but cathartic novel to read). I didn't actually realize there was a second novel in the series until discovering this new one through the Vine program, so I picked up that one too and read it first. Unlike many series, though, if you haven't read the first two novels, you won't be completely lost with this one, because Lorello sufficiently references past issues that affected the characters so that you understand what motivates their behavior and shapes their experiences today. I'd still recommend reading them first for the full picture, but you'd still enjoy this novel just the same.But it wouldn't be a Lorello novel if she didn't rip the rug out from under her characters, and in the second chapter, she gets right to it: a 15-year-old girl literally shows up at David and Andi's doorstep with the claim that she might be David's daughter. Andi sees it in Wylie's eyes immediately, hence the oft-repeated title of the book, ""She Has Your Eyes."" Just as Andi's finally ready to commit to marriage with David, he now has a potential daughter and they have to figure out if or how she'll fit into their lives. To further add to their challenges, Andi gets devastating news about a family member that will further test and change everyone's relationships. And if that wasn't enough, Andi's cheating ex-fianc resurfaces and wants to be friends.I can't say any more about the plot without giving things away, but Lorello deftly weaves these story lines together and fully explores the impact of these events on Andi, David and their relationship. The reader will wonder along with Andi if they'll be able to survive these challenges intact, and whether they should. There are times the reader might even get mad at the characters (Andi and David, like most people, have their moments where they're selfish or insensitive), but that's part of what makes it so real. Andi had put her husband Sam on a pedestal and never saw any of his flaws (he never seemed to see hers either, which made him even more fantastic), so when she's faced with how most people respond to challenges, she's often at a loss about how to deal with those problems constructively. We see her, David and the other key characters make mistakes and grow throughout the story, and figure out how they need to manage and improve their relationships, so in the end, it's quite satisfying.I love novels where the characters truly do grow as people and their lives change for the better, without the syrupy crap you find in typical romance novels. That's why Lorello's aren't classified as romance novels, and why you may enjoy her books as much as I do (just be sure to have a hanky ready...she does like to make you cry!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYEHEO3ARSEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477848126#wasThisHelpful","RFYEHEO3ARSEB","A2DDVD6SPKZOZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DDVD6SPKZOZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easy Reading.  A tongue-in-cheek pre-WWII story of ""what if...?"": a mixture of fiction and historical facts about Jack Kennedy as a young man and F.D.R.Jack's admiration of Winston Churchill is in total conflict of Joe Kennedy, Sr.'s loyalty to Chamberlain and his passiveness to Germany (Joe Kennedy, Sr. was the American Ambassador to England at the time).  Being the son of American Ambassador, F.D.R. could use him secretly to be his unofficial eyes and ears on events taking place overseas.  Who would suspect this young man as he traveled Europe on the pretext of gathering information for his college thesis?To sum it up, there are nail-biting moments.  There is romance. There is conflict.  Everything comes together to make this enjoyable reading.  A good WWII novel before the United States finally became involved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELDZICO3KP3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073XV2K4#wasThisHelpful","R2ELDZICO3KP3V","A2A7NHE5HTK79N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A7NHE5HTK79N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"BearManor Media presents ""CHARLIE OF NOB HILL"" (Paperback) -- by Gene Arceri.It is not only about Charlie's heroism, but the fact that he and Miss Nova were inseparable from the very first time they met. Coming from Mrs. Binder of Pets Unlimited, this was several years earlier on one cold December day. Bringing Charlie in a basket, his curiosity could not take it any longer, he peered out to see a woman with soft Grey hair and twinkling blues eyes - it was love at first sight. Miss Nova gazed at Charlie's handsome black and white markings, the black scalloping on his back and ears, and the perfect black mustache. ""He looks just like Charlie Chaplin!"" she exclaimed. ""He's just beautiful"".Christening him on the spot, now you belong to me. Charlie thought and he supposed he could get use to being called Charlie, but what's a CHARLIE CHAPLIN?My favorite part of the book is on page eleven ... Charlie watched from the doorway as Miss Nova instructed a visiting friend to hang up some of her pictures. They were signed photographs of the men associated with on her publicity work in Hollywood -- One was HUMPHREY BOGART, the inscription read: ""To Nova-You ain't so tough"". The other picture was of a smiling CARY GRANT and he had written, ""Nova, what makes you so small?"" (Miss Nova was under five feet tall.) -- Between them now hung a picture of CHARLIE. ""Well, she said, ""now we have three tigers on the wall - BOGIE, CHARLIE and CARY"".Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.Big thank you to Ben Ohmart and his staff, BearManor Media, a small press that publishes BIG books.

"Black Dog Books presents ""DEAD MAN'S BRAND"" (Paperback) ~ by Norbert Davis (Author), Bill Pronzini (Introduction), Ed Hulse (Appendix), Tom Roberts (Cover Design)I've collected pulps for many years - and as one reviewer states, we are living in the Golden Age of Pulp Reprints, and I also take my hat off to Black Dog Books and editor/publisher Tom Roberts, we now have these collections at our fingertips.All eight are fast action packed stories, but the first story in this collection A GUNSMOKE CASE FOR MAJOR CAIN, has to be my favorite.  It was adapted into a B-Western, HANDS ACROSS THE ROCKIES (1941), starring one of my favorite Western stars Bill Elliott (Wild Bill Hickok) and Dub Taylor (Cannonball Taylor), mixed with plenty of gun play and humor.  Of course many of the names are changed to fit our stars handle in their films, but remained faithful to Davis' plot, still basically on the same plain.  Reprinted here for the first time since its original magazine appearance, as with the other stories herein.Collection of eight Western tales, from Action Stories, Dime Western Magazine, Star Western and Western Aces (1935-1942) -- pure entertainment.With a an introduction by Spur Award winner Bill Pronzini -- Must agree with Pronzini, all eight stories collected here are all first-rate entertainment by a born storyteller.

"BearManor Media presents ""IDA LUPINO:BEYOND THE CAMERA"" (Paperback) -- by Ida Lupino (Author), Mary Ann Anderson (Author)I love the comments in the afterword, where Lupino states - ""I was now able to tell WARNER BROS, to go to hell!  None of us were happy there.  I used to go up on the hill beyond the studio and throw rocks at it.  I was always going on suspension or doing roles that I absolutely hated.  I refused to do roles turned down by other actresses, like Better Davis.""Lupino never said she was the poor man's Bette Davis, WARNER BROS. came up with that bad line, not me.  I respected Davis, Now Ida could do heavy, light - She had a great sense of scene construction.  If she could have only gotten another picture like THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT or THE HARD WAY, she could have stayed on top.  Lupino's states, acting is a born talent within people, it can be polished and made better but you definitely cannot teach someone to act, you need to leave that up to the audience -- Orson Welles puts it best, actor's acting, I am Bored.In the director's chair, after films NOT WANTED (1949) and OUTRAGE (1949), Ida had offers by all the studios as a director, but she remained independent.  When filmakers was dissolved, Ida turned her full attention to television directing, first directorial assignment was HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL, Richard Boone was a wonderful man, but he was not out to baby any director, believe me, but after the first episode he said, ""I like you, I want you on the rest of them.  I stayed on and directed four episodes.  Boone liked his direction hard-boiled.""Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.TABLE OF CONTENTS: (Chapter, Title and Page Numbers)Foreword --- xi1.

"BearManor Media presents ""THE FILMS OF THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION"" (Paperback) -- by Philip Leibfried (Author)Have many films on the 'French Foreign Legion', but was not aware of the ones I've missed.  As the author points out in his introduction -- Created by an order of King Louis Philippe of France in 1831, the LEGION ETRANGERS originally served as a means of ridding France of thousands of political refugees who had sought asylum there after revolutions in their own countries in Southern and Eastern Europe.One of the most famous and a great story BEAU GESTE, by Percival Christopher Wren, published in 1924, of an unshakable bond among three brothers, which featured action, adventure, mystery, and a character by the name of Sgt. Lejaune, who became a symbol of cruelty as great as Simon Legree.  Something I didn't know was, BEAU GESTE was remade three times as a theatrical feature, but its leading characters, including an ogre of a sergeant, have influenced generations of filmmakers and film goers.  Beau Geste (1926) (Silent) with Ronald Colman, Neil Hamilton, Ralph Forbes & Noah Beery ... also, Beau Geste (1939) with Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy & Susan Hayward (This is one of my favorite films, great acting and direction by William A.

"Black Dog Books presents ""LUST OF THE LAWLESS"" (Paperback) ~ by Robert Leslie Bellem (Author), Tom Roberts (Editor), James Reasoner (Introduction), Allen Anderson (Cover Design)As editor Tom Roberts points out, Robert Leslie Bellem is best remembered for his tongue in cheek gumshoes, DAN TURNER, the pulp detective to ever have an entire magazine devoted to him with HOLLYWOOD DETECTIVE, which appeared regularly in SPICY DETECTIVE.  He seemed to effortlessly churn out the stuff, and it's estimated he wrote an astounding 3000 or so pulp stories, with Turner starring in at least 300 of them, not to mention 60 or 70 comic book stories.Bellem was born in 1902 in Philadelphia, and worked in Los Angeles as a newspaper reporter, radio announcer and film extra. But it was as a writer for the pulps that he truly made his mark.I'm so glad Tim Roberts of Black Dog Books published this collection of SPICY WESTERN STORIES, the spice in each story is not as graphic in todays publications, but this was hot stuff, for its time.Here's just a sample: - ""He plunged toward her, Me, I want something to bind the bargain, he panted, as he swept her into his arms in a bearlike, crushing embrace. His hands pawed at her shoulders. The roughness of his embrace burst the catches of the negligee, which slipped from her smooth shoulders"".This collection brings together Robert Leslie Bellem's entire output for Spicy Western Stories, plus a short biography of the author.With an introduction by Spur Award nominee James Reasoner.Cover art by Allen Anderson, a woman being grabbed by an outlaw in the back of a covered wagon.Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.TABLE OF CONTENTS: (Chapter, Title and Page Numbers)INTRODUCTION by James Reasoner --- 71.

"Black Dog Books presents ""HELL'S HOOFPRINTS: THE COMPLETE WESTERN TRAILS TALES OF LESTER DENT"" (Paperback) ~ by Lester Dent (Author), Gene Christie (Editor), Walter M. Baumhofer (Illustrator), Will Murray (Foreword)Dent was the originator of the Doc Savage series of books, a master of pulp fiction and real-life adventurer. His writing advice is specifically tailored to the pulp-era markets, but is surprisingly effective even today.If you don't have any Lester Dent books in your library, here is a good start with 'Complete Western Trails Tales of Lester Dent', you'll be glued to every page, the characters seem to jump out from the page ... Nobody can put sentences together like Lester Dent, as he pulls you into every chapter ... This Lester Dent Library Vol.3 - is a GOLD MINE in reading!As Will Murray states in his foreword - ""Most pulp Western writers of the Depression consisted of what some derisively called HUDSON RIVER COWBOYS - Eastern pulpsters who cribbed their knowledge of the west from movies and pulp magazines. Lester Dent was the real article, however. He could ride like an Indian and bagged his first antelope with a .22 rifle when he was just eight. And he knew the territory. As his wife Norma once put it, He was a WESTERNER.""One of the articles that caught my attention is RIDIN' SIGN, the character Skookum Charlie reads sign, it was a highly developed art in the days before telephones and automobiles came to the West. A sign rider was the Sherlock Holmes of the cow and mine country. A sign rider drew down good money for his work, Cowmen hired him to track rustlers. The U.S. government hired him to track Indians and outlaws.Entire book gives the reader the sign of the times, Dent rarely depicted a matine idol hero, but true 'Sons of the West' in all their raw, sunburned glory. sometimes the characters are unpleasant, repulsive - like Will Murray in his words, you decide if it was 'repulsive' or 'realistic'.Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.TABLE OF CONTENTS: (Chapter, Title and Page Numbers)Introduction by Will Murray --- 7Dusty Trant-Road Agent --- 11Gunslick Roundup --- 25The Sudden-Disaster Gent --- 38The Gun Quest --- 50Hell's Hoofprints --- 73Fear Ranch --- 86Trigger Trap --- 101The Devil's Ear --- 114Haunted Saddle --- 134Trickery Trail --- 148Frozen Phantom --- 161Snow Ghost (bonus story) --- 177Appendix A--A Bonus Silver Corporal storyDeath Cache --- 197Appendix B Articles--Hogleg Facts --- 213Ridin' Sign --- 216Bronc Twisting --- 218Cold Facts --- 224Appendix C--Letters to Western TrailsApril 1932 --- 229June 1932 --- 230June 1933 --- 231Appendix D--From Lester Dent's notebook-Story submission records --- 335Another great cover art by Walter Baumhofer, he was best known as the 'King of the Pulps', captured a pretty girl in a handsome man's arms as easily as he could grab readers with a pulp monster threatening the world ... and because of his talent, he was soon churning out crime, western, and thriller paintings. Some 550 pulp covers grace his resume ... Baumhofer captures the mood of the authors words.In closing, Black Dog Books have for over ten years, been publishing collections of rare and obscure fiction from the golden age of the pulp magazines (roughly 1920-1945). -- Great job from publisher Tom Roberts and his staff at in bringing forgotten series of characters and hard-to-find works from rare magazines -- great reading from those days gone by!When the gunsmoke clears, the dust from the trails settle ... you'll find Lester Dent & Western Trails Tales ...

"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""THE SILVER FLEET"" (1943) (88 min/B&W) -- Starring: Ralph Richardson, Googie Withers, Esmond Knight, Beresford Egan, Frederick Burtwell, Kathleen Byron, Willem Akkerman, Dorothy Gordon, Charles Victor, John LongdenDirected by: Vernon Campbell Sewell & Gordon Wellesley(VCI's slant on the synopsis)Set during the occupation of Holland during World War II, Ralph Richardson, in a very charismatic role, stars as the owner of a Dutch shipyard who pretends to collaborate with the Nazis in order to protect his wife and fellow workers. Inspired by the memory of the Dutch historical hero Piet Hein, he forms a complicated plan to double cross the Nazis and to sabotage the two submarines he's been ordered to build for them.The Silver Fleet a lesser known World War II film, but very well done with an excellent cast, great direction and a screenplay that has non-stop scenes loaded with tension. Ralph Richardson gives one of his best performances of his career.A truly rousing and patriotic WWII film, with an ending that is quite moving. This film has long been under appreciated.Special footnote: ~ Esmond Knight, who had lost an eye during the war, had not yet regained the use of his remaining eye when he played the role of Von Schiffer. Playing his part completely blind, there is only one scene when the audience can guess Knight's disability. It occurs quite briefly when Knight, about to go through a doorway, is gently steered through the door by a fellow actor.BIOS:1.

"Columbia Pictures presents ""ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS"" (1939) (121 min/B&W) -- Starring: Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Richard Barthelmess, Rita Hayworth & Thomas MitchellDirected by Howard HawksWhile waiting for her boat, Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur) stops at a small airport in South America. The pilots there deliver mail over a dangerous and usually foggy mountain pass. Geoff Carter (Cary Grant), the lead flyer, seems distant and cold as Bonnie tries to get closer to him. Things heat up as Judy MacPherson (Rita Hayworth), Geoff's old flame, shows up with her husband Bat MacPherson (Richard Barthelmess) who is an infamous pilot.Scripted by Jules Furthman from a story by Hawks, 'Only Angels Have Wings' is a treasure trove of terse, pithy dialogue: one favorite scene occurs when, upon discovering that he's about to die, Thomas Mitchell says he's often wondered how he'd react to imminent death-and, now that death is but a few moments away, he'd rather that no one else be around to witness his reaction.Good score by the great composer Dimitri Tiomkin.Special footnote: ~ Howard Hawks remembers: ""When the movie was released a certain critic said 'It's the only picture Hawks ever made that didn't have any truth in it.' I wrote him a letter and said, 'Every blooming thing in that movie was true.' I knew the men that were in it and everything about it. But it was just where truth was stranger than fiction.""BIOS:1.

"Warner Bros.-First National Pictures presents ""PERSUED"" (1947) (101 min/B&W) -- Starring: Robert Mitchum, Teresa Wright, Judith Anderson, Dean Jagger & Alan HaleDirected by Raoul WalshChased by a posse to a remote cabin, Jeb (Robert Mitchum) is joined by his fearful wife Thorley (Teresa Wright), awaiting the arrival of the men tracking them, as they try to reason out what has gone wrong in their lives. Jeb can't remember anything about his early childhood except for a horrible incident in which the people around him were killed by a mysterious stranger, whose flashing spurs were all the boy saw. He was raised by Ma Callum (Judith Anderson), alongside her two children, Thorley and Adam, as one of her own. But every time Jeb seemed poised to find peace, or even simple stability in his life, lurking nearby was Grant (Dean Jagger), a one-armed stranger who seemed bent on tormenting him.Jeb doesn't know who he really is, much less who Grant is, but Grant knows enough about him and is good enough at manipulating human nature to make Jeb a target for jealousy and murder. Making Jeb's life even more complicated is the fact that he and his adopted sister Thorley fell in love with each other, while Adam (John Rodney), his adopted brother, has come to hate him. The machinations around Jeb and Thorley come home to roost in multiple shootings and murder, a deadly chase and a long-planned lynching.A true western 'noir', one of Mitchum's best.Fans of Robert Mitchum's noir will be aware that this western noir has a ""companion piece"" namely Blood on the Moon (1948)Director Raoul Walsh opens the door to a new expressionism in the western, eventually taken over by Mann and Boetticher.BIOS:1.

"Universal Pictures presents ""GUN FOR A COWARD"" (1957) (86 min/Color) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring: Fred MacMurray, Jeffrey Hunter, Janice Rule, Chill Wills, Dean Stockwell & Iron Eyes CodyDirected by Abner BibermanHaving inherited a huge cattle ranch from his late father, Will Keough (Fred MacMurray) wants nothing more than to tend to his work and live in peace, but this is made impossible by the tense situation in his own household. Will's two younger brothers, Bless (Jeffrey Hunter) and Hade (Dean Stockwell), are as different as night and day: Bless, convinced that he was responsible for the death of his father, refuses to use a gun, and is thus branded a coward; conversely, Hade is wild and reckless, literally an accident waiting to happen. Exacerbating the situation is the brothers' grim and merciless mother (Josephine Hutchinson), who has instilled most of Bless' guilt feelings, and Will's sweetheart Aud Niven (Janice Rule), who finds herself drawn to the sensitive Bless. Ultimately, there will have to be a showdown...but who among the Keogh siblings will survive?Good cast, with some wonderful dialogue.Fred MacMurray shows why he is the versatile and good actor that he is.BIOS:1.

"BearManor Media presents ""KARLOFF AS: THE INVISIBLE MAN"" (Paperback), by Philip J Riley.Would have been interesting to see what Karloff would have done with this character.  Another great book in the series ""what if"", film scripts from those 'Golden Years of Horror', from those Universal monsters.  Karloff was announced to star in the Universal Exhibitor;s Book for 1932-33.  The final shooting script was completed by R.C. Sherriff in late December of 1932, who knew H.G. Wells.  Sherriff described the working condition at Universal Pictures during the writing of the screenplay, ""Universal was a boom town.  Everything was fresh and vigorous and light-hearted, and everything they touched was turning into gold"".  Karloff at this time refused to do the picture due to a salary dispute with Carl Laemmle Jr.One can only imagine hearing that distinctive Karloff lisp, what reaction the audience would have had, as opposed to Claude Rains, whose perfect diction was a plus when he was rambling on about people leaving him alone to find a serum to bring him back to visibility.  Sherriff's interpretation to the plot is the most similar to the author H.G. Wells'.Riley (author), states he interviewed the producers, directors, stars, cast and crew in thee early to late 1970s, they were recalling events that happened 35 to 45 years previous and sometimes memory fades or events are recalled from their perspective point of view.  The purpose of this series is the preservation of the art of writing for the screen.  Rare books have long been a source of enjoyments and an investment for the serious collector, and even in limited editions there are thousands printed.  Scripts, however, numbered only 50 at the most.In the history of American Literature, the screenwriter was being lost in time.  It is Riley's hope that his efforts bring about a renewed history and preservation of a great American Literary form - The Screenplay, by preserving them for study by future generations.Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.Stand up and take a bow, big thank you to Ben Ohmart and his staff, BearManor Media, a small press that publishes BIG books. They pride themselves on publishing quality entertainment biographies, so they often put out the first book on unique subjects -- plus specializing in books with nostalgic themes and keeping classic Hollywood alive not only thru his publishing house, but thru his own books.In closing, author Philip J Riley, has spent his life hunting this material down and interviewed many of the Universal crew (including Laemelle Jr) in the seventies. His eye for detail is impeccable, much so that your interest in his topic never sways from the target of what he's trying to give each and every collector --- food for thought.A must read ~ Highly recommend!Total Page: 292 Pages ~ BearManor Media #ISBN-13: 978-1593934835 ~ (October 31, 2011)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31QO8LJA0DDEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593934831#wasThisHelpful","R31QO8LJA0DDEL","A2A7NHE5HTK79N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A7NHE5HTK79N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Columbia Pictures presents ""FAIL-SAFE"" (1964) ~ (112 min/B&W) ~ Starring: Henry Fonda, Dan O'Herlihy, Walter Matthau, Frank Overton, Edward Binns, Larry Hagman & Fritz WeaverDirected by Sidney LumetBased on the novel by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler, Fail-Safe tells of what happens when a misguided transmission sends a squadron of bombers hurtling towards Russia, fully prepared to drop their atomic weaponry on Moscow. Air Force commander Frank Overton desperately tries to establish radio contact with the bombers, but once the pilots have passed the ""fail safe"" point, they've been instructed to disregard any reversal of orders. Racing against time, US President Henry Fonda, through his interpreter (Larry Hagman), informs the Russian premiere of the impending nuclear disaster. Working in concert with SAC, the Russians send up interceptors to shoot down the American bombers, while some of the planes run out of fuel and crash. Unfortunately, one aircraft, piloted by Edward Binns, manages to escape destruction and continues on its fatal mission.Special footnote: ~ Columbia Pictures produced both this movie and 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'. Director Stanley Kubrick insisted his movie be released first, and it was, in January 1964. When Fail-Safe was released, it garnered excellent reviews, but audiences found it unintentionally funny because of ""Strangelove"", and stayed away. Henry Fonda later said he would never have made this movie if he had seen ""Strangelove"" first, because he would have laughed too.BIOS:1.

"BearManor Media presents ""THE UNKNOWN PETER CUSHING"" (Paperback), by Michael G. McGlasson.The author McGlasson states within the introduction, Without a doubt, Peter Cushing was the quintessential screen villain and hero of horror cinema, due to his remarkable ability to express an entire range of human emotion while in character.  But off screen, Peter Cushing was one of the kindest and most compassionate human beings to ever walk the earth, at least in the opinion of the numerous actors and actresses that worked with him over a span of some fifty years.Peter was also completely devoted to his wife Helen, born Violet Helene Beck in 1905 in St. Petersburg, Russia, and likewise, she was utterly devoted to him.  It is beyond any doubt that Peter loved, if not adored his Helen with unbounded passion, much like Kharis, the high priest of Hammer's THE MUMMY whose ancient heart heart was filled with tenderness for the beautiful Princess Ananka.Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.TABLE OF CONTENTS: (Chapter, Title and Page Numbers)Dedication --- viiAcknowledgments --- ixIntroduction --- xiRogues, Vagabonds, and Scoundrels --- 1The Life and Times of Henry William Cushing --- 9Photo Gallery --- 35The Moon in June is Full of Beauty --- 49Helen: The Poetry of Her Presence --- 65Final Thoughts --- 77Endnotes --- 83Bibliography --- 93Index --- 103BIOS:Peter Cushing  [aka: Peter Wilton Cushing)Date of Birth:  26 May 1913 - Kenley, Surrey, England, UKDate of Death:  11 August 1994 - Canterbury, Kent, England, UKThank our lucky stars for Ben Ohmart and his staff, BearManor Media, a small press that publishes BIG books.

"20th Century Fox presents ""THE RETURN OF FRANK JAMES"" (1940) ~ (92 min/Color) ~ Starring: Henry Fonda, Gene Tierney, Jackie Cooper, Henry Hull, John Carradine & Donald MeekDirected by Fritz LangThis Technicolor sequel to Jesse James (1939) does without the services of the earlier film's star Tyrone Power, who after all was shot dead by that ""dirty little coward"" Bob Ford (John Carradine). Repeating his portrayal of western outlaw Frank James is Henry Fonda who has retired from his life of crime to become a peaceful farmer, though he has never given up his search for the treacherous Ford. The killer and his cohorts are eventually rounded up, but are pardoned due to political intervention. That's when Frank slaps on six-guns once more to seek his own form of justice. Featured in the cast is Henry Hull as Major Rufus Cobb, a crusading newspaperman and Jackie Cooper is Clem, the headstrong young sprout whom Frank has taken under his wing. Making her screen debut is Gene Tierney as Eleanor Stone a reporter from the East who wants to tell Frank's true story to the world.Special footnote: ~ The studio bought the rights to the James Brothers but changed the facts for entertainment. Although Frank surrendered 6 months after Jesse James' murder, both Ford brothers were already dead and Frank had nothing to do with their deaths ~ The original treatment had Frank romantically interested in the reporter played by Gene Tierney, but the studio became fearful of a possible lawsuit by Frank's widow and/or son, so it was eliminated from the script.BIOS:1.

"20th Century Fox presents ""JESSE JAMES"" (1939) ~ (106 min/Color) ~ Starring: Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Nancy Kelly, Randolph Scott, Henry Hull, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell & Donald MeekDirected by Henry KingIrresistibly entertaining story of Jesse (Tyrone Power) and Frank James (Henry Fonda) becoming train and bank robbers to avenge the death of their mother killed at the behest of greedy railroad interests.Director Henry King stages the action sequences in glorious outsize fashion, notably the famous bank-robbery scene in which Jesse rides his horse through a plate glass window. The scenes involving both James brothers are stolen hands-down by Henry Fonda, not so much because he was a better actor than Tyrone Power but because his character had all the best lines. Jesse James was filmed largely on location in Missouri.Even though Randolph Scott is not the star here but he has a pivotal role as Marshall Will Wright, this would be the success to his lasting and legendary legacy.Then came the sequel!

"20th Century Fox presents ""DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK"" (1939) ~ (104 min/Color) ~ Starring: Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert, Edna May Oliver, Eddie Collins, John Carradine, Jessie Ralph, Ward BondDirected by John FordGilbert and Lana Martin (Henry Fonda & Claudette Colbert) are a young couple trying to make a home in New York State's Mohawk Valley, but repeated attacks by Indians drive them, along with other settlers in the valley, into a nearby fort, where they watch helplessly as the natives lay waste to their farms and cabins. A spinster with a large farm, Sarah McKlennar (Edna May Oliver), comes to their rescue when she hires Gilbert to work as a field hand and gives the Martins a place to stay. The rugged life of the farm and frontier doesn't always sit well with Lana, who was raised in wealthy and comfortable circumstances - but in time she develops a thicker skin and learns to love their new life in the Mohawk Valley, especially after giving birth to their first son. Gilbert joins the militia, who must do battle both with the local Indian tribes and the British soldiers who are provoking them to battle. Gilbert returns wounded, and as he recuperates, a healthy crop rises in the fields, but their satisfaction is short lived when the Indians once again hit the warpath.Oscar Nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Edna May Oliver) & Best Color Cinematography1939 was a big year at the Academy Awards ceremony for director par-excellence John Ford, as he also garnered a nomination for Best Director for Stagecoach (1939)BIOS:1.

"BearManor Media presents ""LEE VAN CLEEF: BEST OF THE BAD"" (Paperback), by Michael G. McGlasson (Author), Mike Malloy (Foreword)The opening foreword of this book by Mike Malloy, completely grabs you:  ""Antihero, This word gets thrown around a lot when describing the protagonists occupying the cruel, ruthless world of the Italian made spaghetti westerns of the 1960s and 1970s, where the only difference between the (alleged) Good Guys and the (extreme) Bad Guys is that the former limits their killing to the latter.  So naturally ""antihero"" is usually the label bestowed upon the spaghetti western roles of Lee Van Cleef, who was easily one of the genre's biggest and most iconic stars"".We that being said, Van Cleef's character or persona evolves into this hero right before our very eyes, which became a standard formula in some of the best spaghettis...with the exception of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966).  In most cases abandons the self interests quest for revenge or payback, switches to aiding the young man in finding closure in the film DEATH RIDES A HORSE (1967).Agree with Mike Malloy, Van Cleef depicts heroism with such a perfect world weariness that he never comes off as a stuffy, straight laced, goody two shoes protagonists...Cleef's western performances are obviously timeless, with all of his performances on television as a filler badman or character actor in the vast cast of players...feel his short time in the business left a mark from his career, that of a HERO, who played the part with feeling and truism.Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.TABLE OF CONTENTS: (Chapter, Title and Page Numbers)Acknowledgments --- 1Foreword: ""A Good Guy, After All"" by Mike Malloy --- 2Introduction --- 8The Extraordinary Life of Lee Van Cleef --- 14The Mythic Archtype of the Villain --- 33The Gunfighter and the Bounty Hunter:Fact vs. Fiction --- 39The Guns of Lee Van Cleef --- 48Portrait Gallery --- 56The Gunmen:Colonel Douglas Mortimer: Vengeance Is Mine ---61Angel Eyes: 200,000 Reasons To Kill --- 64Frank Talby: A Man Without A Conscience --- 66Fade Out: The Legacy of Lee Van Cleef --- 71Bibliography --- 77Index --- 81BIOS:Lee Van Cleef  [aka: Clarence Leroy Van Cleef Jr.]Date of Birth:  9 January 1925 - Somerville, New JerseyDate of Death:  16 December 1989 - Oxnard, CaliforniaBearManor Media, a small press that publishes BIG books.

Voice acting is quite good pulling panels and pages and inserting into this animated movie.Being a fan of animation regardless if DC or Marvel, love when each reintroduces characters from the GOLDEN AGE OF COMICS.  Film was quite good considering the area it must cover in this 76 minute adaptation, just couldn't fit the entire novel. cause they only have so much time.Superman shows he's just as smart as Lex, which in some comics it is not shown...good to see it in this story.  You can see that he connects with the rest of the world, showing why Superman is so well received on this planet.

"DC Comics presents ""SECRET ORIGIN: THE STORY OF DC COMICS"", this is obviously a 75th birthday celebration in the form of a 90 minute documentary approved by the top brass of DC Comics itself.  Great men and women who are keeping alive this medium and bringing in new and extraordinary things for all of us fans to enjoy.Being a fan of comics books, love both DC and Marvel, very happy with any documentary letting me into their world...expect Marvel would or has done the same thing.  Believe we should all let this organization have their day in the sun.As a collector, I would still purchase this DVD,  However, mostly to see some of the rare archival footage and newly recorded interviews with comics veterans.  As one reviewer pointed out...Stan Lee built a career out of misrepresenting himself to the unknowing public.  So what's the problem with some other reviewers on this DVD release!That's part of the ""Schtick"", (is a Yiddish term meaning, a contrived and often used bit of business that a performer uses to steal attention), plus we enjoyed the storytelling and artwork of DC, took us out of everyday life, into a world of adventure through the days of GOLDEN AGE, SILVER AGE COMICS and THE BRONZE AGE, which reinvented itself over and over again.No special features, this is a downer, but not necessarily a lost cause for the DVD...if you're a hardcore collector and fan, this is a must have for your every growing collection....very much recommend.For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.Mr. Jim's Ratings:Quality of Picture & Sound: 4 StarsPerformance: 4 StarsStory & Screenplay: 4 StarsOverall: 4 Stars [Original Music, Cinematography & Film Editing]Total Time: 90 min on DVD ~ DC Comics/Warner Bros.

"Dark Horse Comics presents ""CREEPY ARCHIVES VOL.FOUR HC"" [Hardcover], Creepy originals #16-20 (1967) ~ Dark Horse has put together some true classics with an all-star lineup of storytellers and illustrators...started collecting 'Creepy' and Eerie Archives, which I own the originals and was also involved in the fan club roster.Covers by Frank Frazetta (cover #16 & 17), Albert Nuetzell (cover #20) and Vic Prezio (cover #18 & 19) each cover an original. Plus Neal Adams, Dan Adkins, Roger Brand, Gene Colan, Hector Castellon, Johnny Craig, Reed Crandall, Steve Ditko, Frank Frazetta, Archie Goodwin, Jerry Grandenetti, Jeff Jones, Gil Kane, Roy G.

Inside the issue story by Archie Goodwin and artwork by Neal Adams, as we join them in a haunted journey into illustrated terror and suspense, which is a fantastic combination.  A hunter uncovers a curse in cat's clothing.Haunted fear and sheer terror illustrated by Frazetta on cover #17, inside story by Archie Goodwin and art by Donald Norman, outside the raging thunderstorm...within a frightened and helpless girl wanders through cold stone corridors haunted by a blood drenched legend, we call HERITAGE OF HORROR.Script by Ron White and artwork by Roger Brand in MOUNTAIN OF THE MONSTER GODS, surely no human hand carved these grotesque figures, but if not human who?

Instead, Dark Horse chose to simply reference their position in the previous volumes. This is too bad. Better, I think, to publish all the issues intact and not presume that readers will have access to the earlier books"". ---- Most assuredly agree with this reviewer and any changes that were not in the originals --- Dark Horse, don't ruin a good thing!For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.Highly recommend ~ another winner from Warren and Dark Horse, they just keep getting better.Total Page: 240 Pages ~ Dark Horse Comics #ISBN-13: 978-1595823083 ~ (August 4, 2009)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIZTQ79ZRI4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595823085#wasThisHelpful","R2SIZTQ79ZRI4E","A2A7NHE5HTK79N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A7NHE5HTK79N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Meanwhile, Mundson reveals to Farrell that his primary business is control of an international tungsten cartel that he plans to use to further his fascist ends.Great tight tense script, direction and cast makes an all-time classic noir, but it's George Macready who gives such an icy cold character  performance, that when he's on the screen nobody else seems to be there, even though Hayworth and Ford are steaming up the cameras with their hot steaming scenes.* Special footnote: ~ Rita Hayworth had to wear a corset while shooting ""Put the Blame on Mame,"" as she gave birth to her first daughter, Rebecca, months before filming ~ In the scene where Gilda is brought back to Argentina by Tom, she slaps Johnny hard across both sides of his face.

"Dark Horse Comics presents ""CREEPY ARCHIVES VOL.THREE HC"" [Hardcover], Creepy originals #11-15 ~ Dark Horse has put together some true classics with an all-star lineup of storytellers and illustrators...started collecting 'Creepy' and Eerie Archives, which I own the originals and was also involved in the fan club roster.Covers by Frank Frazetta (covers #11, 12 & 15) and Gray Morrow (covers #13 & 14) each cover an original.

All they get is ANTS IN THE PANTS...among other places"".As one of my fellow-reviewers points out, Steve Ditko stories in particular present wonderfully-the art jumps out of each panel and at you on this paper!  You see why Ditko was such a force in ""Comic Book History"", he has a place of honor ready for him.  And the other reviewer is right on with the statement Adam Link Series is outdated...I did like the previous Creepy Archive Vol.Two stories involving Link...believe they've run out of fresh ideas.For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.Highly recommend ~ another winner from Warren and Dark Horse.Total Page: 240 Pages ~ Dark Horse Comics #ISBN-13: 978-1595822598 ~ (May 20, 2009)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FROWMGP4CCR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595822593#wasThisHelpful","R3FROWMGP4CCR7","A2A7NHE5HTK79N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A7NHE5HTK79N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Warren had set down his own code. We would show no blood and gore. Nothing that would bring the Comics Code Authority knocking at his front door.

"Columbia Pictures presents ""THE BIG HEAT"" (1953) - (90 min/B&W) -- Starring: Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame, Lee Marvin, Carolyn Jones & Alexander ScourbyDirected by Fritz LangThe Big Heat is director Fritz Lang's landmark bleak, film noir crime classic and violent melodrama. Lang's characteristic expressionistic lighting, use of sets and decor, and costuming sharply reflected the personality traits of the film's major characters. The sparse screenplay of a story laced with revenge, murder, and hate was written by former crime reporter Sidney Boehm and based on a Saturday Evening Post serial and the hard-hitting, brutal 1952 novel by William P. McGivern. The film's title referred to the enforcement crack-down on lawlessness and illegal activities.Its an uncompromising and grim story of an iron-willed, driven, dedicated, honest, incorruptible homicide detective within a crooked and perverted society and corrupt system at all levels (e.g., the mob, the commissioner, the police, and everyday citizens), and the enormous price that is paid to find justice. The crusading, vigilante rogue cop/hero must erode his idealistic, law-abiding principles when he resorts to the unlawful tactics of the hoodlums after the tragic murder of his young wife by sadistic, viperous gang members led by a big-time crime boss. He enlists the help of one of the gangs' molls in order to seek revenge.Lang & Ford combined again for Human Desire (1954)Special footnote: -- When Lee Marvin first sees Glenn Ford face to face, the music in the background is ""Put the Blame on Mame,"" a reference to Ford's performance in Gilda ~~~ Columbia wanted to borrow Marilyn Monroe from 20th Century Fox to play the role of Debby Marsh, but Fox's asking price was too high. Gloria Grahame was cast instead.BIOS:1.

"Dark Horse Comics presents ""EERIE ARCHIVES VOL.1 HC"" [Hardcover], Have collected the 'Creepy' Archives from Dark Horse, am now getting into the 'EERIE' zone of the Warren Publishing phenomena of the 1960s.Take note as one reviewer commented the first Eerie is simply a reprint of three stories that previously appeared in a Creepy magazine, those who have purchased 'Creepy Archives Vol. 2' may not care for this, Dark Horse wanted to keep this accurate and clean, I'm not disappointed in their decision.  The stories and artwork are fabulous.  Archie Goodwin has to be one of the most talented writers on the planet, and Warren Publishing, don't ever lose him, he's your ticket to some of the success you've been having.Cousin Eerie doesn't disappoint with at the helm, James Warren (publisher), Archie Goodwin (editor), Frank Frazetta (covers), Ben Oda (lettering), Eando Binder, E. Nelson Bridwell, Eugene Colan, Reed Crandall, Jack Davis, Steve Ditko, Frank Frazetta, Archie Goodwin, Roy G. Krenkel, Larry Ivie, Rocco Mastroserio, Gray Morrow, Joe Orlando, John Severin, Jay Taycee, Angelo Torres, Alex Toth, Al Williamson and Wally Wood (staff) - an all-star line up sure to hit a home run every time.The bull-pen above is only a hint at the kind of HORRORIFFIC HAPPENINGS in the first and future issues of this GHOULISH GAZETTE, hosted by COUSIN EERIE.  He's taken the CREEPY COLLECTION of artists and writers, and brewed a monstrous mixture of TERROR TALES to keep you on the edge of your seat (if you're not hiding under it).  FEAR FANCIERS will want to avoid missing the future fright in sight, by surfing the Amazon sites for EERIE the CREEPY HOME COMPANION.For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.* Special footnote: -- One of the top Eerie artists is Reed Crandall, who has worked for most of the top names in comics.  He achieved recognition for his art on Quality Comics ""Blackhawk"" series and his many more contributions for EC COMICS.  He has been a major artist in the early years for Warren Publishing, creating some of their most moody and dramatic tales.  His accomplished use of fine line shading gave these stories an almost Gothic quality.  The feeling of studied realism he's created gives his horror stories believability.  They are both frightening and memorable.Superb, terrific, fabulous, magnificent, excellent, gorgeous, sumptuous, beautiful, stunning, and even GOOD!  These are the words in describing this Eerie release, only because I can't find other words to fill in the gaps.  The writers keep you horrified and they dream up some of the best plots ever put on paper.In  closing -- Here is a poem from the ""poison pen"" letter section:""Eerie, Eerie, kind of dreary,What is your monsters' food?With ghouls and vampires, werewolves and witches,All in a killing mood""!Highly recommend, to bring back those memories, you never really forgot....Total Page: 240 Pages ~ Dark Horse Comics #ISBN-13: 978-1595822451 ~ (March 10, 2009)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T6HRROX8VWVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595822453#wasThisHelpful","R3T6HRROX8VWVE","A2A7NHE5HTK79N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A7NHE5HTK79N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark Horse Comics presents ""CREEPY ARCHIVES VOL.1 HC"" [Hardcover], Now it all comes back to me. I was already collecting 'Famous Monsters of Filmland' magazines, saw the ads of coming attractions. A new title on the horizon 'Creepy Magazine' gathered some of the best on their debut outing - Jim Warren (publisher), Russ Jones (editor), Archie Goodwin, Joe Orlando (story ideas), Ben Oda (lettering), many of the previous EC Comics team brought their talents to the forefront with embellisher's such as - Reed Crandall, Jack Davis, George Evans, Frank Frazetta, Roy Krenkel, Bob Lubbers, Gray Morrow, Joe Orlando, Alex Toth, Maurice Whitman, Al McWilliams, Al Williamson, and Angelo Torres, illustrations and storyline within 6 - 8 pages in length for your perverted enjoyment.Remember when our host Uncle Creepy came into the lives of all the comic book fans, not since ECs horror years had we been this excited.  This first installment brings on vampires, werewolves and zombies - just the perfect ingredients for scaring the pants off of you, all the time craving for more and the next issues to follow.Nothing like this was on the newsstands to compete, Jim Warren and his staff had outdone themselves, as the pages of the first five stories will attest, but not to worry it even gets better in the coming issues.  Dark Horse has maintained the magazines size as to the original with perfection, left in the original ads and letters for your reading pleasure.For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.Special footnote: -- The greatest comic artists in the world bring you...tales of suspense, horror, mystery, the unknown and the weird.  As mentioned by several other reviewers. The reproductions are outstanding, the artwork and stories are at the top of their game. The Frazetta covers are mesmerizing - Now that Dark Horse has our attention, open the doors and let the issues flow, in chronological order, please!In closing - It is only natural to associate 'Creepy' with EC Comic group, definitely feel the artwork is better than EC's, with Creepy's own Gray Morrow, Angelo Torres and Bob Lubbers - What is considerably more important is the fact that the stories are in black and white, allowing an amount of shading undreamed of with colors, Frank Frazetta, Joe Orlando and Gray Morrow take full advantage and give class to their work...Here's to the success of Dark Horse and Creepy, may they keep the fans in complete horror!Total Page: 240 Pages ~ Dark Horse Comics #ISBN-13: 978-1593079734 ~ (August 19, 2008)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQFDC5AOJF49H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593079737#wasThisHelpful","RQFDC5AOJF49H","A2A7NHE5HTK79N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A7NHE5HTK79N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dynamite Entertainment presents ""VAMPIRELLA ARCHIVES VOL.1 HC"" [Hardcover], Back in the day we had James Warren (publisher), Bill Parente (editor), Frank Frazetta (cover), Neal Adams, Ernie Colon, Reed Crandall, Billy Graham, Mike Royer, Tom Sutton, Tony Tallarico (appearing artists), Nicoli Cuti, Forrest J. Ackerman, Don Glut (appearing writers) - those are just some of the personnel from the first issue of Vampirella.Warren Publishing ran into a bad period in the late 60s.  Badly in need of a hit, Jim Warren struck gold in 1969, with the advent of their most popular character, VAMPIRELLA.  Warren had an idea of a woman character in mind, with sketches on my notebook met with Frank Frazetta, Forry Ackerman, and Trina Robbins in my office and enough energy left for a game winning home run.  Chose Forry as my writer, his first love was science fiction, we both had seen BARBARELLA and loved it ... Warren carefully outlined what he wanted done, a modern day setting but something mystique of vampires, Transylvania and something legendary - and VAMPIRELLA was born.The formula was horror and sex!  Good American sex, there it is a sexy babe on the first cover...standing there with a modern setting, Sexy, but not naked or bare breasted, her colors were bright red for excitement and pitch black for mystery ... along with great writing and outstanding illustrations, Warren had another winner.Reading the advertisement in the Warren issues of 'CREEPY' and 'EERIE' and the coming of captivating comics about fantastic females - ""Look Out! She's waiting inside this first collector's edition ... for you!!""  Illustrated tales to bewitch & bedevil you.On the inside cover as she stands before you with a red backdrop - ""Hi, there!  Welcome to the coolest girl-meets-ghoul mag on the market.  My name's VAMPIRELLA!  I'm the newest thing in comic magazines!  And if you take me home with you, YOU can call me...VAMPI (that's if I don't call you first).  I've put out the call to all the Creepiest Eeriest artists in the country (and you know what country:TRANSYLVANIA... And it'll be a BLOODY pity if anyone in the whole wide world doesn't get the word about this way-out mag of fantastic females!  My AMAZING ADVENTURES explode here exclusively every issue and in addition you get half a dozen other sock-it-to-you SHOCKERS for gals and guys who're wise to the best in BEWITCHING COMICS!  What more do you want - BLOOD?  You got it!...COME WITH ME....Special footnote: -- As mentioned by several other reviewers. There are seven issues instead of five, the quality seems good enough.

"United Artists  presents ""STAGECOACH"" (1939) - (96 min/B&W) -- Starring: Claire Trevor, John Wayne, Andy Devine, John Carradine & Thomas MitchellDirected by John FordDirector John Ford combined action, drama, humor, and well-drawn characters in the story of a stagecoach set to leave Tonto, New Mexico for a distant settlement in Lordsburg, with a diverse group of passengers on board. Dallas is a woman with a scandalous past who has been driven out of town by the high-minded ladies of the community. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) is the wife of a cavalry officer stationed in Lordsburg, and she's determined to be with him. Hatfield (John Carradine) is a smooth-talking cardsharp who claims to be along to ""protect"" Lucy, although he seems to have romantic intentions. Dr. Boone (Thomas Mitchell) is a self-styled philosopher, a drunkard, and a physician who's been stripped of his license. Mr. Peacock (Donald Meek) is a slightly nervous whiskey salesman. Gatewood (Berton Churchill) is a crooked banker who needs to get out of town. Buck (Andy Devine) is the hayseed stage driver, and Sheriff Curley Wilcox (George Bancroft) is along to offer protection and keep an eye peeled for the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), a well-known outlaw who has just broken out of jail. While Wilcox does find Ringo, a principled man who gives himself up without a fight, the real danger lies farther down the trail, where a band of Apaches, led by Geronimo, could attack at any time.Stagecoach offers plenty of cowboys, Indians, shootouts, and chases, aided by Yakima Canutt's remarkable stunt work and Bert Glennon's majestic photography of Ford's beloved Monument Valley. It also offers a strong screenplay by Dudley Nichols with plenty of room for the cast to show its stuff. John Wayne's performance made him a star after years as a B-Western leading man, and Thomas Mitchell won an Oscar for what could have been just another comic relief role. Thousands of films have followed Stagecoach's path, but none have ever improved on its formula.Although there were Westerns before it, Stagecoach quickly became a template for all movie Westerns to shoot for.Oscar Winner for Best Supporting Actor (Thomas Mitchell) & Best Music Scoring.Oscar Nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (John Ford), Best Cinematography (Black & White), Art Direction & EditingJohn Wayne: The Duke - one of the most recognizable people on the planet - a true mega-star in film* Special footnote: -- John Ford's first sound Western, and his first in that genre in 13 years. Westerns had fallen out favor with the coming of sound, as it was tricky to record on location.  This was the first of many films that John Ford filmed in Monument Valley, Arizona. Others were: My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Wagon Master, Rio Grande, The Searchers, Sergeant Rutledge and his last western, Cheyenne Autumn.** Asked why, in the climactic chase scene, the Indians didn't simply shoot the horses to stop the stagecoach, director John Ford replied, ""Because that would have been the end of the movie.""BIOS:1.

"TwoMorrows Publishing presents ""THE WARREN COMPANION"" [Hardcover] [Deluxe Edition], edited by Welsh comics artists and historian David A. Roach and CBA editor Jon B. Cooke, this is the definitive and fully authorized book celebrating and examining the underrated Warren Publications, a must have for any serious comic book fan.Was quite young when the legendary horror movie magazine 'Famous Monsters of Filmland' hit the newsstands, Warren Publications suddenly took the comic world by storm. Six years later in 1965 CREEPY #1 stunned, delighted and terrified its young readers.  They were filled with compelling tales of terror exquisitely illustrated by many of the best artists of the day.  The magazine proved to be just the tip of the iceberg of horror.As Warren Publishing went on to produce some of the finest comic book stories in the history of the genre.  In the pages of CREEPY, EERIE, VAMPIRELLA, BLAZING COMBAT, HELP!, THE SPIRIT, COMIX INTERNATIONAL, 1984, THE ROOK and many more, readers discovered extraordinary artists and writers coming together to create more extraordinary work.  Sadly to say in 1983 the company suddenly disappeared from the planet.In 1999, Comic Book Artist magazine published the most comprehensive history of the oft-neglected company to date in its Eisner Award winning fourth issue.  But, until now, the riveting story of Warren Publishing was incomplete.In addition to reprinting the contents of CBA #4, this volume contains many new interviews, features, articles, and the most comprehensive and exhaustive checklist ever complied on Warren Publishing's incredible output.For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.* 'FEATURES INCLUDE' *1.

"BearManor Media presents ""THE TELEVISION SCRIPTS OF PHILIP RAPP"" (Paperback), by Philip Rapp (Author) editor's note by Ben Ohmart.Editor Ohmart is somewhat an authority on the brilliant writings of Philip Rapp, mostly THE BICKERSONS, which also is a love of mine. But as Ohmart remarks - ""Rapp was a deeply funny and prolific writer who deserves to be remembered as more than the creator of THE BICKERSONS --- This book should do"".Within the pages of this little gem, 'Deputy Seraph' (1959) featuring the Marx Brothers with Chico and Harpo as a pair of angels and Groucho as Deputy Seraph. About the same time, 'Joan of Arkansas', starring Joan Davis (was as funny as Lucille Ball) who is featured in an interesting role of a 'dental assistant', which didn't fly, wish it would have made it, sounds like a winner for todays sitcom reruns.  Now we have the final entry as the pilot 'Squeegee' which the great comedian Ben Blue was the star, never saw the light of day, and did not make it.Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.TABLE OF CONTENTS: (Chapter, Title and Page Numbers)Editor's Note --- 1Deputy Seraph (starring the Marx Brothers) --- 3Joan of Arkansas (starring Joan Davis) --- 61Squeegee (starring Ben Blue) --- 115Big thank you to Ben Ohmart and his staff at BearManor Media, a small press that publishes BIG books.

"BearManor Media presents ""THE BICKERSONS SCRIPTS VOL.2"" (Paperback), by Philip Rapp (Author) with a foreword by Marsha Hunt and edited by Ben Ohmart.In the editor's notes: - ""The first time THE BICKERSONS was up for its own half hour series (1948), a special pilot was written, and is printed here for the first time.  Perhaps the most surprising inclusions are the radio commercial scripts.  Few people today realize that THE BICKERSONS were kept busy well into the 1970s when Don Ameche and Frances Langford pitched everything from General Motors air conditioning to Coffee Rich.  The 30- and 60- second spots were funny and popular, and proved to be an admirable swan song to a beloved creation"".* Special footnote: -- Ben Ohmart as before, has captured the historical accuracy and true spirit of the original scripts complete with formatting.  Once again you'll rediscover all the bad cooking, bourbon and of course snoring you can handle.  If you're a fan or not, this book will give you ""the chuckles"", from page to page.

"I got this compact for $1 off of the ELF website. It features a big mirror and 4 pans that also fit MAC eyeshadows. It is compact and super-sturdy. I have 5 of these and I have traveled with them extensively and never had any issues. A great product at an amazing price, highly recommended!I have all the eyeshadow colors and I really like them. They are pigmented and they blend nicely. They are nice smooth shadows and the color selection is very tasteful as well. I am a big fan of the customizable compact concept: you can pick and choose 4 of these shadows and pack them in your bag. This is what I use when I want to do a quick look on the go and they haven't disappointed me in any of the airports I've used them so far. With a primer, they don't crease. The only con is that they are a bit powdery so your palette may get a bit messy if you don't blow on it every once in a while, but I like that they do not go on chalky at all. And each shadow retails for just $1 on the ELF website - I think they're a great deal, something of a hidden gem of the drugstore. The only question is which 4 shades exactly are you getting with this bundle?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUDUYTOA05Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009PK8Q0W#wasThisHelpful","RSUDUYTOA05Y","A3LJLRIZL38GG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LJLRIZL38GG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I've been a fan of ELF products for some time, I have shied away from trying this one thinking that it couldn't possibly be good for just $1 (on the ELF website/Target).

"Great, bright night light for no night time fright. Phew, say that ten times fast. But seriously, kids love this light - it is much brighter than the Maxxima MLN-50 Light but does tend to get a but more light up in your face. It's in the design of the angle of the light. Kids don't seem to mind this at all though.We recently traveled with this and all three kids were comfortable with just this light and stayed in the second bedroom, leaving quiet nights of sleep for parents. Five stars for this alone. Also, this was great for travel due to the light weight (much lighter than other emergency, plug-in we have) and the plug rotates into the base. Plus you can get even more light with the three-LED switch. Notably, you can illumate both the single and three LEDs at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15D6TCY2A66MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SVJED2#wasThisHelpful","R15D6TCY2A66MF","A32V4TT1ZJVY2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32V4TT1ZJVY2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We purchased three of these in various colors for our kids to carry their own water during hikes. Sizing was perfect for modest sized water bottles - we used various 12-24 ounce Contigo, thermos, and other bottles, plastic disposable up to 1.25L (42 oz) although this size was a bit difficult to get in/out of the holder. I would also note that silicon wrapped bottles are easy to insert, but cause the holder to flip inside out when removed. IT's easy enough to put back in place, but this would get cumbersome during a hike. The entire holder, including straps, are made from neoprene and you can adjust the sizing to meet almost anyone's requirements. We had no issues with using this with out kids ranged 5-9 (and they are on the shorter side for their ages). With the youngest, we adjusted the strap to the shortest and tied a knot on the top strap to shorten it even further. The knot sat behind and was totally out of the way and unnoticed during use (after the initial complaints about why it had to look different).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Z4H5OPUIUBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VA9510#wasThisHelpful","R35Z4H5OPUIUBJ","A32V4TT1ZJVY2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32V4TT1ZJVY2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Items does run big. I typically wear a M/L in golf gloves and found the Medium Akona to be perfect in finger length, but broad around the hands and fingers. There is no stretch to the gloves. The strap helps mitigate this quite a bit. I found the gloves accumulate a lot of sand in the fingers. This must be due to the nylon backing. The backing is a positive though in terms of drying time. Traction was good pushing off rocks and I found the level of protection adequate for snorkeling, even with sharp rocks.

"I'm a long-time Swedish goggle user (the kind with no padding). I tried these out for a recent vacation and loved the improved visibility. I did find the product bulky when trying to swim laps - particularity when pushing off walls, but never had an issue with them falling off. The suction is very strong to the face / eye socket.

"We used this product during a recent family trip and found it useful in repelling mosquitoes. It seems to work well for about one hour, but not if you get wet. Sweat seems to be ok if you don't touch the skin. We found ourselves (kids included) reapplying the product hourly during a longer hike. We were using another essential oil mix (DoTerra with Witchhazel) but switched to this for convenience and better effect. This did not leave the skin as oily.I highly recommend that you do not loose the inside cap (there are two caps) to prevent leaking. No issues to irritation or painful skin contact despite several days use in a row. Application is white cream, but rubs in clear very quickly. Needs to be appied liberally. Scent is strong, floral but ok for a man; dissipates quickly to a lower level, but scent does not go away completely.

"Excellent disposal - much better than the aging 1/2 hp Badger 5. Granted the Badger 5 was older, but the Waste King is much faster and quieter than the Badger. It was well worth the upgrade.Instructions were very good. Although, in marketing materials and instructions they assume you know the difference between EZ Mount (Waste King) vs. 3-Bolt (Badger). Now you know that unless you have an EZ Mount, you will need to replace the entire mounting system when switching disposal units.Installation was simple once I figured out that I had to disassemble the entire unit from my sink (see above). Note, I have a Corian sink. The only things you may need to purchase that was not included is a screwdriver, wrench, and plumber's putty.The Waste King unit itself is much larger than the Badger - the girth is enough that we have to fit in one of our two trash bins sideways.

Also, the only round ball is the soccer ball - the baseball and basketball are round/square-ish. Not ideal if you are looking to use these with an indoor basketball hoop.

"So this was a tough one for me to rate. I like the Niagara Sava Spa 1.75 but my wife does not. This comes down to personal preference regarding water flow.We switched one shower to the Niagara earth massage 2.0 and did not feel much difference (in a good way) vs. the 2.5 gpm standard showerhead we had previously. I thought I would try to go down a bit further to 1.75 gpm in the second shower. I like the coverage of this showerhead, but my wife does not like the lower flow. The combination of the lower flow (1.75 vs. 2.0) and wider coverage make this feel like the flow is not sufficient for her.Beyond preference, the showerhead is a very high quality product - exactly what I would expect from Niagara. It has a fine appearance and installed perfectly into our shower.

Normally, I would say something negative about a product that breaks before it's intended live, but hey, the phone was protected and the case did it's job. Can't ask for more. Upgrade to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is a very minimal cover for the DROID Ultra. My wife was concerned about the larger size of this phone (compared to her last Android phone) so she wanted a less bulky cover. This cover has a very nice, high quality feel, very bright color (pink) and fits her Ultra very well. The button slots line up well and provide the necessary space for the buttons to work properly. The only negative is the top and bottom of the phone are not completely covered and are thus exposed if the phone was to call on an edge just right.

"***Update***After not a whole lot of use (I used these only for travel, perhaps 8-10 times over the course of approx one year) the shoes developed a tear in the heal strap. When I say developed a tear - I mean they tore completely off. I liked the fit and the convenience, but can no longer recommend this shoe due to lack of arability. I ended up getting the New Balance Men's MX20v3 Minimus Cross-Training Shoe as a replacement and like it much more.***Original Review***I'll start by saying that I am not a runner. I do occasionally jog (especially while traveling) if I can not get to a gym to swim. I do, however, use the gym frequently and love to continue my routine while traveling. Often times though, I find myself on week long or longer business trips and am forced to not pack shoes to exercise of use a hotel (or local) gym. I have been searching for a very lightweight and minimal shoe to pack for these occasions. The Hattori fits this need very well. I like the flat heel, light weight, minimal profile (even lighter and flatter than Five Finger shoes) and strap (the attachment to the foot is very good). So far the construction has held up (in a few months of use), although I am concerned that long term these do not feel like the most durable shoes, from a construction standpoint. One point here is, as others have mentioned, these shoes do run small. I purchased my typical shoe size and it fits, but my toes exert more pressure on the top material than I prefer. If the shoes were to break down, it will be near the toe bed. All-in-all, very good shoe for travel and I would recommend to others.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PL463EDSAX32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004O2AOK6#wasThisHelpful","R3PL463EDSAX32","A32V4TT1ZJVY2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32V4TT1ZJVY2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The criteria are very easy to understand (the easiest of the 4 Top Trump games we have) and the statistics are easily compared between characters (for example, we had difficulty with the Transformer game due to the comparisons of Transformers to humans).The cards are durable. There are 30 characters and five criteria (some Top Trump games have six). The criteria are: Size, IQ, Popularity, Eyes, and Scream Can Rating. They each have different value ranges so it adds to the difficulty for the younger children - they tend to focus on one or two criteria.Each game takes about ~10-15 minutes. The game is reasonable entertaining to play a few rounds with the kids - after that it gets a bit dull for adults. Kids can play for hours. We have introduced variations to the game such random selection of cards, strategic card selection, varied number of cards, leaving cards in the middle and randomly selecting them as a tie-breaker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBZ7NQF5KOV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8D30K8#wasThisHelpful","R1XBZ7NQF5KOV8","A32V4TT1ZJVY2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32V4TT1ZJVY2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun game and easy to understand. Compared to the other Top Trump card games, this set has very realistic head shots of the Horses and Ponies, very easy to understand criteria and very comparable statistics (meaning it does not seem like you are comparing apples to oranges so to speak) (for example, we had difficulty with the Transformer game due to the comparisons of Transformers to humans).The cards are durable.

They each have different value ranges so it adds to the difficulty for the younger children. I am no expert on horses, but I found the characters to be well represented insofar as we are able to make clear comparisons. I also appreciated that there is a flag designating the country of origin for each horse/pony, as well as a brief description of their background. The only con I found is that the type face is a bit smaller than with the other Top Trump games (I think due to the space taken up by the descriptions).Each game takes about ~10-15 minutes.

"My daughter is getting ready to take the PSAT this fall.  She was so relieved to receive this study guide, because she was experiencing a bit of that old ""fear of the unknown"".  While the size of the book caused her to pause a bit, when she looked at how it is structured and saw that it is not just reading but guides you through actual practice as a workbook, she wasn't as intimidated.  She's working on it through the summer to prepare.I am impressed with the readability and ease of practice this book offers.  I'm not saying the work itself is necessarily easy - just that it walks you through things and discusses all sorts of tips to help you feel more at ease with the test.  There are 16 additional chapters of preparation materials available online, included when you sign up online with the purchase of this book.There is one practice test in the book and a second available online.  I will say, I was a little disappointed with only having 2 tests available with this guide.  We have the College Board SAT guide, which includes 10 practice tests in the book, which I feel offers more practice.  In all other respects, this book is very similar to the College Board book.Obviously, I cannot give our opinion yet on how well this helped her actually pass the test.  I'll definitely update this review in the fall after she takes the test.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MG3PPKTYXPC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625232403#wasThisHelpful","R1MG3PPKTYXPC8","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great book - couldn't put it down!  The storyline, the suspense, the romance, the characters - it was all great.  This is the second book I've read by Lisa Carter, and I really enjoy her writing.I did not realize when I picked it up that this book comes after ""Carolina Reckoning"", and there were indeed times where I felt like I was missing something that had happened in the previous book, like how you feel when you are missing an inside joke.  However, this story did not depend on the previous book to make sense.  I actually want to read ""Carolina Reckoning"" now, as well.I definitely enjoyed this book & recommend it if you enjoy Christian fiction and mystery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLQPMIVICQEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426795440#wasThisHelpful","R1WLQPMIVICQEB","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband bought this for our anniversary two weeks ago.  I absolutely love it!  I prefer understated jewelry, and this necklace is exactly that.  The pendant lies right at my collarbone, making it suitable for a number of outfits.  I wore it to dinner the night he gave it to me with a burgundy V-neck dress, and it looked stunning.The combination of rose gold and silver is lovely with what I feel is a bit of a vintage feel.  The photo here is enlarged, so be sure to look at the measurements in the listing under Jewelry Information.  The diamonds are really just tiny accents, they don't stand out.The chain is not as delicate as I thought it would be, which I like - I don't feel like it's breakable in the way that some finely textured chains I've had have been.

" 1:15 Mins I've been around babies long enough to know that some toys seem like a great idea and are wonderful at first, but they can quickly wear on you with their sounds, or can be boring.  For this reason, it's hard to choose a toy like this online without hearing it for yourself... I made a short video for this review to allow you to see and hear just a bit of the capabilities and sound.I do like the ability to turn it on and off!  Some toys with sound don't have this option, which is crazy and annoying and burns out the batteries.  This also has the option for two different volume levels, which can help in the car or quiet living room vs. in a loud place where baby can't hear as well.The little grey slider bar at the bottom of the ""screen"" doesn't do anything - it's just for show.  So don't think you have control over brightness, fast forwarding, locking, or refreshing - despite the fact that those indicators are printed there.Finally, the frustration-free packaging was great.  I can't tell you how many times our kids received a gift, and then we had to snip an abundance of tough wires, ties, and/or tape to get it out of the package.  The packaging for this makes it more fun right away for both the child and the parent when received as a gift!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQDAHM9F6J3Y8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHQDZ42#wasThisHelpful","RQDAHM9F6J3Y8","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband's day job revolves around setting up routers and switches for companies both large and small, so he has written this review:Overall, I'm a little under-whelmed by this wireless router. When pulling it out of the box, it's heavy and feels solid, which initially told me quality. While the interface to configure it is nice, the wireless performance for me just isn't solid or reliable.++++++++++Pros:- The web interface is simple, clear and easy to use- Able to place this router into access point mode which is nice if you don't need routing or NAT; I like this because it gives me flexibility in how I use it in conjunction with another routerCons:- Reception in the house is worse than my older Linksys WRT54G; my wife and daughters are coming to me way too often saying they are losing connectivity; sometimes a reboot helps, sometime it doesn't; still troubleshooting it, but it's intermittent- When running in router mode, the content filter is way too simple, only allowing for you to pick certain websites (and only a handful at that); you cannot filter based on keyword or category at all; what good does it do to block 6 or 10 website URLS when there are trillions out there? I'd rather be able to block by keyword & category- Slow when moving through the web GUI++++++++++Honestly, I was expecting more with technology that has moved on from the old WRT54G days, but I am considering powering this new router down and firing the old one back up. I'm hoping that future firmware updates will fix the things that are frustrating me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21F1CKMAZ4QYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20T0#wasThisHelpful","R21F1CKMAZ4QYC","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great book, couldn't put it down! I already have the preorder for the sequel in my Amazon cart...The storyline sounded a bit fluffy, but definitely enjoyable, so I picked this up for a poolside read. Turned out, the storyline was not fluffy, and I really enjoyed the depth of the characters.I loved the way Jessie rebounds and finds her way, and the way she boldly takes risks starting a new business despite feeling out of place in the new life she was forced into. I was glad to find she's not shallow despite her apparent spoiled lifestyle that she begins with at the start of the book.I also enjoyed Danny's kind heart, the way he stepped up to help her out above and beyond just his initial job of investigating her missing husband. The way his character unfolded through the story was nicely done - we don't know everything about him up front, and find out more even as the book is drawing to a close.The Christian element in this story is definitely present, but not overly preachy. It was interesting how Jessie's thoughts and inclinations toward God are not resolved at the end of this book, so I anticipate that being part of the sequel.The one odd element for me was the weaving in of Jessie's grandfather's thoughts about Jessie's growing up years. While the memories were sweet and helpful for understanding Jessie's character, I found it odd how his present-day character was not part of the present-day storyline. It felt a bit disjointed when jumping back and forth between the two, especially at the beginning, but I was used to it by the end.I can't wait for the next book in this series, especially after reading the teaser at the back of this one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTGDSJS5IZDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426711603#wasThisHelpful","ROTGDSJS5IZDB","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year, I tried a hummingbird feeder that did not attract a single hummingbird.  I left it up all season, and hummingbirds came to my flowers and trees, but not to that feeder.  So this spring, I decided to try this new Perky Pet feeder.  I considered placing it in a different spot, but the spot where I had it last year still seemed ideal to me because it is close to a plant with red trumpet flowers that the hummingbirds love.The very first day the feeder was out, I saw a hummingbird stop by!  It checked out the feeder, visited the trumpet flower bush, and then went back to the feeder for a while.  I was ecstatic!  Since then, we've seen hummingbirds just about every day.I was concerned with all the rain we've been having that the water would somehow get into the feeder through the yellow parts, water down the solution, and deter the birds from visiting.  However, I have not noticed it affecting the birds, they keep coming around!One final note: don't bother with the store bought solutions - I actually have noticed the birds didn't come around when I put those solutions out.  Instead, I followed the advice of a coworker: make a simple (inexpensive!) solution by boiling 3 parts of water with one part sugar, cool completely, then add it to the feeder.  If you make extra, you can keep it in a pitcher in the fridge for refills.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C7KHN4GB1K0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBFYT3A#wasThisHelpful","R3C7KHN4GB1K0J","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spring, I planted a flat of Verbena around the trees in my front yard, only to see a rabbit sitting under one of the trees a few mornings later, eating what apparently considers a delicious Verbena Salad.  He was only eating the flowers, not the plants, so my hope was that by using this product, I could keep rabbits away long enough for the plants to grow enough to generate more flowers.I followed the directions for sprinkling the pellets in a 2-3ft radius from the area I wanted to protect.  I noticed within two days I had new flower buds, and a couple of days after that they were blooming!The biggest issue I've had with this product is really not the fault of the product, but the fact that we have had an incredibly wet, rainy spring here in north Texas.  This product, being made of natural elements, gradually washes away.  A single rain or yard watering wouldn't do it, as stated on the bag.  However, we have had so much rain this product couldn't help but be dissolved and washed away after a few short days right now!  This means I've had to reapply, but I haven't always been able to because it's been raining practically every day.  As a result, there have been spurts of flower loss.  On the flip side, the spurts of time when the product is fresh and doing its repelling job, combined with all the rain, the Verbena has had lots of growth, and I have not lost the plants.As to the fragrance of this product, I do not find it offensive or very strong.  In fact, chemical fertilizers have a much stronger smell than this does; even organic fertilizers tend to have a stronger odor than this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GAAGUIKHOV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBGGEH6#wasThisHelpful","R8GAAGUIKHOV7","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Ace Collins book I've read - I also read The Color of Justice last month.  I enjoyed Hollywood Lost, but not quite as much.The author is skilled at writing a book with intensity of story and well-written characters.  I enjoyed the storyline along the way even as I was on the edge of my seat to find the answer to the mystery.  Suspicions are cast in every direction, making it tough for me to truly put a finger on who did it until the very end!The characters are developed well, so that I felt I knew and recognized them early on, yet there is enough complexity to each one that they do not feel contrived. The allure and glamour of Hollywood was fun to read about while also portraying the occasionally harsh realities behind the scenes.As the book progressed, I became disappointed in the character of Bill Barrister/police captain.  I felt that he put Shelby under pressures that a police investigator would not put a civilian woman under, even back in the time period this was written about.  It cast an unrealistic shadow that I couldn't shake through the rest of the book when it came to his character, and even affected how I felt about the big build-up to the revelation of the true murderer at the end.  For this reason, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did The Color of Justice - however it was still a thrilling and exciting book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R268SEK3IRDCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426771886#wasThisHelpful","R268SEK3IRDCJ","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FYI: This review contains ***Possible Spoilers***I really enjoy Biblical fiction, and was looking forward to reading ""Angels at the Gate"".  When I say Biblical fiction, I am thinking of books that take a story from the Bible, even if it is minimally described there, and use historical study plus creativity to write a great story that holds true to what the message of the Bible is.As I began reading this book, I liked the premise, despite the difficulty imagining a girl of this time period being raised with her identity hidden so she could remain with her father in his travelling trade.  The storyline is compelling, mysterious, and suspenseful, with places of intense action or anticipation.  In that regard, this book has a lot for those who want to stay on the edge of their seat. As the book moved on, however, I noticed more and more places where the author was asking the reader to suppose alternate possibilities of what else could have occurred when the Bible is short on description.For example, the ""men"" and ""angels"" described as appearing to Abraham, and later to Lot, are not described much in the Bible.  Therefore, the author gives us the idea that Mika and Raph were indeed men - very tall, very imposing men.  OK, I'm willing to give this a possibility for the sake of the story, because after all, the Bible does give the possibility in Genesis 6 that angels married women who gave birth to giants.  But as the story keeps going, what could have been the power and manifestation of God working through Mika is eventually referred to as ""magic"", and he doesn't ""hear from God"" as I would expect if the message were staying true to the heart of the Bible.  Instead, he has to use a magic stone in a ritual that is just like a pagan one, which included having sex with the main character Adira after getting her drunk, and beseeching the goddess Ishtar.  When Mika addresses the king regarding what he was told in this ritual, he does not say, ""The Most High God has shown me..."" as Biblical language would suggest from other prophetic words spoken throughout the Bible; he says, ""This then is what the gods told me.""The author uses references to Islam, including quotes from Islamic texts, which I was willing to see past, since Abraham's son Ishmael is included in this story, and the history of his descendants and their religion could help make up the historical context of part of the book.  However, as I continued, it felt to me that the author was trying to blend the religions of Hebrew and Islamic religions, as well as the pagans, into one universal thing.  Something along the lines of ""We all call our gods and goddesses and their powers different things, but it's all the same.""This book does NOT stay true to the overall message of the Bible, as I would have expected from Biblical historic fiction.  I must say I was quite disappointed, because I had started this book so looking forward to it thanks to all the great reviews currently posted for it.  If you are interested in Biblical fiction that follows the heart of the message of the Bible, I suggest Francine River's A Lineage of Grace: Five Stories of Unlikely Women Who Changed Eternity and Sons of Encouragement, as well as Davis Bunn & Janette Oke's Acts of Faith (3 Book Series).","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38K5EAVYIVNAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=390619602X#wasThisHelpful","R38K5EAVYIVNAB","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a Burts Bees fan, so I looked forward to trying these face cleansing wipes.I was very pleased with the way they washed my face, my skin felt very clean.My skin did not feel dried out or greasy afterward, nor did I sense any residue left from the cleanser.My one negative for these: I did not have great success removing eye makeup with these - it took 5x as long and far more swipes to get my mascara and eyeliner off.  I still need eye makeup remover (on days I wear it - which is not every day).I can actually cut these in half - half of one is really enough for me to wash my face for one night.My daughter tried a pack of these, and she loves the convenience of washing with wipes. She's rather impatient and doesn't always take the time to wash with cleanser and a washcloth, and her skin suffers for it (acne). But with the wipes around, she washes every night and her skin looks better.My mother also tried a pack of these, because she has both sensitive skin and a sensitivity to fragrances. She loved them!

"This book was beautifully written, such a joy to read!  I forgot I was reading a book targeted at a younger audience.  While the main characters were children, the book does not feel childish at all (not to mention the sheer size of it - it's a long book!)  The characters have such heartful complexity that I couldn't put it down.  However, it is not too complicated that a young person would not be able to follow along - my 12 year old daughter is reading it right now, and has found herself being completely drawn in as well.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book to a child or an adult.The theme of music being both healing and a place to find refuge is universal and timely.  So many kids today do not realize that there was once a world where music was not so easily accessible.  All three stories in this book are from a time when music was a treasure.  I hope this story introduces young people to the precious thing that music can be in their lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPLBDQBSI0JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439874025#wasThisHelpful","R2YPLBDQBSI0JI","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always interested in helpful tools to cook more foods on the grill, so that I can keep my house cool in the summer.  When I saw this griddle, I was excited because most of the time when I wanted to cook something that needed a tray, I just put a cheap cookie sheet on the grill, which was honestly too thin and I had to be very careful not to burn things.This griddle is very heavy duty, from a thick gauge of steel, which goes a long way to keep food from burning over the grill flames.  The weight also keeps it from scooting around easily while I'm flipping and moving food on it.The hinge on the elevation bar is very stiff, which is a good thing because it doesn't flip down easily while the tray is in use or being moved.  It would be a pain having to flip that thing back up when the whole tray is hot to touch.The drip tray is helpful, and didn't fill up when I cooked turkey bacon on here.  For most other foods that I cook on here, though, the drip tray is unnecessary (such as French fries or pancakes).If you've cooked with stainless cookware, you know that it can be tougher to clean than nonstick, so be prepared for the shiny new finish on this to be quickly marred by both foods and grill smoke marks.  However, if you properly prepare it before cooking foods that stick, that helps.  Also, a paste of baking soda and water can be used to gently and effectively scrub away stuck on and burned food.One note on the packing - Amazon packaged this product just fine to ship it to me, but the actual product box was very damaged at one corner when I opened the shipping box.  Unfortunately, this meant that the corner on the opposite side of the drip dray was bent.  Considering the heavy gauge of the steel used, I am convinced it was a significant impact to the actual product box before shipping that caused this.  Thankfully the bent area does not affect the use of the tray, but I'm disappointed that they would ship a product that has obvious damage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9P1S8EDJBWK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B58A0R4#wasThisHelpful","R9P1S8EDJBWK6","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used the original Nivea Lip Butter, and liked it quite well, so was looking forward to trying this cocoa butter version.It smells delicious, but doesn't have any flavor to match, which I found odd.This product applies very smoothly and definitely feels like butter.  It's not waxy, sticky, or cheap feeling at all.  However, I don't feel like it lasts very long, and I've had to reapply it often.  For me, long lasting moisturization is the main goal of lip balm, I don't like having dry lips!  The original lip butter lasted longer for me than this cocoa butter version, so of the two, I would choose the original for this reason alone.The tin the Lip Butter comes in is not easy to open and close - the lid sticks to the main tin, and not because of something sticky, it's the actual design.  It could just be a manufacturing defect, because the tin from my original lip butter never did this.I'm not a fan of trying to apply products this thick with my finger, because I don't like standing there rubbing and rubbing just to get enough on my finger for suitable application.

"This book was not quite what I expected, yet in a good way. Rather than an exposition on taking time to value in the world around you, it is more of a journal of the author's personal experience with this topic. It is organized by month and season, so you can read along as the year passes by. There are suggestions for moments of contemplation and moments of action, all focused on special moments exclusive to the season.At times I became a little lost in the prose of this book, because the author can be quite flowery, as if she is writing poetry. I would rather read straightforward, practical language that cuts right to the heart of the matter, but that's just personal preference.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4TE8KNP8EER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142677642X#wasThisHelpful","R2T4TE8KNP8EER","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The flavor of these has brought mixed reactions as we have tried them.Neither I nor my 12 yr old daughter liked them at all.  I felt they were sickly sweet and artificial tasting, which is very odd since they are naturally flavored with real raspberry puree'.  I gave them a second try another day, thinking I'd misjudged them the first time, and found them equally displeasing.  I really like nuts, so I am disappointed!However, my husband actually snatched the bag from me when he found out I didn't like them, and he vowed to finish them off because he liked them so well.  I shared a few with one of my coworkers the first day I was trying them out, and she said they were delicious.So it seems they are a flavor that is loved by some, and not pleasing to others.  As far as the actual nuts go, they were crunchy, not soggy, which is certainly an important quality in nuts covered by a coating like these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3571Q355K20Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REDUAHO#wasThisHelpful","R3571Q355K20Y5","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These dishtowels have a very nice, smooth feel, especially after you wash them a few times, but they're not so smooth that they don't absorb. They absorb similarly to a woven tea towel (if you've ever had one of those), and do not soak up as quickly as a thick towel. For a spill, I would probably grab a thick towel instead, but for drying dishes and such, these work well for me.They are generously oversized, much larger than what standard kitchen towels usually are. There is a hanging loop on the back of one of the corners. However, because of the generous sizing, when you hang it from the corner it hangs down about 36"". I would have to put the hook on a wall, not a bottom cabinet door, which doesn't suit my kitchen.The color is a lovely turquoise that coordinates well with my kitchen, and has been quite a popular color lately.When these are laundered and dried, the edges curl and buckle in the dryer. I'm not going to be ironing my kitchen towels, but that's what it would take for them to fold flat and have a smooth appearance after that first laundering.Overall, these are nice if you're looking for oversized kitchen towels. If you're wanting a more standard size, these are not it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XCLGIH3PYIYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3R8YJG#wasThisHelpful","R1XCLGIH3PYIYW","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This replaced a 6 year old cracking plastic drain cover that was nasty, despite my attempts to keep it clean.  When I measured it before ordering the new one, it was 4 1/2"" wide, but I decided to take the risk because I was so ready to get rid of the old one.I am soooo glad I decided to replace it, and this metal drain cover is so much easier to keep clean!  It doesn't have the thick 3-dimensional grid that dropped down below what you see on top that the plastic one had, which was the part that was always nasty.  Plus the metal has a much nicer look than plastic that gave just a little touch of class to the shower floor, if that is possible!The only drawback I found is that this doesn't actually snap in place, despite what the title says.  It stays in place thanks to gravity, but not due to snapping tabs or anything like that.  For the most part, this is fine.  However, it does shift around a little, maybe as much as 1/4 of an inch in any direction, probably due to that initial size difference.  This is not a deal breaker for me, and it most certainly is not sliding all over the shower, but I felt the product description/title was misleading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJS1S4B8WZ7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FH86RW#wasThisHelpful","R1DJS1S4B8WZ7E","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially I liked the idea of veggies added to the actual pasta.  The vitamin content of these noodles is significantly higher as a result.I made a creamy noodle and chicken dish my family loves, and the noodles had a distinctive orange color that threw my kids for a momentary loop (""Why is this orange?"" followed by dubious looks...)  Everyone did eat it, however, and enjoyed it!  You can't taste the orange after all, ha!Here's my concern with the veggie idea - this is still a white wheat product.  There is no added whole grain which adds fiber and other important nutrients.  I don't usually purchase pasta that isn't 100% whole wheat, or multigrain with added fiber (such as the Barilla Plus).  And if you look at the back, there are only 2 carrots and half a cup of squash processed into the *entire box* - that's not a lot of veggies as far as I'm concerned.

"I actually had a tough time initially getting into this book.  I felt like the author was quite hedgy about giving any background or details about connections with people in an attempt to create suspense, and this made me feel lost.  However, this seemed to end rather quickly after that first chapter or so, as connections were explained and the suspense started to build more naturally.I ended up really enjoying this book!  The mystery is full of tension as the red herrings fly left and right.  The romance has a beautiful draw, as a second chance is such a hopeful, heartwarming theme.  The Christian aspects of this book are well done, in what I felt was a realistic and non-preachy way.I'm going to be looking for more from Christy Barritt - she had me on the edge of my seat with a hard-to-put-down story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XDSD5CR5QAYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477826807#wasThisHelpful","R1XDSD5CR5QAYH","A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HLJJ6MKZLR3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm so happy that Soul Music Records ( a division of Cherry Red in the UK who is also the parent company of Big Break Records) decided to reissue Tasha Thomas's album MIDNIGHT RENDEZVOUS on a special two-CD expanded edition set.The remastering is absolutely fantastic and I can really hear different instruments like finger-cymbals and horns on cuts like ""Street Fever"" and ""Shoot Me (With Your Love)"" and the bass line on SM(WYL) is still vibrant and on top of the rest of the instrumentation.""Hot Buttered Boogie"" and ""You Put The Music In Me"" last a few seconds longer than their record tracks and you can understand what the male voice is saying on HBB (Butter, Butter), so the remastering does the album justice and  warrants an upgrade.The additional CD contains different versions of ""Shoot Me,""' ""Street Fever,"" ""Hot Buttered Boogie,"" and ""Midnight Rendezvous"" so you do get extras.A booklet is included with 2015 liner notes by Justin Kantor (July '15), original liner notes from Chris Albertson, and excerpts from an interview with Thomas from 1979. Unfortunately there aren't any additional pictures on the inside.It's unfortunate that Tasha Thomas died so young in November 1984 but this (her only solo album) is a testament to her talent not only as a singer but as a songwriter as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z7T9JQ5LHRY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015S222LY#wasThisHelpful","R2Z7T9JQ5LHRY6","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE BROWN DERBY RESTAURANT book could've been easily twice or three times the size (and by that I mean the number of pages) because according to the introduction by Sally Wright Cobb (wife of owner Robert Cobb), she went through hundreds of photos to make this book and whittled it down to the ones that made it to print.Not only does the book show wonderful black & white and sepia toned photographs of the famous stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood, but the book also shows the outside of the Brown Derby Restaurant locations (Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Los Feliz, Wilshire) and includes a picture of the construction of the ""hat"" shaped Derby on Wilshire and a picture of the staff in front of the completed hat.It also includes recipes, I haven't tried the recipes, and pictures of the menu as well as the interior of the restaurant and it includes a homage to the ""I Love Lucy"" episode (LA At Last - My favorite) where Lucy, Fred and Ethel visit The Brown Derby and run into William Holden.Also, the famous caricatures by Eddie Vitch that were on the wall are reproduced on the inside of the hardcover and throughout the book. Vitch, I learned from the book, came into the restaurant and asked Robert Cobb if he could sketch the stars in exchange for something to eat and Cobb was amazed at the speed that Vitch did the drawings and hired him on permanently.The book says that there was a staff photographer at the restaurant and that's why so many wonderful pictures were taken and taken with the stars permission and when they were ready. That's why you don't see any pictures of a celebrity stuffing their face or picking their nose or any other inappropriate behavior or having food stuck in their teeth or faces, LOL.Just looking at the pictures and seeing everyone dressed up and very elegant makes me long for that period. But of course I'm yearning for a fantasy and a romanticized notion of that time and have to remind myself that even these pictures were posed and staged for full effect..Anyway, the book is wonderful and if you enjoy classic Hollywood lore this should be on your list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JK9P3YDFKW39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0847819256#wasThisHelpful","R1JK9P3YDFKW39","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent CD from Culture Club. I had it on cassette tape way back then because I liked the single ""Miss Me Blind,"" but the whole album is great.There a good mix between up-tempo and slower ballads on COLOUR BY NUMBERS and the bonus tracks are good too (although I swear that the title track ""Colour By Numbers"" was on the original cassette because I have heard that song before). Anyway, I think this was the second album from Culture Club and it proved that they were no flash-in-the-pan.The CD has the hits ""Karma Chameleon,"" ""It's A Miracle,"" ""Church Of The Poison Mind,"" and ""Miss Me Blind,"" which were all hits and got a fair amount of radio play back then. I remember because I couldn't afford to buy albums back then, being a broke teenager, so I would rely on radio play to hear songs and the songs mentioned above were on constant play.Also on this CD are slower ballads like ""Black Money,"" ""Stormkeeper,"" ""Victims,"" and ""Changing Everyday,"" the latter more an up-tempo ballad, but each with profound lyrics. And even though they're of the slower variety they still jam. I was actually surprised to learn that all of the songs were written by Boy George along with others including his band mates because I didn't know this back then.I had the cassette of this album and eventually got the first issued CD of it, and now I've got this expanded edition. This CD comes with a fold out booklet that has pictures of the band members and the lyrics to the songs, but no other liner notes except credits.

"These NO-SHOW SOCKS have a very large silicone pad on the heel so it stays on, unlike some other brands with the small dot or strips on the back, since it has more of a gripping surface .I got the size XS-Mens because I wear a size 9 in loafers and dress shoes (Cole Haan, John Varvatos Star, also 9 in Chuck Taylor Converse) -- in sneakers I wear between 9 1/2 -10 1/2 (Nike, Adidas) -- so I went with the XS according to the Stomper Joe size chart and these fit just right. In fact they could be a bit smaller length wise for a tighter more secure fit because the back part of the sock I have to tuck down a little because my Cole Haan ZeroGrands push the sock a touch above the rim, so some of it shows until I push it back down. Otherwise the fit is on point.If you wear a smaller size than a Men's 9 the XS may not fit well, and that's the smallest size for Men, so if I were you I'd look for the comparable size in the Women's section of the same sock.Walking around this past weekend to dinner and bar hopping,  these STOMPER JOE'S NO-SHOW SOCKS stayed up. Normally when I wear the other brands the heel will slip off inside my shoe and I have to stop and take off my shoe and fix it, which is a pain!I also got these in the tan color and I've washed the pair I wore.

"NEXXUS OIL INFINITE SHAMPOO does make my hair soft and manageable. I find that I don't have to use a conditioner after shampooing and after showering, I don't have to use a leave-in conditioner (except a little on the ends so that my hair doesn't look too wiry) .It has a perfumey scent something like Frankincense incense and one of those inexpensive perfumes that they sell in the drugstore, which might be the oil in the shampoo. The scent is strong when you put it on, but after rinsing off it's not bad.Another reviewer said that this shampoo didn't lather up well enough, but I didn't have that problem. It does contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Cocamidopropyl Betaine, which are chemicals used to make products like shampoo and facial/body cleansers foam up, so it lathered up very nicely for me.

"I like the ANDIS PET NAIL GRINDER even though I still use the manual nail clippers on my Shiba.I found that by cutting with the manual clippers her nails get jagged and rough and they hurt when they come into contact with my skin. So the Andis helps with that issue.Normally I clip her nails after her bath, her nails get really long, and then the next day I'll use the ANDIS to further shorten the nail (since I keep far from the quick) using the sanding head. I then follow that with the polishing stone head, which smooths out the nail and keeps them smooth even after they grow out. I couldn't be happier since her nails no longer scratch when they come into contact with human skin.I initially had the Dremel Nail Grinder but after a couple of years the battery wouldn't hold its charge (and it didn't come with a polishing stone). The ANDIS PET GRINDER is corded so I don't have to worry about that.The kit comes with a case, instruction sheet, extra sanding bands, polishing stone head, 1 large drum head, 1 small drum head, wrench, and a silicone covering that you can use on the unit for better grip, but I don't use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I91RWABCDN5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UO2PRY#wasThisHelpful","R2I91RWABCDN5R","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you haven't already bought the ""Poirot: The Movie Collection Set 6"" and/or the separate Blu-Ray of ""Poirot: Murder On The Orient Express,"" and instead have started your collection with the AGATHA CHRISTIE'S POIROT SERIES like I did, then you should definitely pickup POIROT SERIES 12.Fellow Amazon reviewer Paul J. Mular does a pretty good job explaining the differences between the Poirot ""Movie Collection"" set and the Poirot ""Series"" sets, which really confused me when I started buying the ""SERIES"" Blurays since many of the more recent episodes weren't available on Blu-Ray and I started finding the ""movie collection set"" DVDs, but they both contain the same movies/shows that were broadcast, just not in the same order. As long as you started with POIROT SERIES 1 and have continued in sequential order ending with ""SERIES 13"" you will have all of the episodes; there is no difference between the shows on the ""Poirot The Movie Collection"" and the ones on the ""Poirot Series.""This is the second to the last set of AGATHA CHRISTIE'S POIROT: SERIES starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot.I had originally bought the stand alone Blu-Ray of POIROT: MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NPJE6U1T0O9W/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L80FLC - here's the link to my review for that disc) and was surprised by the different characterization of ""Poirot"" by Suchet, which was really dark and short tempered. I can't remember which ""Series"" I had finished I think 4 or 5, while waiting for the Blu-Ray release of the subsequent ones and maybe that's why I was taken aback. I've never watched the shows while they were on the air, so I had to wait for home viewing and would watch back-to-back. When I bought the stand alone ""Orient Express"" Poirot was very different from what I was used to. According to IMDb the show started in 1989 and ""Murder On The Orient Express"" aired in 2010, so the show has been on for quite some time with obvious breaks/gaps in between, and during that time the show morphed from a sequential type series to more feature length films.Interestingly enough as I was able to go forward and watch the episodes in broadcast order, I was not as off-put by the change in character once I got to MOTOE. Perhaps as the show went on subtle changes in characterization was happening and so it wasn't so stark once you get to that episode, but when you watch from the earlier shows and jump to this one it's very different.Anyway, this includes the special of Suchet on the real Orient Express.Definitely pick this up if you don't already have the ""movie collection"" set. If you haven't started with any of the ""Poirot"" series, you don't need to have seen any of the previous ones to enjoy each of these episodes since they work as stand-alone shows. Also, I don't know if they follow the Christie stories to the letter so I can't comment on that but I enjoyed watching the entire series.***  SPECIAL FEATURES  *** ""David Suchet on the Orient Express"" (2009) - 47-minutes:01-secondFollow the actor as he goes on board the real Orient Express, going from the UK to Venice to Prague. You get to see the compartments, the dining car/bar, the porters, and there's wonderful historic footage included as well, and Suchet interviews the train's experts, and real passengers riding on board the iconic train.

"This FEBREZE AIR EFFECTS CLEAN SPLASH spray smells like dried urine to me. I don't know if I got a bad can,  I bought this elsewhere because it says it reduces allergens, but the smell is really odd.

"I enjoyed watching MIDNIGHT LACE starring Doris Day and Rex Harrison.The movie is a suspenseful thriller where Day plays this stereotypical ""damsel in distress"" -- I guess this was the accepted norm for female characters in 1960 who weren't the bad girl femme-fatales in Noir films -- named Kit Preston, a vanilla white newlywed trophy wife who has recently moved to London to be with her husband Anthony Preston (Harrison). Someone starts threatening to kill poor Kit, once in a fog-filled park and then endlessly on the telephone, with this high-pitched, sing-song voice and the poor woman is terrorized to the point of madness! But she looks great clutching her head with both hands with the look of absolute HORROR on her face, crying, as the phone rings incessantly, while things go bump in the dark, and poor Kit is frozen with fear.In the storyline viewers only hear the threatening voice twice, in the beginning and the end, and the other characters never hear it until the end, so one is never quite sure if Mrs. Preston is actually receiving threatening calls from the same person, what the voice is actually saying, or if she's just becoming unhinged and imagining all of it or worse making it all up because she feels neglected. This plot device is what keep viewers interested in the movie until the end, and where Day really shines in this characterization as the hysterical wife, because one can see all of the above outcomes being possibilities. At times you want someone to kill her, at others you think she's making it all up, still others one thinks that she's losing her mind, and that keeps viewers watching until the truth is revealed.Anyway, listening to the fabulous intro by TCM's host Robert Osborne and we learn that this movie was so emotionally taxing that Doris Day had a nervous break-down during the filming and vowed to never do another like it.The picture quality is pretty good, but I do notice a haze around the shots with Day and Myrna Loy (who plays her Aunt Bea), which was probably in the actual source film (I heard that gauze and Vaseline was used as a camera filter on movies from this era as a way to make actresses more ethereal and dreamlike, not to mention ageless/no wrinkles, on the big screen) so that probably couldn't be helped.I took off one-star because of the above and some viewers might actually have trouble with suspension of disbelief especially with certain scenes in the movie -- of course context is everything -- like when the caller calls, why doesn't Kit hangup immediately instead of listening, crying and shivering and asking ""why?"" as she continues to listen to him? Of course we wouldn't have a movie in that case, but some viewers will find it hard to believe and quite comical at times. Also, NO SPOILER, but at end, it seems very odd as though some scene was cut-out, but the very end is nonsensical.Roddy Mcdowall, Hermione Baddeley, and handsome John Gavin co-star in the movie as well. I think Gavin's character is supposed to be British but his accent isn't really there especially when he's in scenes with Baddeley, but with a face like his who's listening?There's some good extras on this DVD as well:***  SPECIAL FEATURES  **** Intro by Robert Osbourne* ""High Style Elegance of Midnight Lace"" - Fashion Featurette - 06:32-minutesMore like a fashion show this special has the costume designer, Irene, describing the wonderful clothes that Day wears in the film, as test shots are showed with Day modeling the outfits. This promo was actually played in theaters and the clothes were displayed in department stores according to the text at the beginning of this featurette as a way of drumming up publicity for the movie.* StillsNumerous stills from movie posters to lobby cards, fashion sketches to publicity stills, and you can select by category.* TCM Db ArticleThis is a text article written about the movie for TCM's site that provides additional information on filming and what the various stars had to say about the picture.* Radio Interview - 03:59-minutesExcerpt from a radio interview with Day about the movie.* Doris Day Animal Promo - 01:02-minutesCommercial featuring Day asking viewers to consider pet adoption.* TrailerAs long as you aren't expecting too much from this movie, I think most people will enjoy MIDNIGHT LACE in a cult-like way. I'm not sure why she looks like Dinah Shore on the cover, but Doris Day is pretty good in the movie and it's a shame she didn't do more thrillers! After all, who else but the whitest woman in America could portray such utter helplessness and  madness convincingly?","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JW1UTHWPC2OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRQDQSW#wasThisHelpful","R1JW1UTHWPC2OW","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the CLAIROL HERBAL ESSENCES WILD NATURAL HAIR CONDITIONER.It has a nice grapefruit scent and leaves my hair nice and soft.  I've got very thick and dry hair so I usually have to apply some leave-in conditioner, otherwise my hair will end up looking like a Q-Tip, so this was no different. However, even without that extra step my hair was nice and soft with just rinsing with this conditioner.There's other stuff in the ingredients like a lot of alcohol derivatives (I assume to stabilize the other ingredients) so be aware of that fact. Also, I haven't notice the conditioner striping out my hair color or causing any scalp irritation so that's also a plus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OQHHT7QU3BMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP25TRS#wasThisHelpful","R3OQHHT7QU3BMT","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's about time that Expos's debut album be given the deluxe treatment. I loved EXPOSURE and so I was overjoyed when I found out that Cherry Pop in the UK was releasing this 2-CD expanded version of it. I'm amazed that it's usually Japan or the UK that does these lovingly expanded re-issues of older soul/disco/r&b music from the USA (look at Universal Japan's reissue of the original Donna Summer ""Live & More"" album or Big Break Records UK expanded edition of The Pointer Sisters ""Break Out"" album for example), while the US record companies just keep putting out the same stuff just repackaged (I'm still waiting for a Janet ""Miss"" Jackson's CONTROL album to get an expanded makeover).I only know the original album (I actually had it on cassette) and the old CD, so I don't know if many of these remixes have been released before, as another customer stated, and I think I have two remixes that are on a ""Free-Style"" compilation, but I'm not sure if they're the same as on this edition, so mostly all of these extra tracks are new to me.On track #6 ""Point Of No Return"" from the original album, the track listed here on CD 1 is the extended version and runs 6:08-minutes. I no longer have that old cassette tape, but on the previous CD version of EXPOSURE this track is only 3:29-minutes, so that's one difference that I found, but that might be because the CD version had an edited version of the song -- I can't remember if the track was longer on the original.The remastering sounds fantastic and I think Cherry Pop did a great job.EXPOSURE DELUXE EDITION comes with a booklet featuring the lyrics to all songs, track annotations by the song-writer Lewis Martine who talks about the inspiration for each song and how it came about, liner notes by Bill Pitzonka written on Aug 2014 that includes interviews with Jeanette Jurado, Gioia Bruno, and Ann Curless discussing how the group was formed etc., discography, some publicity pictures from back then, and single/album sleeve pictures.According to the liner notes there was a different group of singers who initially recorded ""Point Of No Return"" and ""Exposed To Love"" and featured lead vocals by Al Lorenzo, who sounds exactly like Jeanette Jurado, and in the credits on lead vocals in the booklet it lists Lorenzo as the singer of both songs that feature the 1985 mixes. Jurado --once the group was formed with the lineup of Bruno, Jurado and Curless -- went back to the studio and recorded her own vocals on the two songs and Lewis Martine says that if you owned any of the first 125,000 pressing of the EXPOSURE album you have Lorenzo's vocals, and any after are Jurado. I didn't know that so the liner notes were very informative.However it should've been mentioned that Gioia Bruno was diagnosed with throat cancer (I think that's what it was), which caused her to drop out of the group and be replaced by Kelley Moneymaker, while she recovered, and eventually she rejoined the group. I learned all this when I saw them perform at an LGBT Pride Festival back in either late 90s or early 2000s and Bruno was back in the group, and all were in fine voice.Another interesting tidbit is the group's performance at the famed Apollo Theater in New York, which you can find on Youtube, when they were touring. They brought the house down and I remember watching this on TV.Anyhow, if you were a kid in the 80s and went out clubbing you'd know this album and so I definitely recommend picking it up. If you like ""High Energy/Free Style"" music from the 80s then EXPOSURE is what you need.Normally, I don't really care for remix versions of songs, but in this case all of the additional tracks are based on the strong hits from the album and the remixes are extended mixes that doesn't change the song around too much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ZUMVN6B55DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUJZ43O#wasThisHelpful","R21ZUMVN6B55DN","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finally watched IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT after seeing the iconic scene a number of times that featured Claudette Colbert hitch-hiking with Clark Gable and using her leg to get a car to stop. Now I see why this is considered a classic and why it swept the Oscars.If you haven't seen the film, Colbert plays a spoiled heiress who is on the run --rebelling from her father-- and she crosses path with Gable portraying a reporter; they meet on a night bus to NYC and one thing leads to another and suddenly they fall for one another.The beauty in this story is the fun that audiences get to share in as the characters go along the journey from being indifferent and almost hostile toward one another to falling in love and that's what makes it a classic. Supposedly IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT was the film that started the genre of the ""romantic/screwball comedy"" and the chemistry between Colbert and Gable is spot on.This new CRITERION BLURAY edition of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT also comes with a bunch of extras that should keep fans happy and has been digitally restored. I was reading another review that said the Blu-ray's picture quality was on par with the DVD release and since I haven't seen that version I can't comment on it, but the image on BR looks good to me considering that this movie is from 1934.The blacks are black, the image is sharp and clear, and there aren't any visible dust/hair/scratches that I can see.*****  EXTRAS  *****""Frank Capra, Jr. Remembers"" -- featurette (11:16-min/ 1999)Son of director Frank Capra discuses how the movie came about (it was based on a short story called ""Night Bus"") and was filmed in four weeks.""Screwball Comedy?"" -- featurette (38:36-min/ 2014)Film critics Molly Haskell and Phillip Lopate talk about the film and how it came to signify the genre of the ""screwball comedy"" and they also discuss Capra's filming techniques.""Fulta Fisher's Boarding House"" -- silent short film (12:03-min/ 1921)Capra's first movie that was based on a story/ballad by Rudyard Kipling.""Frank Capra's American Dream"" -- documentary (01:36:02-min/ 1997)Hosted and narrated by director Ron Howard this full length documentary shows Capra from his humble beginnings to becoming a  powerful director/story teller. And it shows the ugly side of America's past as Capra was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy witch hunts. It also talks about Frank's last movie he directed (which was a remake of his own ""Lady For a Day"" and that was ""Pocketful Of Miracles"") and it's ironic for me because this remake starring Bette Davis was the movie that introduced me to Frank Capra. He became disillusioned with Hollywood and making films because the studios no longer trusted the director and all movies were now being star driven -- in this case it was Glenn Ford who was calling the shots, I don't know why since I never saw Ford as that big of a star or money maker -- and the ""star"" was basically telling the director how to make the movie. Another interesting note is that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was not a commercial success when it was released, only to be rediscovered years after, which  would then become the great Christmas classic we all know now.""AFI - American Film Institute - Tribute To Capra"" --  special (59:11-min/ 1982)From its 10th anniversary, the AFI salutes Frank Capra and features many of the Hollywood greats that starred in his movies including Bette Davis, Jimmy Stewart, Claudette Colbert, and Peter Falk. There are also many other celebrity cameos as they reminisce and talk about Capra who was present with his wife and children and grand kids. I must say that I was impressed with Colbert's speech: she went up on the stage and gave a touching recollection of working with Frank and Gable and IHON and she did so without cue cards and no teleprompter (most of the other celebs on stage including Davis and Stewart used cards which is why I noticed).TrailerMini Poster with close-up picture of Colbert and Gable along with information about the transfer and liner notes including an essay by Farran Smith Nehme who blogs about classic films.I think the CRITERION BLURAY of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is definitely worth buying for all movie lovers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HMUAO45QKOUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRKX9PO#wasThisHelpful","R3HMUAO45QKOUR","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wonderful and inspirational book that features men from all walks of life.What I really like about Guiseppe Santamaria's book MEN IN THIS TOWN: LONDON, TOKYO, SYDNEY, MILAN AND NEW YORK is that he photographs men of different colors and ages, and with different styles of dress, so you aren't just looking at guys wearing 3-piece suits.There are several spotlight interviews with a few guys in the book, but for the most part this book has limited text descriptions of the outfits.The pages are printed on thick, but matte pages and it comes with its own bookmark.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OMISBPES8RLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742707815#wasThisHelpful","R2OMISBPES8RLF","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although I like the graphics and the shape of the I LOVE LUCY HEART SHAPED CALENDAR, it's only half the size of my previous ""I Love Lucy 2014"" wall calendar by Mead.Because of its unique shape this calendar is folded in half for display purposes meaning that the date part is actually contained in the rectangular-shaped bottom, while scenes from the show are in the heart shaped part (the Mead calendar had the picture on the top half and the dates on the bottom half so it was larger and easy to see). That makes seeing the date or any written in schedules hard to see unless close-up.Even though I schedule appointments and dates into my phone calendar, I still write them in on the wall calendar as a reminder because I hang the calendar next to my bed and can see the month's schedule.I should've paid more attention to this detail.

"I've been using the L'OCITANE SHEA BUTTER BODY LOTION on my hands and feet just before bedtime for the past month and I am impressed with how it softens my skin, making it appear healthy and smooth.The cuticles around my fingers are excessively dry and cracked, I usually get hang-nails easily and I have to clip them with cuticle cutters, and I get the same on a couple of my toes (not so much the cuticles but the front of the toes) and using the L'OCCITANE every night and those issues have been minimized greatly.I still have some dry spots on my right thumb and some on my middle finger of the right hand, but otherwise my hands look and feel healthy. Likewise, my feet are in much better shape and I can go much longer in-between using the Ped-Egg on the dry calluses than before I was using the lotion.I knocked off one-star because the lotion is somewhat greasy after you put it on, but it does dry pretty fast, and there is a floral type scent that reminds me of the ""Rose Milk"" lotion or Nivea type lotions, so it lingers for a while, but it isn't overpowering.Because it is a fairly heavy-type lotion, I don't want to use it on my body because I tend to break out.

"This is the first time that I have watched DOUBLE INDEMNITY 70TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION and it looks great on Blu-Ray. The transfer is fantastic with sharp image resolution and dark blacks, which is really important since light and shadow play such a HUGE role in the way the film was made and also to punctuate the storyline.Allegedly this movie is what started the whole ""film noir"" genre and rightfully so.The movie revolves around a woman (Stanwyck) who plans to get out of an unhappy marriage by luring a smooth talking insurance salesman (MacMurray) -- by seducing him -- and then making him do the unthinkable. However, the insurance salesman's co-worker, a claims manager (Robinson) starts putting pieces of the puzzle together and that's where the story starts getting even more suspenseful!After watching DOUBLE INDEMNITY,  I see why many refer to it as THE classic film noir movie.Anyway, the DOUBLE INDEMNITY 70TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION comes with digital download (works on Ultra Violet & iTunes I don't see an expiration date listed), 5 reproductions of lobby type cards which are the size of a standard DVD/BR clamshell case, commentary, featurette, and TV movie.*** EXTRAS **** Introduction -- Turner Classic Movie (TCM)  host and film historian Robert Osborne provides an intro to the movie and gives some insight.* Featurette -- (2006 - 37:56-min.) -- ""Shadows Of Suspense""This featurette has some major Hollywood players including director William Friedkin, Cinematographer Owen Roizman, Author James Ellroy, Film Professor Drew Casper, Time Magazine film critic Richard Schickel and others who talk about ""Double Indemnity"" and how the movie came about.

"The BEST OF HULLABALOO COLLECTION 2 DVD is wonderful to watch and is hosted by a very young George Hamilton and features live performances by The Ronettes, The Hollies, The Impressions, Brenda Lee, Noel Harrison, The Womenfolk, and Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders.There's some other performance clips which I believe are from another show and they feature The Everly Brothers with Steve Lawrence, and Peter & Gordon with Michael Landon, and Cannibal & The Headhunters.Picture quality is fair and it's shown in black and white and not in color as shown in the inset pictures on the DVD cover art. I think these are from the Kinescope copies of the HULLABULOO shows and are the only original masters that exist, so the picture quality can't be fixed beyond what is presented here. That's why I gave this DVD 4-stars. Even though the picture quality isn't the best it doesn't interfere with viewing pleasure.The show starts with the opening jingle and the ""Hullabuloo dancers"" and is a hoot to watch. I wasn't alive back then, so I never saw the show as it was presented, so I can't comment on whether or not the format is the same. From what I've seen, the first 90% of this DVD is from one show.Included is a special featurette that interviews one of the dancers!  SPECIAL FEATURE* Donna McKechnie Interview -- 19:43 min -- 2013Present day interview with Hullabaloo dancer Donna McKechnie who talks about the show, filming live in front of an audience, the 60s, the hosts of ""Hullabaloo"" like Sammy Davis, Jr., and acts like Petula Clark, the Supremes and others. She also talks about famed and legendary Broadway choreographer Michael Bennett who was also a dancer on the show (who knew?) and what it was like working with him.I hope that these interviews are featured on the other editions of the HULLABALOO DVDS because it brings insight into the show and the people on it. It would be interesting to know who the other dancers were and where did they end up, not to mention what was their experience like.If you enjoy 60s music or are a history buff or just a fan of classic television shows, I would definitely recommend this DVD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIO1NMYJ4DLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQRNM0A#wasThisHelpful","R1YIO1NMYJ4DLH","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose the DOVE ADVANCED CARE ANTIPERSPIRANT & DEODORANT because I wanted something unscented and it seems that most deodorant sticks on the market have perfume or other strange stuff in it -- especially those marketed toward men.The DOVE is unscented and goes on smooth and keeps wetness and odor away, but I don't really perspire too much under my arms. Being unscented it won't clash with or change the fragrance of your cologne or perfume so you don't have to pick one over the other. Also, I don't have really strong body odor, like some guys, so I don't know if this will work on men or women with that type of skin chemistry.I deduct one-star because you have to massage the deodorant in after you apply it because it leaves a white film that can transfer to dark color clothes.Otherwise it's pretty good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RYFWHWGUY2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GY2B6L0#wasThisHelpful","R25RYFWHWGUY2W","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The RUTA-SLEEP AID PILLS works but you must take it about 2-hours before you want to go to sleep. I have a sleep disorder called ""delayed sleep phase syndrome,"" which is a circadian rhythm issue usually affecting blind people, and that makes falling asleep at night difficult for me. Some call it being a night owl, but since I have to be up in the daytime (that's when I'm usually sleepy) to go to work, I need a sleep aid at night.Supposedly, RUTA-SLEEP uses the extra time to clear your body of any caffeine and then the melatonin takes effect. I took it according to the directions and after about an hour and half I started to feel very drowsy. I went to sleep pretty fast after that and slept pretty much through the night, getting up only to use the bathroom.The reason I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because  a 3mg Melatonin tablet, taken sublingual (under the tongue), works a lot faster. Within 30-minutes of taking a 3mg Melatonin tablet, I'll be very relaxed and drowsy and able to drift off to sleep, so I usually do that instead.Otherwise the RUTA-SLEEP  AID works but I like the Melatonin pill better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GXAD68CIH98D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLERZC4#wasThisHelpful","R1GXAD68CIH98D","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These MILK BONE BRUSHING CHEWS are great to give to your dog to chew on. They aren't super hard like Nyla-Bones, but they aren't soft/hard like Greenies.I've given one chew every 2-3 days to my 3-year old Shiba and she loves them. She doesn't like most ""dental chews"" like Terra-Bones or the breakable Nyla-Bones (the ones that look like hardened biscuits), so I was surprised that she enjoys these.I brush her teeth once a week, sometimes I skip a week, but she gets a Greenie every night before bed. Her teeth are pretty clean and it seems that the MILK BONES BRUSHING CHEWS help remove some food stains from her teeth.They come in a resealable bag and the mini-size is just right for her small mouth.

"I love the Barbra Streisand/George Segal movie, ""The Owl & The Pussycat,"" and have always enjoyed hearing the soundtrack music while watching the movie (that was done by the group Blood, Sweat & Tears), but for years it has been out of print.Finally, Wounded Bird Records has reissued it in this CD RARE, RARER & RAREST. It also includes other hit songs by Blood, Sweat & Tears including ""Spinning Wheel,"" their hit cover version of Brenda Holloway's ""You've Made Me So Very Happy,""  and Laura Nyro's ""And When I Die,"" so there's much more on this CD than just the soundtrack.I never had the original LP of The Owl & The Pussycat, but going by other reviewers there was incidental dialogue from the movie on the record. This CD has no dialogue just the music and it's FANTASTIC!The only way to actually make this better would be to add the original dialogue/music background tracks as bonus tracks, but it's fine the way it is. I also wished there had been liner notes included in this release because I'm curious as to why dialogue was added to the original soundtrack album in the first place (did the record producers feel that they had to have Barbra on the record for it to sell?) and I'd like to know why the album was out-of-print for so long?On a side note, this was Streisand's first non-singing role in a movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU0FFQ4538NVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CS45CGI#wasThisHelpful","RU0FFQ4538NVB","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The FRESH GUARD SOAK is AMAZING! Before trying it, I was cleaning my night guard with the big orthodontic brush that my dentist gave me (when I got the guard for teeth grinding) and leaving it at that, which I thought was fine and didn't realize how dirty it was getting.So when this stuff came up on Amazon Vine, I decided to give it a try. I didn't even know that there was such a thing! I thought all the cleaners out there were for dentures only.Anyway, after the first use my night guard was dramatically cleaner -- I could see the difference -- and with subsequent cleanings it looks almost brand new. It's clear and I can practically see through it whereas before there was a dingy opaqueness on the guard. It even cleaned the crud out of the bottom of my tooth brush cup that I use to rinse after brushing!I'm cleaning once a week and that's seems to be just the right amount of time to keep my night guard in clean condition.* Easy To Use* Minty Scent* Cleaning Water Turns Blue (when the Fresh Guard pellets are added) Then Turns Clear When Finished* Removes Crud & Stains On My Night Guard & CupI'll be buying this product from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H51J75JR4B2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNKXSZO#wasThisHelpful","R1H51J75JR4B2H","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This this is TERRIBLE. It worked in the beginning, but I still had to hold onto the WRAPTASTIC while pulling the plastic wrap out to unroll it. I had used the remaining roll of GLAD CLING WRAP in it until I used it up and then I switched to the included plastic wrap, which was AWFUL!On that roll, it would NOT unroll at all with the lever in it, which keeps the plastic wrap from sticking to itself, and so I took it out. Then half of it decides to stick to itself and when I tried to unroll it the plastic wrap just tears down the middle. This happened over and over again and finally the torn part just kept on unraveling, so I couldn't get it back evenly, and I decided to switch to the GLAD CLING WRAP.And low and behold the large roll doesn't fit. RIDICULOUS. Save your money and find something else. This thing is actually worse than the box the GLAD WRAP comes in.UPDATE 02/2015Both dispensers have been trashed. This happened awhile back and I forgot to update this review. Anyway, there are two prongs inside the WRAPTASTIC and one-side broke which made it difficult to use, and then the other side broke off. This made the device unable to open back, once you push down on it. And it happened to both dispensers. In my photo you see the little white stick at the top of the photo?

"Although it was a great idea, the GILLETTE BODY RAZOR FOR MEN needs some improving.Yes, it was much easier to shave the boys because of the rounded corners of the razor head, but for some reason it seemed to get clogged faster than my regular razor. At first I thought it was because the head was smaller on the body razor, but that's only an optical illusion; it appears smaller when looking at both the body razor and my Mach 3, but on closer inspection the razor is exactly the same size (see pics above).If GILLETTE made the razor's head longer, while keeping the rounded edges, I'm sure it wouldn't get clogged so fast.Another issue is the cheap feel of it! It really feels like a disposable razor rather than one you can buy refill heads for. I don't know if this was due to trying to keep the razor light-weight, but it feels really delicate.Likewise, the release button for the cartridge feels very flimsy, not at all like the Fusion or Mach 3, and so I'm not sure how long the handle would last.And it doesn't come with a holding case or cover for the head, just the cheap plastic it came in (see photo), so none of this screams a razor that you'd want to keep and refill. I did double check to make sure this was NOT a disposable razor and it isn't; there are razor cartridges that you can purchase.Aside from these issues, the GILLETTE BODY RAZOR does the job and makes it a lot easier to shave downstairs. When Gillette makes those fixes above this razor will be a 5-star game changer -- at least for the body. The razor itself is reasonably priced, but until those fixes are in, I'm not sure if the upgrade is worth it? The cartridges still cost double the price of the razor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZWKO9MOREPPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HF3XSRW#wasThisHelpful","RZWKO9MOREPPS","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find the KING OSCAR SARDINE WITH JALAPENO delicious! The jalapenos give it a nice kick and the spiciness cuts down on the unctuous taste of the olive oil, so it's a good combination. Normally I buy my sardines packed in water because I'm not too fond of that oily olive oil taste, but with the added cut jalapenos I like it.Even though the jalapenos are cut and layered on top of the sardines, the fish have picked up some of the heat, so picking the peppers off won't help if you're giving them to someone who doesn't want any hotness on their tongue or is sensitive to spicy foods.To me the hot scale is medium-hot, whereas something like Sriracha Hot Sauce I consider hot, so keep that in mind. I like spicy foods so what might be medium-hot to me maybe too hot for those who only want mild heat.Anyway, these sardines are great for snacking on. Here's a tip: add some soy sauce to it to further reduce the oiliness of the olive oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VG7HR2HB20TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDM5IE8#wasThisHelpful","R2VG7HR2HB20TX","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the TOPEAK CAGE MOUNT  to use with the TOPEAK MODULA CAGE EX WATER BOTTLE HOLDER to hold my Polar Water Bottle on my bike.When I was installing it, I thought that the mount wasn't going to hold securely to the bike's frame because when I adjusted the metal strip (you can't see the strip until you take it apart) to the hole that was closest to the frame it wasn't shut all the way and the next hole was too small. But as I tightened the nut inside the body of the mount, the ring did tighten nicely.There's a piece of rubber/plastic that keeps the metal strip from coming into contact with the bike's frame and it keeps it held flush and securely.I took one star off because you have to buy these things (water cage AND the mount) separately!

"I never knew that Ren Woods had released a couple of albums since they weren't commercial hits. However I remember her from her acting work in the movies ""Car Wash"" --even though she had such a small role-- and in her dynamic vocal performance in Milos Forman's screen adaptation of the rock musical ""Hair."" Again Woods only had a tiny role, she sang the opening song ""Aquarius"" in the movie and that was it, but it left an indelible impression on me. She also had small acting roles on television.Anyway, when I came across this re-release I was excited and turned to YouTube to hear some samples (I don't know why you can no longer sample songs on Amazon for certain CDs) and I was again blown away by that wonderful voice.This album came out in 1979, which was at the beginning of the backlash against disco music that eventually spun out of control and ended in Comiskey Park's ""Disco Demolition Night,"" so I can see why this album gained no traction or attention and it wasn't because of a lack of talent or shoddy slap-together material.It has an excellent disco sound, but not the overly lush orchestrations like the Andrea True Connection (More, More, More) or repetitive chants like Silver Convention (Fly, Robin, Fly). The sound on this album is more along the lines of Donna Summer with full lyrics and choruses and actual singing.The album was produced by Earth, Wind & Fire's guitarist, Al McKay, and it does have that sort of flavor, too. Most of the tracks are upbeat and danceable grooves, but there are a couple of ballads on here including the heart-aching ""I Need Someone To Touch Me,""  and ""I'm In Love With You"" that sounds a lot like Deniece Williams's ""I Found Love"" and ""Cause You Love Me.""Incidentally, Ren Woods sounds like a cross between Deniece Williams with shades of Stephanie Mills, but retains her own unique song styling and she can sing! Whether on ballads or the uptempo disco numbers, Woods handles both with ease. And the producers of the album allow that voice to shine, which is why I say that this album had top notch production.I can't express how many times I've been disappointed by finding re-released material that contained one strong single while the rest of the album tracks were filler! I found none of that on Ren Woods OUT OF THE WOODS EXPANDED EDITION CD. I enjoyed the CD from start to finish, including the bonus tracks.The CD contains liner notes written by music journalist Alex Henderson (Oct '13), which provides information on Woods, this album, etc. and why she hasn't been a more prolific recording artist.According to the liner notes, Woods is back in the recording studio and doing a cover version of the Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal's duet hit ""Saturday Love.""It's too bad that bad timing is to blame for this album tanking commercially because had it been a hit, there would've been more output from this wonderful singer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12749GY14C7WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FKJZ1JG#wasThisHelpful","R12749GY14C7WM","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The PETSAFE INDIGO FRESH FLOSS BONES MEDIUM might've been too big for my 3-year old Shiba. She's about 20lbs and the medium is recommended for dogs between 25-60lbs, which I didn't know when I chose them for my Vine selection.Anyway, I've got a picky dog! She did eat the first one, which took her a while, licking it, whimpering, licking it, and then finally gnawing on it like she should, but maybe because of the size she didn't want to be bothered by them again. I'm sure if they tasted more like meat she would've made the effort, but I guess the payoff wasn't worth it.I tried to break one of the FLOSS BONES in half so she could chew it easily, but they're really hard and rubbery, so it wasn't possible. They also give off a sour type of scent, which might be the blueberry juice in them, I'm not sure, but my dog won't eat them anymore.I think this has to do with the size rather than the taste, but like I said I've got a picky dog when it comes to dental cleaning treats. She loves Greenies and Bully Sticks, but won't touch Terrabones, so go figure.Anyway, the medium size is for bigger dogs 25-60lbs and the bag says that these treats are NOT recommended for dogs under 5lbs or under 6-months of age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQPMKMSBVVLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLQWSCI#wasThisHelpful","R2RQPMKMSBVVLU","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading the product description, I was hoping to use the TP-LINK TL-WR710N MINI ROUTER as a Wi-Fi booster in ""repeater mode"" because the reception in my home-office is somewhat weak.I'm not an IT expert but I have been able to configure another portable mini-router before, which I use when I go on vacation, so I figured that I could do the same with this one but I couldn't get it to work in that mode.First of all the Ethernet cable that is supplied is so short that it makes it difficult to set-up the TP-LINK MINI ROUTER for any use other than the default setting of wireless router. For the other selection modes (client-repeater-access point-WISP client) you have to have the mini router connected to your computer and an AC outlet, so that you can change the configuration from the default setting. Also, in the instructions it says that the light on the device is blue, but it was green on mine, and there's no legend for other colors; it's either a solid light or a blinking one, so that was a little confusing.BTW, I did this on my Sony Vaio laptop, Win 7 (OS-Operating System)/64-bit.I followed the instructions for ""repeater/client mode"" and everything went as outlined: I was able to sign into the TP-LINK setup page, set the router to ""repeater"" and then have it search for available Wi-Fi networks. It found mine and I selected it, put in the SSID password, and then clicked ""reboot,"" which restarts the router with the new settings.I removed the Ethernet cable and I looked down at my Wi-Fi settings in Windows and saw that the signal strength was indeed boosted and described as 'excellent,' but when I tried to access the internet I got nothing. No connection at all, so I tried to do the entire process again and as soon as I plugged in the Ethernet cable to my lap top, I was able to access the internet, but if I removed it I got nothing -- even though the Wi-Fi signal was full strength.According to the instructions, once you reboot you must sign on to the Wi-Fi using the ""instant wireless connection"" instructions, which says that you must select the TP-LINK's SSID and sign on that way, but I don't see it in my list of available Wi-Fi networks! So I went through the same set-up process a few more times, thinking maybe I missed a step, but to no avail. The TP-LINK MINI ROUTER  doesn't show up for me to sign on, and if I sign on using my regular SSID, I get nothing! It connects but then I have no internet use whatsoever.Since I don't want to screw everything up on my computer, I'm going to leave it alone for right now until I can ask our IT guy when he comes around again.I give it 3-stars because it did boost signal strength and it did work while tethered to my laptop's Ethernet port, which means it was receiving the Wi-Fi signal from my office network (I checked my computer settings that confirmed that it was receiving the Wi-Fi signal through the MINI-ROUTER, which was then transferring it to my laptop through the Ethernet port giving me an internet connection, and not through my normal Wi-Fi port on my laptop), so it might be a user error (on my part) type of situation and the fix could be really simple, but I don't know what it is.The process should be a lot easier if you're only using the device as a router like in a hotel room since it should be plug and play.If I do find the solution I'll update this review, but in the meantime I better leave well enough alone because I don't want to really screw up my office network.UPDATE 03/05/14I have upgrade my review to 5-stars. Thanks to another Amazonian, C B, who suggested I try using IE in the comments section, I was able to get the device working as a repeater by using Internet Explorer to set it up! I knew it might've been something simple, but I didn't know what! I was using Firefox initially and although it allowed me to set-up the TP LINK I couldn't get a connection unless it was connected to my computer. Now, it's working like it should and boosting my existing router's signal strength to full and I don't have it hardwired.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OY6G7J5VE01I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRMAOIO#wasThisHelpful","R2OY6G7J5VE01I","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm slowly but surely becoming a BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA convert! I really like the BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA NIGHT CREAM AHA (Alpha-Hydroxy-Acid) because it goes on thick and velvety, but has absolutely NO GREASY feel or look, including the next day!Normally when I use a night time facial cream that moisturizes, my face will end up looking like a grease pit in the morning -- but not with this cream. I have combination, oily with dry areas, skin and I occasionally breakout, but experienced no adverse reaction to this cream; it left my skin feeling nicely hydrated and soft.I don't have deep wrinkles, but I do have some fine lines on my forehead and in-between my eyebrows and after using the BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA NIGHT CREAM for nearly a month the lines have softened a bit. I'm sure with continued use they'll be almost non-existent.This cream, like all other BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA products, is supposed to be specifically formulated for men's skin, which tends to be thicker and oilier than women's, according to research, and so perhaps that's why it works better than the average night cream that you find in the drugstores.Although it's described as an Alpha-Hydroxy Acid cream it won't leave you red with burned and peeling skin like a prescription one (i.e. Retin-A), so don't worry about that unless you have the most sensitive of skin. You should also wear a sunscreen in the daytime after you start using this cream because AHA creams leave the skin ultra-sensitive to sunlight and UV rays, and so your skin is more susceptible to getting burned (even when you'd normally tan).I highly recommend this cream to guys of all ages! Although the price might turn some men off you're really getting a lot for your money because you only need to apply a little bit and it is a fairly large sized tube. Most men should definitely add products to their hygiene routine, other than soap and shaving cream, so that they can look their best no matter what age they are and BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA can help with that.PLUSES* Safety-Sealed* Thick, Velvety Texture* Slight Scent of Soap(?)* Non-Greasy* Large ""Tooth-Paste"" SizeMINUSES* None","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ECPOW26E0AQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z61PR6#wasThisHelpful","R3ECPOW26E0AQL","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really surprised at how well the BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA OIL FREE MOISTURIZER performed on my skin. I have combination oily and sometimes dry skin, but mostly oily in the ""T-Zone"" area, which is the forehead, nose and chin.This moisturizer immediately absorbed into my face and my skin felt hydrated. It left no oily shine or texture and it doesn't feel oily or leave your face with a greasy after feel. And my face was pretty much shine-free for the rest of the day at work.BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA OIL FREE MOISTURIZER has no scent and is formulated for men's skin. I don't know if I really believe that there's that much of a difference between guys' and gals' skin (research says that there is and men tend to have thicker, oilier skin than their female counterparts) but this moisturizer works much better than other ""oil-free"" ones that I've tried.I'm also experiencing better performance from other BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA products like the body lotion, so maybe there is some difference in how a product is formulated and whether it's designed for male or females.The only reason I don't give a full five stars is because the moisturizer doesn't contain a sunscreen so you'll have to do an extra step if you're going to be out in the sun at all. Also, for those with really dry skin, or patches of dryness caused by chemical peels or acne medication, this moisturizer won't be able to do the job on those areas.I break out occasionally and use acne products that contain Benzoyl Peroxide, which my skin can handle most of the time, but every now and then the medicine will cause me to get extremely dry patches of skin and the BAXTER OF CALIF OIL FREE didn't help in those areas.Other than those two issues this is a great product line for men!PLUSES* Safety Sealed* Non-Scented* Large ""Toothpaste"" Sized Tube* Hydrating Matte FinishMINUSES* No Sunscreen* Won't Help Extremely Dry Areas","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFFFOJ7TPFKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009GIHT6#wasThisHelpful","ROFFFOJ7TPFKT","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because it doesn't contain alcohol you don't get that extreme tingle/sting like most other toners, but it still feels refreshing.I highly recommend the toner and although it costs more than a drugstore brand, you only need to use a little of it.

"I bought THE ART OF MANLINESSS: CLASSIC SKILLS AND MANNERS FOR THE MODERN MAN in the ""Art Of Manliness Collection"" Cigar Box Set, which also includes the other book ""The Art Of Manliness: Manvotionals,"" but I haven't read that book yet, so I'm just reviewing this one.The book has a lot of useful information that guys can use like how to tie a tie, folding a pocket square, different types of cuffs on pants, and how to iron a shirt; it also includes great information on etiquette and behaving like a gentleman in public and private. It also includes stuff like how to jump start a dead car battery, pitching a tent, clean a fish, make a camp fire and how to administer first aid to a snake bite victim or saving a drowning person. Other nuggets of information include how to be a responsible father and husband and how to be a good friend to other men.I give it only four stars because the book focuses entirely on heterosexual men. With chapters on dating females and taking care of a pregnant wife, etc., THE ART OF MANLINESS: CLASSIC SKILLS AND MANNERS FOR THE MODERN MAN missed the opportunity that could've addressed sexual orientation by letting readers know that being a ""real man"" has little to do with sexual preference or machismo. Perhaps the authors didn't know how to broach the subject or they didn't want to confuse the issue, but if the goal of this book was to teach young men how to be ""gentlemen"" then it should have been addressed. As it is any young gay man reading this book will probably feel that they've been left out and therefore can't be a ""man,"" while others will think in the stereotypical ideal of a chest thumping, war mongering ""manly man"" which is unfortunate because those readers will miss the point of this book.Likewise, although the book contains lots of great advise, some of the suggestions on how to treat women harkens back to the days when females were seen as weak and ineffectual and some women might take offense at that type of behavior.Aside from those issues this book is still a worthy buy and would make great gifts for young men and guys in general who either grew up without a male figure in their lives or who have had fathers who weren't very helpful when it comes to things like this because of lack of knowledge or experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJS8BLL4JJEEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600614620#wasThisHelpful","RJS8BLL4JJEEB","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are very few new TV shows out there that have been able to catch my interest, but SHERLOCK is definitely one that I'm hooked on. After watching a first few episodes from SHERLOCK SEASON 1 for free (because of Prime membership) on my Kindle, I knew this was a show that I could get into and so I bought the first season on Blu-Ray.SHERLOCK SEASON TWO continues on with the great formula that they started in the first season with the graphic embellishments and updating the original stories to match a modern context. Chemistry between Holmes (Cumberbatch) and Watson (Freeman)-- and consequently their relationship -- continues to evolve and there's a shocking cliff hanger on the last episode ""The Reichenbach Fall,"" but I won't give it away.Anyway, definitely pick this up if you like well-acted, brilliantly written, and cunningly executed TV shows. Although there are only three episodes in this season, they run about 90-minutes each (about the length of a feature film), so it doesn't feel like you're being short changed.BONUS CONTENT""Sherlock Uncovered"" -- Featurette 19:06-minutesShows behind-the-scenes footage and has interviews with cast and producers, including Cumberbatch and Freeman, and the show's co-creators and Executive Producers Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss (Mycroft Holmes).Even if you're a fan of the classic Sherlock Holmes movies -- which I love -- that starred Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, or even the new ones with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, I believe that you'll enjoy this incarnation with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.I can't wait to get SHERLOCK SEASON THREE, which I already pre-ordered, and I hope that this show will continue on for many more seasons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIB8CWE9VUPY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QOB8SY#wasThisHelpful","RIB8CWE9VUPY1","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although some might balk at the price of the BANANARAMA CD SET, as of this writing it's about $26.00, you're actually getting a good deal. The release by Edsel/Rhino has 2 CDs with bonus tracks including different mixes and versions of the songs contained on the self-titled second album from Bananarama, including the song ""The Wild Life,"" which was added on the cassette back in the 80s but missing from the first CD version of this album. Plus, you also get a DVD that has all the music videos released for the singles from BANANARAMA and performances on the BBC!But the goodies don't stop there! There's also a booklet that features color and b&w photos of the group and the various album art from different countries, as well as song credit, and the lyrics to all of the songs -- including the bonus ones. This is especially appreciated because most of the really good reissue companies like Big Break Records don't include the lyric sheet with their reissues opting to focus on interviews and other info from the recording sessions instead.There's also liner notes written in August 2013 by the reissue producer, Tom Parker, that provides the background information of  what happened between the group's first release and this one, and the inspiration behind each of the songs. I didn't know that group (Sara Dallin, Keren Woodward and Siobahn Fahey) also contributed to the writing of the songs on BANANARAMA and many of them had strong lyrics dealing with social issues, which was belied by their angelic harmonies.The discs are housed in medium weight cardboard sleeves with a cut-out notch at the top and bottom, allowing part of the disc to be visible, so they can be accessed and put away easily, and the set is looks like a hardcover book. I would use the term ""digi-pack,"" but this is much more sturdier than most digi-packs that feature only a cardboard cover (like a mini album replica). One note though, the inside of the sleeve isn't laminated as much as I think it should be (I don't even really know if that makes a difference) so I don't know if repeated taking the discs in and out would cause scratches. Normally I'll place the discs in a CD case but I'll probably leave them as is in this situation.If you're a fan of the group than I would definitely recommend picking this up because not only is it worth it, but it lets companies that take the time and care to reissue older music with care that there is a market out there and if they make it we will buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O4S30F9JYZUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9JQHFU#wasThisHelpful","R3O4S30F9JYZUM","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I thought that the PERFECT FITNESS RIP DECK SYSTEM was only designed to do fly pushups using the Perfect Pushup concept, but it does much more!You can do fly pushups, but you can also do regular Perfect Pushups, Normal Pushups, Forearm Fly Pushups, and you can separate the two sides and use the sliders under your feet to assist in either doing the Chaturanga or Plank Run!Some simple assembly is required, not involving tools, but it's very easy and fairly quick. Here's the rundown:GOOD* Mutli-Use -- allows for multiple exercises on one machine including fly-pushups and regular pushups.* Secure Perfect Push-up Positions -- has two clip locks that will keep the sliders from sliding so you can position yourself in the correct alignment for wide, regular, and close Perfect Pushup positions. This takes the guess work out of how far or close the Perfect Pushup paddles are supposed to be for that particular exercise, which is great for beginners.* Tracks Separate -- the two tracks, left and right, separate so that you can use the sliders vertically, under your feet, to do plank or Chaturanga run (P90-P90X).* Hand Grips -- snap in and out easily. This allows you to use the paddles for either the run or the forearm fly pushup. And you can use just the paddles on the ground like regular pushup bars, so that they don't rotate, which is good if you're not ready for the rotation pushups.BAD* Workout Instructions -- these are not included, at least not in my set, so you have to print them out from the company's website.Once you figure it out and put the RIP DECK SYSTEM together, you'll find that it's really clever and works well. I have the older and newer sets of the PERFECT PUSHUP PADDLES and have been using them off and on in my workouts for a while to get better results and to do pushups more effectively.If you aren't strong enough to pushup, you can also do these on your knees so you don't have to be super strong or physically fit. Also, there's a 300-pound weight limit on the RIPDECK, so keep that in mind.Anyway, I recommend the RIP DECK for home gym use and should make a great addition to your workout arsenal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2565TY0UDSUA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW0V2EC#wasThisHelpful","R2565TY0UDSUA3","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The AXE STYLING CONTROL CREAM PEACE provides a light-medium hold and has a matte finish.It comes in a jar with instructions printed under the cap and has a soft and pliable consistency, so you can easily dip your finger in and spread it through dry hair without struggling like with hardened wax hair products.The hold is touchable, tames frizzy and flyaway hairs, but you won't be able to do any extreme styles with it. Likewise, it doesn't do much to texturize the hair and give it separation, but makes the hair bond together. I also discovered that when I run my hands through my hair hours after, I feel a little tackiness on my palms so it seems like it transfers.This product also has that ""Axe"" scent, but it seems less than the usual strength, which is good because I don't like that cloying smell.Overall it's not bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O5NQIBXAIZB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUC7XAW#wasThisHelpful","R1O5NQIBXAIZB1","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The GENTLEMAN: A TIMELESS GUIDE TO FASHION book by Bernhard Roetzel is beautifully bound and has really thick, high quality pages.There's lots of pictures and good tips on how to iron a shirt, how to tie a tie, how to properly wash your hair, etc., and it also includes interesting bits of information on the history and evolution of men's clothes and why certain things are the way they are. It also takes the reader behind the scenes with step-by-step photos of how good shoes are made, and how they hand craft suits, while supplying information on what is appropriate attire when one is out and about at different functions. It also includes good tips on cleaning and storing suits and shirts etc. and should come in handy to almost every reader out there.Keep in mind that this is based on European/British clothing styles and so many references are to where the suit or jacket originated and how they are worn today (like one must wear certain clothes and hat at a particular horse race) are given in a British context, but Roetzel also discusses US and Italian styles and how they all differ.This isn't a ""wear this"" type of book, but does offer suggestions on what goes with what. It's more of a general book about sophisticated and elegant dressing for the ""gentleman,"" think old school/Golden Age of Hollywood types like Fred Astaire and William Holden, so don't expect to see popular designers or anything like that in this book.The one thing that I wish it had was that on certain sections like when its discussing the different types of shirt collars, it would have helped greatly to the reader if the parts of the collar being referred to were highlighted, so one can get a clearer understanding of the differences.Otherwise the book is really nice and enjoyed reading it. Also bear in mind that a lot of the stuff presented in here is TOP-OF-THE-LINE items that many of us won't be able to afford, nor would want to, but you get a good idea of what's elegant or timeless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FX8WWUC9ZHON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3848002620#wasThisHelpful","R2FX8WWUC9ZHON","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 20 FEET FROM STARDOM BLU-RAY is a fascinating look at the unsung heroes -- the unknown backup singers -- who really push good songs into the stratosphere and make them iconic. It's amazing that most people will know these popular songs, will know the chorus and can identify the background singers' sound, but not be able to name them.This documentary has two parallel story tracks, maybe three, aside from just getting the backup singers' individual stories and that helps focus the movie so it isn't just a bunch of talking heads. The documentary takes us into the fascinating story of Darlene Love, who was THE voice of the whole Phil Spector ""Wall Of Sound"" and how her voice was used in many number one hits, as lead singer, yet credit was given to other singers/groups (The Crystals). Once you hear Love's singing you'll know instantly that voice (if you're a fan of 60s girl group songs) and she represents one dynamic to the story.Contrasting that we are introduced to Judith Hill, who rose to fame being selected to take part in Michael Jackson's comeback tour before his untimely death a few years back, and she's young and starting her career. She's a triple threat being uniquely beautiful, an enormously talented singer, and she writes and plays music. Hill is desperately trying to avoid the pitfall of getting stuck and comfortable in the background and trying to achieve her dreams of solo stardom.And that brings us to the next dynamic in the story and that is Lisa Fischer. She was the incredibly GIFTED (and still is) singer who was Luther Vandross's protege. He took her on tour and gave her wings to fly. She released her solo album in 1990, SO INTENSE, which featured the number one hit single ""How Can I Ease The Pain,"" that she co-wrote, and won the Grammy (tied with the incomparable Patti Labelle -- no less), and was a monster success. But Fischer turned her back on all of that, instead choosing to remain a backup singer for which she was more comfortable, and one in high demand, traveling for the last 25 years with the Rolling Stones, as well as with Sting and others. I always wondered what happen to her and it's good to know she's still thriving. She represents the middle ground between Love and Hill, and she enjoys being able to continue sharing her gift, while at the same time still being able to be anonymous. Of course that's not good news for us fans! I've been waiting for the next Lisa Fischer CD to drop for more than a decade ever since I fell in love with that voice on her first album.Of course there are many other background singers featured in 20 FEET FROM STARDOM, I just chose those three to give you a sense of the story line, but other incredible singers featured are Tata Vega, Merry Clayton, Claudia Lennear, the Waters (Julia, Oren, Maxine - I wonder if these were the same ""Waters"" that were the Andantes at Motown?), Susaye Green, Edna Wright, David Lasley, Jo Lawry, Gloria Jones, among many others. And there's also a reunion of Darlene Love with her The Blossoms group mates Fanita James and Jean King. Many of these singers have released solo albums but, with the exception of Fischer, none ever reached critical acclaim or success that they deserved, not counting underground/cult followings. Hopefully this film will rectify that.Anyway, there's plenty of music and singing in the film and includes many archival footage of these singers in action. Also, though the film focuses mainly on female background singers there are male background vocalists too like David Lasley, Luther Vandross, Oren Waters and others which are featured throughout.Plus there are plenty of celebrities on hand as well like Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Bette Midler, Mick Jagger, and Stevie Wonder who express their deep gratitude to these unsung heroes and why they've been so important.******  BONUS BLU-RAY FEATURES  *******Deleted Scenes* -- 29:00-minutesHere you can select 'play all' or choose which scene you'd like to see and includes other interviews and shots not in the film.*Buddy System* -- 08:52-minutesFeaturette that explains the ""buddy system"" and how background singers will refer each other to sessions that they hear about and how the music industry is changing where it's becoming more difficult to find work, since most soloists are doing their own backgrounds or hiring family members to do them.*New York Times Talk* -- 29:24-minutesLive Q&A with Darlene Love, Lisa Fischer, Merry Clayton, and the director Morgan Neville on how the project got off the ground. Singer and prolific songwriter Valerie Simpson is in the audience.These are just some of the many stories out there about the highs and lows of being in the ""background,"" and it's both entertaining and heart-breaking at the same time. You do come to realize that many more factors come into play other than talent and ambition, or even fairness, when one is fortunate enough to realize their dream of being a star and here is the proof.Likewise, not every seminal background singer is featured here like Venetta Fields who was part of the Ikettes (in one iteration) and went on to become a very much in demand background singer for many superstars (Streisand, Ross, Quincy Jones, Joe Cocker, Rolling Stones to name a few) in the 70s.Another interesting story would've been Martha Wash, although she is featured in the bonus section in a short clip. Wash was another great singer who, along with Izora Rhodes-Armstead, started out as background singers for Sylvester and the two would become the Weather Girls. Wash would eventually go solo and then, like Darlene Love before her, sing lead on many huge hits in the 90s, particularly for groups like C.C. Music Factory and Black Box, but get no credit for it. Her story would've showed that stuff like this was still happening even in the current day.I also would've like to learn or hear more from those who started in the background but gained at least some success like Deniece Williams who was one of Stevie Wonder's background singers in a group called ""Wonderlove"" before she would achieve some acclaim with her solo records, hitting big in the 80s with ""Let's Hear For The Boy"" from the movie Footloose. And superstar Mariah Carey also got her start singing backup for Brenda K. Starr, so it would've been interesting on they were able to maneuver from the back to the front, but maybe those interviews would've detracted from the main story.Anyway, 20 FEET FROM STARDOM  is definitely a must see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12E8G653WRZDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1LRCY6#wasThisHelpful","R12E8G653WRZDQ","A32GCOTGFJ9XC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32GCOTGFJ9XC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have three criticisms of this lube, in this order:1. It does not absorb into the skin completely. It leaves a film when it dries down that is just the slightest bit sticky. The first time I realized this, I was looking at my arm in the morning light and thinking to myself ""what's that shiny stuff dried on my arm?"" It was this.2. It's a little bitter tasting. Like you just get a hint of soap flavor at the beginning, then it's sweet for a brief second, then nothing.3. It's the least lubricating lube that I've ever used. You know how when you spread water onto plastic it tends to form droplets instead of staying in a single glob? That's what this does. It behaves similarly to water on the skin. If it is spread thin, it won't stay put, separating into veins, leaving parts of skin without lubricant. No bueno.I will say this, it stays wet for the longest time. Some of it was on the bottle when I put it in the cupboard. I came back 3 months later and found the bottle looking like it had water on it.I'll be trying other things. And updating when I find something I like better.UPDATE 9/15/15: I tried Aloe Cadabra in Vanilla and like it much more than this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YVVGW1TN5NX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPQOJXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YVVGW1TN5NX7","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought 4 packs of these at Target, two in black, two in natural. The color was fine, black was a little sheerer than I expected, natural made my pale legs look naturally tanned.

The fabric is cheap, and I was actually appalled at the difference when I compared these with my trasparenze and JC Penny tights.Won't ever buy these again, complete waste of $40. I'd rather buy one pair of $20 tights that will last for months than two of these that won't last one use. JC Penny makes amazing tights that last much longer. I think the brand is called Sheer Caress. H&M also makes really nice tights, but I have long legs and I always felt that the crotch of them sits a little too low for me.

"I was curious about what the putty would feel like. It's oily feeling, but then kind of has an oobleck quality to it. The arrowroot powder behaves kind of like cornstarch, so that's probably why. I've had to remix it a few times, since it was so thin on the top and so thick at the bottom. Only a little of the product is needed. I found that if I put too much, it would roll off in white globs. Surprisingly, it didn't mark my black shirts.The deodorant works. Keeps me smelling good for a solid twelve hours. Doesn't smell like vanilla to me at all, hence the deducted star. Smells like 100% lavender, albeit a very soft, toned down, relaxing kind of lavender. The company packaged this BEAUTIFULLY and included a free eye serum.I probably won't repurchase, but not due to any flaw of the product.

"Buy direct from Pacifica. It will be fresh and you can earn rewards points.This is a nice and clean, mature, true vanilla smell that is not overly sweet. A toned down, cleaner vanilla extract smell. Not a warm vanilla at all, which I like. Can't stop smelling it. It kind of reminds me of the smell of homeopathic arnica that I took as a child. It dries down a little powdery smelling at first, and then it's just subtly sweet. As with all Pacifica perfumes, the scent wears off after only a few hours. For this one, I'd say about 5 hours, which is considerably longer than the rest of the Pacifica perfumes that I have tried. 8 hours in, it's still faintly detectable on the wrist where my Persian Rose perfume would have worn off hours before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30GL28L5G8XWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVRBGYM#wasThisHelpful","R30GL28L5G8XWR","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a prior customer of hydracentials, I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. My rating and review reflect my honest opinion.This lunch tote does keep things nice and cool. The fabric is thick and durable, and I can tell that it will hold up for a long time. I put it to the test against my trusty LL Bean lunch tote, putting a frozen water bottle in both and waiting 10 hours. This one kept the water bottle almost completely solid. LL Bean water bottle had melted down by 1/3. So it definitely is well insulated.It is bigger than most lunchbags I've owned. On the plus side of being big, lots of food can fit inside. I had no trouble fitting a big salad, cake, and a big bag of pretzels. It's too big to fit into a backpack, it's really meant to be carried on its own, so I don't think that this would be good for kids bringing their lunch to school.I'm deducting a star because I find that it's really hard to put over my shoulder: the strap isn't really long enough to be comfortable and the bottom of the tote is also a little too wide in the middle to comfortably rest between the body and arm.

It's a pain in the neck to get the wipes out unless you have the packs with the plastic closure. These are the best natural wipes that I've tried so far. I will update when I find better ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20P1QTBOS82XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUR3YDC#wasThisHelpful","R20P1QTBOS82XB","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All I can say is WOW. I always thought the Physician's Formula would be garbage because of it's cheap looking packaging. Boy am I kicking myself now. These are the most creamy, pigmented, long lasting, smudge proof eyeliners I have ever owned! My Mac and Urban Decay pencils don't hold a candle to these. I can put them on the back of my hand and wipe them a few seconds later, and they stay put! I am super impressed. Wore these for 12-hours and they looked THE SAME as when I put them on. Didn't even use a primer. There's a little sharpener on the bottom of the pencils that you would never know was there unless you read the packaging. Will be buying more colors in this line and repurchasing these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGOT3S5XYKYOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006RJRFBK#wasThisHelpful","RGOT3S5XYKYOY","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. If I didn't think it was great, I wouldn't give it 5 stars.I originally purchased the 25oz size for smoothies. I thought the 25oz size was sleek, but the 16oz is even sleeker and much easier to hold. I still use the 25oz bottle for my green smoothies, but I've been using the 16oz bottle for my lunch beverages - most recently, iced tea. It's the perfect size for accompanying a meal.My two small gripes with these bottles is that the straw at the very top is clear (so people can almost see what you are drinking) and the paint begins to wear off the edges at very bottom of the bottle with the normal wear and tear of setting it on surfaces. This could be prevented by adding some kind of protective barrier to the bottom. Non-slip silicone might be a nice addition. But in any case, the koozie that they sent to me is perfect for protecting the bottle, and it also helps keep the contents insulated for even longer.I love how it is opaque and how when liquid is sucked through the straw there is no unpleasant suction, like other straw water bottles. The straw is silent - there are no strange noises when I sip from it, which is nice when you work in a quiet office with lots of other people, like I do. Nothing comes shooting out of the straw when it's turned open after sitting for a long time, either.I'm also totally impressed by how well insulated these bottles are. I put my beverages in at 5-6AM and they stay cool well past 3PM. And no condensation on the outside of the bottle! I was a little nervous the bottle might be too cold and have condensation or leak when I first got it, but now I toss it into my bag without worry.It comes with two straws, which is nice if you are in a rush and don't have time to clean one of them. The company will also send a card with the bottle the tells you how to claim a nice little fabric cover free of charge. I just went to the webpage on the card and put in my Amazon order #. Then I get an email from the owner of the business asking what address I wanted the cover sent to. They sent a gray koozie, an extra straw, and two straw brushes, free of charge. Fabulous customer service. They really stand behind their products.I love how the bottle fits in my hand and how easy it is to hold onto. It just feels so well designed. I will be buying these for birthday gifts for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39KEJSGKQG2G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMYVSZM#wasThisHelpful","R39KEJSGKQG2G8","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This would be a great book for someone that is on the shy side, has never had phone sex, or talked dirty. It's a good, solid collection of sexy phrases and succinct explanations for why they work. As far as being a beginner's book, I think it falls a little short on how to describe what you're doing, going to do, or want done to you. But if you want to learn how to dirty talk or want liberate your partner into expression, this will suit your needs.It's not for the experienced, though. If you've had a fair share of phone sex, you won't find anything new here. It's a quick read, I finished it in about 15 minutes, but that may be because most of the phrases are things that I have heard and already say. Not much kinky stuff. I only found one phrase in the entire book that I had never heard before (#128). I bought this looking for new ideas, so I was a little disappointed. But I would definitely recommend it to newcomers or those that need a refresher.Update 7/20/15 -Wanted to come back here to share an insight I had about talking dirty. There's nothing worse than a predictable lover. All the hottest things that have ever been said, the things that really get people going or make them climax in an instant are... completely unfiltered, unedited. They are speaking exactly what is felt, direct responses to what the partner responds well to. It's instinctual. There's an element of unpredictability in the heat of the moment, the I-can't-believe-he-just-said-that kind of thrill. So in summary, good dirty talk is hot because 1) it shows your partner how in tune you are to them and 2) it's unpredictable. Don't go by what they found hot last time, go by what they moan to this time. Above all else, go by how enthusiastically your partner responds to your words and DON'T FILTER YOURSELF. Say exactly what you think in the tone you thought it in. If your partner likes teddy bears, talk teddy bears. When they respond well to a certain idea, take the idea a step further. If they don't respond as enthusiastically, don't sweat it, just take it back a step and go in a different direction. Let your instincts take over. I think this concept is applicable to good sex in general.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6V7N169Y2UA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C00QS4U#wasThisHelpful","R1G6V7N169Y2UA","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Essential Foundation Brush - Meh. Out of the entire range of RT brushes, I haven't used this one very often because I don't feel like it's big enough to apply foundation to my entire face. I usually reach for my Boots no. 7 or Mary Kay foundation brush. If you like your foundation brushes on the smaller side, you might like this.Multi Task Brush  YES. This brush is my most used out of all my RT brushes. I use it to apply powder foundation, blush, bronzer, highlighter, contour... just a GREAT brush overall, extremely versatile.Domed Shadow Brush  Great for blending eyeshadow. It's on the bigger side of eyeshadow brushes.Panoramic 2-in-1 brush case/stand  Meh, I tossed this because I found it a pain to use. I didn't like that it was always open and that my brushes weren't sealed off from the outside environment when the case was closed. I would prefer if they came in a case like the Sigma brushes, or if they included a cute little bag to keep them in, but that's just me. I don't like having to put each brush back into a specific place, and I feel like this gets dirty and isn't easy to clean.I could do my entire face with these three brushes. I would say that this is my favorite set of brushes out of all the RT brush sets.I've had the full set of these brushes since they first launched in 2012. Since getting them, I've used at least three of them every single day. That's two years of constant use, and they look and preform the same way they did the day I received them. Since getting the full line of these, I have not purchased a single new brush. My old mac brushes lay untouched in the back of my drawer. Not to mention that just one Mac brush costs as much as the whole set of these ones. Did I mention that you can now buy these at Walmart?These brushes are superior to animal hair brushes in every way. They are cruelty free. They are extremely easy to clean-- I timed myself, and I can wash twenty brushes in seven minutes. They do not get stained. I purposely didn't clean red OCC Lip Tar off of my lip brush for a month, and the lip tar came off as easily as any other product. (I use Trader Joe's Tea Tree Body Wash or just regular Equate hand soap to clean mine.) They  don't hold any funky smells or bacteria after washing, since the bristles aren't porous, unlike animal hair bristles. For the same reason, they dry off very fast. My RT face brush takes about 30 minutes to dry if I leave it damp on a washcloth, and I can dry it almost completely in a few seconds if I rub the brush against a sham. I've cleaned and dried my brushes right before using them to do my makeup regularly. My mac brushes take hours (sometimes days) to dry completely, even if I wipe them against a sham first. Another advantage of the non-porous bristles is that you don't have to condition them. After washing animal hair brushes, you are supposed to condition them with an oil or conditioner so they stay soft and don't get brittle. If you don't, your brushes will start shedding. The RT brushes don't need to be conditioned, and they don't shed.Then, they are soft. Softer than animal hair. They pick up product and dispense it with ease. Product doesn't linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product. Truly a pleasure to use and apply makeup with. My one small gripe is that sometimes product can get stuck on the black grip part of these brushes, but that is hardly an issue since it cleans right off. They just might look a bit dirty after rolling around in your makeup bag.These are so durable and have held up better than any brush I've ever had before. As I said before, I've been using them for two years already and they look and feel the same way they did the day I got them. I'm sure that they will last for years to come. I would give these to a friend. I would repurchase. Affordable, durable, just a great product. These would be a great gift to anyone that wears makeup. I would recommend these over any other brush on the market. I feel that this is a truly superior product in every way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLAKAO7C6FC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TSFEBY#wasThisHelpful","R1NLAKAO7C6FC7","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Detailer Brush - Smallest brush in the kit. I use this brush to apply lip tar and sometimes concealer. It's nice. It has a pointy end for very precise application.Pointed Foundation Brush - Nah. Out of the entire range of RT brushes, this is one of the ones I've used the least. It's really small. I feel it's way too small for foundation. It's more of a specialized kind of brush that could be used for getting foundation in a tricky place, applying highlighter, applying concealer, or possibly blending. I don't use this brush at all.Buffing Brush -  I use this brush every day. I use it to apply foundation, powder, powder foundation, bronzer, blush, highlighter, contour, or to just blend away edges. Extremely versatile and a good size.Contour Brush - I use this a few times a month. It's great for contouring under the jaw, but I find it too fluffy to contour my cheeks, nose, forehead, or chin. It does the job, but I prefer using my Becca paddle brush to contour, and my RT buffing brush to blend it.Panoramic 2-in-1 brush case/stand - Meh, I tossed this because I found it a pain to use.

"UPDATE 5/21/15- For the past six months, I have been using Bioderma's Cleansing Milk which I got for $6 on eBay by accident when I thought I was buying their micellar water. While the Bioderma Cleansing Milk may not be as soothing for dry skin as the NUDE cleanser, it is AMAZINGLY moisturizing, so much cheaper, and has replaced this product as my holy grail. The only situations I would recommend this product over the Bioderma is if you have 1) chronically dry skin, or 2) heavy duty costume makeup to remove.ORIGINAL REVIEW-This was the first Lisa Eldridge recommendation that I thought was going to be a total let-down. When I first tried it, my initial thought was ""it's just oil."" I needed two or three pumps of the stuff and it took my makeup off just like my other cleansers. Then, I gave it a second chance. That was when I realized how extremely gentle and extremely effective it was. It's easy to apply, it's pleasant to massage around the face, it cuts through heavy waterproof makeup with ease, it doesn't foam, it doesn't run into the eyes, it doesn't sting the eyes if you do, it washes off in a creamy milk that doesn't run off the face, and it doesn't dry out the skin. It's the perfect cleanser with none of the downsides of soap. Now my chronically dry skin doesn't feel parched after I cleanse. Also, the  dry patches of dead skin rub off easily while massaging the oil around to remove makeup. When I finish cleansing, my face is soft, like baby's skin. I will never use another cleanser. This is my holy grail. Will repurchase again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13C7BDA94QDHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFWRFKK#wasThisHelpful","R13C7BDA94QDHO","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this brush to apply my liquid foundations. It doesn't create streaks, and will apply the product as thinly as I please. It feels oh so soft against my face, and is a nice shape for getting into crevices. I do use my fingers to blend my foundation in for a seamless look, but I'm sure if I didn't want to get my hands dirty I could probably use this brush. I prefer a stiffer, denser brush for blending in foundation, like the Boots No. 7 foundation brush, but that is my preference. This brush isn't as stiff or dense. One thing I should note is that the metal part on the brush I received is silver, where the picture of the one here is black.

"This isn't an extraordinary thing. It's a stick of wax. It goes on matte, not shiny, and is, for all intents and purposes, invisible... so apply as much or as little as you need. I use this for taming my brows and keeping them neat looking. I don't use a brow powder with this. I definitely prefer this stick as opposed to the poured pots that you apply with a brush, which I think are better if you are applying brow color. I think the stick really helps mold things down and keep them looking tidy. It's especially good for in-between tweezing/trimming, when your brows are looking a little unruly. It molds them into shape with ease. It is a little hard to stick down unruly hairs that are really long or have a curl to them, so when I encounter those I usually just pluck them out. Would repurchase. I have occasionally seen drugstore brands of this that seem to work the same for cheaper.I am also a fan of Revlon's Brow Fantasy, but the brow fantasy gel doesn't last as long as this (8+ hours).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R219WCFW69W0EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048KSGZO#wasThisHelpful","R219WCFW69W0EU","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this after I saw Lisa Eldridge use it in her Kate Winslet red carpet video, since I have very red skin. I think it's just okay. It's a water-based moisturizer, hypoallergenic and unscented. It doesn't really give me the moisturizing my dry skin needs. It does reduce my redness, and the green tone of the product neutralizes the remaining redness. The weird thing about this product is that once it dries, it has a tendency to roll off my skin in green blobs... especially when I'm applying makeup. I am not sure if that is because I have dry skin, but I would not repurchase this.However, the La Roche Posay B5 Baume is an amazing product (my HG daytime moisturizer) that sucks the redness out of my skin and moisturizes very well.

"(I have this in Roseglow). I love this product. It's a light-weight illuminator, concealer, and corrector. It has a creamy consistency that tends towards slick rather than sticky, and translucent rather than opaque; especially when I compare it to my Laura Mercier secret concealer, which is incredibly sticky and opaque (the one in the pot, not the compact). Because the Dior Skinflash is so creamy, slick and slightly translucent, it's very easy to blend. Comparing this product to the By Terry equivalent (By Terry Touch Expert Advanced Multi Corrective Concealer Brush - # 1 Fair), I would say that this product is far superior. I purchased both products at about the same $40 price tag.I mainly use this to conceal my blue-ish undereye circles. Sometimes I also use it to highlight down my nose, the tip of my chin, and the tops of my cheekbones. If I'm feeling really lazy or my skin is very clear, I might use it to conceal some tiny acne scars that are still healing. Usually I use Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage to conceal spots though (it's my holy grail for covering spots).I like the twirl stick, which makes the product very convenient to dispense. I don't have to get my hands dirty if I don't want to. I get about 2 uses out of one click. The brush is small and just the right size. It feels soft against the skin and gets the job done. I've cleaned it a few times just to make sure it doesn't have bacteria growing on it just by taking some Bioderma and wiping it off, no big deal. The thing that I love the most about this product is that the highlighter is not over the top with noticeable glitter, which makes it very easy to work with. It doesn't matter where I apply it on my face, it won't look strange (I am also a very good match to the color that I purchased). This is important to me because it ensures that the product looks natural and seamless; like it isn't even there. Because I have very fair skin, I would recommend this product to fair-skinned girls looking for concealer light enough for them. The color does have that salmon-ish aspect which makes it great for blue-ish color correction, but it's not salmon-ish enough to eliminate it from regular concealing.I will repurchase this until I find a better product, and will update this review if that happens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HCUV063725OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BQFT9W#wasThisHelpful","R1HCUV063725OB","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me get my one gripe out of the way first. The packaging is horrible. Turning the cap causes product to pour everywhere and billow into the air. Powder gets stuck on the corner edges of the package and there's no stopping it from going EVERYWHERE whenever you put on the lid or take it off. Therefore, I have transferred mine to a baggy with a corner trimmed off one side (very tiny hole). I pour a little out on the back of my hand or in a bowl when I need it, and I keep the corner twisted and taped closed when I'm not using it. It successfully stops the product from billowing into the air and getting all over the place, but white powder in a plastic baggy does look a little sketchy.The powder goes on beautifully over foundation, cream blusher, highligher, cream contour, even eyeshadow. It is translucent. It absorbs oil and is soft to the touch when over foundation. If applied over still wet foundation, it is possible to apply too much, which can make you look washed out. It's setting powder, not powder foundation. It's a fabulous dupe for high end setting powders, and for a very reasonable price. Will repurchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BF95YF6JEJ6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DIXYUI#wasThisHelpful","R3BF95YF6JEJ6N","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not found a kit anywhere that includes this many pieces for a comparable price.The brush bristles could be a little better... slimmer, a little less scratchy, but these get the job done fine. The rubber on the bottom of the bowl could be more grippy so it doesn't slip. The plastic on the combs and clips could be less flimsy. At this price though, I can hardy complain about any of this.

"Edit: Not sure why this review is getting so many downvotes. If you have dry skin, this product is great. If not, it's going to be way too oily.Original Review:I have chronically dry skin from undergoing accutane treatment. I was really struggling with my makeup because I had so many dry and flaky patches on my face that whenever I applied concealer, cream foundation or liquid foundation, it would get stuck on the dead skin and look very unnatural and unattractive. I've tried a lot of drugstore moisturizers, and my all time favorite was the Olay Perfecting Cream (now named Olay Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream) because it was the only thing that could clear up my dry patches and not irritate my skin. However, it was only a temporary fix and would never keep the dry patches away for more than a few hours.I discovered the La Roche Posay B5 after hearing Lisa Eldridge recommend it for dry skin in her Beauty Nightmares video. As soon as I tried the B5 baume I was in love. It was like it mimicked my skin's natural oil. As I rubbed it into my face, I could see my dehydrated skin absorbing it. My dry patches disappeared, and the dead skin rubbed off and was gone. I applied my makeup, and no dry patches in sight. It was magical. I've always had eczema on my shoulders and hands. This dramatically helps those patches, but takes about 2-3 reapplications to get rid of them completely. I would warn that if you have normal or oily skin and use too much of this, your face will look like an oil slick. I think this is really meant for dry skinned people. The other thing I've noticed about this product is that it takes down my redness. I believe that is because of the vitamin B5, which soothes irritation.I use this everyday underneath my makeup. I will repurchase this item time and time again. It has been a complete game changer for me.P.S. If you have dry skin like me, try out Waleda's skin food. It's heavier than this product and really hydrates deep. I use it at night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJBH6MA1G05Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060OUV5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2XJBH6MA1G05Z","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product does exactly what it claims and smooths down hair. It has the consistency of most other smoothing products-- lotion consistency, holds its shape, is thicker than a serum, yet slippery when rubbed between the fingers. I run it through my ends when my hair is still damp. It helps to de-tangle and de-frizz. After my hair dries, it looks smoothed down. I didn't notice a difference in terms of lusterizing, but I did notice the insane amount of glitter on my hands after I applied the product. I'm not a great fan of that, and cringe when I think about the glitter getting on my sensitive skin around my face an neck.

"I have the Mac, Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier and Real Technique equivalents for this brush, and I have to say... this one beats them all! The bristles are soft enough for the eye area, yet stiff enough to easily achieve a precise application. One thing I love about synthetic bristles is how easy they are to clean, but even next to the Real Techniques eyeliner brush, this one is faster and easier to clean! I have used this for fluidline a few times and it has been great, but mostly I use this brush for pin-point concealer application with my Laura Mercier secret concealers.

"I love the other Kasugai gummies, and I love ramune, so I eagerly bought these. I don't think they taste like ramune at all. They have a strange chemical taste, that, combined with the lemon flavor comes across as Windex flavor. I shared these with two friends, and they both said they tasted like shampoo. I decided to get second opinions since I saw so many positive reviews online, so I gave them to my aunt, uncle, and young cousin too. My aunt and uncle made faces while they chewed, and my cousin (who loves trying new candy) spit it out. I think it's really hard to get past the soap flavor. Maybe they don't taste like that to everyone, different body chemistry and taste buds, but know when purchasing that you run the risk of Windex-flavor. I would not buy these again. However, I highly recommend the Kiwi, Peach, Mango, Orange, Strawberry Kasugai gummies, all of which are well-liked and I have repurchased time and time again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W5E3JE52SVS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089MM1JY#wasThisHelpful","R2W5E3JE52SVS1","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update 1/19/14: I purchased the Manic Panic Dreamtone foundation in white (Manic Panic Virgin Dreamtone Gothic Foundation Vampire White) and tried mixing it with this foundation and I made my perfect color. The Manic Panic is thicker and creamier, whereas the Makeup Forever is watery, but they mix together perfectly.Original Review:Chances are, if you are reading this, you have very pale skin with deep, cool, pink undertones. This is the kind of skin that I have. I have searched and searched for a foundation pale enough for years. I've tried every major brand (even Dainty Doll), and everything is too dark or too yellow. I had such high hopes for Make Up For Ever's HD Foundation in 107. It came so close to being the right shade. So so so close, but a tad too dark of a pink. I am thinking I will buy Face Atelier's white foundation and mix it with this one for the right shade. This was so frustratingly close-- in my hand it looks like the right color, and when I blend it into my wrist, it's seamless... But on my face, it looks too salmon and not pale enough.This foundation is rich and luxurious to apply. It dries beautifully, with a natural finish. It's not luminous. It wears well, and will last all day if set with a powder. What a great foundation, but so sad that the lightest shade is still not light enough... I will update once I find a solution or buy the white Face Altier foundation. I've also been considering Graftobian, Cinema Secrets, and RCMA. If you are having the same problem I am, check out those websites.Tips: Always test foundation on your jawbone, between your neck and cheek, in natural light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21J2BKUEX9R9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001WESTFG#wasThisHelpful","R21J2BKUEX9R9S","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can only hope that they will re-continue this jacket in the future.I first tried this jacket on 2 years ago and fell in love with it. Unfortunately, I needed an XL for my taller frame. I went home and looked at Carhartt's website, only to see that it wasn't in stock. I searched high and low, but could not find any stores that still had it in stock. Dismayed, I added it to my Amazon wishlist, in hopes that Amazon would restock XL. After 2 years of searching, I managed to snag this used on eBay.Wow. What a great jacket this is. This is the jacket to have if you are up against some real weather. It sheds water, rain, snow, doesn't let the wind through, and yet, it is breathable enough to keep me just the right temperature underneath- keeping me sweat free and bone-dry. It's perfectly warm enough for extremely cold temperatures if paired with a long-sleeved shirt and/or fleece underneath. Think of it as the ultimate outer shell. It isn't made of the same weave of nylon as typical windbreakers- this is thicker nylon, thicker nylon than some winter jackets I have, and it isn't as shiny.The hand covers on this jacket are one of my favorite features, as they prevent cold from creeping into and up the sleeves of this jacket. As someone with long arms, this has long been a problem for me. The hand covers are made of a thin, stretchy, spandex-like fabric, and work great with gloves layered over.The jacket is shorter in the front and longer in the back. It looks great on. I seem to be the only one that is reviewing this jacket in XL, as I notice that a lot of petite women have reviewed this before me (I'm 6'0, about 165 with a D-cup). They've commented that the jacket fits large on them, but I actually had the opposite experience, where the jacket in the normal size I would buy (L) was actually was too short in the arms and wasn't roomy enough to layer clothing in the middle. In the XL, it's perfect--arms are long and it's roomy enough to add layers inside. For me, the jacket looks a lot more like it does on the model, which another reviewer mentioned that it didn't. I also don't find the positioning of the pockets awkward, as another reviewer here said.The many pockets are great. There are two hidden pockets inside the jacket, slightly below the chest. The positioning is great, as the objects I keep inside are not being held against my breasts. The pockets on the outside of the jacket are lined with material, and keep my hands warm. The breast pocket is the same, with a plastic coating around the zipper, so anything in the pocket is kept perfectly dry. It's perfect for keeping my wallet in.The hood is convenient, and I am so glad that it snaps on and off as opposed to Velcro on all of my other jackets. There is a Velcro closure on the front of the hood to cover the neck. The jacket has a double zipper and 2 layers of fabric that snap closed to cover the zipper. The snaps are not visible except for the ones at the very top and bottom of the jacket. At the top of the jacket, there is fleecy fabric on the inside so the rougher outside fabric doesn't rub against the skin of the neck.A lot of thought went into this jacket. It's easy to tell that it is of superior quality and make. I constantly receive compliments. I would happily repurchase this, even if it was $250.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0IP17X2VYBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001I9TO1I#wasThisHelpful","R2E0IP17X2VYBX","A3315AAN855HYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3315AAN855HYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This charger really surprised me. I'm used to my phone taking hours to fully charge, and my tablet even longer. This charger took my LG G3 from 8% charge to 94% charge in about an hour and a half (110 mile drive). My 7"" tablet charges in about 3 hours. Plus it gives you a second port for your headphones, GPS or other toys. It has a coiled cord (which is stronger than you might expect) that makes storing it in a small space easy.

When my daughter got close to delivery she started asking what my thoughts were on the various formula in case she wasn't able to nurse 100%. Now that Gerber has formula I had to recommend that as an option. Her thoughts and concerns were well founded when my grandson was born. She was unable to keep up with his dietary needs and had to supplement. Her doctor and hospital recommended other, sponsored to them, brands, which she dutifully tried. They were included in her going home kit and she figured they should be ok as the hospital provided them. Her son was not as impressed. I found this sample box quite by chance and sent it to her. Once it arrived and she tried it, she called me in tears. His first bottle gave her the first rest she had had in the 2 weeks since he arrived.

"Both of my boys (ages 2 years and 10 months, respectively) have very fair skin and eczema. I veer away from anything scented or fragranced for our entire family. My son even had a reaction to a common eczema lotion!We've used Babyganics baby shampoo/body wash since my oldest was born, and it's never caused a reaction. We've also used their sunscreen, bug spray, and lotion. My son asked for bubble bath, so I bought this, and I'm so glad I did! It makes bath time much more fun. My oldest loves swishing the water around to make more bubbles, and my youngest loves playing with them. The bubbles last a while but because it's naturally derived, it's not as bubbly as other brands. I'm ok with that. I put 2-3 squirts in and it provides bubbles for up to 30-40 minutes.

"This is (almost) the perfect breastfeeding pillow. I used it for my first son for a few weeks until he switched to breastmilk in the bottle, and I used it for my second son for eight months. I firmly believe that having a breastfeeding pillow makes nursing more enjoyable for everyone.I absolutely love that it is very adjustable (I am a size 16/18), the cover is soft and machine washable, and the shape of the pillow itself is conducive to nursing. This pillow, while a bit more bulky than the Boppy, won't slide off because it's attached around your waist. It takes a few more seconds to prep yourself to nurse because of this, but it's well worth the lack of stress during feeding from the pillow sliding out from under baby. I have decent upper body strength, but holding a baby for 10-40 minutes without support is a challenge! I also appreciate the pocket on the pillow. I kept a cloth diaper (see below), nursing pads, and Mother Love nursing cream in it.The reason I didn't give this five stars is that underneath the cover, there is no waterproof barrier. This is a big oversight in my book. Babies drool, spit up, milk lets down when baby's not latched....things happen. Babies are gross, guys. While the cover does provide a barrier between dirt/drool/milk and the foam pillow, it's not enough protection. I used the My Brest Friend pillow at the hospital and it didn't have a cloth cover, but a plastic waterproof cover on it that the nurses could wipe down with a wipe. Make sense, right? Or, if the pillow wasn't lined, the least they could do is line the interior of the cover (like a cloth diaper cover).  Anyway, I kept a cloth diaper underneath my little one's head while he was nursing, so if any milk did leak out of his mouth (...or me...) I could just wash the cloth diaper instead of the whole cover and pillow. This prevented needed to wash the cover or spot clean the pillow excessively (but I did that a few times, too).That being said, I would still highly recommend this pillow as it's the best one I've used. It has its faults, but it's not a deal breaker. Nursing is an incredible way to bond and nourish your baby (if you are able/want to), and this is a great tool to have in your arsenal to assist with breastfeeding. Best of luck to you and your sweet little one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R360K70WUYJNOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HZI1R2#wasThisHelpful","R360K70WUYJNOJ","A1T6C769GKIVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T6C769GKIVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This eyeshadow is great. It's smooth, easy to apply, and stays on for most of the day (I have yet to find an eyeshadow that truly lasts all day!). I normally wear hypoallergenic eyeshadow because my eyes and skin are very sensitive, but this eyeshadow didn't cause any irritation.

The apple is the only piece of fruit that's one solid color (it's odd and doesn't really look like it belongs in the set). The other pieces have more true-to-life color.

"We have two fair-skinned little boys (our oldest is 28 months, and our youngest is 10 months old) and use Desitin every diaper change for our youngest and almost every diaper change for our oldest (sometimes we use Baby Anti Monkey Butt powder). I don't have any hard numbers, but I know it's prevented many, many, MANY diaper rashes. When my son was 16 months old, we went on a short family vacation. I forgot to pack Desitin, so we were just using the powder. I figured he would be fine for a few days. Nope. He had one bout of diarrhea (which we quickly cleaned up), and the next day he had an awfully red and blistered bum. I actually cried because it was so painful to even look at, poor guy! I know the rash wasn't just from his poop, because he's had that issue before, but had no rash develop when we used Desitin. We learned from that mistake and make sure to use Desitin at least twice a day.When a rash gets *really* bad, we use Triple Paste, but it's cost prohibitive to use that daily. Desitin has done well by us, and considering it's what my mom used on her kiddos, I think it'll be around for a while. Quite simply, it works!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPTTD1515KF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006RBLFDW#wasThisHelpful","R2NPTTD1515KF7","A1T6C769GKIVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T6C769GKIVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two boys (at the time of writing this, my oldest is 28 months old and my youngest is 10 months old) with very fair skin. I used Desitin as our every day cream, and that has prevented many a diaper rash. We also use Baby Anti Monkey Butt powder on my oldest. However, when they do get redness that the Desitin doesn't help, we use Triple Paste. Yes, it's expensive. But it works. And to me, it's worth the cost for my baby not to be in pain-and not to have to take him to the doctor for a rash that won't go away! I wish I could upload before and after photos, but I don't think my little ones would appreciate that when they got older. :)Recently, my 10 month old got a diaper rash after he pooped a few hours before he woke up (and the poop didn't wake him up). He was miserable, but within 36 hours of using Triple Paste, he didn't cry during diaper changes and the redness had dramatically lessened. My oldest had an awful rash when he was 16 months old after I forgot to pack Desitin on a weekend trip. We had just been using powder, and he got diarrhea. That was an awful combination, and he woke up one morning with a blistered bum. Triple Paste came to the rescue and cleared up his rash within a few days.I think it's worth noting that if your baby's rash is yeast-based, this will exacerbate the rash, as it contains cornstarch (which yeast loves).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16LGWVPULLGSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GCL2B8#wasThisHelpful","R16LGWVPULLGSZ","A1T6C769GKIVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T6C769GKIVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tried about four other brands of stainless steel cleaner and polish, and this one is the best. You definitely have to put some upper body strength into it (especially on the more ""shiny"" stainless steel finishes; the matte finishes are much easier to clean), but it works. I wish it would add some sort of fingerprint-proof film on it...but that's just wishful thinking from a mom with two young kids. :)All of our appliances (fridge, oven/stove, microwave, and dishwasher...plus our toaster) are stainless steel and I use this on all of them. The fridge is the hardest to clean, but being as it has the most surface area, that makes sense. But, as I mentioned earlier, it has more of a shiny finish, so it doesn't repel fingerprints. If I could go back in time and spend a couple hundred more bucks on a fridge that had a matte/fingerprint resistant finish, I would. I use this about once a week and a bottle lasts us about 2-3 months. I usually spray it on a microfiber cloth instead of spraying it directly on the appliances, as this greatly reduces the overspray.Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26D3TXZS72HZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WZ2NLY#wasThisHelpful","R26D3TXZS72HZ2","A1T6C769GKIVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T6C769GKIVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I initially purchased the Unicorn Beetle case (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MYZLLIY/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1426279646&sr=1&keywords=unicorn+beetle+iphone+6), but the volume rocker buttons did not work well with this case. I returned it and purchased this one instead. While it's not perfect, I definitely like it more than the Unicorn Beetle case. I have two kids under two, so my phone goes through a lot. In the past I've only used Otterbox cases, but I'm happy with this case through the water, drool, juice, dust, dog hair, and drops it's experienced.Pros of this case:-Easy to take off and on-Interchangeable face plates-Good splash, dust, and drop protection. It's not waterproof, but for the price point, I wouldn't expect it to be. It definitely provides more protection than the UB case. The only part of the original phone that's exposed once this case is on is the back camera.-Sleek and stylish-All buttons and the screen work perfectly (although I haven't tried out the touchID feature)Cons:-Not very grippy, but more grip than the UB case (on the sides)-Not a wide variety of color selection-No holster clip included (not a big deal for me since I wouldn't use it anyway, but it might be for some)Overall, I think this case is a steal for the price point. It's a good looking case that provides great protection!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QITS9ELHEWNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXDZFFM#wasThisHelpful","R2QITS9ELHEWNU","A1T6C769GKIVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T6C769GKIVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love glass food storage, but we recently moved into a house with porcelain tiles. Turns out they love breaking glass. I needed some more food storage, so I embarked on a quest to find a high-quality plastic set. I'm so glad I stumbled onto this! It's the perfect compromise between the traditional Rubbermaid plastic food storage and glass food storage. The plastic is thicker, stronger, and clearer-and foods that traditionally stain plastic (think tomato sauce) don't make a mark. I also like the the lids ""snap"" together, so they don't all come tumbling out of the cabinet if you accidentally bump one. It's also lighter weight than glass, which is perfect for lunches and taking food to a friend's house. I definitely recommend this set-even more than my Tupperware pieces (and I LOVE Tupperware)!Update 5/2015 (three months after initial review):Guys. This is the real deal. These have stood up to almost daily dishwashing, drops, microwaving, and the fridge. My food storage cabinet is nicely organized because they stack together well, and they are reasonably priced. Yes, they cost more than the ""standard"" Rubbermaid, but it's well worth it. I love these so much I bought a second set at BJ's. And then my mother-in-law bought herself a set after seeing our set. Love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SO5XIUORIMLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5GEJGM#wasThisHelpful","R1SO5XIUORIMLF","A1T6C769GKIVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T6C769GKIVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love Melissa and Doug products, and this is another winner in my book! The knobs are easy for my son to grab, and the colors are vivid. These seem to be pretty well made, but we'll see how they hold up to toddler abuse. Other Melissa and Doug puzzles are still going strong after a year, and I don't have any doubt these will be the same. My son definitely prefers the animals over the shapes at this point, but that's just because he loves animals.

"This works fine, is well made, and is easy to use...but it just doesn't sharpen quite as well as the traditional sharpening steel. It claims to work on serrated blades, and I guess it technically does, but I wasn't overly thrilled with the result. I got the best result on my chef's knife. It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it.

"I had high expectations for this book based on Amy's work on SNL and Parks and Rec, as well as what I've learned about her through mainstream media. Buuuut....it didn't meet my expectations. Don't get me wrong, I would recommend this book, and am glad I purchased it, but many parts felt rather forced. There are a few times where she bemoans the effort required to write a book. Well, yeah, I know it wasn't a particularly easy process, especially with the busy schedule she keeps, but she chose to write the book! If you're looking for a in-depth analysis of her personal life, you won't find it here. She discusses her career at length (which I loved...mostly), but veered away from specifics about her relationship and subsequent divorce from Will Arnett. That's her choice, and I respect her for that-but I think some people might pick up this book hoping to get some dirt. What you will get are a grouping of essays on her career, her childhood, her college experiences, and her boys (which was one of my favorite chapters, as I have two young boys as well). This is surprisingly well written (the few ""celebrity"" books I've read have been sub-par) and was easy to read. There was quite a bit of name-dropping, but I was expecting that...I mean, she's worked with tons of well-known folks!Overall, as I mentioned earlier, I would recommend this book. I hope she will write another book focusing more on everyday topics. It's worth the read, but falls a bit flat on occasion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNSIC2WUOSHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHZS39A#wasThisHelpful","R1NNSIC2WUOSHO","A1T6C769GKIVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T6C769GKIVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love any product that helps organize, but this is one of my favorites. I originally purchased it to keep on our bathroom counter, but have since moved it into the medicine cabinet we installed, where it fits great. I love that it can hold all the little things you need in a bathroom. Right now, I have two tubes of toothpaste (one for my kids, one for my husband and I), two toothbrushes, a section just for cotton swabs, a small container of vaseline, a battery-powered facial scrubbing brush, a tube of lipstick, and floss. Without this organizer, these small items would be awkward to just sit on a shelf by themselves without falling off or getting bumped off.

"Update: I'm really bummed because this stopped working after owning it for nine months and using it once every two weeks or so. For the price, this should last much longer than 18-20 uses.Initial review: I've used a few different trimmers over the years, and this is my favorite. I've been using this for three months now. Please note this is a *trimmer*, not a shaver. Although I suppose you could take the guard off, I wouldn't recommend using this for a full shave. My previous trimmer was rechargeable, but I actually prefer batteries. The charge would frequently last no longer than a few minutes, even when I actually remembered to charge it. My favorite feature of this trimmer is that the pointed tips of the guards are rounded. This may sound like a feature that should be common sense, but other trimmers have been more pointy (and thus, painful).

"Another reviewer wrote ""Well worth the peace of mind,"" and I can't agree with that more. They were easy to install (MUCH easier than other child-proofing products we've purchased!) and when we tipped the bookcases and dressers a bit to see how these hold up, we felt confident that they could withstand the force of a small child trying to climb them. They'd also worth great in earthquake-prone areas (I'm looking at you, California! :)). Well made, relatively inexpensive, and easy to install?

"I've read a few books focusing on parenting toddlers. I have a 22-month-old son (and a 2 month old, as well) and was having trouble disciplining him since his brother was born. Jo's book provides suggestions and in-depth examples and scenarios to assist in implementing her advice. I've been using her techniques for about a month now, and notice that although my son still has tantrums, my overall relationship with him is better. Some tips like getting down to your child's level, maintaining consistency with discipline, letting your child exercise, and providing a healthy diet for your child  may be common sense, but Jo goes into detail as to why she recommends what she does. She also emphasizes focusing on the child. All too often we get distracted by electronics or TV, when all our child wants is US! I deducted one star because at times the tone of the book was condescending, and I wish there was a recap at the end of the book because it felt a bit jumbled at times. Overall, this is my favorite parenting book I've read so far. I would (and have) recommended this book to friends and family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDYKAOM7PZLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1W0DEK#wasThisHelpful","R3FDYKAOM7PZLJ","A1T6C769GKIVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T6C769GKIVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love Ran Red is Chris Tomlin's 11th record. From his first album, The Noise We Make, to now, he has been a huge influence to praise music and people everywhere. TIME magazine proclaimed him ""likely the most often sung artist anywhere."" Chris Tomlin has a GRAMMY Award, 18 Dove Awards, one platinum album, and three gold discs.Some questions people may have:Q. Is this album better than Burning Lights?A. I think it is, but the answer will differ depending on who you ask. Tomlin has more variety, the lyrics are more gospel-focused, and it is more worshipful than Burning Lights.Q. Is this a praise album?A. Yes. This album has more praise songs than Burning Lights did. Chris Tomlin seems to be returning to a focus on praise music.Q. Are the songs very different from Tomlin's usual style?A. In some ways, Tomlin has kept his old style, but he has also changed some things (he now uses more synth).Q. Is this a good album for someone who is new to CCM?A. I cannot think of a better album. The songs are full of praise to God, and are very well written and performed.Q. Should I buy the regular album or the Deluxe Edition?A. The deluxe edition includes the song In the End, an awesome remix of Waterfall, and two acoustic songs. Unless the difference in price is small, I would go for the regular album, because the only really amazing song you will get in the Deluxe Edition is the Waterfall Tritonal remix.These are the songs in Love Ran Red (with description):1.  GreaterA great way start to the album. The message is clear: Jesus is greater than my sin, and greater than the grave. The accompaniment and vocals go well together, creating an incredible song.2.  WaterfallThis song is amazing, combining a beautiful accompaniment that has piano, percussion, and more, with great vocals and stirring lyrics about God's love.3.  At the Cross (Love Ran Red)The background vocals, the piano, and the lyrics shine out on this song. The focus is on the cross, which is great.4.  Jesus Loves MeA beautiful song with a beautiful message. It is awesome to know that Jesus loves ME.5.  Boundary LinesThis song blew me away with the soaring melodies, upbeat synth accompaniments, incredible background vocals, and more. I love the line, ""If my heart is a cup, Your love is an ocean.""6.  AlmightyIn my opinion, this song rivals How Great Is Our God in its simplicity and worshipfulness.7.  The RoarAnother great song with a great message about God's deliverance.8.  Fear NotUnique accompaniments, a powerful bridge, and remarkable background vocals complete this song.9.  The TableThis unique, almost gospel-like song is very enjoyable.10.  Psalm 100This song is nothing short from amazing. With joyful lyrics from Psalm 100 and upbeat synth throughout the song, this song is sure to be loved by anyone who listens to it.11.  I Will BoastA beautiful, slow-moving song.12.  Jesus, This Is YouChris Tomlin has ended many of his albums with great songs, such as Shepherd Boy in Burning Lights, and Awakening in And If Our God Is For Us, but this song is better than any of them. Another worshipful song like Almighty, but much bigger.The deluxe edition includes these songs:13.  In The EndThis song has a nice melody, but, in my opinion, isn't quite as good as the other songs in the album.14.  Waterfall (Tritonal Remix)An incredible remix. I can't really find words to describe it.15.  At the Cross (Love Ran Red) (Acoustic)The acoustic version of At the Cross.16.  Let It Be Jesus (Acoustic)Chris Tomlin's acoustic cover of Let It Be Jesus, originally sung by Christy Nockels in the album Passion: Take It All.Album length: aprx. 49 min.Similar Christian Albums:Burning Lights by Chris TomlinPassion: Take It All by PassionYour Grace Finds Me by Matt RedmanThanks for reading!

"UPDATE: I now own the BDP-S1500, which is the 2015 equivalent of this Blu-ray player. I am very satisfied with it, and would suggest it over this model.When it comes to DVD and Blu-ray players, Sony is by far my favorite brand. I have owned, and still own multiple Sony DVD players and Blu-ray players, and every one of them is great. That's why I chose another Sony Blu-ray player.I must say, this Blu-ray player much exceeded my expectations. There are so many things I really like about it. It's starts up fast, and loads discs very fast. While some DVD/BD players have trouble with any amount of dirt or scratches on a disc, this one plays through most without a problem (though really dirty/scratched discs will of course still have problems).Best thing: NOT MADE IN CHINA!!! It's made in Malaysia (at least mine was).PICTURE/AUDIO QUALITY_____________________20/20Blu-ray discs look incredible (on an HDTV, of course). DVDs obviously aren't as nice, but still look great. The audio quality is awesome. I am using the coaxial audio port, but the HDMI carries audio, too. Beautiful digital surround sound audio!FEATURES_____________________17/20Besides being a BD/DVD/CD player, it also has a USB port for plugging in a USB flash drive and viewing personal pictures, videos, and music (which can be a little slow to load, though, when opening folders with many files). The USB port is also for BD-Live.But the big thing about this Blu-ray player is the internet apps, including Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, Vudu, YouTube, Pandora, AccuWeather, Facebook, and many others. It also has the Opera TV Store with more apps, but there's not much worth mentioning there. There are three things to note about the internet features, though: 1) Starting up the apps can be a bit slow, especially if your internet isn't very fast. Not too bad, but not as fast as my Vizio Smart TV. 2) Navigating is a little hard. Basically, there are a few columns for pictures, videos, music, and other things, and you have to scroll through the hundreds of apps with the up and down buttons on the remote. The more popular stuff is near the top, thankfully, so they're not too hard to reach. 3) You can't use Wi-Fi, you will need to plug it in with Ethernet.DESIGN_____________________18/20The compact design is very nice, but is too small to fit a front panel display, which shows the run time of the disc that's playing. To see how much of the disc has played and how much is left, you instead have to press the DISPLAY button on the remote (under the VOLUME control).REMOTE_____________________14/20I know, the remote is a little small. I can't complain about it, though, because of two things. First, after some practice, you can find most of the important buttons by feel. Second, the remote's range is huge, and it doesn't have to be pointed directly at the Blu-ray player. I'd also like to mention that the remote has controls for your TV, too (VOLUME, TV POWER, and INPUT). To get the remote to work with your TV, you have to hold down the TV POWER and enter a number (usually from 01-20). The manual will tell you which number you have to press for it to work with different TV brands. Some brands are not listed in the manual, but may still work with the remote. Just try entering every number from 01 to 20 until one of them works (Vizio is 04).VALUE_____________________10/20This Blu-ray player works well and has almost all the features you could possibly ask for, yet it is still affordable. UPDATE: Since this is a 2013 model, it is pretty outdated, and I do not recommend it any more. Instead, I suggest you take a look at Sony BDPS1500 Wired Streaming Blu-Ray Disc Player (Black).Thanks for reading!

"What's good about it: It's tiny, so you can leave it in the USB port of your laptop and take it wherever you go. It's pretty powerful, so you can put your keyboard, mouse, etc. quite far away and not have any problems. It doesn't look cheaply made, so I'm pretty sure I'll lose it before I break it. It can also have up to six devices hooked up to it, which is very convenient.What's bad about it: Nothing really. It is easy to lose, but I would rather have it be tiny than for it to be big and bulky. I do think it is a little overpriced, but it is cheaper than buying a new mouse/keyboard/etc.All in all, it's really awesome, so if you need a replacement, don't hesitate to buy one.TROUBLESHOOTINGIf the receiver (dongle) isn't working, try some of these things: Go to Logitech's website and download the software for the receiver (just Bing or Google ""Logitech Unifying Receiver Software""). Make sure the batteries in the keyboard, mouse, etc. are fresh. Make sure the keyboard, mouse, etc. isn't too far away from the receiver (dongle). Make sure the receiver (dongle) is plugged in firmly.If you have further questions, feel free to post a comment.Thanks for reading!

"I have had this monitor for a few months now, and have been able to compare it to many other monitors. I previously used a slightly older Dell monitor (it was a 1909w), and I must say, this one is much better. I love the fact that it is 16x9. I don't like 16x10 monitors as much, because widescreen videos don't fill the screen. I also love the full-HD 1080p resolution. The picture is very sharp. As for the sound, I haven't used the speakers, so I don't know how they sound. I wouldn't expect much from them, though.COLORS__________________18/20The colors are very vivid and real. All my older Dell monitors' colors were a bit warm, but this monitor's colors are very nice. I don't think you can find many monitors with better colors at this price.CONTRAST RATIO__________________17/20The blacks weren't quite as dark as I was hoping, but I definitely can't complain. The whites are amazing, but make sure ASCR is on (press the MENU button and go down to IMAGE, select ASCR, and change it to ON).FEATURES__________________18/20Having VGA, DVI, and HDMI makes this monitor easy to connect to a computer or laptop. Also has plenty of calibration settings, as well as preset settings, which is nice. It doesn't have USB ports or a headphone port, so that's why it got an 18/20, instead of 20/20.DESIGN__________________15/20The monitor looks nice, but it won't stun you with its beauty. The stand tilts and has a hole in the back to run the cables through, so that you can't see them from the front of the monitor.VALUE__________________19/20You can't go wrong with this monitor. You will get amazing quality at a decent price. Remember that Amazon's prices can change rapidly, so watch out for a price drop.By the way: I noticed this monitor has been discontinued by manufacturer. I think it was replaced by the VE228H-P.

"I own many desktop speakers, so I can compare these to many other speaker systems. Besides these, I have the Logitech Z506 5.1 Speaker System, Cyber Acoustics CA-3602 2.1 Speaker System, and the Altec Lansing VS-4121 2.1 Speaker System.Logitech Surround Sound Speakers Z506: These speakers are incredible for movies, and quite good for music (such as electronic/dance and pop)Cyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602a): Immensely popular, these speakers are great for music (pop, jazz, and electronic/dance sound great on them)Altec Lansing VS4121 Powered Audio System (Black): I've heard many good things about this brand, but these specific speakers are quite outdated, and are okay for music, movies and games.Now, these speakers (VM ECXS212): Great for music (rock, pop, and songs with plenty of bass) and nice for movies, too.Considering the price, these speakers really blew me away. The bass is the best part; it's rich and powerful. The mids are audible, but seem a little lacking. The highs are clear, but are not extremely impressive.AUDIO QUALITY___________________18/20As I said earlier, the bass is impressive. The 50-watt subwoofer pumps out deep bass, but the 15-watt speakers (30 watts altogether) can be heard over it, although the mids and highs aren't perfect. These speakers are great for music with lots of bass, but are really nice for movies, too.DESIGN___________________7/20Unfortunately, I cannot rate design very high. The volume control is on the front of the subwoofer, which is supposed to be placed on the ground, thus making it hard to reach. The bass control and power switch are on the back of the subwoofer, making it even harder to reach. Also, it does not have a headphone port or a second Aux. in. I guess VM sacrificed ease of use to put more money into great sound. If hard to reach volume controls isn't a major problem for you, you will get a serious bang for your buck.DURABILITY___________________15/20These speakers have taken some minor spills, and still look and work great. The speakers do feel a little light, but are quite hard to knock over.VISUAL APPEAL___________________14/20The subwoofer looks really nice, but the LED light on the front is a little bright (it does turn off when you turn off the speakers, though).

"I am one of those people who does lots of research before buying something. After looking at hundreds (maybe thousands) of headphones, I found these. Here is why I chose them over all the others I looked at:After much research, I found that there are basically two types of headphones, those for studio use, and those for home use. Many popular headphone brands such as Audio Technica and Sennheiser make headphones for studio use, which are not as good for listening to music, watching movies, or playing games. Since I wanted headphones for music, those were out of the question.Headphones for home use can be further divided into: headphones designed for music (like Beats and Skullcandy headphones), headphones designed for games (like Logitech and Razer headphones), and headphones designed for multiple things (Bose headphones are great for music and movies). There are also home theater headphones, but those aren't so common. These headphones fall into the music category, though they're pretty good for movies, too.When comparing music headphones, I found that headphones such as Beats and Skullcandy were not rated very highly by critics, partly because they were overpriced. Sony brand headphones had much better ratings. Because of the ratings and the price, I went for these, and couldn't be happier.AUDIO QUALITY_____________________19/20If you want incredible sound, these headphones are for you. The highs are beautiful. The mids are clear and easy to hear. The bass is rich and powerful, but doesn't drown out mids or highs. The range is huge: 3hz-28khz, and I can hear things I couldn't hear on other headphones.Electronic/dance and pop music sounds best on these, but rock and classical are great, too. Jazz and hard rock are okay, but not as amazing as the other genres.NOISE REDUCTION_____________________14/20These aren't noise canceling, so you don't need to put batteries into them, but that does mean more ambient noise can be heard. Although they are on-ear headphones, the cushions really envelope your ears, so a good amount of outside noise is blocked. I found that while mowing the lawn, the headphones cut the sound of the mower almost in half, and I could hear my music pretty well. Though not perfect, it does a pretty good job.COMFORT_____________________20/20I have worn Beats headphones. Great. I have worn Sennheiser headphones. Nice. I have worn Bose. Very Good. The list goes on. But when I put these on, I went AHHHHHHH! These are so comfortable, I sometimes look forward to putting them on. The pads are squishy and a little cool to the touch, but can heat up after a while. 20/20 for comfort.PORTABILITY_____________________18/20The cups swivel 90 and flatten out to 8 in. x 1  in. x 7  in. If you want to put them in the case, though, you have to collapse the cups (make sure the pads face each other). The case is 6  in. x 4 in. x 5  in. The cable, which locks in place in the headphones, is easily detachable, and can be placed with the  inch adapter in a pocket inside the case. The cable is short (4 feet) and wide, so it is hard to tangle. The case does have some nooks and crannies for storing a small mp3 player, USB, etc. 18/20.APPEARANCE_____________________17/20To me, these headphones look pretty cool, but they don't stick out and scream, ""WEIRDO!"" like yellow Beats would. These headphones also come in silver/red, but are priced different than the silver/black, so be careful. I would actually suggest silver/red, because it has better (and more) sellers, but that's subject to change.VALUE_____________________19/20These headphones are a HUGE bang for your buck as long as:1) You can get a great deal for them. The retail price for these is anywhere from $100-$300. Amazon's prices go as low as around $80 (and less if you buy it used), which is definitely a great deal.2) These are the type of headphones you want. Great for music, not so great for studio or professional use (such as mixing).Thanks for reading!

"Just so you know: Before buying this HDTV, make sure that the model number has a ""B"" in the number and not an ""A"", which is the 2013 model (unless it's the 80 inch, which doesn't have a ""B"" model). The 2014 ""B"" model is definitely better. Also, different sizes of this model will have different statistics.I did countless hours of research and comparing HDTV's in stores. After much thought and many comparisons, I concluded that Samsung HDTV's had the best picture quality (at least to me). Their colors were very strong, vivid, and real, and their whites and blacks were amazing. The problem was the cost. Probably second or third best in picture quality came Vizio, and at a much more affordable price.When looking to buy an HDTV, I found this Vizio HDTV, and compared it to the Samsung HDTV's for sale on Amazon. There were three Samsung HDTV's with a 120Hz refresh rate (like the Vizio) in the size I was looking at (40-42 inches): The UN40H6203 Smart LED TV, the UN40H6350 Smart LED TV, and the UN40H6400 3D Smart LED TV. The latter two were too expensive for my budget, and the first one didn't have as good stats and features (only 2 HDMI ports, no back-lit keyboard on remote, etc.) Because of these things (and the fact that most of the one star reviews for this HDTV at the time were on the 2013 model), I chose this over the Samsung's, and I'm very glad I did. It has everything I could possibly ask for, especially at this price!COLORS:_____________________17/20The colors are not quite as good as good as a really nice Samsung HDTV, but incredible nonetheless.CONTRAST RATIO:_____________________19/20With the active LED zones, this HDTV can dim different parts of the screen for darker blacks. The blacks are so dark, that if you are viewing a blank black screen, you wouldn't easily be able to tell if the HDTV is on or off! The whites are really white, not yellowish or grayish.SMOOTH MOTION:_____________________20/20The 42-80 inch HDTV's in this model (the 2014 ""B"" model) are 120Hz true refresh rate, and the 32 inch is 60Hz. Motion is so smooth that it takes my breath away. Incredible for sports and movies with a lot of movement.SOUND:_____________________11/20The built-in speakers on this HDTV are slightly above average, for built-in speakers. They aren't muddy or tinny, and there is a very small amount of bass. You can always hook up a speaker system if you want great sound.DESIGN:_____________________19/20This HDTV is so beautiful that I sometimes just sit and stare at it, even when it's off. It is not ultra thin, but it is quite thin. The bezel, or frame, surrounding the screen is extremely thin, which makes it look very nice whether it's on or off. Everything about this HDTV looks like it was well thought through.REMOTE:_____________________19/20I love the remote! After a while, you can find most of the often used buttons by feel. This remote has all the important buttons, and has a keyboard at the back that lights up. It looks really nice, too.FEATURES:_____________________18/20This baby has hundreds of apps, including YouTube, Facebook, Amazon Instant Video, AccuWeather, Netflix, Twitter, iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, and much more. It also has a USB port for viewing your personal pictures, videos, and music. It is wall mountable as well. It also has a built-in digital tuner, so you can plug your antenna right into the HDTV without a nasty converter box. You can even name the inputs, so that you know which input is for which device. There are lots of settings and calibrating you can do with it, but I won't go into detail.VALUE:_____________________20/20This is one of the top LED HDTV's (excluding, OLED and 4k UHD, which are in another league), yet at an affordable price. Although it isn't quite as nice as an expensive Samsung HDTV, It comes extremely close (and surpasses in some areas) and is a good amount cheaper. You can't go wrong with Vizio, especially this Vizio HDTV!Two more notes:#1: Most TV Manufacturers exaggerate the refresh rate. They come up with names such as Clear Motion Rate, SPS, or MotionFlow, and label their HDTV's with higher refresh rates than they actually have (for example: 240Hz Clear Motion Rate). When reading statistics, check for the true refresh rate, often called ""Native Refresh Rate."" These Vizio M-Series HDTV's are 120Hz true refresh rate (except for the 32 inch, which is 60Hz). In case you were wondering, the refresh rate tells you how many times the screen ""refreshes,"" so generally, the higher the number, the smoother the motion will be.#2: Vizio has released the 2015 M Series. They are 4k Ultra HD (four times the resolution of full HD), and will probably be some of the most affordable 4k TVs this year (but if they are anything like the 2014 M series, they will still perform very well). They come in 43-80 inch sizes and are a bit more expensive than the 2014 version (but cheaper than the 2014 4k P Series). If you don't need 4k, I still highly recommend this TV.Thanks for reading!

"Pros:  It works  Cheap priceCons:  Cables are quite thin.  There is a little quality lossSummary:  This cable isn't incredible, but it is worthy of three stars because of the price. There is a little loss of volume using them, but it isn't too bad. I would like it if the cable was thicker, but it hasn't broken yet. All in all, it's a pretty good buy.

"Pros:   Not bulky, yet not flimsy   Much better quality than composite cables   Plugs in firmlyCons:   NoneYou have to push pretty hard to get them plugged in, so if you aren't getting all the colors (or no video whatsoever) on the screen, you might want to try pushing them in further. Also note that this is a video cable, not an A/V cable, which means it doesn't carry audio. If you do need audio, you will need a red and white RCA cable as well, such as this one: C2G / Cables to Go Value Series 40464 RCA Type Audio Cable (6 Feet, Black)I would definitely recommend this cable. It's really cheap in price, and the quality is great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R40LQZJ5O18S5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SJ5X2I#wasThisHelpful","R40LQZJ5O18S5","ABHVX10MEGARN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABHVX10MEGARN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*****UPDATED: May 25, 2015*****BROUGHT IT YESTERDAY... And I'm loving every minute of it !  I must state that, currently, SONY makes the best portable bluetooth speakers in the $100-$200 range. The X55 is, in my opinion, a ""home-based"" speaker. It is beautiful in its simplicity, it is elegant with its glass top, and it is heavy for its size due to its containing THREE speakers, one of which is a SUB-WOOFER . This speaker stays at home while its little brother, the X33 goes out traveling.  In my humble opinion both speakers are BETTER than the super-popular Bose soundlink mini with its over-empasized muffled-sounding bass.  Sorry but I like to hear a distinct bass-line in my music, and when the drummer is rocking out on his kit, I want to be able to hear each individual drum being hit.. They should not be all garbled together.FYI: - Speaker Driver Size :  2 Full-range - Approx 38 mm (1-1/2 in.) dia.  Subwoofer - Approx 58 mm (2-3/8 in.) dia.*****UPDATE June 9th*****  My top 4 bluetooth speakers (that I own) are:1- SONY x552- Stelle Audio Pillar3- JBL Charge 24- JBL Clip (pocket-sized)  I don't go anywhere without podcasts and or music.Thank you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32A609A0DK823/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTWZHBW#wasThisHelpful","R32A609A0DK823","A22K36X80X815R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22K36X80X815R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have never seen such ingenuity before.- A pleasure to listen to , even at full volume. A real rarity among small speakers.CONS:- The bass sounds a bit muffled, as if there is a towel in front of the speaker.- The highs are under represented, which means the bass and drums can get muddled together on certain tracks which are bass heavy.FYI:- after listening to 20 different speakers in the 100 - 200 dollar range, I chose the SONY srs-x5. It has a subwoofer for the lows and a surround-sound feature which adds sparkle to the highs. Go listen to both in person and listen for the individual instruments.

"As an ancient history enthusiast, I was well aware of Alexander the Greats campaigns, his amazing military victories, as well as his untimely death. I was also aware, in general terms, of the fact that his empire was ultimately divided among his top generals. However, I was not aware of the intricate details of how this partitioning actually took place or how bloody it turned out to be  the whole process lasting up to about a decade and a half after Alexanders death. Consequently, this book shed light on a period of ancient history that I knew very little about.I found that the author has done a superb job in recounting these complicated events, complete with the cast of intriguing characters, details of battles, political agendas, shrewdness showed by some and the unbridled determination of all parties involved. From one of the books sections to the next, the author hops from one or two individuals activities to those of another one or two, etc., while remaining more or less within the same timeline, i.e., this is what was happening over here while that is what was happening over there. This leads to several thrilling cliff-hangers which make the book very hard to put down. In addition, since many individuals have taken part in this story, the author often refreshes the readers memory of whos who by re-iterating an individuals identity when that person hasnt been discussed for several pages; I found this strategy to be indeed quite helpful.The writing style is clear, always lively, highly accessible and immensely captivating. Although any interested reader can enjoy this remarkable book, I believe that ancient history enthusiasts are likely to relish it the most.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FUX7GLRMPEL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307456609#wasThisHelpful","R1FUX7GLRMPEL4","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a book with this title and subtitle, I was expecting to see adequately detailed descriptions of navigational techniques complete with well-labelled geometrical diagrams as well as the necessary mathematics. I was also expecting to see a brief history of the sextant, along with clear diagrams of how it works. And finally, I was expecting to read about the adventures of past explorers and their contributions towards mapping the world. However, what I found within its covers was not quite all the above.On the positive side, I found the authors narratives about past explorers to be indeed quite captivating and lively. I think that it would have been difficult to write up these adventures in a more engrossing style. On the down side, as a reader with very little knowledge of navigation and its instruments, I found the discussions on the fundamentals of navigation to be not adequately illustrated. The sextant and its history are briefly outlined but not as detailed as I was hoping. Perhaps an appendix could have been included to contain clear and detailed figures and all of the necessary mathematics to allow an uninformed but mathematically-inclined reader like me to better understand what the various explorers had to do to find their way at sea using the sextant and the other techniques/instruments available. Also, the book contains a great many nautical terms that I was not familiar with. A brief glossary of some terms is included at the back of the book; however, a great many of the terms that I looked up there were not there. Needless to say, a significant part of the authors log entries during his trans-Atlantic voyage as a young man were unintelligible to me.Overall, I enjoyed the historical components of the book, but I was occasionally frustrated with the lack of technical navigational details. Consequently, I believe that those who are likely enjoy this book to the fullest are history enthusiasts who are already knowledgeable about navigation and about nautical terminology.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROD2THFVDNVY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062279343#wasThisHelpful","ROD2THFVDNVY0","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, the author weaves a thrilling tale of a zombie apocalypse falling upon an unsuspecting town. Written in the first person, the story revolves around a mathematics professor at a local college who gradually stumbles upon various uninfected colleagues and students who try to escape a zombie invasion and survive. Generously peppered throughout the story are detailed discussions on the mathematics, i.e., calculus, used to quantify various zombie characteristics. Most of the more involved derivations and calculations are relegated to an appendix which continues the story, in parts, through more detailed mathematics. Finally, a second appendix contains a more leisurely discussion between two of the characters about the basics of calculus  essentially a brief review.I found this book to be really quite captivating. In fact, the story was so gripping that I had difficulty putting the book down. The calculus is very well presented in a clear and accessible manner. In the books introduction, the author recommends that readers should have learned at least some calculus to better appreciate the book overall. I agree with that recommendation. However, a reader with no knowledge of mathematics and who totally ignores all of the mathematical discussions could still follow the essence of this thriller, i.e., the more typical human components.Finally, on a more realistic note, its hard to believe that a group of people who are fallen upon by a horde of murderous shuffling zombies would find the time or have the stomach to partake in teaching each other the finer points of calculus. But it certainly does make for a more enriching story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XUVQEQXJ80T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691161909#wasThisHelpful","R23XUVQEQXJ80T","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its been a while since Ive read a book as absolutely gripping as this one. The books title is certainly appropriate since all the stories discussed display some element of mystery. But the author does more than just recount them; he provides excellent, thoughtful and very often witty, commentary as the stories evolve. I was already familiar with a few of the stories in this book, but the way in which they are presented here is clearly the best and most engaging that Ive read so far.As can be gleaned from the above, I found the authors writing style to possess all of the essential characteristics found in the best page-turners. The prose is friendly, smooth, lively, adequately detailed, clever, accessible and highly absorbing. When I reached the end of the book, I was actually disappointed  I wanted to read about even more mysteries. Needless to say I found the book almost impossible to put down.Im sure that this book can be enjoyed by absolutely anyone, especially those who love good mysteries - particularly when they are either alleged to be true or are simply popular myths or legends.

"After having read this book from cover to cover, I can say that I am a bit disappointed. Although the author writes in a friendly accessible prose, some of his technical explanations are not so clear; a few even seem to be self contradictory. Unfortunately, I found this to be a relatively common occurrence in his prior two books of this series. However, I did find his first one, 100 Essential Things You Didnt Know You Didnt Know, to be a bit better than the next two.In the books 100 chapters, several topics are discussed. So, as expected based on personal interest, I found some quite captivating and informative but others rather boring. A few chapters contain some simple mathematical formulas but most do not. I would have preferred more mathematics since this might have compensated for the lack of adequate written explanations. In most of the chapters one does find some association between mathematical concepts and one of the arts.This book may be of interest to those with a curiosity about relationships between the arts and mathematics. Even the artistically inclined math-phobic could learn quite a bit from this book without the fear of being encumbered by mathematical formulas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5SQEY37AGBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393246558#wasThisHelpful","R1I5SQEY37AGBW","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this spellbinding book, the authors describe volcanic eruptions in the world with particular attention to the effects on humans, civilization and the environment. But the books main focus is on an Icelandic volcano called Laki and on the devastating effects of its 1783 eruption on the local inhabitants as well as in Europe and indeed the Northern Hemisphere. Other volcanic eruptions discussed include Toba, Tambora, Krakatau, Vesuvius, Etna and several others mainly in Iceland. Although the mechanics/geology of eruptions is briefly discussed, its the actual materials/chemicals that are spewed out and their respective devastating effects that the authors devote more space to.I must say that I had a very hard time putting this book down. The prose is clear, friendly, very lively, highly accessible and immensely captivating. The descriptions of the effects of the eruptions on people and livestock are particularly heart-wrenching.

"This is the second book from these authors, depicting various events in the lives of funeral directors. I have read their first one (Mortuary Confidential) and enjoyed it, but I found this one much better from my perspective. The prior book contained 50 stories from mortuaries across the USA, as collected and published by the authors. However, in this highly captivating book, the authors recount many of their own experiences in their profession, as well as a few choice stories from abroad. In addition, they share various aspects of their own personal lives, thus making this book more personable and, to me, more appealing. Although their prior book is mentioned a few times, reading it is not a prerequisite for reading this one.The authors writing style is, as in their prior book, clear, friendly and accessible; but in this case I found it more lively and engaging. Once again, the fact that the authors shared so much of their own personal histories in this profession made the book more enjoyable to me. This book can be relished by anyone, especially those with a curiosity about the people who work in this relatively mysterious field.I found that both books take a much needed light-hearted look at a subject that makes many people feel rather uncomfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQQTFCFQFJ88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806536640#wasThisHelpful","R1RQQTFCFQFJ88","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I learned quite a bit from this fascinating book. The authors main focus is on the rarity and/or value of various metals, e.g., the rare earths, gold, silver, platinum and several others. In doing so, he discusses our planets natural resources as well as their distribution, geology, chemistry and the technologies that would benefit from these metals. He also delves into various quite interesting issues such as politics, both national and international, military conflicts, economics, waste disposal and even the possibility of acquiring these metals from outside our planet.I found the authors breadth and depth of knowledge to be quite impressive, especially on the related socio-political issues in the world. I also found the writing style to be clear, lively, friendly, often witty and widely accessible.On the down side, I found a number of inaccuracies mainly in the early chapters where nuclear physics is discussed. I have listed the main ones at the end of this review for those who are interested as well as for consideration by the author should a revised edition of this book be published in the future.Overall, I found this book to be quite captivating. It can be enjoyed by anyone, particularly science enthusiasts as well as those interested in the social, political and scientific problems that may be faced in the development of new technology.Inaccurate/Misleading Information1) At the bottom of page 53, it seems to be implied that plutonium was used in both bombs dropped on Japan during World War II. In fact, the Hiroshima bomb was a uranium bomb.2) Near the bottom of page 57, the Ivy Mike test is discussed where it is pointed out that it was a twelve-kiloton explosion  four times the combined might of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In fact the yield of the Ivy Mike test was about 10 megatons making it about 300 times the yield of the combined bombs dropped on Japan.3) The discussion on the decay of carbon-14 on page 72 and its use in radiocarbon dating is incorrect. Carbon-14 decays by beta minus emission to stable nitrogen-14. What is used in carbon-14 dating is the concentration ratio of carbon-14 atoms relative to carbon-12 atoms in a formerly living organism - carbon-14 decaying at a known rate, thus decreasing the above ratio at a known rate over time. Carbon -14 is never stable, before or after the organism dies.4) Regarding the creation of curium and americium, near the top of page 73, it should be noted that neither of these two elements have any stable isotopes.5) Near the bottom of page 101, the inverse square law is discussed. In calculating the dose rate at a given distance from a source of ionizing radiation, several factors must be taken into account, e.g., nature of radiation, shielding, scattering, source shape, etc. If one is using the inverse square law, this implies that the source must be a point source as seen at the distance where the dose rate is being determined.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMCCLHJUB6IXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616149728#wasThisHelpful","RMCCLHJUB6IXZ","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read the comments on this books cover, I thought that it would be filled with hilarious, knee-slapping anecdotes from funeral directors as they were experienced during their careers. After all, the potential is certainly there. But what I found was different.This book is comprised of a series of fifty stories/experiences reported by various funeral directors (or their staff) across the USA during their careers. The book is divided into a series of sections that cover the different aspects of their business: removal of bodies, preparing them, interactions with family members of the deceased, wakes, funerals, etc.I found most of the stories to be interesting in that they represent various incidents that can happen during a funeral director (or parlor employee)s day-to-day life in the business. Some of the stories were rather sad, some were mildly humorous but most were events somewhere in the middle. So, the outrageous hilarity that I was expecting was definitely not there. In retrospect, I believe that people in any trade/profession could write a similar book, possibly with much more humour, especially if dealing with members of the public is a factor.The book is well-written in a style that is clear, friendly, accessible and occasionally lively. It should be of interest to anyone curious about the professional lives of people who take care of us after we die.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJ4B06NDVB7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806531797#wasThisHelpful","R1WJ4B06NDVB7F","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The topics are quite varied, but they are all carefully classified by subject  40 of them  each subject being presented in the form of a list of four or five (or more) entries which are each discussed over a page or two.Once I got used to the lingo, there were still a few one-liners that went over my head, especially those involving some peoples names - people that Ive never heard of before (but thats only due to my own ignorance).

"Ive been following Arnolds progress in bodybuilding since the 1970s. I also read his book Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder as soon as it came out. So I was already familiar with much of the information in about the first third of this book. After enjoying Arnolds series of movies over the years, I lost track of him when he went into U.S. politics and became governor of California. This book contains all of stages in Arnolds life and it certainly filled in the gaps for me. Of particular interest were the behind-the-scenes activities/problems/challenges/etc. faced by actors and movie makers when developing and filming a movie. This gave me a new insiders perspective for when I watch Arnolds movies again.I found this book to be not only an excellent page-turner, but also a most inspiring work. Arnolds intrinsic mindset, his bull-headed determination in setting difficult goals and working hard to succeed in achieving them, and his much sought-after ability to turn obstacles into opportunities have been instrumental in constructing the amazing life that he has led.Arnold has always been an icon for me, so it goes without saying that this book should be greatly enjoyed by Arnold fans, like me, everywhere. But I also believe that there is so much here that anyone could appreciate: one can learn a great deal about life in general and that the fulfillment of ones dreams is attainable  if one is willing to make the necessary sacrifices and do the necessary work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NIDQIHT9CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451662440#wasThisHelpful","R30NIDQIHT9CH","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One would think that a book detailing the history of nuclear/atomic accidents, with lots of technical detail, would likely be of interest only to the most devoted nuclear/reactor physicists/engineers. Not so in this case! Certainly there are a lot technical descriptions of how reactors and other apparatus are made and how they operate, as well as play-by-play descriptions of how the various accidents occurred and their aftermaths. The descriptions are clear, most specialized terms are explained and the events leading to the various disasters are told in a most captivating way. But in my view, what makes this book so special is the authors writing style, particularly his careful choice of words when describing the events that transpired: wittiness, tongue-in-cheek narratives, subtle sarcasm, etc. I often found myself laughing out loud at the way the author presents some of his material. Because of all of this, at least in part, I believe that this book can be enjoyed by a fairly broad readership.One might expect that a tome like such as this one would contain a number of mistakes  editorial or otherwise. I must admit that I found very few. Other than a couple of misprints, i.e., on page 12, radium-266 should be radium 226 and on page 283, cesium-167 should be cesium-137, I did find one error of greater significance which may of interest to nit-pickers like me: footnote 82 at the bottom of page 99 is incorrect. In particular, the roentgen (R) and the rem are entirely different quantities. Very briefly, the roentgen applies only to X-ray and gamma-ray photons and is defined in terms of the ionization of air, i.e., the absolute value of the total charge of the ions of one sign produced per unit mass of air. Roentgens can be converted to rads (or rems) to human tissue using appropriate conversion factors whose values depend on the energy of the incident photons.Overall, I believe that this book is a major contribution to the literature that describes various aspects of the nuclear field, which has often been perceived by the general public as being disturbing and obscure, in understandable, relatively jargon-free, language. It puts various nuclear accidents into perspective and makes the structure and operation of several nuclear devices more widely accessible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QK5VV99B7ZYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605984922#wasThisHelpful","R3QK5VV99B7ZYL","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From getting up in the morning to going to bed at night, the author describes a typical day in his life, all the while concentrating on mathematizing various things/events/processes that he sees around him. From functions to differentiation to integration, the reader is gently guided through the nature of calculus and how it can be used to solve various problems in the real world. This is all done in a most painless way; the more in-depth calculational details are relegated to appendices. Although, as pointed out by the author, the mathematical models that are developed here are crude approximations to reality, the approaches that are used are important and serve to illustrate the power of calculus.On the down side, I did find a few errors, e.g., Galileo did not invent the telescope (as stated on p.17), the speed of light is not 11,176,920 miles per second (as given on p. 47), etc. However, I did not find many such mistakes and they do not detract from the essence of the book.I found the writing style to be very friendly, lively, authoritative, highly accessible and quite captivating. Although any interested reader could enjoy this little book (117 pages of main text), it would likely be most appreciated by math/science enthusiasts. The book could also be used as an enjoyable complement to an introductory course in calculus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16J5P3ATVECUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691157553#wasThisHelpful","R16J5P3ATVECUY","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this enjoyable book, the author recounts what is currently known about the history of the San Andreas Fault in California and the mechanics of earthquakes in general. Adjacent faults are also discussed and explanations are provided as to how these faults are related to each other, how they behave and, of course, the damage that associated earthquakes have caused. The author also provides brief yet quite captivating accounts of the contributions of dedicated individuals who have done pioneering research into the scientific understanding of earthquakes. Included are: the types of faults, how earthquake magnitudes are measured, important considerations for building structures, efforts at predicting future cataclysms, etc.I found this book to be well written in a style that is friendly, lively and generally captivating. However, since some of the passages are fairly technical, e.g., types of rocks and strata, types of faults, interrelationships between them, etc., I believe that diagrams/figures should have been included for illustration purposes; such figures would certainly have helped me.I believe that this book can be enjoyed by a fairly broad readership: general readers can glean information on earthquakes and human efforts towards understanding them, and avid earth science buffs can, in addition, appreciate the more technical discussions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CK1L5NKL5OV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605984957#wasThisHelpful","R3CK1L5NKL5OV3","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The end of the Bronze Age, which has been estimated to have occurred c. 1200 B.C., has been the subject of much discussion among scholars for many years. The main issue being: How could several thriving empires  the civilized world at the time - all suddenly collapse within just a few years/decades? In this fascinating book, the author, an archaeologist and expert on this topic, attempts to answer this intriguing question.Starting a few centuries earlier (fifteenth century B.C.), the author sets the scene. He describes the empires/civilizations that existed at the time, how they evolved and how they interacted with each other, especially through trade. He then describes the destruction of each of these major centers: when it happened and how it appears to have happened. He then discusses each of the probable causes for such a widespread calamity. Throughout, he backs up his arguments with solid, up-to-the-minute archaeological evidence and also presents the views of other scholars in this field.  Finally, he describes what he and several other experts believe actually happened to bring an end the Bronze Age  something which I found rather surprising yet very compelling.For me, this book was quite engaging and very hard to put down. The author writes for a wide readership in a style that is authoritative yet accessible, lively, friendly and very captivating. I believe that this book can be enjoyed by any interested reader; however, ancient history/archaeology enthusiasts, like me, should be in for a treat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPUQ1SBZ6HZUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691140898#wasThisHelpful","RPUQ1SBZ6HZUD","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this to be a truly amazing book! The author, a professor of physics and a long-time science fiction aficionado, provides a scientifically critical look at science fiction and fantasy stories. The book is divided into four main parts: fantasy (wizards, etc.), space travel, other worlds/aliens, and the survival of humanity (world building, possible future capabilities, etc.). The author does not shy away from the mathematics involved. Consequently, (and to the joy of math/science enthusiasts like me) the book contains plenty of formulas that are immensely helpful in better understanding the various points that the author makes. These formulas are kept simple, are not generally derived but are clearly explained and used in the main text.I found the authors writing style to be very clear, quite authoritative, lively and extremely captivating. On the down side, the book contains a significant number of editorial mistakes of various sorts. Also, in some formulas, sometimes the same symbol is used for different quantities (in different formulas); this can be sorted out through careful reading of the text. Finally, in a very few formulas, a given symbol is not defined; again, a careful perusal of the text can usually make sense of them.Despite the fact that those who are math phobic may cringe at the sight of the books subtitle, I do believe that they can still enjoy it and learn much from it  the authors prose alone contains all the essential information. Consequently, I think that this book can be enjoyed by any interested reader; however, science buffs should relish it the most.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ASVVEZ52BMGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691147159#wasThisHelpful","R2ASVVEZ52BMGV","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The books title refers to Edmond Halleys ocean voyages which were commissioned to map the deviations of magnetic north from true north  this mainly to provide a tool for mariners to estimate longitude at sea. However, the book contains much more. In fact, Halleys scientific life is rather well covered, as well as his interactions with his contemporaries, e.g., Isaac Newton, Robert Hooke, John Flamsteed, etc. Halleys interests in so many scientific disciplines, as well as his significant contributions to them, are truly outstanding.I found the book to be generally well-written in a lively, often quite gripping prose. My only disappointment was with some of the passages pertaining to scientific, technical and nautical matters. Several specialized terms were used without being defined or explained. Science enthusiasts, like me, have an advantage here in the scientific discussions; however, in my case, some of the nautical terms left me scratching my head.But despite this shortcoming, I believe that this book could be still enjoyed by a wide readership -  particularly by those who have a penchant for seventeenth/eighteenth century European history and, of course, by science buffs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIT8042BDOZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0309095948#wasThisHelpful","RIIT8042BDOZY","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

From ancient perspectives on chance events to modern thought on whether randomness truly exists, the author guides the reader through a subject matter that has perplexed humankind for millennia. In addition, various probability problems are discussed, as are results of research in this fascinating discipline.The author writes well, in a prose that is friendly, lively and engaging.

"This is one of several books on the risks of medical screening that have been written in recent years. Here, in eleven chapters, the author discusses the screening of various body parts to search for abnormalities: from whole body CT scans to eyeball pressure  there are even chapters on mental health screening and self-screening. In each case, he discusses how the supposed need for the screening of healthy individuals came about, the promoters, the techniques used, their effectiveness (or lack thereof), the dangers involved of the techniques themselves and the possible post-screening consequences. Along the way, he presents various case studies of healthy individuals who were somehow injured through unnecessary medical screening. Throughout, the author makes what I think are common-sense recommendations that should be seriously considered by everyone.I found the authors writing style to be clear, friendly, lively and quite captivating. I believe that this book, and others like it, should be read by everyone, if only to make healthy people aware of the possible dangers of medical screening and guide them towards making well-informed decisions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JKYT0VNBL7VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087GK266#wasThisHelpful","R2JKYT0VNBL7VV","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several decades ago, I took a superb thermodynamics course as part of a university physics program. It was extremely theoretical with, as can be expected, a lot of mathematical derivations, proofs, etc., but short on applications to the real world. This excellent book complements such a course: it is loaded with actual applications of various heat engines: jet, gasoline, diesel, refrigerators, heat pumps, etc.The book is designed so that it does necessarily not have to be read from cover to cover, which is what I did. Consequently, each chapter contains a certain amount of repetition  something which I found to be quite refreshing. References are routinely made to other chapters regarding various techniques, definitions, etc. Once a topic is presented, practical examples are given in a clear step-by-step format. The various formulas that are included are simple and generally not derived in the book.I noticed that the author has used various terms/quantities that I was not familiar with. It turns out that these are particularly useful in the engineering/technological world and not necessary in the theoretical physics domain.I believe that this book could be extremely useful to engineering/technology students because of its friendly style, clarity and all the practical applications. But I also believe that it could be useful for physics students who are exposed mainly to the theory/mathematics/derivations in thermodynamics but less to real world applications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXV93LPC2IRMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D7EHN6#wasThisHelpful","RXV93LPC2IRMS","A2VX6A9UZBLEPI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VX6A9UZBLEPI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Holy Cow!!!!  What an ending!!!  Lauren has stepped up her game when it comes to suspense.  She definitely left me hanging with this one.  Lauren is truly a master when it comes to giving us passion, suspense, mystery and romance in her stories.Sinful Longing is the 3rd book in Lauren's Sinful Nights series.  This series is a romantic suspense series.  Each of these books are about a new couple but the storyline is a continuing one, so it is not recommended to read these books out of order.  I think you would be lost or confused if you did.The Sinful Nights series is about the Sloan family (Shannon, Ryan, Colin and Michael) and their love interests, but it is also about solving some old haunts when it comes to the murder of their father 18 years ago.  The mysterious storyline begins in Sweet Sinful Nights (Book  1) and Sinful Desire (Book 2) and then carries over into this book and will conclude in Sinful Love (Book 4).  Some questions are answered in this book, but some new ones are created.  I am going to go ahead and label this book a Cliffhanger, because the epilogue will definitely leave you hanging and wanting Michael's book ASAP!!!!  Now that I say that, you don't have to wait for Sinful Love (Michael's Book) to be released to read this book.  Just know that some new questions are going to arise when you finish reading this book.  I know I can't wait to see how this story will be wrapped up in the final book.I have to be honest and say this isn't my favorite out of the three books so far.  I just felt something was missing in this story.  Now don't get me wrong the suspenseful storyline is truly what saved this book for me, that and all the spicy scenes ;)  I love where this story is going and that Lauren keeps the reader guessing all the way through.  What I had trouble with in this book was the connection between Colin and Elle.  It was just missing something.  I had a hard time connecting with Elle's character.  As for Colin he is just as dreamy as his brother Ryan and he sure knows how to melt a pair of panties!!!Colin and Elle's story is all about taking risks.  Elle is a single mother of a 14 year boy and she is a social worker at a community center.  That is how Colin and Elle know each other.  Colin is a venture capitalist who volunteers at the center.  Colin is also a recovering addict and Elle is scared to connect with Colin because her husband died of a drug overdose and Elle watched him spiral out of control.  She is afraid of that happening with Colin and she won't put her son through that again.  So to say that they are more like friends with benefits would be an accurate portrayal of their relationshipat least in the beginning.  As time moves on and Colin and Elle open up to each other, Elle learns she can trust Colin and he isn't like her dead husband.  But of course things get in their way and Elle is quick to push him away.  Will Colin's risk taking and past come between these two??  You need to read this book to find out.At the end of Sinful Desire we meet Marcus and he is revealed as the Sloan's half brother.  His mom is their mom also.  I liked that we got to know Marcus more in this book and loved the connection she created between him and the Sloan siblings.  I am interested in seeing how things will work out after the bomb Marcus drops at the end of the book.  It was also great seeing the other couples in this book.  We got more Ryan and Sophie in this story and I was thrilled about that because they are my favorite couple of this series.  We did get a little bit of a sneak peek at Michael in this book and hints about his past, I am interested to see who his love interest will be.So I'll leave you with this.even though this isn't my favorite, you still need to READ this series/book!!!  You won't be sorry and I can be sure that you will become addicted to Ms. Blakely's writing like I am.  I look forward to every book she releases and I always walk away with a smile on my face and wanting more of her books!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21401YRWDUUR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142ZNO7E#wasThisHelpful","R21401YRWDUUR8","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not one who normal picks up a book that is in the middle or end of series, but I have always heard great things about Carly Phillips books and the cover and blurb for Dare to Seduce caught my attention.  I am a sucker for a forbidden Brother's Best Friend love story.Now as with any interconnected standalone series, like this one, Each book can be read by itself, but to get the true feeling of the characters it is recommended to read the books in order.  Now don't worry if you don't because this is the first book in this series I have read and I wasn't lost or felt like I was missing anything.  Carly does a wonderful job keeping the reader informed about past couples or characters.  I will admit however, that after reading this book I am definitely going back to read all the other books in this series.  I fell in love with Carly's writing style and creative stories and lovable characters.  Plus she knows how to write one steamy love story ;)One thing I truly enjoyed about this book was that we get to the heart of the story right away.  Carly doesn't add in extra details to the story.  I find that refreshing :)  This was also a fairly quick read written in dual POV.  Also this book wasn't overloaded with outside drama.  Any drama that was written into the story was caused by the fears or insecurities of the heroine.  But what I loved the most was how Max stuck by Lucy no matter what.  He wouldn't allow her to run away because of her fears.  He helped her work through things.  Truthfully they helped each other overcome past fears and pains.In this story we follow the love story of Max Savage (Best Friend of Gabe and Decklan Dare, Lucy's brothers) and Lucy Dare.  This is definitely a friends to lovers story, but in the end it is also kind of like a second chance love story.  Lucy and Max have known each other since they were kids.  Lucy of course has been in love with Max since then, but Max's feelings didn't truly grow until Lucy was older and returned home from College.  Scared her brother's wouldn't approve Max fought his feelings.  Some seriously tragic things happen, which intern keep Lucy and Max apart for years.  Now Lucy is back for her brother Decklan's engagement party and Max isn't letting her slip through his fingers again.  Can Max and Lucy finally give into their feelings and find their HEA??  You'll need to read this book to find out.I would definitely recommend this book.  If you are looking for a quick, sweet and sexy friend's to lovers story, then you don't want to pass this one up.  I know after reading this book, I look forward to reading the other's in this series.  Carly Phillips has definitely found herself a new fan :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW7N6P27YLEB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143CT6DC#wasThisHelpful","RW7N6P27YLEB7","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only downfall to Kendall Ryan writing a novella, is that it is not nearly long enough!!!  I want more of Hudson and Gracie!!!I fell in love with Hudson in Screwed and was excited to find out he was getting his own story.  This book didn't disappoint at all.  I love Hudson even more now and Gracie was just so sweet and innocent, But not in an annoying way.Monster Prick is a standalone novella told in Dual POV.  It is a forbidden romance story because it is a story about a brother's best friend, which we all know is forbidden territory.  This is a very quick read and should only take a couple hours to read at most.  But what I thought was great, was that even though this is a novella, I didn't feel like anything was missing.  We got a fun, sweet and sexy read.  She even added a touch of drama to keep things interesting.  I think the reason I had such a connection to these characters was because we met them in Screwed.  That book is not required to be read first but to get the true feeling of both Gracie and Hudson, I would recommend it.Gracie and Hudson have known each other most of their lives and both have been harboring hidden feelings for one another the whole time.  Gracie has always held back her feelings because she didn't think Hudson would ever go for her.  And Hudson always held back because of his close friendship with Hayden (Gracie's Brother).  That is until Gracie announces that she signed up for online dating and was looking for someone to take her v-card from her.  Hudson, not happy with that at all, comes up with a plan to help her.  What neither of them were expecting was that their feelings might grow into something much bigger.  Find out how Gracie and Hudson weather the storm as they enter uncharted territory, by reading Monster Prick.  Will these two get their HEA??  You'll have to read it to find out.If you are a fan of Kendall Ryan's you don't want to miss this little gem.  If you are someone looking to pass a couple hours with a sweet and sexy read, then you definitely should give this novella a try, you won't be sorry!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCHNFP0MC3AE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014X8XL1Y#wasThisHelpful","RHCHNFP0MC3AE","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No matter whether she is writing about a swoony cowboy or fast talking NASCAR driver, Kelly Elliott knows how to write about LOVE.Ignite is the first book in a new series by Kelly Elliott and it was just as fabulous as her Wanted Series.  I love reading anything by Kelly because her books just sweep me away.  She writes such swoony love stories, you can't help but fall in love with her characters and stories.What I loved about this book was that she went outside of her norm and entered the world of race car driving.  I haven't read too many books about NASCAR so that piqued my interest right away, but then knowing Kelly wrote it, I knew I HAD to read this book.  I am so glad I did, because what we got is the best of Kelly Elliott.  This book was told in Dual POV.  It's a second chance romance book with the hint of suspense.  The book was truly about the love story between Emmitt and Adaline, but she added some suspense to the storyline to keep you turning the pages.  She was even able to shock me at the end of the book.  I totally didn't see it coming.This is the love story of Emmitt and Adaline.  Emmitt and Adaline have been friends since elementary school and then moved into a relationship as they grew older.  At age 19 Emmitt was starting to make a name for himself in the NASCAR world, but Adaline wanted to follow her own dreams.  She has wanted to be a nurse and go to school for that.  So deciding to follow her dreams she decides to leave Emmitt and go to school.  Now it's 3 years later and she is ready to go back to Emmitt.  Although Emmitt might not have the same feelings.Adaline's return into Emmitt's life was not a smooth one.  Even though Emmitt has loved Addie for the past three years he is having trouble letting go of the hurt.  I enjoyed watching these two work through everything.  They do have their ups and downs and Addie has some trust issues, but over all they function together fairly well.  Just like her cowboys, Emmitt the NASCAR driver was great!!!  Even though in the beginning he was a player, I fell in love with him as the story progressed.  What I loved about both these characters was that they loved with their whole heart and went after what they wanted!!!As always Kelly introduced us to some wonderful secondary characters, and she also gave us those characters we love to hate.  It wouldn't be a Kelly Elliott book without some of the drama she cooks up.  I am looking forward to reading Malcolm's book..that is going to be an interesting story ;)So if you love Kelly Elliott or are looking for a great second chance love story built around the world of NASCAR, then you aren't going to want to miss this book!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HS2MNRUFRNPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01605OPZ4#wasThisHelpful","R2HS2MNRUFRNPC","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Last Shot is the third novel that I have read by Sara Hubbard and I really enjoyed it.  Her stories suck me in with her blurbs and then keep ahold of me as soon as I read the first page.  I took a chance on a new author when I read her book inCAPABLE and I am still extremely happy I did.  She hasn't disappointed me yet.What I love the most about her books is that she doesn't overload them with extra stuff that normally slows a story down.  She keeps the pace and flow moving right along.The Last Shot is a second chance love story based around a hockey theme.  I will tell you though the hockey aspect really plays a small part in this story, so if that's the reason for choosing this book, just beware the hockey theme is the secondary plot to the storyline.  If you are a fan of second chance love stories, then you really don't want to miss this one.  I thought this story was well written.  It is told in Dual POV.  Another thing I liked was that this book wasn't too heavy.  I say that because what we learn about Annie's and Ethan's past.  I like that she gave us just enough history on the characters for us to connect with them and know why they are the way they are without bringing the mood of the story down.  I was happy she concentrated on the second time around for Annie and Ethan.  They had a special love story :)We meet Annie and Ethan in this story.  They have known each other since Annie moved to Rawdon as a young child.  Annie is abandoned  by her mother and when things go bad for her in foster care she is sent to live with her nan.  This is how she meets Ethan.  Ethan came from a  good home until his mom dies of cancer and his dad falls off the deep end turning into a drunk and a mean one at that.  Ethan seeks comfort from Annie and her nan.  They forged a friendship that eventually turned into more and then Ethan was given his ultimate dream.a contract in the NHL.  Annie and Ethan try to make things work when he leaves, but Annie was always told by her mom, to leave a man before he can leave you, so that is what Annie does.  Now fast forward 3 years and Ethan is forced to come back to Rawdon, because his brother Manny was hurt and in the hospital.  This is when Annie and Ethan reunite.  What I'll say from here is that their road to a HEA is not an easy or smooth one, but they work through it all together.The only secondary character I liked was Manny (Ethan's brother)  I think he has a story there and I hope we get a book about him.  He deserves to be happy too.I don't think there was just one thing about this book that spoke to me, it was everything about this book.  The writing was fantastic.  The characters were engaging and believable.  The storyline was great and I just loved how the author told this story.  I would definitely recommend this book, especially to those readers who are fans of the second chance romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N6WF40XN09BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015AUEQHC#wasThisHelpful","R3N6WF40XN09BE","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow!!!  What an amazing ride this book was.  I have to be honest.I truly think this just might be my favorite Emma Hart book and it even beats out Twisted Bond (book 1 in the series).Emma Hart has done it again!!!  Tethered Bond is the Third book in her Holly Woods Files Series and this book is the reason I fell in love with this series.  It had everything mystery, suspense, intrigue, romance, Nonna and a crazy Parrot :)  My heart was racing through most of this book.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out how this story unfolded.I am going to warn you this review is going to be short and vague, because I can't talk about the storyline hardly at all because everything would be a spoiler and this is a story you want to unravel yourself ;)This book had me guessing and on the edge of my seat all the way through.  I found this storyline interesting because I haven't read a mystery/suspense story with a religion based storyline.  I thought this was a unique and intriguing story and very well written.  I also loved that Emma focused more on the mystery of the story and threw in just enough romance between Noelle and Drake to keep her readers happy.  I mean what would a book in this series be without the sassy and smart mouthed banter between Drake and Noelle.Tethered Bond is not a stand alone book.  Just like Twisted Bond (book 1) and Tangled Bond (book 2)  Tethered Bond is a complete story and the mystery is solved by the end, but what makes these books NOT stand alones, is the on going story between Drake and Noelle.  Each of these books follows their journey and how they handle being in a relationship together.  This book will test their bond.  Will they come out unscathed or will their job threaten their happiness together??  You'll just have to read the book to find out.What I loved about this book was we got some more background on Drake and Noelle.  We find out why Drake doesn't like Messina and we also find out exactly happened with Noelle in her past in Dallas.  I enjoyed watching these two continue to open up to each other and continue to learn how to trust and love one another.  There are many times these two characters had me laughing out loud.  I absolutely love their dynamic and when you throw in her family, Nonna and a crazy talking Parrot, you can't help but laugh :)So if you are a fan of Emma Hart, you don't want to miss this book!!!  I would also recommend this book/series to anyone who is a fan of a romantic suspense story.  If you like a book that is full of twists and turns, mystery, and intrigue..then PICK this book up, you won't be sorry!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLS0BJPR7JQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TNHLPI#wasThisHelpful","RKLS0BJPR7JQF","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What drew me to this book was the blurb but what truly sucked me in was when I read the sneak peek of the Prologue!!! This is the first book by either of these authors that I have read and I am so glad I took a chance on something new, because this is a book everyone should read!!!!Cruel and Beautiful is a story with so much emotion. I knew going into this that this book was going to be both heart warming and heart wrenching and I was correct. The emotions this book drew out of me was amazing!! This is truly one woman's journey to finding love, letting love go and learning to love again. Cate truly had to go through the cruel to find the beautiful.The authors created a story that you can't help feeling like you are a part of these characters lives. All the characters, both the primary and secondary ones, were essential to this story. They all landed support, love, guidance and even some comic relief. This book does cover a sensitive subject and I believe this story will hit home for many readers out there. You will definitely need tissues while reading this book.I absolutely love when two authors join forces to create a story. What is truly remarkable is when their writing style mesh so well you can't tell who wrote what part. The flow of this story was amazing. I also loved that this was a stand alone novel.This story is told in Cate's POV. We learn about her past and present in alternating chapters. I thought this was an interesting way to tell her story, but I have to admit I was slightly confused in the beginning. I also felt that the alternating chapters between past and present went on too long. This was my only negative about this book. The main reason I wish the authors would've shortened the past storyline sooner was because I felt that there was more to Cate's present story that could've been played out. Like the epilogue could've actually been more of the main story for Cate.I would 100% recommend this book, but just remember to have some tissues with you when you do. You will need them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JWEV6YY09DTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GFDQPW#wasThisHelpful","R2JWEV6YY09DTF","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an enjoyable read and a good addition to this series. I will say that I still liked the first book better. This one the story was fairly predictable and the storyline was just missing something. I still really enjoyed this read and will continue to read the other books in this series when they are released.What I think I had the hardest part with in this book was that it lacked a WOW factor like the first book. Truth Kills was all about the mystery and romance and sex and it kept you on your toes, but this one really didn't have that. I felt kind of underwhelmed once the ""lie"" was revealed. The author did try to add some element of surprise when it came to Lenore, but by that time I felt it was too late to be in the storyline. I would've liked the Lenore storyline to have played more of a role in the book, because that would've brought in that element of mystery and suspense.All in all I enjoyed this book and would recommend to readers. Just like the first book, this is a standalone story and you don't have to read Truth Kills first to understand the story. Jamie does a great job connecting the dots for the reader so you know how everyone is connected and what part they play in each others lives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359Q04UZ0ELEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016YVYO9Q#wasThisHelpful","R359Q04UZ0ELEQ","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As excited as I was to read Painter and Melanie's story, I have to say this wasn't my favorite of Joanna Wylde's books that I have read.  Now I will say that I did enjoy this book but it just didn't WOW me.  I loved the overall storyline and the intriguing storyline involving all of the MC clubs, but I think what brought this book down for me was the connection between Painter and Melanie.This book was filled with A LOT of drama and angst when it came to Melanie and Painter.  Now I knew going into this that their journey wasn't going to be an easy one, that point hits home even more once you read the prologue, but I didn't think the angst and Melanie's stubbornness would last the majority of the book.  I did really like both Painter and Melanie as characters.Painter was an Alpha with a bossy attitude but he also had his sweet side and tender heart (especially when Izzy came into play).  You truly can't help but fall in love with him.  Yes he makes some MAJOR mistakes in this story, but you can totally feel his regret and we get to see a completely different side to him.  He did everything he could to change his ways and prove his love for Melanie.Now Melanie on the other hand, I really liked her character as well, until like the last 30% of the book.  She is strong, and fierce and loved with her whole heart.  She believed in Painter when no one else did.  Then when things went south, she pulled herself together and made it through.  What my biggest issue with her was how long she held her grudge against Painter.  No I didn't want her to just roll over and forgive him, I loved that she made him work for it, but once he proved himself to her, she still wouldn't let it go.  I had to agree with Painter when her called her a hypocrite.  She would bag on him about the Reaper's but at every turn they were there to help her when she needed it.  By this point I really wanted to smack her.  This didn't totally deter my enjoyment of the book, but it was why I couldn't give it a higher rating.I will continue to read Joanna's books, because when it comes to an MC story she is the best by far.  Just because this wasn't my favorite, I still look forward to more of her stories to come.  I loved that she gave us a double epilogue, because the first one finished Melanie and Painter's story and the second one set up Gage and Tinker's story.  That is a story I am looking forward too ;)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MUG6A2CKS9ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFM0#wasThisHelpful","R2MUG6A2CKS9ZB","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each time I read a Kristen Proby book, I fall more and more in love with her writing.  Her books just put me into a happy place and I can't help but have a huge smile on my face.  Her books are literary works of art in my opinion.Her stories and characters are so full of love and emotion, you can't help but get drawn in.  She writes with such feeling you can't help but feel like you are a part of these books.  What I love the most about her books is that they aren't overloaded with excess drama.  Yes she adds a little here and there just to keep the readers attention, but she knows how to balance all the elements of the story to make it a smooth read.Easy Melody is the 3rd book in her Boudreaux Series and it was just as wonderful as the first two are.  I absolutely love this Boudreaux Family.  They have such warmth and compassion and really look out for each other.  They are what I believe most families aspire to be in real life.  This book was a sweet and sexy read with an amazing Hero and a sassy heroine.  I can't say for sure but I swear the books in this series are getting steamier and steamier as they are released ;)  Not that I am complaining!!!  As with the other book in this series, this is fairly quick read, one you can finish in a day or less.Easy Melody is the story of Declan Boureaux and Callie Mills.  Callie is originally from New Orleans and was raised by a single dad after her mom dies when she is young.  Her dad over time becomes an alcoholic, so when Callie is old enough she leaves New Orleans for Denver and starts her life over.  10 Years later she is forced to come back to New Orleans after her father passes away.  He has left the family bar to her and she has to figure out what to do with it.  While she is back in New Orleans, her boyfriend and boss Keith calls her and literally breaks up with her and fires her all in one phone call.  So realizing she has nothing to go back to, Callie decides to stay in New Orleans and run the bar with her BFF Adam.  This is where she meets Declan, because he is a musician who plays at the bar a couple times a week.  Lets just say when Declan sees Callie for the first time he is smitten and will not take No for an answer.  He is determined to get to know Callie, in every way her can.  Now Declan is known as a player, so will Callie be able to tame his wild ways and make an honest man out of him??  You'll just have to read the book to find out!!!Again in this book we get to see all of the Boudreaux clan and we also get to meet some new characters.  I love that all the characters overlap in the stories.  Each of these books can be read as a stand alone, but to fully appreciate this family unit, you will want to read them in order.  As like in the first two books, the epilogue in this book is a sneak peek to the next book in the series.  Easy Kisses is going to be Charly and Simon's story and I can't wait to meet Simon ;)  Another aspect to this book that I truly loved was that she included a cameo from a few of the couples from her With Me in Seattle Series.  I thought that was great!!!So whether you are a fan of Kristen's books or haven't read any of them yetdon't wait, pick up this book and read it now!!!  You don't want to miss reading about this amazing family and what is  left to come for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RN9XIRZQSHM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153VNDZY#wasThisHelpful","R2RN9XIRZQSHM0","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Are you a fan of the Forbidden Love Story?  Do you like Angst??  Well if you answered yes to either or both of these questions, then you NEED to read Sins of Sevin by Penelope Ward.I have been a HUGE fan of Penelope's from the very beginning.  I have read every book she has written and I am happy to say that I have NEVER been disappointed by her work.  Sins of Sevin was no exception.  I truly loved this book.  I have to be honest I was a little nervous going into this book, because after reading the blurb, I was afraid of how she would handle the aspect of cheating and a love triangle (both which are hard limits for me when reading a book)  Well don't worry, she does a fantastic job while covering these things.  Yes there is cheating in this book, but the way it was written into this story, it just worked and I found I wasn't bothered by it.  As for  the love triangle aspect, this wasn't really an issue.  I can't really explain why without spoiling things, but just know that this isn't a triangle type story.  There is clearly one couple who are meant to be together in this book.I honestly don't know if I can truly express in words how I felt about this book.  Nothing I come up with seems to do it justice.  I felt so many things while reading this story.  It truly is a heart wrenching story of forbidden love.  I love how Penelope sucks you into the story right from the beginning.  The prologue is sure to grab your attention and you won't be able to put the book down until the story is over.  That is one thing that is consistent with Penelope's books.I never want them to end and they seem to end way too quickly!!!!Sins of Sevin was an interesting storyline.  In some ways the set up and the delivery of the story reminded me of My Skylar, but it was also so different from anything I have ever read.  This just proves that Penelope is a phenomenal writer, because she can always seem to come up with outstanding books and characters that continue on in your heart and mind well after you have finished the book.  This book was truly beautifully written and surpassed all my expectations.  This story was intense at times, heartwarming at other times and down right heart wrenching at other times, but just know that in the end, Penelope knows how to heal a broken heart in the best way!!!!  I will say that at times I had to remind myself that this was a contemporary romance because with the way Penelope wrote some of the scenes, it truly felt like I was taken back in time.  It's hard to explain, but you'll understand once you read this book.This book is one I truly believe people should go into blind because I think any teasers or reviews might spoil the true feelings you get while reading this book.  Penelope throws so much at Sevin and Evangeline that you can't help but feel bad for everything they have to go through, but you also can't help by root for their HEA!!!!.If you are a fan of Penelope Ward's or even if you have never read a book by her yet, you don't want to miss this book!!!  This is definitely one I will read again in the future and recommend to all my friends.  Penelope's books always leave me speechless and in awe of her talent.  I can't wait for her next book!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFLBS2GS8A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M1PULU#wasThisHelpful","R2AFLBS2GS8A6","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tattooed Emotions is exactly like the name infers.  This book is packed with so many different emotions, you can't help but get swept away!!This book starts off on a sad note but also a happy note, it's hard to explain that without spoiling the story for others.  Just know that Alicia doesn't hold back the emotions for later in the book, she grabs at your heartstrings right from the beginning.Tattooed Emotions is only the second book of Alicia's that I have read (even though I do have all her other books waiting on my kindle to be read).  I enjoyed her first book so much, but I have to say that this book is by far my FAVORITE.  There was something about this storyline and characters that just sucked me in and held me all the way to the end.  I will say that there are aspects of this story that kind of reminded me of another book (hint: Christian Grey) but yet this story is so completely different.  You will understand why I say this once you read the book.  There were just certain things that brought me back to the Fifty Shades series.  Now if you aren't a fan of that series don't worry this book and storyline is not like that one.  So don't let my comment scare you off from reading this wonderful book!!!!Tattooed Emotions is told completely from Raelyn's POV.  I do wish that we would've gotten a little bit of Damien's POV, because there were times I wanted to know what he was thinking, but it in no way deterred me from enjoying this book!!!  I will let you know that this book is NOT a stand-alone book.  Now I wouldn't consider this ending a cliffhanger, because the ending wasn't shocking, it just left you wanting more.  So to me it is a To Be Continued ending.  The way it ends, you just know there is more to come.  There are a lot of things that weren't covered in this book, so a second book is definitely needed.  But I will say that I don't think Damien and Raelyn are going to have an easy road ahead of them.  I also have a feeling the second book ( Tattooed Scars ) is going to heartbreaking, but I am hopefully that Alicia will mend are hearts by the end of the series.What I loved the most about this book is that it wasn't saturated with a lot of drama.  Alicia added just enough outside elements to keep you rooting for Damien and Raelyn, but it wasn't so much that I was frustrated by the end of the book.  This book does end with Damien and Raelyn in a good place and looking towards the future.  I also loved that this couple never had that crazy miscommunication and separation that we normally see in this type book.  I loved that Damien never let Raelyn run very far or for very long.  It was refreshing to see a couple actually work together to solve the issues they faced.I would 100% recommend this book to everyone!!!  I don't think it is necessary to wait for the next book to be released before reading this book.  Just know going in that there is more to come.  I know I can't wait until November for the next book.  I really want to see this couple get their HEA!!!  Raelyn and Damien both totally deserve one after everything they have had to endure.Don't miss this AMAZING read!!!  You won't be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7E5YUN8XGXQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155R57HS#wasThisHelpful","R7E5YUN8XGXQS","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As always you can't go wrong with a Kendall Ryan book!!!  Screwed is Kendall's first book in the Romantic Comedy category and I thought she did a great job.  I haven't read many books in this category, but I thought she did a great job giving us a fun, sexy, no nonsense type book.Screwed is a light hearted, sexy, fun and sassy read.  It is also a fairly quick read, one that can be read in a couple hours.  The pace and flow worked perfectly with this storyline.  What I loved about this book is it wasn't overpowered with a lot of drama.  She added just enough to keep the story and characters interesting, but whatever drama was created was over fairly quickly.  Now I know many will say that it was over too quickly and that Emery forgave Hayden way too fast, but to me it just worked with this story.In this book we meet Hayden Oliver and Emery Winters.  Hayden is a property developer and owns many properties with his best friend Hudson.  Hayden is your typical player, doesn't believe in a relationship and has no problem with one night stands.  He is also cocky and arrogant, but also sweet and charming.  Things change for Hayden when Emery moves into one of his buildings (which also happens to be the building he lives in) and his business partner Hudson tells him he isn't allowed to sleep with the tenants anymore.  Hayden of course sees this as a challenge in a way and befriends Emery.  Now Emery has had the great pleasure of meeting Roxy on her first day there and to say she didn't paint Hayden in a good light is an understatement.  So Emery is determined to blow Hayden off and focus on her career.  That is until Hayden says he just wants to be friends.  From here we get to see two people learning to open themselves up to the possibility of love and relationships.  I loved watching Hayden and Emery together.  Emery was a great character.  Very strong, determined and I found her to be funnier than Hayden at times.Now I don't truly know what makes an amazing romantic comedy book, but in my opinion, if the book can make you laugh, make you connect with the characters and storyline and leave you with a huge smile on your face then I think the book has done it's job.  I feel Kendall hit each of those marks with me on this book, so to me this book was a great read.  I always look forward to seeing what Kendall gives us next and I am never disappointed.  I look forward to reading Hudson and Gracie's book next!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14FNH5FKPDW20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146ZAZSQ#wasThisHelpful","R14FNH5FKPDW20","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I just finished this book and I just had to write my review to express my feelings!!!  This book was beyond AMAZING!!  I loved it even more than the first book.This book was filled with such wonderful and heartbreaking emotions, but also twist and turns that you don't see coming.  I was amazed at all the little secrets AL Jackson added to this story.  As per my usual I won't be discussing any of that because I don't want to spoil anything for the readers.  This story will have your emotions going in all different directions.  One moment I was giggling and smiling and the next I was either crying or wanting to throw my kindle, but that is exactly what I love about Ms. Jackson's books.  She knows how to create a story that will touch you on every level.I don't think I have the words to really do Shea and Sebastian's  story justice.  These characters were just amazing!!!  They were full of such depth and heart.  I loved their story or should I say journey, because this was not an easy road for them.  They definitely have their ups and downs, but what I loved most, especially in this second book, was how they worked through stuff together and formed a strong and everlasting bond against the evil doers.What I truly loved about this book, besides the characters, was the writing!!!  AL Jackson has true literary talent.  I have read all her books and every time I pick up her books I know it is going to be a phenomenal read!!  I will say that the Bleeding Stars Series is turning out to be my favorite of hers so far!!  There is just something about a story about musicians and the girls who tame them, but then add in an adorable little girl to the mix and these boys turn to mush.LOVE IT!!!!Drowning to Breathe picks up right where A Stone in the Sea ended and thank you for that, because the Cliffhanger in book 1 was horrible tourture!!!  I was a little nervous about the direction this story was going in the beginning, but that fear was short lived because Sebastian changed his tune pretty quickly ;)  I have to say I honestly believe that this was the perfect ending for Shea and Sebastian's story.  I couldn't be happier with what Ms. Jackson gave us.So I will just finish here and say READ THIS BOOK!!!!  You won't be sorry.P.S.  Drowning to Breathe is NOT a Stand-alone book.you do need to read A Stone in the Sea first or you will be completely lost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AS51OUSUNCNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158V0DBQ#wasThisHelpful","R2AS51OUSUNCNH","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As always, I knew when I decided to read Ryker that I was going to enjoy it!!! and I wasn't disappointed at all.Ryker is the fourth book in Sawyer Bennett's Cold Fury Series and I have to say, I think these books have just gotten better as they have come out.Sawyer has continued to give us fun, sexy and enjoyable story lines and characters in this series.  A Hockey themed sports story is definitely my favorite,  There is just something about reading about a hockey player finding his soulmate and true love.  What I loved best about Sawyer's hockey players is that they are the perfect mix of strong and macho, but have hearts of gold underneath and are willing to do anything for the love of their lives.  I truly loved that Sawyer also gave both Zack and Ryker kids to show their tender and passionate side.  Kids in books just suck me in.Ryker is  kind of a forbidden love story, because it is between Grayson Brannon and Ryker Evans.  Gray is the GM of the Cold Fury hockey team and Ryker is the star goalie, causing a little bit of a  conflict of interest.  I loved the hint of the forbidden that Sawyer gave us in this story.  I enjoyed watching these two characters work to have it all, love and a career.  I was extremely happy that this book wasn't overdone with outside drama.  Yes Sawyer added in some drama in the form of an ex and a pyscho player, but that was very short lived and I loved that Ryker and Gray are able to work through all of those issues together!!!  They truly are a strong functioning couple!!Every time I pick up a Sawyer Bennett book, I know I am going to enjoy the read, I am going to love the characters, and I am going to end up with a huge smile on my face.  I don't know if the Cold Fury series is done now with Ryker, but if she writes more for these guys and this team, I know for sure I will read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEAYKJOIQQ4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OXC0#wasThisHelpful","R2MEAYKJOIQQ4B","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
""" Today may be a very bad day, but tomorrow may be the best day of your life.  You just have to hang on until you get there.""Mia Sheridan has extremely amazing talent when it comes to giving her readers unique and engaging stories.  This isn't the first time we have seen the storyline with a marriage bargain included, but Mia truly made this her own story and something completely unique from what is already out there.  Yes some of the elements of the story are fairly predictable, but that didn't take away from my complete enjoyment of this book!!!"" Forget the Prince and Princess.  I always imagined the real story was between the witch and the dragon.""Grayson's Vow is part of Mia's Sign of Love Series based off the Zodiac Sign of the Libra.  I am a Libra, so to say I was most looking forward to reading this book is an understatement.  This book didn't disappoint what so ever!!!  Grayson's Vow is a complete Stand-alone novel, you don't have to read any of the other books before you dive into this one.  I will say that the pace of this story was kind of on the slow side, but I feel that it was the perfect way to tell Gray and Kira's story.  Even with saying that, this story never dragged on, where I felt I wanted to skim ahead just to finish.  I honestly wished it was a little longer, because in the end I fell in love with Grayson and Kira."" You have to feel the pain if you're going to feel the joy.""Mia does an excellent job when creating her stories, they feel well thought out and developed.  I loved the backdrop of this story being in Napa and at a winery.  I have always wanted to visit Napa and after reading this book, I only want to visit even more.  I also felt that the characters in this story were well developed and felt completely real.  She gave us a wide variety of characters to meet, some you will love, some you will grow to love and others you will just hate!!!!"" There's nothing on earth like the feel of someone who loves you grasping your hand in the dark when you're lost and afraid.""In this book we follow the story of Kira and Grayson.  Grayson is an ex-con who after spending five years in prison, goes back home to take care of his family vineyard, that was left to him by his dad.  When Grayson realizes that the vineyard is in dire straits and he is out of options, a little witch comes into the picture.  Kira is a girl who grew up in a family of privilege  but no love, so when she was shipped away to Africa for a year, when she comes home she is bound and determined to make it on her own.  She was left a large some of money by her loving grandma, but there is a contingency on it, she has to get married.  This is where she enters Grayson's life.  She hatches a plan that will help both of them."" True love is the greatest leap of faith there is.""I have to admit, I didn't like Grayson very much in the beginning.  Kira called him a dragon and he lived up to that definition.  I was so glad that we got to see a softer and sweeter side of him as the story went on.  I LOVED Kira.  She was such an amazing character, that you can't help falling in love with her.  She was so genuine in everything she said and did.  Even though she did like to scheme and plot a lot, it was never malicious or mean, it was always to help others out!!!.We met a handful of secondary characters that I loved just as much.  Kimberly, Walter, Charlotte, Harley and Priscilla and Sugie (the dog).  Each of these characters played a major part in this book and helping Kira and Grayson finally get their HEA!!"" In love there is truth.""This book is definitely filled with a lot of emotions.  There is laughter, romance, sexy times, and hurt.  This book is definitely worth the time to read, especially if you are a fan of Mia's.  This book is well worth the time and money that the reader will invest in it.  I know I will for sure be reading this book again in the future!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OJSGSSO09O92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155Q0LWA#wasThisHelpful","R3OJSGSSO09O92","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW!!!  What an amazing book!!  This was so much more than I expected.Raven is only the second book of Ashley Suzanne's that I have read, but the first one where she is the only author.  I believe after reading Raven I have found another go to author for me.  I will definitely be reading more books by this author in the future.Raven was such a unique story about a girls journey to happiness and forgiveness.  I was drawn to the book from the blurb.  I couldn't wait to read about a female MMA fighter.  Even though that was the main reason for reading this book and it really wasn't as big of part of the book as I thought it would be, I wasn't disappointed in this book what so ever!!!..  I thought the flow and pace of the story was perfect.  We got just enough history and information to make the characters feel real and the storyline to be believable.  I loved the characters in this story.  I found I was able to connect with Rian and Garrett pretty early on and I felt every emotion they felt while reading this book.In this story we meet Rian and Garrett.  When we first meet them they are teenagers and best friends.  Garrett really looked out for Rian when she was bullied by many at school.  Rian was a young girl from a broken home who had a hippy for a mom and no dad, but she was happy.  That was until her mom married Tom and Garrett if forced to move away with his military family.  What happens from here is a string of bad luck and heartbreak for Rian.  After all this turmoil, Rian is left broken hearted and also not willing to trust or form bonds with anyone.  What I loved about this book was that it also turned out to be like a second chance romance story.  Because Rian does eventually reunite with Garrett and to say it's explosive is putting it mildly.  Now I don't want to go into to much more detail because that would spoil things.  Just know this I truly believe that Rian and Garrett are characters everyone should meet.So I am just going to leave this here by saying this book definitely deserves 5 stars and nothing less.  Even though there are some tough subjects discussed and some heartache throughout the story, this really was a very sweet and wonderful love story between two people who are just destined to be together.  You can't help but root for Rian and Garrett all the way through.Even though this is listed as a first in Ashley's new series, Raven is a stand-alone novel.  You get a complete story with this book and are left with happiness in your heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14SDV3BGZAX03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3LY3XK#wasThisHelpful","R14SDV3BGZAX03","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first Alessandra Torre novel and I am happy to say it won't be my last!!!I was drawn to the book because of the blurb and I went in thinking it was going to be similar to another Hollywood type story that I have loved in the past.  I am HAPPY to say that this book was just as good as the other one I was thinking of, but was completely different from that book.  This storyline was completely unique and different from the other movie star romances out there.Yes this is a book about a famous movie star ( Cole ) and a no name country girl not looking for fame ( Summer ) but that is the only similarities there are to others books like this one.  I loved Alessandra's writing style.  This story and characters were engaging, intriguing and held me captive all the way through.  The banter and sexual tension between Cole and Summer was off the charts.  This couple made me laugh, scream and blush and that sometimes happened all within the same chapterLOL :)These characters felt real to me and totally relatable.  I felt like I could be friends with both of them.  I also loved the authenticity of the town of Quincy.  It felt like a pace I would love to visit.  I also reminded me of my own hometown growing up, ( without the Billionaires )  I enjoyed the pace that the author took with this couple and the fact that nothing felt rushed or unrealistic.  My only complaint per say is that I wish Cole and Summer would've united a little sooner in the book so that we got to see more of them as a happy couple.  I absolutely LOVED the ending to this book.  I couldn't have thought of a better one myself.One thing I did really enjoy and didn't expect was the surprise visit by Brad DeLuca.  He is Cole's divorce attorney in this book.  As some may or may not know Brad comes from Alessandra's Innocence Series.  This is one I haven't read yet but I look forward to reading all about Brad's story.  He fascinated me in this story, so his books I have a feeling are going to be good ones.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Alessandra's, but I will let you know that from what I know this book is completely different from her other books.  Just be aware of that going in.  You also must like a slow burn type romance.  Cole and Summer's love story is slow going, but I truly think it is the way it was meant to be told.  Anything different would've been unrealistic.  So if you are looking for a story about a Hollywood Hunk and a Country Girl that is truly a feel good story, then look no further.this is the book to read!!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SE1MEHII95J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UA70U8#wasThisHelpful","R18SE1MEHII95J","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With each book that Stephanie Smith releases her writing just keeps getting better and better.  I love each new book more than the ones before it.How My Heart Breaks is the third book in Stephanie Smith's stand-alone Try Again Series.  Each of these books can be read as a stand-alone, except I think you get a better feeling of the past characters by reading these books in order.  Especially this one, since the past two couples play kind of a larger part in this story.What I love more and more as these books are released is that we are getting more and more of the Male POV in these stories.  This book we actually get an equal amount of Jake and Lana's POV's.  I just think the story is better told by both characters, so you are never guessing what the other is thinking.  This book is a sweet and sexy story between two people who have closed themselves off to love because of past tragedies.  This book isn't wrapped up in a lot of drama or angst.  We just got a to watch Jake and Lana learn to love again.  With that said, yes there is some drama and lies are told in this story to keep you interested, but it doesn't over power the book.  I was actually surprised that once the lie comes out in the open how quickly it was glossed over and the drama came more from Lana's fears.In this story we meet Lana (Tate (from book 2) Sister) and Jake.  Lana is someone who has closed off her heart to loving people, because she thinks she is jinxed.  She seems to lose everyone who she has ever loved and is tired of hurting like that.  She feels she is better off alone, that is until she meets Jake.  Jake is a single father of 5 year old Hallie. I absolutely love when authors throw children into the mix in books.  They are always so endearing.  Jake is an Army guy and you couldn't help falling in love with him.  He was sweet, sexy and loyal to a fault.  His loyalty is what gets him in hot water, but also leads him to Lana.  I loved watching these break each others walls down.  Learning to love and trust again.  Jake wouldn't give up, no matter how hard Lana pushed him away!!!  Jake is one of those Heroes that will live on in my head because he was just that great.Another aspect of the book I loved was that we got to see a lot of Brooke and Saxon and Tate and Harper.  It was wonderful to see how these couples are doing now after their stories have ended.  We also got meet some new characters. Georgia is one of them and I can't wait to see where Stephanie takes her in the next book!!I would recommend this book and series.  Each book is about learning to open yourself up to love again.  That finding the right person is always worth the risk!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X7GGM16YJHNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SCK30W#wasThisHelpful","R1X7GGM16YJHNF","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just knew when I found out that two of my all time favorite authors were collaborating on a book that it was going to be AMAZING.and I wasn't wrong.Cocky Bastard was OUTSTANDING!!!  I truly hope that Penelope Ward and Vi Keeland continue to write books together in the future.  Their writing styles meshed so well I honestly couldn't tell you who wrote what parts.  I saw elements of both authors in this story.This book had everything that I look for in a 5 star read.  The storyline was interesting and unique.  The pace and flow of the story were spot on.  The characters were relatable and likable.  This story was such a fun, sweet and sexy story, but I also experienced some sad moments and moments I wanted to yell and throw my kindle.  When authors can evoke that many different emotions from their readers, I truly believe they have extreme talent in the literary world.I don't want to spoil the storyline at all, so I am only going to touch on it briefly.  In Cocky Bastard we meet Chance and Aubrey.  Chance is the HOT Aussie model/soccer player who is on his way back to california when he has a chance meeting with Aubrey at a rest stop in the middle of Nebraska.  To say their first meeting was cordial is the farthest from the truth.  They had a lot of animosity  and sexual tension ;)  What happens from here is a road trip to end all road trips.  They had some major laughs along the way, but they also had some bumps.  After spending a week together they are separated for two years.  What happens once they are reunited was explosive.I have to say that Chance was my favorite character of this book.  I loved his cocky ways and his sense of humor.  But what I loved the most was his determination.  I can't explain that because it would spoil the plot.  Just know that after you read this book Chance will make your BBF list, I know he is at the top of mine :)  I did like Aubrey too, but there were times I really wanted to smack her for her behavior.  I was glad to see how this book ended and how everything all played out!!!Cocky Bastard is a standalone novel with a happy ending.  If you are looking for  a book with a lot of laughter, a cocky hero who will make you swoon and even some sad times, then this is the book for you.  If you are a fan of either or both Penelope Ward and Vi Keeland, you don't want to miss this book.  I know this is a book I will read again in the future!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B1MTGLCIVYE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014005B72#wasThisHelpful","R2B1MTGLCIVYE6","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am completely addicted to this series!!!  I don't know what that says about me because of the subject matter of this story/series,, but Mia Storm has completely sucked me in and I hope we get more books to this series.Getting Hot is the third book in the Jail Bait Series.  Even though these books are all stand-alones, it was great to see how the author ties all the characters together.  She even overlaps the story just a tad bit.  What I did find different with this book was how she handled the age difference.  I thought it was glossed over in this book compared to how things turned out in the other two books.  This one didn't feel as realistic to me as much as the other books did.  Now with that said.I still LOVED this book and it in no way took away from my enjoyment of this story.Getting Hot is a taboo/forbidden love story between Bran (26) and Lilah (16).  If you are not a fan of this type of age difference then this book might not be the one for you.  I on the other hand didn't mind the age gap, because one thing Mia does amazingly well with , is creating characters that seem older than they really are.  As you read this story you truly do forget how old Lilah is.  Lilah has been through more stuff in her 16 years of life than most people see in a lifetime.  Even though they are so different in age, Bran and Lilah still seemed to fit together.  they truly do complete each other.  I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, but I think this one is my favorite so far in this series and that is saying something because I LOVED Getting Dirty (Book 1) and Getting Played (Book 2).Each of these books are age related taboo love stories, but I truly believe they are all tastefully written and like I said before she does an amazing job with the characters you truly forget their ages.  These books are all fairly quick reads and talk about STEAMY :)  but not to the point of tacky or raunchy.  I truly can't say enough about these books and this series.I am forever a fan of Mia Storm and her books!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUEDM2GNJ2UQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YZLP38#wasThisHelpful","RUEDM2GNJ2UQI","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back to the Drawing Board was an enjoyable read.  It had what a good romance novel should have.  There was laughter, angst, sexy times, and of course love.  This book didn't have a whole lot of drama and what there was of it was short lived.  I really liked that, because it focused on Julia and Carter.This book is kind of considered a third in a series, but I would also say it is a standalone.  I didn't read the two prior books and I didn't feel lost at all.  This is more of a spin off if anything.  This book was about Blake and Liane's Son Carter.  Even though I didn't read the other books about Blake and Liane, I still got the full jist of their story and how it plays into Carter's story.I will say that this book started out different than I expected.  The prologue sucked me in and is not what I was expecting. (Totally is a good way)  We get most of Carter's backstory in the prologue and it sets up the rest of the book as to where Carter's head is emotionally.  This story is told in Dual POV, which I love.  I felt this was a complete story also.  I didn't end this book with the thought of I wonder how the characters end up down the road.  LL Collins does a fantastic job giving us Carter and Julia's full story.If you are a fan of angst then I would definitely recommend this book to you to read.  The push and pull that Julia and Carter go through in the beginning was a lot.  I understood why Carter was pushing Julia away.it was almost a taboo type story, being that Julia was his boss,  and he didn't want to jeopardize his career.  One thing I truly loved was that Julia was the aggressor in this book.  Usually we see the Hero being the one to pursue the heroine, but not in this one Julia went after what she wanted (Carter) and wouldn't take no for an answer.  I really liked that!!  Now at times I felt Julia was a strong lead, but then there were times I wanted to smack her and tell her to grow up.  I would've liked to see that strong female lead all the way through the book.What I truly enjoy about LL Collins's books, is that she creates real stories and real characters.  Her stories are stories that could  happen in real life and we get the feelings and reactions of characters as they would handle things in reality.  She is able to tell the story so that the reader is able to connect with the characters and feel what they are feeling.I will warn you though that this story is kind of the insta-love/lust type story.  Right from the get go, Julia and Carter are attracted to each other, but their feelings grew for each other fairly quickly.  So if you aren't a big fan of that type storyline, then this might not be the book for you.  For me I really liked it and felt it worked well for these characters.  This story really shows you how even the best laid plans can be changed when you meet the right person!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XOK6ISFK31LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NXMLWA#wasThisHelpful","R2XOK6ISFK31LQ","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I absolutely love about Lauren Blakely's books is that she knows how to create a story that is the perfect combination of heart, humor and melt your kindle steam ;)I have read MANY books by Lauren and I have never been disappointed.  Her books have always captivated me, made me swoon, made me blush and yes I have even gotten angry at her characters, but that is what truly makes a 5 star book in my opinion.Consumed by You was no different.  This story was sweet, heartfelt, fun, and sexy all rolled into one.  She has created characters that you can't help but suck them into your heart and feel like you are a part of their lives.  I thought the pace and flow of the story was spot on.  This book isn't extremely long, but it never felt rushed or that it was missing something.  Consumed by You is the third book in Lauren's Firefighter series, but can be read as a stand-alone.  I personally haven't read either of the first two books and it didn't take away anything from this story.  You do have reoccurring characters from the previous books, so it kind of ruins the endings of those books, but after reading this one, I want to go back and read the first two to see how each of those couples stories played out.In this book we follow the story of Cara and Travis.  This book is pretty much a second chance romance because Cara and Travis have a past history together.  Cara and Travis dated back in high school but separated when they left for college.  Travis has a HUGE phobia of relationships because of what happened to his mom after his dad is tragically killed when he was 10.  He felt that if he avoided connections to other people (women) then his heart is safe.  Cara on the other hand wants what every girl wants.  The marriage, kids and a loving home to come home to.  Just like her sisters.  But Cara and Travis can't forget what the two of them have in the chemistry department.  So they come up with a plan.a 2 week fling!!!  That will solve all their problemsRight???  Well you are going to have to read the book to see how everything works out for this couple.If you have read the first two books in this series then you are going to enjoy seeing the previous couples in this book.  You get to see where they have gone since their books.  Being that I hadn't read them it was still nice having them in the story because it showed the close bond these friends all have.  It really made you want to be a part of this circle of friends.I would 100% recommend this book.  I have LOVED every Lauren Blakely book and I don't think you'll be sorry if you pick up this or any other of her books.  They are downright sinful.in the best way ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7671NJ7615W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7S52H2#wasThisHelpful","R7671NJ7615W","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sky High was my first book by C.J. Lake.  I really enjoyed this story.  It was a fun, flirty and sexy read.  It is also a book that can be read in less than a day.I thought the storyline and flow of the story was really good.  I also enjoyed the characters and how well she developed them.  My only real complaint about this book was the ending.  I felt it was kind of abrupt.  I would've loved to have an epilogue or even just another chapter or two completing their story better.  Now don't get me wrong this is NOT a cliffhanger ending or one that leads you to believe there is more to their story, it just felt to quick.  It's hard to explain except to say I wanted a little more.Sky High is the third book in C.J. Lake's Attraction series, but can be read as a stand-alone.  You will see the characters and couples from the previous books, but it doesn't take away from this story at all and you won't fell lost if you haven't read the other books.One thing I really liked about this story was the author had the characters become friends first and really took their relationship at a believable pace.  It was nice to see a couple start out as friends and not just jumping into bed the first time they meet.  Although with that said I did have one frustration during their friendship..I didn't like that Sky continued to ""date"" other guys while befriending Jamie.  You could feel their attraction right away, so to me she shouldn't have continued on with the blind dates.  Even if it was to help out her BFF's sister.  I will say that except for a short term separation, this couple really didn't have any drama, yes the author tried to spice up the drama a little by having Jamie become jealous of Remy, but even that was short lived.  I will say the chemistry that this couple had was off the charts.  I thought the author did a really great job at conveying their feelings and creating  tasteful and steamy sex scenes.  Those scenes were truly some of my favorite parts of the book and not because of the sex, but because of the connection I could feel between Sky and Jamie.I would recommend this book to any fan of the New Adult Genre.  I thought this book was truly refreshing in the sense that it wasn't totally cliche and the Hero was actually a really sweet, funny and lovable guy.  Yes I love my cocky jerks and alpha males, but it is nice to see a ""nice"" guy win in the end sometimes too.  I know that I will for sure be reading the other books in this series, to see how the other couples come about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41XU0X02SWYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1MYSP2#wasThisHelpful","R41XU0X02SWYF","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can I say.I LOVE Michelle Leighton's writing/books.  She always gives us a story that is both entertaining and intriguing.  I love that she can create a suspenseful story but add in the right amount of romance to it too.  Oh and the sexy times in this book were STEAMY ;)Strong Enough grabbed me right from the prologue.  My heart broke after reading it.  I felt that this book was truly a story about redemption and learning to love oneself and others and also learning to be loved by someone.  Can a person who truly believes they are a monster be redeemed and loved?  Are they able to grow and learn to love another?  Well those answers is what you find out while reading this book.I felt this book was written perfectly.  I felt the pace and character development was spot on.  I also thought the storyline was captivating and unique.  It had the right amount of suspense to keep me turning the pages.  The secrets and betrayals that are revealed in this story are ones I wouldn't have expected.  I loved that Michelle was able to keep me guessing throughout the whole book.Strong Enough is told in Dual POV.  We meet Muse and Jasper in this story.  Muse is a girl who has been raised by her military father and has left her hometown because she felt it was in her dad's best interest in keeping him safe.  When her father fails to be there at the determined time for their weekly call, Muse panics and hires a bounty hunter to find him.  In comes Jasper.  Jasper is a man who grew up in a horrible situation, you'll understand after reading the prologue.  He has shut down all feelings and emotions and has become what he thinks is a monster.  Now Muse hiring Jasper isn't as cut and dry as you might think.  Secrets and Lies are revealed, but I am not going to tell you what they are, you NEED to read this book.  Ah..Jasper King.what can I say about him except, he is one hero you won't want to miss meeting.  I don't know what it was about him, but something sucked me in and didn't let go.  I loved his character and I truly felt connected to him.Another thing I loved about this book, was that even though this is the first book in Michelle's newest series, it can totally be read as a standalone.  This book does have a Happy ending and a complete story.  The next book in this series will be about another character that you meet in this book.  (One of Jasper's friends)  After reading this book, I am totally looking forward to Rogan's book.If you are a Michelle Leighton fan, like I am, then you don't want to miss this book.  It was a story that had suspense, lies, betrayal, redemption and love!!!  This was definitely a GREAT start to her new series :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ZCZELHMLV4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4FUI#wasThisHelpful","R21ZCZELHMLV4H","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Welcome to INDULGE, where your fantasies meet reality.""INDULGE is a totally Indulgent read!!!  This book was so good it totally deserved more than 5 stars!!!!This has to be the BEST Georgia Cates book I've read to date, and that is saying something since I Loved all her other books.  She knows how to create a story that has it all.  This book has got to be the steamiest of Georgia's books.  You will definitely want a fan and cold drink with you when you read this book.  This book totally sucked me in.  I loved the storyline and the characters she has created in this book.  The pace was fantastic and the writing flawless.  I read this book in less than a day, because it was so good I couldn't put it down.  Georgia had me laughing, swooning, crying and even rolling my eyes at times.  I love when an author can do that to meit shows true talent!!!In INDULGE we meet Anna James (AJ) and Beau.  AJ just came out of a crappy marriage and her best friends give her an all paid trip to Jamaica with them to the resort Indulge.  She hesitantly goes along, because her friends are swingers and live a different lifestyle than she does.  Indulge is an all inclusive resort that tends to lean towards Hedonism and Polyamorous couples.  Even knowing this AJ can't pass up a trip like this.  On her first night she is alone and hungry so she goes to a restaurant on the grounds, finding out the wait is too long but she is able to be seated with another single diner, so she takes a chance and does that.  This is where she meets Beau.  What happens from here is a fun filled adventure into learning to broaden your horizons and try new things ( not all sexual ).  I loved Beau right from the start!!!  He completely stole my heart.  He was a man with a very naughty mouth, but a heart of gold and he loved his family immensely!!!  I loved watching both him and AJ grow into stronger people as their time together continued on.  I don't want to say anything more because this is a book that everyone should experience on their own ;)INDULGE is a standalone novel with a Happy Ending.  It is told kind of in Dual POV.  The first 12 chapters are told from AJ's POV and then there is a time jump and we get 6 chapters in Beau's POV, then for the last two chapters it is back in AJ's POV.  The epilogue is in Beau's and I absolutely LOVED the epilogue.  She finished their story amazingly well, so that the reader is not left wondering what happened to this couple.  She did put a little something in the epilogue about Beau's brother Judd and I am hoping that is leading to a book about Judd.  I would love a story about him :)If you are a Georgia Cates fan then you DON'T want to miss this book!!!  This is the best book by her to date.  If you have never read a book by Georgia then what are you waiting for.Start with this one, you won't be sorry!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GOWGOI6ZGPRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013AOZ2H8#wasThisHelpful","R1GOWGOI6ZGPRD","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really don't know how to write this review to make sure it does this fabulous book justice.  I was absolutely blown away from this book.  The storyline was filled with heart and emotion and I honestly thought it gave an accurate portrayal of what a person struggles with in life when it comes to abuse, bullying and alcoholism.This is the first book I have read by Tiffany Aleman, and I will say it won't be my last.  The amount of emotions that Tiffany makes a reader feel while reading this story was fantastic!!!  My heart broke for these characters, but it also smiled and laughed with them.  It also learned to love these characters as their flaws were revealed.  I know that this is only the beginning of Brayden and Karmen's journey and I am truly hoping that they do get their HEA.  I feel it is going to be a tough and long road for them to get there.Now I do feel it is necessary to warn readers that this book does end on a cliffhanger and touches on some subjects that could be triggers for some people.  As for the cliffhanger, it isn't a nail biter or a pull your hair out, it is the perfect ending to the start of Brayden and Karmen's journey.  As a couple they aren't in a great place at the end of the story, but they are in a healing place.  I feel that this book ended right where it should have.  As for the tough subject she covers, it is the topic of Bullying, abuse and alcoholism.  I want to say the Bullying is the prime focus of the story, because it was the focus of Brayden and Karmen's past history,  but the abuse and alcoholism do play a big part in Brayden's backstory and why he is the way he is.  I thought Tiffany did a wonderful job in showing the daily struggles both Karmen and Brayden had to go through.I thought Karmen and Brayden were both great characters.  Full of emotion and heart.  I truly just wanted to jump into the book and give both of them hugs.  I do hope that in the second book we get to see Brayden open up more to Karmen.  It will be nice to see him let her in.  I am interested to see how Karmen weathers in the next book.  To see how she overcomes this set back from book 1.As for the secondary characters, I thought they were all wonderful and just as important to this story as the main characters.  Drew, Chelsea and Tammy were all amazing supports for both Karmen and Brayden.  I was extremely happy to see Drew transform into a better person compared to his High School days and to ask for forgiveness from Karmen for all the wrong he did back then.  It made it more believable that him and Karmen could end up being friends now later in life.I would 100% recommend the heartfelt and emotional journey to everyone.  If you aren't a fan of cliffhangers I don't think this is one you have to wait for book two before starting this one, just be aware that at the end there is more to come!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWSNYUDAB5WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0137S80PS#wasThisHelpful","R1MWSNYUDAB5WB","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caught in Us was just what I was looking for.  This book was AMAZING.  It had everything I look for in a 5 star read.  It had a wonderful love story, sexy times, a little suspense, some family drama, and the best ending I could've hoped for.I have read and LOVED every book Layla Hagen has written and Caught in Us was no different.  her writing style sucks me in every time.  I love her story lines, and the characters she creates.  She has the great ability to create characters who you just grow to love and can't help but feel a part of their lives.  Being that this is the third book in her Lost Series, I am sad to see this series end.  These characters will live on in me for a long time to come.  This story is told in some Dual POV.  We get mostly Dani's POV but she does throw Damon's POV in quite a few chapters.  This is a fun, sweet and sexy read that was a fairly quick read.  Like I stated earlier there is a little drama, but nothing over the top and she added an element of suspense to keep you turning the pages.I loved how she created Dani and Damon's story and how it all unfolded.  This story is told over the course of a couple years.  It starts out when Dani and Damon are in high school and Damon is a transfer student at Dani's school.  Damon was a bad boy to the core and to say they have a rocky start is an understatement.although I did love their banter.it had me laughing a few times.  Their friendship/relationship slowly grows over the first half of the book and then the family drama kicks in and forces Dani and Damon to separate.  A year passes and they are reunited.  This being their freshman year in college.  They both attend Stanford.  From here we get their sweet love story and the suspense of the storyline.  I absolutely loved both Dani and Damon.  They were as opposite as two people could be, but truly brought out the best in each other.  They knew how to showcase each others strengths.Another thing I loved about this book, was how Layla incorporated the other characters from the other two books into this story.  We kind of got the back story because this book starts before James has met Serena and Parker had met Jessica.  But then how she tells the story we also got to see where these two couples end up and what they have been up to since their books.  It was just a really interesting way of telling this story and I loved it!!!!Caught in Us is a third book to a series, but can be read as a stand alone.  Being the way the author wrote this book, you really don't even need to read the first two books before reading this one.  I would suggest it, but it is not necessary.  This book does have a HEA and it wrapped up this series very nicely!!!I would 100% recommend this book/series and author to anyone who hasn't read any of Layla Hagen's books.  Her stories will suck you in and leave you smiling in the end.  Pick up one of her books today.you won't be sorry!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3T6O34OUAE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01370RXFE#wasThisHelpful","R2F3T6O34OUAE2","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when, what starts out as a simple agreement, turns into something more and feelings are brought into the picture ???  You get an interesting journey to a HEA!!!This book was exactly what I was looking for at this point.  I was looking for an Erotic love story that wasn't just about sex, but had an interesting storyline as well.  Well 30 Days was both of those.  This is the first book by Christine d'Abo that I have read and I am really glad I took a chance on a new author.  This book was a fun and very sexy read (but by no means overdone or raunchy) but also had some great feelings built in.30 Days is a Second Chance at Love type story.  We meet Alyssa and Harrison in this book.  Alyssa is a 30 something woman who tragically lost her husband from cancer.  After mourning her husband for 2 years she is finally ready to move on and find someone new.  I thought the author did a great job at portraying the feelings a widow goes through when trying to move on with their lives.  We saw her go through fear, guilt, anger and loneliness.  I liked watching Alyssa open herself up to new experiences and the possibility of new love.  Before her husband died he gave her an envelope with a letter and some cards in it.  The note is he way of telling her to move on and be happy.  The cards are 30 days worth of sexual experiences.  When Alyssa sees the cards she in mortified and can't even think of doing the stuff on them, until she meets Harrison!!!!  He opens her eyes to what possibilities there could be ;)  Harrison is a temporary neighbor who is living in Alyssa's complex for 3 months.  He is just coming off a bad relationship and is in no way looking for a new one.  That is until he meets Alyssa and hears her proposal.  To say these two have amazing chemistry is an understatement.I thought my kindle was going to melt at many different times.  But under all the sexual experimentation.there really was a sweet love story built in.  There wasn't a whole lot of drama in this story, what was created was created solely by Alyssa and Harrison.  They were each others road blocks.We don't meet many secondary characters, the one that really sticks out is Nikki, Alyssa's sister.  I liked the support system Nikki lends to Alyssa, even if jealousy can come into play.  I would love to read a book about Nikki so that we could see her get her HEA finally.So if you are looking for a fun, and extremely sexy read, but has feelings also, then 30 Days is the book to pick up.  This book is told solely in Alyssa's POV and has a Happy Ending.  I would've liked to see some of Harrison's POV but it didn't take away my enjoyment of the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZKQRXCLE944/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53E0H6#wasThisHelpful","R1QZKQRXCLE944","A2J36T6J3GWT6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J36T6J3GWT6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very excited to get my hands on a canister vacuum, as I haven't used one since I was a kid. Specifically, I was looking forward to using a vacuum with a much smaller footprint (at least the business end of it) than uprights tend to have. But I guess there's a reason we haven't used a canister in the last thirty years: much of our house is carpeted, and a canister isn't really cut out for using on carpets. But more on this in a bit.There's a lot to like about this Bissell. It's attractive and easy to assemble. The wand extends very smoothly to accommodate use by taller people. The canister snaps on and off easily for quick cleanup. There's a cord rewind button. The tools (but not the alternate head) fit on board so they're in easy reach while you're using it.The vacuum comes with two heads. The first is the so-called Turbine Foot Attachment, which is for use on hard floors. The other is the Multi-Surface Professional, which can be used on both hard floors and carpets. The vacuum touts itself as a ""hard floor expert,"" and it works great on hardwood or kitchen floors. It's nice that a head for carpets is also included with the machine, and this would probably be adequate for people who have hard floors and a small rug or two to clean. But if you have a lot of carpeting in your house, I wouldn't recommending going with the Bissell--or, I'm thinking, with any canister vacuum. With a canister, after all, the user is pushing the vacuum head along the surface of the floor, and that's hard to do on a carpet when what you're pushing isn't on wheels. Vacuuming the rug in just our small TV room was a tiring task and not one I'd like to repeat very often.There are a few other minor negatives as well, which I've summarized below along with the machine's pros:PROS-- Attractive-- Easy to assemble.-- Wand extends smoothly-- Canister snaps on and off easily-- Cord rewind button.-- Tools (but not the alternate head) fit on board so they're in easy reach while you're using it.CONS-- Not great for cleaning carpets-- Takes up a lot of space when stored, unlike a canister vacuum-- The position of the cord rewind and power buttons are the reverse of what I'd like. Since I'm right handed, the machine is usually to the right of me, and I expect the power button to be on the left of the machine for easy reach. I keep pressing the cord rewind button by mistake.-- When it's stored, the wand slips into a small plastic bracket on the machine that seems fragile to me. I won't be surprised if it eventually breaks.In sum, although the Bissell comes with a head for cleaning carpets, don't count on using it if you have more than a small amount of carpeting to clean. It's too hard to push, and the multi-surface head doesn't have a beater brush to help get stuff up out of the rug. But if you're just looking to clean hard floors, you won't go wrong with this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MRBU199IGIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OORUCW#wasThisHelpful","R25MRBU199IGIK","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not had any issues with my Nest Cam after using it for several weeks. The camera was a breeze to set up, and the app has consistently worked well. The image quality I've been getting is quite crisp, perfectly acceptable for my needs. The camera is also very nice looking, and I like that its base has some heft to it so it feels like it's not going to tip over when standing upright. What I most appreciate, however, is that I receive notifications on my iPod Touch within seconds of the camera detecting motion in the room it's in. I like the iOS notifications much better than email notifications, which I've received from other cameras in the past.The camera came with a trial subscription, which means that before the trial expired I was able to enjoy the convenience of seeing my video history. It's great, but for me it's not worth the subscription fee. There are currently two subscription options. You can see the last 30 days of your video history for $30 a month or $300 a year, and the last 10 days for $10 a month or $100 a year. I'd really like a third option: a two- or three-hour video history for $2 a month or $20 a year. *That* I would pay for, and I bet a lot of other people would too. $2 a month from a lot of people is better than not having them subscribed at all, Nest people. Please consider it.I see that there are a lot of negative reviews here on Amazon from people who've had bad experiences with their cameras, but my own experience has been thoroughly positive. Good luck with your buying decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283DJ20BMIIYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBJGUA2#wasThisHelpful","R283DJ20BMIIYD","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now that I've played with the Scotch Advanced Thermal Laminator for a while, I kind of want everyone who needs things laminated to come to my house and let me do it for them. It's fast. It's fun. It's easy. It does a good job. The sleeve you put your stuff in adheres not only at the edges but all over the item, so that you can cut off all edging and have, say, a perfectly laminated bookmark with no overhang. So, five stars, Scotch, on this great product.That said, make sure you use it as directed. A morality tale:My daughter came home from college (yes, throwing her under the bus here), eyed our new lamination station, and got busy. First it was regular stuff. A test paper, a bookmark. Then it got more intense. She broke out her box of dried flowers and quickly put together a collage, cranked the thickness of the laminator up to 5mm, and ran it through. The result: not bad. And then I left the room.In my absence she decided to experiment by putting a couple small dabs of paint in a sleeve and running it through. The result was a laminated sleeve with long streaks of paint running the length of it. And--you may have guessed it by now--paint got inside the machine.She figured, reasonably enough, that she could get rid of the paint by feeding sleeveless paper through the machine. Perhaps after doing that a number of times, the paint would be pretty much gone and regular lamination could continue, but things went from bad to worse: the paper checked in, but it didn't check out. It was stuck inside, crammed into a very small space on the exit side of the rollers. We tried using various tools to get it out, but it soon became clear that we'd have to expose the innards of the machine if there was any hope of clearing the paper jam.With some misgivings, we took off the cover and spent a fair amount of time trying to get the paper out. Knives were introduced, tweezers, paper clips. Nothing worked. And after quite a long time we decided that taking off the cover wasn't enough. At this point, I had pretty much given up on the idea that we'd ever get the laminator working again. Taking things apart is easy, but there's a lot that can go wrong when it comes to putting them back together. Nonetheless, I further disassembled the laminator. There was a lot of dried paint in it, more than we'd expected. We chipped it off where we could. But even at this point, it wasn't an easy thing to get to that jammed paper. I wound up having to pry a piece of metal back and then finally, finally, I was able to pull out the paper, which the machine had folded into a very tight fan, each of its accordion fins only a few millimeters wide.I reassembled the laminator. To my astonishment, and with the sweet stench of burning acrylic heralding its success, it spat out a laminated test sheet--perfect but for needing to be wiped free of melted paint. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a working laminator.The moral of this story is, be careful what you stick in the machine. Probably you won't try running paint through it, so you're in the clear there. But this woeful tale does point to what is arguably a flaw. Should someone accidentally insert a sleeveless piece of paper into the laminator--and I can see this happening--there is very little chance that that paper is going to come out again. There is no easy way of clearing a paper jam. Perhaps there should be. (And that's why I've deducted a star from my review.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OBJPHQTAPMDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3CGD3E#wasThisHelpful","R3OBJPHQTAPMDO","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Alexander McCall Smith's latest No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency novel, Mma Ramotswe is talked into taking a vacation, and leaving the agency in the hands of her sometimes difficult colleague, Mma Makutsi. But it's difficult to let go, and Mma Ramotswe finds herself almost as busy on vacation as she is at work. There's a case to solve, a young man to save, and a curiously-named new business in town that needs to be investigated. Mma Ramotswe approaches everything with her trademark grace and wisdom. Readers of McCall Smith's Botswana novels will enjoy this installment in the series as much as his previous books.The leisurely pace of McCall Smith's stories can make one feel as if nothing much is happening in the books. However busy Mma Ramotswe may be, she still has time to contemplate the broad Botswana sky, to enjoy conversations over cake and tea, and and to mull over the remembered wisdom of her beloved late father, Obed Ramotswe. As slow as the books may seem, however, we have watched the series' main characters grow and change quite a lot over the course of 16 books, perhaps none so much as Mma Makutsi, whose circumstances have changed dramatically since she first came to work in the agency. In this latest novel, we see something new emerge in Mma Makutsi, and so does her boss. It's a pleasure to witness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JHX9M6GNBYQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030791156X#wasThisHelpful","R1JHX9M6GNBYQI","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Olaf is very cute and nicely constructed. I like that his sno-cone-making innards are concealed inside his tummy, and also that you can use that space for storing your paper sno cone cups (or enormous wads of cash, for that matter). It's also a nice touch that the sno cone holder--the arm that holds the cup in place as you're working the machine--is removable. That allows you to use a bowl to catch your shaved ice, which is probably what we'll be doing once the batch of cups that came with the machine is finished.The machine is very easy to use, and very fast. The shaved ice that comes out is very fine. Arguably you could use the machine for putting shaved ice in a drink, although it's probably too much bother to do that on a regular basis. On the other hand, a few days ago when my daughter wasn't feeling well--a bit overheated--I was able to quickly prepare a bowl of plain shaved ice for her, and it was exactly what she needed.The machine comes with two plastic molds for freezing ice. We left one empty in the freezer, somehow, and it cracked and is now unusable, so I'd advise against doing that yourself. You can use regular ice cubes with Olaf, however, so even if you do wind up destroying both molds, you're not out of luck.So, I pretty much like everything about Olaf...except his size. He's about 15 inches tall. For a kitchen appliance that you're probably not going to be using all the time, he is HUGE. He takes up a substantial amount of counter space, and he simply will not fit inside our cabinets, though your mileage may vary. When the initial thrill of using Olaf has worn off, he'll probably wind up in a box somewhere, unfortunately, and less easy to access, because keeping him out on the counter is probably not going to work for us in the long run. Size may seem a minor thing, but it causes logistical problems, and if it's not convenient to keep him out on the counter, or even inside a cabinet, that detracts from his usefulness. Anyway, just be aware that Olaf, for all his good points, has this considerable down side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21Q35INEQKU4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7G5SWM#wasThisHelpful","R21Q35INEQKU4E","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philips' Bluetooth Clock Radio is a solid offering. It offers everything you might expect in a clock radio: AM/FM radio; dual alarms that can wake you with either a buzzer or the radio, both of which get louder the longer they're left unanswered; snooze; up to twenty preset radio stations; auto-scan tuning; brightness adjustment; and timed sleep-to-music function. The device goes a little above and beyond by providing a USB port in the back and allowing Bluetooth pairing, so that you can listen to music from your iPhone, etc, through the clock radio's speakers. These don't matter very much to me, but for some people they can be handy.What matters most to me in choosing a clock radio--and I've had many over the years--is  how intuitive it is, and to a lesser but still substantial extent, its footprint. On the latter score the Philips shines: it's a tidy cube less than 5"" (if you don't count the protruding tuning button) on each side. And it does fairly well on the intuitive scale too: it's not the best I've seen--that prize still goes to my old Sony Dream Machine, which lamentably is now discontinued. But it's also not the worst. (There's a prize for that, too, and it goes to the Sylvania SCR1997 USB Bluetooth Alarm Clock Radio. I spent quite a while trying, and I NEVER figured out how to set the time on that thing.) For the most part I was able to figure out how to work all the functions on the Philips without appealing to the directions. (I had to look, however, to see what buttons had to be pushed in what sequence to program the preset radio stations.) The buttons are all arranged in a square on the top of the device, recessed so they're flat. What I particularly like is that the two alarm buttons, which are at the rear right and left of the square, have raised dots on them so that when you're feeling around in the dark you can identify them. And an even nicer touch: there's one dot for the first alarm, and two dots for the second.So all in all, this is a decent machine. I don't think you'll be wowed by it, but you're unlikely to swear at it either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNSFWKZB7P7GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012J1B8CG#wasThisHelpful","RNSFWKZB7P7GA","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:02 Mins More than 20 years ago I did some soul searching and realized I needed to find myself a better toilet paper. After some field tests I settled on a brand called White Cloud, which was produced by Proctor & Gamble. A very short time later, perhaps just a few months, P&G killed off its White Cloud brand, and the toilet paper I'd come to believe was the best available became Charmin Ultra. I watched over the course of maybe a year as the packaging on the White Cloud tissue morphed, its White Cloud branding becoming less noticeable as the Charmin Ultra name became more prominent. Finally the references to White Cloud just disappeared, the old name swallowed up like a ham sandwich within reach of a Charmin bear. This was back in 1993 or 1994.P&G, so I read, allowed its White Cloud trademark to lapse, and starting in 1999, Wal-mart began marketing a White Cloud toilet paper, manufactured by Scott Paper (not to be confused with the short-lived Michael Scott Paper Company). I've never tried this new White Cloud, which has only its name in common with the old White Cloud. Reviews suggest it's worth a go, however.But my point is that I've been a devotee of Charmin Ultra since I made that switch back in 1993. I don't recall purchasing another brand since. I buy the big packs of double rolls as cheap as I can find them at the grocery store. Double rolls, I say. I have NEVER had the nerve to buy the mega rolls because I was worried they wouldn't fit into my fixtures, and I'd have to buy one of those toilet paper extenders one hears about (Charmin Extender Adaptador (For Mega Rolls)). Frankly it all just seemed too complicated.Until now. I've made the plunge, people, and come out the other side, and I've learned a lot.There are three sizes of Charmin toilet paper rolls: double (with 164 sheets per roll), mega (308 sheets), and mega plus (369). There is apparently no such thing as a single roll, although the existence of a double roll would suggest that there should be. I can't speak about the mega plus--I'm not sure I've ever SEEN a mega plus in real life--but I can tell you that the circumference of a mega roll is 2.5 inches more than the circumference of a double roll (16.25 vs. 13.75 inches). (Note that the double rolls are wound more loosely than the mega rolls.) So, the big question is, would a roll of toilet paper 2.5 inches larger than anything I've ever used fit in my bathroom fixtures?I'm happy to say that the answer is YES. It is admittedly a tighter fit than before, but not so tight as to be a problem. Anything larger, however, would not fit: that means you, Charmin Ultra Mega Plus.So does this mean that I'll now be switching to mega rolls? It looks like the answer is no. I've done some price comparisons and from what I've seen (though your results may vary), a 12-pack of mega rolls tends to sell for the same price as a 24-pack of double rolls. You might be fooled into thinking that this is a wash, but consider that there are 3936 sheets of toilet paper in 24 double rolls vs. 3696 sheets in 12 mega rolls: if you buy the mega roll, you're paying the same price for 240 fewer sheets.(The sheets are the same size in both.)  [EDIT! I'm seeing some packages of Charmin Ultra Soft mega rolls online with 308 sheets, and some with 328! Very confusing. If you find packages with 328 sheets per roll, then that's exactly twice the number of sheets as are in a double roll, and 12 mega rolls would indeed equal 24 double rolls.]In coming to a decision about roll sizes yourself you'll want to consider the following factors:Price: Which size costs less per sheet or square foot in your area?Storage Space: Do the rolls fit wherever you usually store them?Bathroom Fixtures: Do the mega or mega plus rolls fit in your bathroom fixtures? If not, you may have to purchase the Charmin Extender. My research suggests that, at nearly $10 a pop, you're never going to save enough buying mega rolls to earn back that outlay.Convenience: How irritated are you about the frequency with which you need to change your toilet paper rolls? Would ridding yourself of that irritation be worth the price of one or more toilet paper extenders?All important questions.While I can't tell you what size toilet paper you should purchase, I can wholeheartedly recommend Charmin Ultra. You work hard. You play hard. You deserve it.Good luck with your decision, one and all, and Godspeed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SEGOXFQT2TR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFLOCC#wasThisHelpful","R2SEGOXFQT2TR3","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Oceanique popcorn rug is attractive, but I certainly wouldn't call it plush. I don't mind its feel on my feet, but other family members find stepping on the ""kernels"" of the rug unpleasant. The 17"" x 24"" rug, which is what I received, is on the small side, but it's ideal for certain bathroom setups. Buyers should just be careful when they order that they know which of the two available sizes they're getting.There are two problems with the rug that keep me from recommending it with any gusto. First, the backing isn't rubberized, so it slips around in a way that you really don't want in a frequently used bathroom. For this reason I've moved it from our main bathroom to a half bath that doesn't have a shower/tub. Second, the instructions call for you to wash it in cold water--fine--and lay it flat to dry. This is just so not going to happen. At least not often. Where on earth am I supposed to lay it flat to dry? And how long is the rug going to be out of operation when I do? Yet another reason to move it to a bathroom where it's less likely to need frequent cleaning.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C0DCOD6WN5BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3FFDOK#wasThisHelpful","R1C0DCOD6WN5BN","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Retired OSI agent Maxine Decker continues to grow on me. In her third outingafter The Blade and The Shieldshe finds out about a long submerged, corroded Nazi device that's recently surfaced in Mexico. Whatever the thing is, and despite its condition, it's worth killing for. And as you might guess, Maxine and her former husband, OSI Special Agent Kenny Gates, are on the short list of potential victims.The book follows Maxine and Kenny as they try to figure out what's going on: it turns out that the Nazi relic is tied to a very real threat in the present day, and thousands of American lives are at stake. The main story is interrupted periodically by excerpts from an old diary. A woman named Magda Scarlet provides a riveting account of a personal tragedy. Her story seems at first to be completely unrelated to the modern-day drama that's keeping Maxine busy, but of course it's not. Eventually the two storylines merge, and it's a bit of a surprise when they do. (My one complaint about the book is that Magda Scarlet's transformation is so dramatic that it perhaps strains credibility.)The Tomb is a quick read with short chapters that keep you turning the pages. An entertaining plot, but I'm increasingly in it for the characters. I really like the relationship between Maxine and Kenny: it's a sweet romance that somehow keeps you hooked despite their history. Their happily ever after didn't take the first time, but we're hoping they'll give it a second shot.[Disclaimer: I received a review copy of this book from the authors.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA566X28IA9QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692486283#wasThisHelpful","RA566X28IA9QS","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buying a 10-port USB hub was one of the best decisions I've ever made...and I made it three years ago. I bought Plugable's  10-Port High Speed Hub, and it's worked perfectly for me ever since. I mention this because as far as I can see, the TRENDnet 10-port USB Hub is identical to the Plugable hub in all respects except for the logo and writing on top of the device.The design of both units is exquisite. They have a small footprint and come with long cords so they can easily be positioned at a convenient spot on your desk. Of course each device will increase by nine the number of available USB slots you'll have, and they'll make those slots MUCH more accessible. Both units have two flip-up ports in the rear, which makes them even more convenient. Both are plug and play, and take about three seconds to install and start using.I love my Plugable. And if the TRENDnet holds up as well as the Plugable has, I'll love it just as much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8YRJHQVFVL2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L49XDB4#wasThisHelpful","R8YRJHQVFVL2A","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm no expert on batteries. I don't understand anything about the specifics of how power is consumed and so on. So my approach to this product is as a fairly ignorant but perhaps average consumer. I now own three different battery chargers. One of them has the same capacity as this one (5,600 mAh), and the other has about a third that capacity. So the 5,600 mAh chargers are able to put out about three times as much power as the other one, and they will take a correspondingly longer time to charge. That's about it for my appreciation of how they work.The chargers do all differ in their appearance/shape, in the extras they come with, and in how they are recharged. So, for example, I have a Tylt ENERGI2 1800 mAh charger that is a square shape, rather thick, that has built-in prongs that can pop out and plug into a wall. That's an extremely convenient feature. Another charger, the Gembonics 5600mAh, comes with a squid-like cord that has a bunch of different cords all attached together--lightning, mini-USB, USB and the old Apple connector. Also convenient, although sometimes I think it doesn't make a very good connection with my iPod.At any rate, the Amazon Basics charger doesn't have a squid cord or prongs. It comes with a simple, very short USB to mini USB cord for charging. You have to supply your own cord for charging your devices (at least, those that don't take mini USB). I don't mind this, as it's usually pretty easy to have the right cord at hand. What I like most about this one is its size and shape. It's about the same width as my iPod Touch 5, a little thicker and a little shorter. It's a great size for slipping in a shirt or pants pocket. As for aesthetics, I really like the matte black finish. The charger also comes with a little drawstring bag, which I suppose is a nice touch, but I can't imagine ever bothering to store it in there. Perhaps if I were traveling with it....In short, I really like the look and size of this charger. It could be improved by coming with a squid cord such as I describe above, but this is hardly a deal breaker. Recharging it isn't as convenient as recharging my Tylt, but then the convenient size of this device precludes its having built-in prongs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OXFGY2WZQ2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRK8IV0#wasThisHelpful","R5OXFGY2WZQ2X","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So this is what a quality pan feels like....I've been using this set of pans for several weeks now, and they've been great. The anti-stick coating is very effective. (As the pan ages, of course, it may work less well. Time will tell.) Eggs, for example, when using a little bit of spray oil, will slide right out of the pan. It's a heavy pan. Initially I thought it might be cumbersome for that reason, but what I like about it is that it sits very firmly on the stove burner. I have some other pans that are light enough that the handle weighs down one side of the pan, and that turns out to be surprisingly annoying.The heaviness/thickness of the pan probably is also responsible for its handling high eats particularly well. Where my other, lighter pans would be smoking and would burn food in high heat, these hold up very well and heat evenly.The stainless steel handle is riveted onto the pan and it feels very solid and well constructed. I was a little worried that the handle would heat up enough while cooking that I would have to use a pot holder to touch it, but that hasn't happened. I've had the pan over heat long enough, for example, to carmelize a bunch of onions and then cook hamburgers, and the handle has never become anything more than pleasantly warm.The only criticism I can think of regarding these pans is not really a fair one to make: I'd prefer it if they were a little deeper. Very often, when cooking for three or four in the larger pan and flipping stuff with a spatula, the food is in danger of falling over the sides if I'm not careful. But as I say, it's not fair to fault this pan for not being a different size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DX5DX8G9QL58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M31W5D4#wasThisHelpful","R3DX5DX8G9QL58","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been very pleased with this towel set. The bath towel is nice and large, and the towels are fluffy but not too fluffy. (This is a matter of taste. I'm used to towels that are a step above sandpaper, so I'm accustomed to a certain roughness in towel use. Indeed, I actually want a bit of that road feel, if you will, when drying off.) There haven't been any problems with the towels. The first couple of washes produced a fair amount of lint, but I think that stage is now over with. I liked these towels enough, in fact, that I wound up ordering six additional Pinzon 550-gram bath towels, in different colors. (Those purchased towels are slightly different, as they come with a wider stripe than these for some reason. I prefer the narrower stripe.) The Pinzon label is Amazon's house brand. As I learned in a helpful towel review by Margaret Picky, the name is fitting: Vicente Pinzn was a Spanish explorer who sailed with Columbus in 1492 and discovered the Amazon River.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZBL6OZ4VAQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSNDGJ0#wasThisHelpful","RTZBL6OZ4VAQD","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:01 MinsThere are two things to consider in reviewing the Angel Soft Soft Packs: the tissues themselves, and their newfangled soft delivery system. As for the tissues, they're just okay in my book. Serviceable, but not as soft as our go-to tissues, the Cadillac of tissues, Kleenexes. And the delivery system? Well, I find it kind of exciting. My daughter and I have created a video that illustrates how tissues are likely to be used in the average family. It also demonstrates the ease/lack of ease with which the tissues can be removed from the pack. As the video shows, the first few tissues are a little hard to get out. It helps if you adopt a sort of swish and flick, bend and snap approach: lift up to one corner of the opening and down to the other. Once you get past the first few, they come out fast and easy. You won't encounter difficulties again until you get to the last few tissues, when the pack is light enough that you'll want to hold it down with one hand while removing the tissue with the other.I quite like the soft pack because of its advantages over cardboard: you can grab a pack for your car, say, and it won't get crushed and broken, like cardboard boxes do. You don't have to dig your fingers into a cardboard box to take out the last tissues when they're no longer popping up as they should. So I'm sold on the soft pack idea, and the tissues themselves are good enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CBGNCP5AEEAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTI8SR0#wasThisHelpful","R1CBGNCP5AEEAB","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't yet read the last couple of books in this series: while I was off doing other things Mma Makutsi changed her title and had a baby--pretty big doings. Still, time moves slowly in McCall Smith's Botswana, and one is able to jump into his books out of order without missing too much. This time out, Mma Ramotswe is asked to discover the identity of a woman with amnesia. She also concerns herself with the future of Charlie, her husband's girl-chasing apprentice mechanic. Meanwhile, Mma Makutsi is wading more fully into entrepreneurship by opening the caf of the book's title: things don't quite go as planned. As always, it's a delight to spend some time in the company of Mma Ramotswe and her people. McCall Smith's writing is a simple joy, in the way that watching dust motes waft lazily in a shaft of summer sunlight is a joy. Life should have more such moments. And more such books.

"Joel Dicker's much ballyhooed The Truth about the Harry Quebert Affair is a very long book. Reading it, one has a lot of time to think about whether jumping into a 650-odd page tome was a good idea. I'm still not sure. There was a lot I didn't like about it. A litany of complaints: I'm pretty sure a lot of the book could have been lopped off to good effect. I found much of the story implausible. The too-precious chapter openings--in which Harry gives Marcus advice about writing--are often nauseating. Marcus' mother--a minor character, thank you, Jesus--is a ludicrous caricature of a Jewish mother. Everyone was supposed to love the fifteen-year-old Nola--whose disappearance in 1975 is the book's great mystery--but the persona she presented to people, as described in the book, was not particularly likable in my opinion. And the book within a book, Harry Quebert's alleged masterpiece, well, it reads like schlock in the snippets that punctuate this book. Towards the end, my interest in the story increased as we finally found out whodunit. And there is indeed a decent mystery buried in these pages. But there are so many twists and turns in the last couple chapters that I wound up not really caring by the end of it what had really happened to Nola.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WZ6KKMYT8RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143126687#wasThisHelpful","R21WZ6KKMYT8RJ","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taboo is a simple but very fun party or family game in which teams of players compete to guess words given a set of clues. The person given the clues tries to get his or her teammates to say a specified word while not saying any of the taboo words. One real example from Taboo Buzzd: the target word is VELCRO, but the clue giver can't say FASHION, FABRIC, STICK, or ZIP. The standard Taboo game comes with boxes of cards, a buzzer (for use when the clue giver says a taboo word), and a small hourglass for timing rounds.Taboo Buzzd offers pretty much the same game play but in a more portable package. Like the traditional game, it comes loaded with about 1000 words to be guessed, and of course the timer is built into the game. It works fine, and it's more convenient than playing the card game. But there are two negatives which may turn you off:1. While you're playing the game, there is an electronic timer ticking down the seconds, gradually becoming more insistent until there's a sort of explosion when your time is up. This is convenient, obviously, because it notifies you when the round is up: with the traditional game, it's very easy to get caught up in game play and not notice that the sand in the hourglass has run out. Unfortunately, the ticking sound in the Buzzd game is extremely loud and annoying, and there is no volume button. I've covered the speaker on my machine with packing tape. This helps a little bit, but it's still irritatingly loud.2. Taboo Buzzd is very low tech. It has a small screen with a pixelated font and four buttons. It looks like something that could have been on the market in 1990. It gets the job done, so I suppose it doesn't have to be any more complicated than it is, but I'd expect more of a game selling for this much. Buzzd looks like something you should be picking up in a discount store for about a quarter the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35VS12BNL6QSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFWSMMS#wasThisHelpful","R35VS12BNL6QSP","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read Eric Jager's The Last Duel some eight years ago, and it still stands out for me as one of the best books I've read since I began blogging books. I was delighted, then, when the author sent me a copy of his new book, Blood Royal: A True Tale of Crime and Detection in Medieval Paris. As the subtitle promises, Blood Royal tells the story of a crime, the murder of Louis of Orleans, who was struck down one night in 1407 by a gang of assassins. This was no ordinary murder, because Louis was the brother of the King of France, Charles VI (a.k.a. Charles the Mad). Charles' intermittent bouts of insanity led to disputes between Louis and a cousin, John of Burgundy, over the regency and guardianship of Charles' young heir. Louis, then, was more involved in the government of France (and, incidentally, with Charles' wife Isabeau) than he would have been were his brother not crazy.Roughly the first half of Jager's book tells the story of the build-up to the assassination and the investigation of the crime by the Provost of Paris, Guillaume de Tignonville. Jager also provides us with backstory about Tignonville and the prisons and executions he oversaw--very interesting, gory stuff. Tignonville's original police report is extant, happily, preserved on a parchment scroll, and it allows Jager to paint a detailed account of what happened in the days leading up to and immediately following Louis' murder. Ordinary Parisians, by virtue of living near the scene of the crime, were suddenly part of a nationally important investigation, and their everyday movements, documented by interrogators, became part of the historical record. As Jager writes in his epilogue, ""The events of November 1407 lit up their lives like a flash of lightning, and the Provost's scribes briefly captured their excited and worried voices, which then fell into silence and near oblivion."" I can't emphasize enough how interesting I find this sort of history, getting a glimpse of the lives of ordinary people from a lost world going about their ordinary business: a purveyor of wicker baskets, a nosy neighbor woman who slept in the nude, watercarriers who made their living delivering buckets of river water to private residences.The second half of the book deals with larger issues, the national and international ramifications of Louis' murder: civil war in France, renewed hostilities with England, the unthinkable savagery of the Hundred Years' War. Tignonville is mostly missing from this part of the book, and ordinary folk are looked at only in the aggregate. This larger story is of course the big picture stuff that changes history, but for me Jager's story--and nonfiction generally--is most successful when it focuses on and fully unpacks small events. And Jager is expert at doing so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26JVS965O81C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316224510#wasThisHelpful","R26JVS965O81C2","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Quartet Magnetic Combination board is a decent white board for the price. The plastic frame is cheap, but it comes in attractive colors, and the strip of cork board down the side somehow makes it look nicer. The board comes with two striped magnets for affixing items to the white board part.I was worried that the cork board would not be deep enough to take a regular thumbtack. If you look at the board closely, it looks like the white board fills up the whole frame and an almost paper-thin swath of cork board is laid over that. I'm not sure how it's constructed, but in fact the cork board works fine: I had no trouble inserting standard sized pushpins.The one negative I see is that the mounting magnets that are included in the package are not strong enough to hold the weight of the board: put it on your refrigerator, and it will slowly slide down to the floor.

"This is a decent white board for the price. The frame is plastic, which betrays its cheapness, but it comes in attractive colors--mine is green--which is nice. The board comes with two magnets which can be used to affix items to the white board. Some of these Quartet magnets come with magnets that have a striped design. My board came with clear magnets, which are considerably less attractive than the striped magnets. Having this be a magnetic bulletin board is a nice touch, though I'm not sure yet if that will prove to be an important factor after continued use.The frame also comes with double sided tape and mounting magnets so that you can either affix the board to a wall or to a metal surface. To do the latter, you first position the tape on the back, then affix the magnets to the tape: the magnets themselves aren't sticky, in other words. I did not try hanging the board up on a wall, so I'm not sure whether that would hold well. But I did put the self-adhesive tape and magnets on the back and tried putting it up on my refrigerator. Unfortunately, the magnets weren't strong enough to hold the weight of the board, which slowly slid down the refrigerator door. It held a little more firmly--though not firmly enough--to the door of our dishwasher (the difference being, perhaps, that the refrigerator door is textured and the dishwasher door is smooth).So the two downsides of the board are the ugly magnets and the fact that the mounting magnets it comes with can't do the job of holding it up. The latter is the more important concern, but it's not a deal-breaker. In short, a good enough white board.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3W94BX20GAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW6S3P6#wasThisHelpful","R1X3W94BX20GAZ","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first, many attempts at using this product one-handed didn't go well. The tape worked as advertised only maybe one out of five times. It eventually dawned on me, however, that I was holding the dispenser wrong. You have to hold it in such a way that the movement of the roll of tape is in no way impeded by your hand. In other words, you have to hold it in a rather unnatural way, very consciously only touching the dispenser with your fingers (your palm can't come into play) in order for it to work. Once you do that, it works fine. And the tape seems sturdy and sticky enough to do its job. So, in the end, I'm a little disappointed with the dispenser (and in myself, for not recognizing what I was doing wrong sooner), but if used properly it does do a decent job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20B5I89UU5JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033URRSM#wasThisHelpful","R20B5I89UU5JK","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Swingline Fashion Stapler looks cheap. It's all straight lines and bargain bin-looking plastic, and the rubber feet on the bottom are narrow little strips that just look ineffectual. Aesthetically speaking, it's not much, except for its color--though this shade of green just seems wrong to me as a stapler color.That said, I've now tested the Swingline against my trusty Red Stapler, and its performance has surprised me. My Red Stapler has formerly contended with and handily beaten the PaperPro StandOut Standup Stapler (see my review: http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4RHFHA1DBRD/). But I'm afraid that it's now met its match (with an important caveat--see below). The Swingline has a solid feel to it, and it's easy to use one-handed. It turns out that it can also handle a lot of paper at one time. I tested both staplers by having them staple multiple sheets of paper together. At 27 sheets the Swingline is still going strong, and I can still use it easily with one hand. But my Red Stapler falters at this stage: it can still staple effectively if I use two hands, or if I use it against a desk, but one handed stapling simply doesn't work. The Swingline definitely wins the day here.The important caveat alluded to above may turn out to be a big problem.The hinge of the stapler, where it opens and closes, has a metal rod going through it. It's a plus that it's not plastic: the hinges of some mini staplers are made of plastic, and they inevitably break there. But the problem is that while the rod has a head on one end that keeps it in place, there is nothing keeping the rod in place on the other end. (By contrast, my Red Stapler is constructed in such a way that the rod in its hinge could not come loose.) Twice already the rod has started to work its way loose. It's something that I'll have to keep an eye on for the life of this stapler. Yet another sign of cheap construction, but in this case one that has more than aesthetic ramifications.So, the Swingline gets 5 stars on performance, and perhaps 3 on appearance. Marks off also for the metal rod problem. I'm still giving it 4 stars, however, since performance, I think, trumps the other two considerations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17LXCA1KX4GZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DQY8B0#wasThisHelpful","R17LXCA1KX4GZ7","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Eureka AirSpeed does a good job as a quick touch-up vacuum. It offers a number of advantages, chief among them that it's extremely light. It's also corded and so is pretty powerful, and it's easy to assemble and use. All very good. Against this are a few disadvantages. At 16 feet, the cord is rather short. Looking at other stick vacuums on Amazon, this doesn't seem to be an unusual length for this type of product, but it is inconvenient. Plug the vacuum in a few feet from the base of your stairs, and you may have trouble doing the entire stairway without moving the cord to a different outlet. The vacuum comes with a crevice tool. The tool has a ring that attaches to the stick of the vacuum, but the connection is not very strong and the thing falls off constantly. Finally, the handle does not feel very strong where it attaches to the vacuum unit. I feel like it would snap if too much pressure were put on it. None of these complaints are a big deal, but they do detract a bit from the user experience. To sum up, here are my pros and cons:PROS-- VERY light weight-- Easy to assemble-- Easy to use (emptying, for example, and putting back together again)-- Corded/powerfulCONS-- 16-foot cord is too short for some tasks-- Crevice tool falls off routinely when in storage position-- Handle doesn't feel solid","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ZTPDNYWY9P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPSL0FG#wasThisHelpful","R32ZTPDNYWY9P9","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a handy first aid kit to have around the house. It comes stocked with a lot of everyday first aid supplies: band aids, thermometers, gauze pads, aspirins, a cold pack, and so on. It seems like an okay value for the price at which it's currently selling on Amazon (around thirty dollars), although the grayed-out list price Amazon shows (over a hundred dollars) is crazy. The case itself is quite nice: lots of little compartments to fit things in so they don't all get mixed up together. I've moved our old first aid supplies into this case because it's better than the unsegmented box we were using.The case comes with screws for hanging it on a wall. In theory, I suppose that would be a good idea. You could create an immobile first-aid station whose whereabouts everyone would know.

"The FK100 is a really handy utility knife, and easy to operate once you figure out how it works. There's not much to it, but the instructions were so cryptic that I had to play with it for a while just to figure out how to load the blade and how to fold the knife up when finished. (To insert the blade, push the button near the front of the device *when it's half folded up.* To close the knife, you have to push aside a piece of metal in the handle.) I like that the blade can only come out when the knife is not fully extended--it's safer to use that way. And I like very much the solid feel and grippiness of the device in your hand. It's an elegant tool, much better than those one-piece utility knives I've used in the past which leave the blade exposed when not in use (and which you have to unscrew to insert a blade).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OQ5B1QUETIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CY8BIZM#wasThisHelpful","R18OQ5B1QUETIS","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To an extent, one's opinion of the Contigo Jackson water bottle will be a matter of taste. Do you like drinking from the bottle's wide mouth or not? I find that I don't. I prefer narrow tops the size of, say, Poland Spring water bottles. Others may like water bottles that come with built-in straws. I imagine it's just a question of what you're used to.Beyond the question of taste, there are more objective considerations. On the plus side, the Contigo bottle is slender enough to fit easily into the mesh pockets on the side of knapsacks. And that wide mouth makes filling the bottle, or putting ice in it, quite easy. It's also easy to open the lid to take a drink from it. Push a button on the side of the cap and the lid snaps open. But that easiness is to my mind also a serious drawback: the lid is *too* easy to open. I would strongly advise against putting it inside a knapsack, for example, since the lid could easily snap open accidentally and soak your belongings. (My daughter dropped the bottle on the floor once and it opened accidentally.)My only other negative is minor. There's a colored loop on the top of the lid that swings open. You can use it to carry the water bottle. But this seems more aesthetic than practical: it doesn't seem like it would be comfortable to carry the bottle by its loop for a long time. And the plastic loop could be cracked with one good drop, rendering it useless.-- Debra Hamel","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WP83SGUF5SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F968YRG#wasThisHelpful","R22WP83SGUF5SE","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On the one hand, I can't fault the construction of this hamper. It fits together easily. The handles are comfortable. The material is sturdy but lightweight. The cover is cleverly designed so that the flaps are flexible but remain in position when not in use. It looks decent. My problem is that, at least for me, the Good Grips Double Flip hamper actually makes the job of doing laundry more difficult.A standard, plastic laundry basket is a pretty flexible tool. (1) You can collect dirty clothes in it, including sorting clothes into different baskets if you're so inclined. (2) You can carry the dirty clothes to your laundry room. (3) You can easily move the clothes from the basket into the washing machine, either by (a) dumping them in (because the size of the laundry basket allow this to be done easily) or by (b) extracting clothes from the basket selectively by hand. (4) When the laundry is done, you can fold the now clean clothes back into the laundry basket and carry them back to where they need to be.The Good Grips hamper does a good job at number (1) above, collection. It's okay at number (2), though the hamper is a bit more awkward to carry around than your average laundry basket. But it fails at numbers (3) and (4). The hamper is too awkward and too big to lift up so as to dump clothes into a washing machine--and the double basket would make dumping problematic anyway. It's also too deep to comfortably extract clothes from. (And where to put it while you're picking clothes out? On a floor and you have to bend down too much. On a table of regular height and it's too tall to reach into. Perhaps it would work if you put it on a chair--if you happen to have room in your laundry room for one.) The hamper is likewise too deep to make it useful for folding clothes back into when they're clean.In short, the hamper is a nicely constructed item that does not serve its principal purpose well. I've decided to put mine to use instead to store balls in--basketballs, soccer balls, etc. It works well for that, but then again, the Good Grips hamper comes with a pretty hefty price tag.

"The X-ACTO SharpX Electric Pencil Sharpener is a powerful sharpener intended to handle a lot of work--more an office or school machine than a home machine. It sharpens pencils very quickly and in my experience so far evenly. It has a big drawer for shavings with an LED light that signals when the drawer is full, which is a nice feature. The best feature is that it stops sharpening when it senses the pencil is sharpened: the motor keeps going, but the teeth aren't engaged, so what tells you that the pencil is ready is a slight change in the sound. (Actually, if you're adding LED lights, one that lights up when the pencil is sharpened would be nice.)For the most part, this sharpener is a winner:-- It's powerful.-- It stops sharpening when the pencil is sharp.-- It has a large drawer for shavings that's fairly easily removed.-- The dial for pencil size is easy to adjust.There are negatives, however, which may influence your buying decision:-- When you pull out the drawer you'll inevitably find more shavings under it, perhaps knocked loose from the mechanism as you're pulling out the drawer.-- The  unit has suction cups on the bottom that hold it in place when it's sitting on a kitchen counter (for example), but these won't hold it in place when it's on a wooden surface. You'll then have to hold the unit steady in one hand while you sharpen, which is a bit less convenient.-- The sharpener is *big* and takes up a lot of real estate.-- De gustibus, of course, but in my opinion the sharpener is seriously ugly. I realize, however, that worrying about the attractiveness or not of one's pencil sharpener is probably the epitome of First World problems.In all the most meaningful respects, then, this sharpener does a good job, and it comes recommended.-- Debra Hamel","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4CDY5KWYH6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZMWHIC#wasThisHelpful","R2X4CDY5KWYH6T","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ambient Weather WR-111B emergency crank radio is similar in my ways to the Etn American Red Cross ARCFR160R Microlink Self-Powered AM/FM/NOAA Weather Radio with Flashlight, Solar Power and Cell Phone Charger (Red), which we purchased, by luck, just a couple of weeks before Hurricane Irene hit in 2011. Both radios include an AM/FM/weather radio, flashlight and cell phone charger, but there are some differences between the two. I like both, for different reasons. Here are the points in the Ambient's favor:1. Both radios can be charged by solar power and hand crank, but the Ambient Weather radio can also be charged by USB device--you can plug it into your computer (cord included) or, if you have the proper converters, into an outlet or your car. (These alternate means of powering the device would mostly be important if you plan on using the radio other than during emergencies, perhaps if you can foresee being without power and you want to charge it up ahead of time.)2. In addition to providing weather radio, the Ambient has a weather alert mode: it will go into standby until there's a weather alert. I have tried out the mode but have not yet been notified of an alert.3. The phone charger on the Ambient is more convenient than the one on the Etn. With the Ambient, you plug your phone into the charged radio, and it charges your phone. It's easy, and my phone hooked up easily and started charging with no problem at all. But with the Etn you need to plug in the phone and crank. I'm not even sure that I've managed to get it to charge at all by this method, as there was no indication on my phone screen that it was charging.Of the above points, I personally only care about the third. If the Etn had the same cell phone charging system as the Ambient, I'd be happy. Here's what I like about the Etn:1. This may be superficial, but the Etn is just a much nicer looking device, and it's smaller, so it fits in your hand better. By contrast, the Ambient is bulky and kind of ugly.2. The directions that come with the Etn are short and sweet, whereas the pamphlet that comes with the Ambient is intimidating.3. It's nice that the Ambient comes with cords and connectors (two cords with three connectors, to be precise), and yet, this also makes it a bit more unwieldy. You have to carry them with you, keep them with the radio, worry about losing them. That suggests maybe you should keep the box the radio came in to store them in, and it just takes away some of the attraction of the radio.4. [EDITED! See below.] The biggest point that the Etn has in its favor over the Ambient, however, is the radio tuning. The Etn has old-fashioned dials for station and volume. They may not be sexy, but they work, and they work fast. The Ambient has a digital tuner, and you advance through it one click at a time: 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4...you get the picture. There's no way to make this go faster: if you hold down the button, it doesn't start speeding through the numbers. If you have children at home during a blackout, for example, with only an emergency radio for entertainment--children who are accustomed to pecking through preset radio stations like crazed pigeons (or something)--then tempers will run high.EDIT: It turns out that the Ambient *does* have radio scanning! You just have to push in the tun+ or tun- far longer than I expected. So, forget the whole crazed pigeon scenario. And yes the auto scanning was mentioned in the directions, but I guess I didn't read the fine print carefully enough.In short, I prefer the Etn for its form factor, but if cell phone charging is a big concern, the Ambient's probably a better bet.-- Debra Hamel","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJELK4OOISVVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071BTJPI#wasThisHelpful","RJELK4OOISVVF","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since the new normal here in the northeast seems to be lengthy power outages following annual hurricanes and winter storms, it's a good idea to have flashlights or lanterns at the ready. The Energizer LED lantern is a very thoughtfully-designed emergency light. There are a number of details that I quite like:-- It folds up into a very compact unit, easily held in one hand.-- The strap, when closed, can be put around the unit to keep it from popping open accidentally (in a knapsack, for example, if you were using it for camping).-- The light can be dimmed by pressing the on/off button for an extended period of time.-- The battery pack is accessed at the bottom of the unit. There's a screw at the bottom, but what's nice is that the groove is so big it can be unscrewed using a coin: no need to search for a screwdriver in the dark.When on at full strength, the light is quite bright, and able to light up an entirely dark room pretty well.There are two potential negatives in the design that I can see. The first has to do with the handle. It's permanently attached to the device on one side. On the other side the handle has a clip. If you want to use the handle as an actual handle when the lantern is open, you'll wind up having to manipulate it rather a lot: you have to unclip it and reattach it so the handle will go up, then unclip and reattach so that it wraps around the base of the lantern. My concern is that the plastic clip at the end of the handle won't be able to handle the strain. (That said, you can put less strain on the clip if you attach it before wrapping the handle around the bottom. It's easier to push the handle into position when clipped than to clip it when the handle is already in position.)Second, I said above that the handle protects the lantern from opening accidentally when packed in a knapsack, but there's nothing to prevent it from being turned on accidentally: the big red on button could easily be pushed in under such conditions, wasting batteries and, perhaps, leading to the lantern not being available for use when you really need it. Of course, if you're not packing this up for use on the go, then this wouldn't be an issue.A final note: The unit turns on and off with single clicks. But if your click is a little slow when you try to turn it off, you'll find that it doesn't turn off. You might think there's something wrong with the on/of switch, but it's fine: it's just that if you linger when clicking then the light will start dimming instead of turning off. Click quickly.-- Debra Hamel","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332A73E9OO56Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0EZWJ4#wasThisHelpful","R332A73E9OO56Q","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It will stay open in two different positions.-- There's a hole in the back cover so that the iPad's camera is not covered.-- Most importantly, the iPad snaps into the stand easily and very securely.As far as negatives, there's not much to say, but:-- The case will not allow you to prop up the iPod vertically, so if you're using it as an e-reader, that may be a disadvantage.-- The volume buttons on the right are a little hard to get to. I suppose it would be hard to make a cover in which this wasn't the case, however, since the edge of the iPod slants inward.-- As far as looks go, the cover is a bit bland, not ugly, but not eye-catching either. It almost has a plastic feel to it, too, despite being leather.Aesthetics aside, however, and despite my other minor quibbles, this is a solid case, and I feel comfortable knowing that my device is securely protected in it.UPDATE 4/15/2013Well, less than a month in and the case broke. It was dropped from a height of about four feet onto a wooden floor and must have hit the floor just right: the upper plastic corner completely snapped off so that it no longer holds the iPad in place at all. I don't know if this is a fault of the case, really: it just happened to hit the floor at a vulnerable spot and broke. But it's a shame that the usefulness of such a nice case depends entirely on fairly breakable plastic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AYZLH9EXWG3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYU2RES#wasThisHelpful","R2AYZLH9EXWG3Y","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Moshi Moonrock ear buds are marketed--at least on Amazon--as being made for the Kindle Fire. I'm not sure why. They're standard size ear buds and thus can work in probably any media player--certainly they work on both my iPod Touch and my 1st generation Kindle Fire.The ear buds come with three sizes of ear plugs--small, medium, and large--and they fit very comfortably. They also sound great, with minimal noise from the cord. To my mind they're comparable in sound quality to my JBuds J2 Premium Hi-FI Noise Isolating Earbuds Style Headphones, which I also think sound great. Unlike the JBuds, the Moonrocks have a pause switch on the wire: someone's talking to you, and click the button rather than fiddling with your music player. That's very convenient, and it worked fine with my iPod. It did not work, however, with my Kindle Fire. I tried it both while using Amazon's Cloud Player to listen to music and while watching an Amazon Instant Video. Perhaps it would work on the Fire in other apps.Another nice feature of the Moonrocks is that the ear plugs come with two different accent colors--red and white. You could use the same color for both ears if you want, but if you don't, you can color-code it so that you can easily tell which is for which ear: red for right, for example.The Moonrocks come with a cord storage unit. You plug the ear buds into the holes of the unit and then wrap the cord around it. It's made of flexible plastic and there's an opening around the edges. It's a nice idea to include something like this for travel purposes, and its looks cool in the pictures, but I found too awkward to use, and I've stored it away with the product's packaging.All in all, very nice headphones. The case is a disappointment, however, so if that's a big selling point for you, you might want to rethink.-- Debra Hamel","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VBRVZAFWNJCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005RGDVTE#wasThisHelpful","R3VBRVZAFWNJCA","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've installed a toilet seat or two in my day and installing this Mayfair (replacing, I note, a Mayfair that came with our house when we bought it twenty years ago) was definitely an unusual experience. Most toilet seats attach with a plastic nut and bolt. You screw the bolt down through the toilet from the top, and it's covered over when you're done with a plastic housing. To remove the seat, you would snap that housing up and unscrew the bolt, which--were you to do this too much--would easily become stripped. This Mayfair is quite different. What you wind up doing is installing a sort of snap closure onto your toilet. The seat then snaps onto that, and is tightened by shifting what would be the plastic housing on a regular toilet seat. That probably makes it sound very complicated, but it's not difficult to install at all. I just wanted to get across that this is a revolution in toilet seat attachment. With this new mode of attachment it's a very simple thing to take the toilet seat on and off, should you want to. No unscrewing bolts or anything. You just push that housing to the side and lift.Why the change? The manufacturer touts the idea that you can lift the toilet seat off for cleaning purposes. It's really not necessary to remove a toilet seat to clean it, of course, but perhaps some people out there actually do that. More importantly, the new attachment type must be the reason that this toilet seat will--the manufacturer promises us--never loosen. And that is an idea I can get behind. There is surely something uniquely worrying about sitting on a toilet seat that is not firmly attached to its base. And tightening that seat--finding a screw driver, flipping open that by now repulsive housing--is not a task one looks forward to. If this Mayfair can deliver me from that particular hell, I'll be very happy indeed. Time, of course, will tell. Time on the order of years.I said above that installing the seat is easy, and it is. The only problem I had was due to the very confined space between my toilet and the wall, and the accompanying limited visibility. I actually wound up disobeying the instructions, which call for you to attach the snap connector thing to the toilet while it's attached to the seat. Because I couldn't see anything, I finally took the seat off, and tightened what needed tightening as much as I could by hand, then reattached the seat and used a ratchet to finish the job, as directed. If you're likewise struggling blind in a cramped space, you might want to try this as well.A final word. If, like me, you don't read the final sentence or two of the directions fully--satisfied that it must say something like, ""tighten completely""--you will likely let loose with an expletive when, upon tightening the bolt, it breaks off. Horrible images went through my mind of having to reinstall the old seat, but it turns out that that the thing is supposed to break. Crazy, eh? So all is well. The toilet seat looks nice and fits perfectly, and I'm looking forward to years of non-slip usage of the thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PR20Q6UGOXEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SJO5QI#wasThisHelpful","R1PR20Q6UGOXEV","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:23 MinsI've had a Dropcam HD Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera since May 2012 and I've been mostly happy with it, but with two reservations. Most importantly, the picture is dull, with most of the color bleached out, which means that it's not only less pleasant to look at, but less useful than it could be. I've had it pointed at my front porch and, for example, cannot tell whether the red flag on the mailbox is up or not because the red blends in with the green bushes behind it. (Notice that in the attached video you can see the red flag just fine!) Second, the email alerts are not that helpful, for two reasons. First, they're so sensitive that I receive notices when cars go by, which I don't really care about. Second, last I checked with Dropcam, the alerts only go out once every half hour. So if someone comes to your door between one alert and the next, you're not notified by email.With that background, I got my hands on a Belkin NetCam. I was delighted by it immediately. Here's what I like about it:1. The setup was absolutely simple. No problems whatever. I had it running in minutes.2. The picture is BRIGHT. Far brighter than what I get with the Dropcam. I've added two images to this item to show the differences between the two.3. You can take pictures or video of what the camera is seeing on the fly. The video attached to this review was taken that way with the microphone off at 640 x 480, with a frame rate of 15 (out of a possible 30) and a quality of 5 (out f 5).4. You can choose to receive email alerts when the device detects motion. Unlike the Dropcam, there is no thirty-minute delay, so when the camera detects motion, you get an email. This is a good thing. The other thing I like about the email alerts is that they include two pictures rather than one. Very often with the Dropcam, which sends one picture, you get a photo when something has just entered the area being monitored, and you can barely tell what it is. With two pictures, you get that first image and the a second one, when whatever has entered the area farther into the frame. The result is a much more informative alert.What could be improved:1. As for negatives, the only real downside of the device for me also has to do with the email alerts. You can adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection with settings from 1-5. What I'd like is to receive alerts whenever someone comes to my door or is in the front yard, say, some 15 feet from the camera. But none of the settings give me that. A setting of 1 seems to result in no alerts coming in at all. But settings from 2-5 result in my getting alerts for cars driving by. Admittedly, sometimes I seem to get fewer alerts about passing cars than other times, and I'm not sure yet what the pattern is. Certainly all settings from 2-5 have alerted me about traffic in front of the house at one time or another. Hopefully the gradations of motion sensitivity for the alerts can be improved in software updates--I'm not sure if that's possible, however.2. There is no Kindle Fire app (yet?).3. The NetCam does not allow you to talk through the device as the Dropcam does. (That is, using the Dropcam you can talk to people in the room from some external site).

"Mr. Monk Gets Even is the 15th book in the Monk series and the last one that Lee Goldberg will be writing. (I see from Amazon that Hy Conrad will be continuing the series.) So, a bittersweet read, as I've enjoyed the series for many years now. This one wasn't quite as funny or even quite as moving as some have been in the past, but it did wrap things up well--wrapped up, at least, as the end of an era rather than of the whole series. I won't give anything away, but Mr. Monk does get even, at least for now: given a universe as unbalanced as ours, things are likely to become odd for him again very soon.

"The Withings WS-30 Wireless Scale (it's apparently pronounced with a long I as in Wi-Fi, i., Wi-Things) is an elegant piece of equipment. It's shiny and modern and good-looking, and it feels sturdy on the floor. (I mention that because my previous scale, the Taylor 7506 Glass and Chrome Digital Scale, is--by design I think--a little unsteady, and I find that annoying.) Setting up the scale was surprisingly easy, for the most part. Everything that might have been hard was easy. It connected immediately to my wifi and I was able to connect it with both my Fitbit account and with a fantastic IOS app I've been using for years, Weightbot. The Withings' weigh-ins synch flawlessly with both. One can view one's information both on the web and via iPhone/iPad apps. I probably won't use the web interface very much but will stick with the IOS app or view my results on Fitbit or Weightbot. (The web interface is much less elegant than the IOS apps.) The device recognized both of my daughters immediately, but it took a couple of weigh-ins, for some reason, for it to recognize my husband and me. But that solved itself very quickly and wasn't an issue.I did have a couple of problems, however, that are both related to a lack of easily found documentation for the product. After the amazing ease of setting up the scale and connecting it, a question of mere minutes, it took me literally about a half hour to figure out how to change the display units on the device from kilograms to pounds. (I finally discovered the information online on Withing's Zendesk account. You have to push that button on the bottom of the device that looks like a computer monitor, then look at the display. To select from the possible units press that same button again.) It also took me a long time to figure out how to make the separate profiles I'd created for the scale private. (For that you have to go into your Withings account, click ""info"" for the profile in question, and then click the ""make independent"" link in the bottom right. That will send an email to the other person and they can set up a password at that point.) Neither of these things is difficult to do once you know how. But the information should be easier to find--perhaps included as instructions that come with the device, as they're pretty basic things that most users will probably want to do.All that said, I'm really pleased with the Withings scale!-- Debra Hamel","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0OAIXROEOF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OXB0K8#wasThisHelpful","R2P0OAIXROEOF3","A1RFQVHBKVN4TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFQVHBKVN4TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall I'm very pleased with this straightener. Here are my thoughts after using it for a couple of weeks:-- The straightener works better on dry hair than wet hair. To straighten wet hair requires repeated strokes.-- The straightener is supposed to leave hair softer because of its soy-infused plates. I'm not sure whether my hair is softer or not, but it's true that the straightener doesn't dry out my hair.-- The straightener is intuitive to use.-- The product smells like burning plastic when it's heating up. It's possible that this will go away with time, however.-- The straightener heats up quickly, but not as quickly as its advertising suggests. (The time may depend on what setting it's set for.)-- The steam vents are supposed to direct the steam away from your head.

"This device is a neat option for those of us who don't have up-to-date car stereo systems that connect via Bluetooth or audio jack to their phone or other music player. Just tune your car's FM radio to an empty, static-only frequency on the dial, tune the Tonor device to the same frequency, plug the Tonor into your phone (or iPod or whatever), and you're all set. The output from the phone will be played through your car radio. I found the audio to be clear and free of static.A couple of points to note:I found that it's important to turn the volume on your phone up all the way. This makes the transmission clear, and you can then control the volume through your car radio.The orientation of the Tonor device assumes that the audio jack of your phone is at the bottom left corner. If that's not the case for your phone, you'll have to hold your phone upside-down and/or backwards to read the Tonor's display, but that's no great hardship.If you're traveling a significant distance, you may find that as different radio stations come into range, you'll have to occasionally change the frequency the Tonor uses, since an empty frequency in one area may not stay empty as you drive.Full disclosure: I received a sample of this item in return for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AJQ9A8UTHTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016Y6K7NS#wasThisHelpful","R10AJQ9A8UTHTP","A2L5R1F9WALW7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5R1F9WALW7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find it kind of weird that, for decades, outlet testers have not taken the obvious step toward simplicity and clarity that this one takes. For all those years, outlet testers (such as this one, also from Sperry Instruments) have used a cryptic system of indicator lights -- a system that has to be translated. Off, off, red means ""bad ground""; yellow, green, off means ""open neutral,"" and so on. Granted the translation chart is printed right on the indicator (for all such indicators that I've seen), and doing the translation isn't exactly rocket science, but still, this cryptic system is an open invitation to make errors that are time-wasting at best and deadly dangerous at worst.Finally, with this outlet tester, the cryptic ""secret decoder ring"" is supplanted. A lit indicator light next to ""bad ground"" means ""bad ground""; ""open neutral"" means ""open neutral,"" and so on. No translation needed.Professional electricians may object to the added bulk of this device versus the older style of outlet tester, but this is great for homeowners to check whether their existing outlets have been wired correctly, and for do-it-yourself-ers to make sure they've done their work right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3569UPQKKHJCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163AKVRM#wasThisHelpful","R3569UPQKKHJCF","A2L5R1F9WALW7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5R1F9WALW7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The care instructions said to dry the rug by laying it flat, but I saw in other reviews that this simply doesn't work, unless you've got a week or two to wait for your rug to dry.

"I first set this camera up for use on my iPad. The setup procedure is long and complicated. Among other difficulties, it involves a couple of screens that are completely non-intuitive: one where there's no prompt telling you you have to tap a magnifying-glass icon before anything will happen, and another where there's nothing telling you that you have to click a Save icon to continue after you've entered some user data (a keyboard <return> does nothing). On my first attempt at installation, something or other went wrong after I'd gone through the whole process, and I had to stick a paperclip wire into the device's Reset hole to start over from scratch. (Note: If you open a technical support ticket on the TrendNet website, they don't email you when there's a response to your question; you're supposed to just log in periodically and check the ticket status.) My second attempt worked okay, and the device now works in conjunction with the TrendNet app on my iPad.I also tried installing the app on my old iPhone 4, which only supports iOS 7.x, and this was a bust. The app launches and starts to show the video, but then crashes after about 5 seconds.This installation and initial test were done with my iPad in Wi-Fi. To access the camera via 3G or 4G, the manual unhelpfully tells you to refer to instructions on the included CD-ROM. (Remember those?) These instructions are in the form of several videos, which for some reason kept dropping the audio on my fairly-up-to-date Mac.

"The compound leverage of these cutters provides a really impressive ratio of handle-motion to jaw-motion. To open the jaws to their maximum (about 1/2 inch), you have to spread the handles to almost 180 degrees. But although the jaws open to  about 1/2 inch, don't expect to cut anything tougher than copper or aluminum of that diameter. I managed to cut through a 1/4 inch diameter steel chain link, and that was definitely pushing the upper limits of what the tool (and my muscles) were capable of. I had to brace one handle of these cutters on my bench and lean my weight on the other handle.So the 18"" model of these cutters won't be much use for cutting medium to heavy chain, or anything but really lightweight padlocks. They're a good size for easy cutting of chain link fencing and slightly larger jobs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q0QFFFFGZZF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UUCY3G#wasThisHelpful","R2Q0QFFFFGZZF6","A2L5R1F9WALW7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5R1F9WALW7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. In it, Peter Biskind  examines a host of films from the fifties (and a few from surrounding years), putting them onto the sociological equivalent of an analyst's couch, so to speak. Through the aperture of these movies, all the conflicting social forces that were vying with one another in the U.S. during 1950s can be seen at work: Liberalism versus conservatism, individualism and personal freedom versus community and conformism, expanding opportunities for women versus reactionary antifeminist backlash, and lots more.For the most part Biskind presents a convincing case that  the movies he looks at stake out this or that position on this or that spectrum of conflicting social opinions and trends, but I'm certainly not saying that I agreed with all of his points. A thinking, critical reader is always unlikely to agree with everything they find in an opinion-packed, interpretation-packed book like this one. In particular, I was profoundly unconvinced by Biskind's argument that the 1954 giant-ant movie Them! carried an anti-feminist subtext. But disagreements like this were the exception rather than the rule for me, and in any case I always found his discussions and analyses to be interesting, engaging, and entertaining.As an example, here's a passage I particularly enjoyed from a section on the James Dean vehicle Rebel Without a Cause (1955): ""With its trilogy of sick families, Rebel touches all the bases. Parents are criticized for being too strong and too weak, too authoritarian and too permissive, for being absent when the kids need them and smothering them with affection when they dont. If its bad to treat teen-agers like children, its also bad to treat them like adults. In Rebel, parents cant do anything right.""Quite a bit of the book is devoted to examining gender roles --  how views about these roles were changing during the 50s, and how a range of movies portrayed and commented, either positively or negatively, on this change. The book's evisceration of the savagely anti-feminist Mildred Pierce (1945) was a particular delight for me in the text.So again, this is a deeply interesting, engaging, and entertaining book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BG73CQE1VYVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HT7MII#wasThisHelpful","R2BG73CQE1VYVM","A2L5R1F9WALW7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5R1F9WALW7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toothbrush is a replacement for a previous, similar model from Sonicare that I purchased on advice from my dental hygienist about 8 years ago.  I loved my old Sonicare and my hygienist raves about how healthy my teeth and gums are at every yearly cleaning.  Of course, I dont know how much my great teeth and gums is the result of the Sonicare and how much is something else, but Im nevertheless devoted to my Sonicare.  The new Sonicare doesnt really add any features that my old one didnt have but after 8 years, although the old one was running fine, I felt it was time for a replacement.  So far this one seems to be just as good as my old one so Im very happy with it.

"For starters, I'm more than a little dubious about the elaborate cleaning system that comes with this shaver. Why should a shaver need to be cleaned (with a dedicated device and a proprietary detergent solution, no less) every day? I submit that it doesn't, and therefor if you purchase this shaver a goodly portion of your money is paying for something that's of no value at all. Thankfully, instructions are included on how to clean the saver without the cleaning apparatus (soap & water, run the shaver, rinse).Moving on to the shaver itself, it seems pretty good. I'm used to using rotary-head shavers, and I'm not willing to say that this reciprocating-blade system is better or worse in terms of closeness or comfort; as near as I can tell it's the same. There is definitely a lot more vibration to the shaver than with a rotary-head device, and people coming from a rotary shaver may find that this takes some getting use to. Regarding comfort, the instructions include the notice that's common with all electric shavers, telling you that ""your skin and beard need about 30 days to adjust to any new shaving method."" I don't understand how this works, but it seems to be true, so don't leap to judgement if this razor causes you a little skin irritation over the first few weeks.One interesting feature is that the sideburn trimmer can be used together with a detachable, adjustable-height comb that can be used to trim a beard or mustache to a given length. Not having a beard or mustache, I couldn't try this out. For giving a nice straight edge to sideburns, the trimmer works very well; it's wide and cuts close to the skin.The shaver has a low-charge indicator warning you when it's time to recharge. I've seen other shavers that display a digital readout supposedly showing how many minutes of use are left before a recharge will be needed, but I know from experience that this display becomes meaningless as the battery ages. So I don't count the absence of this ""feature"" as a minus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX6M6XQEA3QD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","RX6M6XQEA3QD1","A2L5R1F9WALW7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5R1F9WALW7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If there's a pattern to be found in the late period Roth Zuckerman novels, it's that they follow a general (and probably an intentional, since Roth is far from stupid) template.  Nathan Zuckerman stumbles upon a person who has been subjected to a something rather shocking (the act of homegrown terrorism in ""American Pastoral"", the outing of being a Communist in ""I Married a Communist"") and is generally dead by the time he starts to find out the real truth, forcing him to cobble together a biography of that person either through talking to siblings or his own memories or simply pure imagination.  Typically there's a woman involved and a great deal of unfairness being visited on someone and all of that is wrapped in an analysis of what the American Dream might mean at different parts of the twentieth century.  Generally misery seems to be the key takeaway, although small wonders sometimes abound.I wound up reading the trilogy slightly out of order but it worked out because in the order I read it comes across as Roth tweaking and perfecting that aforementioned template.  ""I Married a Communist"" was too busy taking potshots at people that he knew, or lecturing us about politics, to really bite down into its characters.  ""American Pastoral"" was heading in the right direction, adding a necessary dose of compassion and despite more talk about glove making than you'll ever probably experience outside borrowing a book from the library on how to make gloves it treated most of its characters less as plot points or metaphorical stand-ins and as people caught up in their lives and unable to get out of their own way or at the mercy of forces beyond their control, whether those forces were politics or the bonds that attach one family member to another.For the most part, this one gets pretty much everything right.Like most Roth novels, the beginning doesn't so much ease you in as challenge you to keep reading, as Zuckerman goes on about the Bill Clinton scandal that is happening around the time the novel is set (it comes up several times so Roth either means it as a contrast to what's going on (the likely answer) or it was really on his mind for some reason).  The general setup doesn't engender a whole lot of promise either, as esteemed senior citizen professor Coleman Silk, a fiery tell-it-like-it-is fellow like many Roth protagonists winds up getting himself forcibly retired when a comment he makes about two missing students is twisted beyond all intent into a racist invective and blows up out of his control.  His refusal to meekly step down and apologize for something he didn't makes him both outcast and pariah.  His wife eventually dies due to causes related to the stress and when Zuckerman finds him he's ranting like a crazy man, as unyielding as a brick wall and about as easy to have a conversation with.  He wants Zuckerman to write a book about the experience, and while for a moment it seems like the book is going to turn into a treatise on the evils of political correctness, it turns out that isn't the most interesting story here.Given the levels of irony hinted at, it shouldn't take you too long to figure out what the interesting twist to Silk's life here is, and despite the potential for that twist to be used as a cheap and tawdry base for a more exploitative type of novel, it really starts to take off once Roth starts to weave in the issue of race and the history of how this country handles race (spoiler alert, in case you don't follow the news: poorly) Silk starts to become less a man ranting at us about how all his colleagues killed his wife by being spineless and how students these days are all entitled dummies afraid of being offended than the story of how one man decided to tackle the issue of race by playing the only game there was to play, and that was being someone else.  For once we've given a realistic look at the stakes at play and everyone comes across as both disappointed and disappointing, no one is able to get entirely what they want so the best they can do is come close.  But everyone has different reasons why those choices are bad ideas, some are practical, some are principle and sometimes the cost from a certain perspective is just too high.  Roth doesn't shy away from that, painting Silk as the kind of person who is forced to make the decisions he wants partially because of how he expects to be treated but partially because of what he wants for himself, his insistence to not be part of any group that would have him as a member, even if it means alienating his family, even if it means lying for the rest of his life.To that end Roth surrounds him, not just with an unusually eloquent Zuckerman (he seems affected quite deeply by his meeting with Silk and the events of the novel in general, sticking around not just for curiosity but a genuine desire to see the story through) but a round of characters that actually feel like people, starting with the women.  For once, Faunia Farley doesn't generate complete eye rolling beyond her initial appearance, when Silk takes up with the rather uneducated apparently illiterate campus worker, but Roth's portrayal of her is actually rather sensitive as the novel takes pains to point out that uneducated doesn't always mean stupid,  The relationship between her and Silk never falls completely into the vein of ""let's make a didactic point kids!"" and instead operates more like two adults who are enjoying having a sexual relationship.  Even Silk's nemesis Delphine Roux, the feminist professor he helps hire but now sees him as dead wood, could have been little more than a dress or pair of ladies' slacks covering a skeleton made entirely up on screeds (or worse, Roth's way at getting back at someone he knows) but in a few of her more involved scenes comes across as a person trying to do what she thinks is right because it's right even as she can't separate the personal history at play.  As others have mentioned, the only weak spot is Farley's Vietnam Vet husband, all PTSD and jealousy issues, existing mostly to ensure the plot does certain things that Roth needs it to do (even so, his last scene seems to convey the pain and loneliness of being trapped inside your own head with a war that hasn't quite ended yet).It all adds up to a more intense experience than you normally get from a Roth novel, which generally suffer from a bit of clinical detachment, and there's a fair number of scenes that showcase both Roth's eye for memorable interactions and his ability to make it count from an emotional standpoint (a slow dance between Silk and Zuckerman early on is probably the most notable).  Via Zuckerman, who for once isn't making it about him, it comes across as angry and despairing, infused with an grasping sense of loss and the people who are left behind to deal with it.  For once, instead of smacking us with an arch sense of a need to tell us about stuff that we'd never known was important to us, it feels weary and lived in, people fully wrestling with the weight of decisions made not just a long time ago but constantly and ongoing, decisions that can't be easily divided into good and bad but defined by the question: what will it take to stay alive?  In a century where people were hemmed into alleys that could only lead to one place at the end of which was a grinder stained with the hopes and dreams of everyone who came before you.  In the wake of it, all you can do is decide how to stick around for the next day, whatever it takes, and if some good comes out of that by some miracle, you can always claim later it was all meant to be part of the plan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J8RPFAQGGGMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375726349#wasThisHelpful","R2J8RPFAQGGGMK","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one often gets the ""Roth's best novel"" tag (he has a few that vie for the honor, though I don't think anyone has ever come near anything resembling a consensus) since it's about America, especially 1960s and beyond America (when it all got real), and it won the Pulitzer Prize, among other prizes, which generally means that a lot of people who read important books thought it was pretty good as well.  Out of all his Zuckerman novels, it's one of the few I can read without cringing at some point over some ridiculous plot point or characterization, and it's definitely one of the few I can read without being aware of the scaffolding involved in making it as meta-construction of a story (despite it actually being so).  It's shocking in a way that seems realistic and when people react to events they tend to react like real people and not people acting out complicated literary metaphors meant as a commentary on society today (even if they really are).  In a lot of ways the elements here are all elements that we're seen in his other novels, maybe put together a little differently or given a new spin with age and experience, but he's not really going over fresh ground here except maybe from an altered angle.What seems to make this one different for me is the sense of compassion.Most Roth novels that I've read so far seem to have a kind of contempt for the main character in some respect, not only acknowledging that he's not perfect but seeming to take delight in his flaws and how he hangs himself with his own rope regardless of how right or wrong he might be.  It can make for a blistering reading experience because when the author doesn't feel any kind of sympathy for his character he can take the character that might not be as possible if he felt even just a little bit bad at making what could be an otherwise normal person appear as a raging genius idiot.  It's a sense that comes through often in his narratives, especially in the later period novels when events may or may not have been drawn more from personal experience.Yet, here the feel is different, though not at first.  We get Nathan Zuckerman again running into a story that could be told only to him while attending his high school reunion and reminiscing about an old classmate who was beloved and seemed like the most perfect person in the world: Swede Levov, an amazing athlete who eventually took over his father's world famous glove manufacturing operation.  The memory of an encounter several years before with Swede leads to questions at the reunion, most of which are answered by the Swede's brother.  The answers to those questions involve learning what terrible things happened to the Swede, mostly caused by his daughter doing something rather unfortunate, and Zuckerman decides to do his best to figure out where it all went wrong.A lot of this has the skeleton of books like ""I Married a Communist"" where an absent protagonist only appears in flashbacks and is described at great length by his brother as a real standup guy who is unfortunately unable to deal with the cruelties of life and thus ill-prepared is beaten down by them.  But Roth takes a slightly different tactic here, instead letting Zuckerman's imaginings of what happened exactly to the Swede serve as the real narrative, making us wonder how much of this is based in fictional fact and how much of this is Zuckerman interpreting this through his own filter.What it leads to is perhaps the best evocation of the fifties sliding into the mess that was the sixties as witnessed by someone doing their best to stay the heck out of the sixties.  People looking at it as a critique on the counterculture and the anti-war movement are probably barking up the wrong tree.  As brutal (and brutally funny sometimes) as the conversations between the Swede and his very trying daughter Merry are, Merry is ultimately a very one-note character, existing purely to move the plot along with some shock value or subject us to a barrage of anti-war protests taken to a ridiculous extreme.  Where the book succeeds best is spelled out in the beginning scenes with Zuckerman remembering his old high school and the times that he grew up in, where the book attempts a hard look at nostalgia, not just in general but a very specific kind and for a very specific era of the country.  It harkens back to a time that felt different from everything that came after it, and the grasping need to recreate that time in both form and memory, and in some respect delineate the surprise that occurs when people look around thirty years later and realize things have changed, only to wonder ""how did this all happen.""  And it's a form of nostalgia, not just for a childhood, but for the feel of a time and place that can never return, when the decades of American history felt like actual decades that could be separated out in look and feel.  Nowadays it becomes more difficult to tell the decades apart, especially as we move further into the twenty-first century, and most of our nostalgia centers around technology (""Look how big phones were!"" despite cell phones today being bigger than my cell phone was in the nineties) or television shows/movies (which is fine, too, because everyone keeps remaking them for us).  Here there's a longing for an attitude and a texture that no longer exists, and maybe never did, but once departed can never quite be returned.We get that in the Swede, in his grasping for what he calls the ""american pastoral"", the steady successful job, the nice house, being surrounded by family.  And Roth seems to criticize it in suggesting that the only way the Swede can achieve all of it is by letting himself passively fall through the decades (which is how he ultimately loses control) but at the same time evoking a sense of sympathy for him.  The Swede isn't a bad person in what he wants, what makes him ultimately a failure is a failure to understand what's happening around him and how to react to it.  Instead of moving with the times and adjusting himself to it, he tries to plant his foot firmly in place, to let his vision narrow until the only thing he can see are the gloves that he has his workers so painstakingly make day in and day out, not even noticing the events flaring up all around until he has no choice.  He desperately attempts to cling to what he finds important and even while other characters might find him pathetic, there's a certain nobility to it as well, which is a rare feeling in a Roth novel, a nobility in the attempt and a nobility in how he fails to recognize how doomed to failure he is.  But he always comes across as honest in his intentions, and there's a touching persistence in how he tries to hold it all together, not because he wants to maintain some kind of delusion, but because he honestly things that what he holds dear is the pinnacle of life, even if he can't go far enough to restore what he loses.In that sense, it's telling that as the novel proceeds the relationship between the Swede and his daughter becomes less important as the gradual stripping away of all the things he used to find important, leaving him with the realization that perhaps he doesn't understand people at all, and that holding things close only leaves you clinging to the tatters as the years make short work of it all.  Some people don't seem thrilled that the novel doesn't really have a resolution of sorts, but it only ends because it has to end somewhere (and since we've already had a death, it's technically ending even before it starts).  We don't go back to Zuckerman, and for once Roth doesn't let his favorite narrator get the last word, except maybe in an oblique sense.  Instead we get the adage of ""life isn't fair"", both as question and statement, asking us perhaps if as shallow and terrible people we deserve what we get, and then saying that even if we weren't awful people this would happen to us anyway because life doesn't care.  The bleakness of that optimism strikes me as typical Roth, both begging and railing, but gives this one a different feel is that instead of coldly looking downward on his characters and their sufferings (much of which are due to their own actions), just for once there's a sliver of a sense that despite the downfall of the Swede, Roth doesn't quite believe he deserved it a hundred percent.  And it's that tiny fraction of light that's the difference between remembering how the days used to be, with warmth and acknowledgment of that impassable distance between, and standing in a museum of days gone by, convinced that you never left because you're unable to tell the difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G3OMMPVFFL3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375701427#wasThisHelpful","R3G3OMMPVFFL3I","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a song from the Beautiful South called ""Song for Whoever"" where the singer discusses how the women he dates wind up giving him material for his hit songs (prefiguring a certain country-pop crossover superstar, I suppose), eventually reporting with no small amount of glee that ""the number one I hope to reap depends upon the tears you weep so cry, lover, cry . . .""  It's an interesting, if humorous, dissection of how we mine our lives for tragedy and use those moments to craft other moments that people can relate to.  And if in that process we move lots of units, then hey, it'd sure be a shame to let that money go to waste.If Philip Roth wasn't such a extraordinarily good writer of prose, I'd be more suspicious of the games he seems to like to play with the reader, dangling bits of what could be elements taken from his personal life, often given a salacious spin, and seeming to suggest with a wink that he could be discussing himself in a thinly veiled fashion but maybe it's all made up or maybe it's satire or maybe you're just reading too much into it you gossip seeking reprobate.  He seems to like dancing on that very treacherous intersection between reality and fictional and analyzing not only the places where they overlap but our reactions to the overlap and how it colors our perception of the work (and by extension, the author).This one is a bit stickier to dissect.  Most of the time I try to stay away from the broader context of novels until after I read them, that way details which may not be completely relevant to reading the novel get mixed in with my first impressions.  But it's hard to avoid the wider context in this case.  Some time before this novel was published Roth's ex-wife Claire Bloom published a memoir which detailed, among other things, what it was like to live with one of the most famous writers in America at the time.  And the answer, alas, was ""not much fun"" as she apparently laid bare a whole host of pettiness and foibles that seemed to eventually wreck their marriage and depict Roth as less than a stellar human being.  One can't imagine any person, even one with a thick skin and used to personal attacks, justified or otherwise, taking such an act very well.  Thus, depending on how you want to read the novel, this may be a somewhat veiled rebuttal, part ""You didn't get the whole story"" and part Marvin Gaye's ""Here, My Dear"" as the character Eve Frame shares more than a few similarities with his ex-wife, especially in Roth's interpretation of her relationship with her adult daughter from a previous relationship.  They don't jump at your in an obvious fashion except that the narrator's criticisms of them are so specific and unrelenting and sometimes mean-spirited that you start to get an uneasy feeling, like a joke that's gone further than it intended and is trending toward the offensive.To his credit, though, Roth doesn't craft an entire novel around a polemic about his ex-wife, choosing to set the novel as a weird sort of nested series of flashback.  Roth standby Nathan Zuckerman runs into his extremely old former teacher Murray Ringold and as the two of them start reminiscing, Murray recounts the story of his brother Ira, who was a famous performer before the Communist hunts took over America and ruined his life, especially after his wife published a book about he was nothing but a redder than red Commie.  Thus the book consists of Murray's detailed narrations, interspersed with Zuckerman's own recollections of when he met Ira as a youngster, so that the plot basically boils down to two people telling parallel stories to fill in their own blanks.  It's interesting but the constant reminder that everything is a flashback makes the whole affair feel rather flat at times.  Because it's all happened already there's really nothing at stake and so you're reading basically to find out all the dirty details which will mostly be revealed in time.In this case it has to come down to the characters and their ideas.  And in this instance Roth sort of falls short.  He depicts the time quite nicely, evoking a sense of what America was like in the 1950s when people started to see Communists under nearly every rock, and what it was like to be a Communist in those days (apparently it was like being married to Roth, not a whole lot of fun).  We watch the rise and fall of Ira as he's shaped by the twin collections of his brother and Zuckerman and while the narrative doesn't shy away from his imperfections, there's also a bit of a saintly demeanor to him, a noble soul that is suffering unnecessarily and while I don't to draw parallels between Roth's desire to perhaps reclaim his dignity and this novel, it does feel a little self-serving in parts.  Even worse is the depiction of Eve Frame and her daughter, neither of whom come across as nice people (except for one scene when Zuckerman interacts with her daughter) instead seeming petty, vain and needy, especially when compared to the long-suffering Ira, who only wants to help the workers of the world.All of this would be okay if the book didn't subject you to the characters giving long political rants detailing their beliefs, especially the Ringold brothers, both of whom are ardent socialists and spend pages and pages at a stretch going over the same points again and again, ranting about America and Eisenhower and Nixon and the unions and the working class.  Perhaps it's meant to be a satire of how the extreme left-wing took themselves just a bit too seriously (there's several scenes of people being visibly annoyed as Ira goes off on yet another speech about the working class to anyone who will listen, willingly or otherwise) but it means you have giant blocks of text engaged in one sided political discourse and while I'm not completely unsympathetic, I've already read Ayn Rand novels so I think I've more than served my fair share of time weathering dialogue being used as a blunt hammer.It all makes for an interesting experience but not an especially memorable one except maybe in how weirdly personal it all seems.  The lack of any kind of narrative tension deflates any momentum and while I like seeing hypocrites being punctured as much as the next person, the people involved are such caricatures that you only get the kind of satisfaction that you probably would feel if you had written the whole thing yourself.  As an evocation of the times it's probably a better candidate than ""Happy Days"" was but unlike the show the book never learned the lesson that people are more inclined to listen to you if you loosen up and have a sense of humor once in a while.  The one moment the personal and the political come together is, sadly, the end sequence, where Roth's prose takes on an effortless grace that is sublime to watch (and most writers would kill for) and only makes you wish the rest of the book had that kind of elegiac delicacy.  I give Roth credit for allegedly managing to blow off some steam and get paid for it in the process but he would have been better off if he had just separated the plot of Ira Ringold into a separate novel and written an essay called ""Everything My Ex-Wife Says is Wrong"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2TJZNOO1DCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375707212#wasThisHelpful","RW2TJZNOO1DCB","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ooh, this one is . . . uncomfortable.  Roth has teasingly drawn from his life before, and or at least seems to be in a constant game with the reader daring them to figure out how much of what he is writing is autobiographical and how much is simply an informed and exaggerated variation (a game that can admittedly get tiring after a while for people who want to read a story and not pay the author to subject us to a detailed psychological examination of his flaws, or lack thereof) but this one gets fairly intense when you realize that several of the events in the book mirror things that happened to him during his first marriage.  I'm not sure if that classifies the novel as a exorcism of sorts, or a bizarre form of revenge therapy or just a cold-hearted ""boy this will sure move numbers"" attitude but it does, like it or not, cast a different shade on the work, which has a different feel than most of his other novels in that vein.  Not personal but more . . . to the bone?  Like when you're kidding around with friends and then somehow crosses a line that nobody really knew existed and then suddenly the joking around gets deadly serious.  It feels like that.But not at first.  At first it feels like one of Roth's innumerable games where Nathan Zuckerman stands in for whatever aspect of his life he's cleverly attempting to convince us he's fictionalizing.  Only he takes it one step further this time, giving us two stories about Zuckerman but written by another author, Peter Tarnopol.  The two Zuckerman stories are variations on a theme, where poor Zuckerman gets trapped into two different relationships, the second of which seems to be at the hands of an honestly crazy person.  That's the first section ""Useful Fictions"" and when that gives way, we move into ""My True Story"" which is supposed to be Tarnopol telling us the story of his disastrous marriage and even more disastrous separation (and failure to divorce) his wife Maureen.Tarnopol is basically another version of Roth's first person narrators, in the vein of Alexander Portnoy (or Zuckerman himself), erudite, a sometimes adversarial relationship with his family, and very complicated relationships with women, most of whom seem like absolutely nutty people in the eyes of said narrator.  Jumping back and forth in time, Tarnopol relays to us both how he meets Maureen and gets tricked into marrying her (apparently similar to how Roth married his first wife) and the women he meets subsequent to leaving her even as she refuses to divorce him, much of which causes Tarnopol no end of stress.  A lot of the novel, much like ""Portnoy's Complaint"" is given to us from the psychiatrist's couch, although unlike that novel the doctor is allowed to get a word in edgewise.  It covers much of the same ground, infidelity, relationships, the intertwining of the artist and his life, and a lot of it comes across as so ridiculous at times that it could almost be funny.Except . . . it's not.  Maybe Roth has dug so far down here that the only thing coming up is the thickest of black crude but as a whole the novel feels far more savage than his other works.  Most of this comes from the utterly toxic relationship between Peter and Maureen, who have passed from nitro and glycerin to something new and far more dangerous.  Maureen seems to be actively psychotic (an early scene where she tearfully lambastes Tarnopol for answering a question about how his editor is with the editor at his publisher instead of her tells you a lot of what you're in for), spending most of the time saying crazy things or lying or manipulating, acting like a time bomb that keeps resetting itself every time it goes off.  It's harrowing watching the two of them go at it, even more so as the marriage winds towards its inevitable end and matters get ramped up to a degree that is actively unsettling.  It's riveting but with both characters fairly unpleasant it's probably a fair question to ask why we need to subject ourselves to it.And it is a valid question.  Stripped of the voyeuristic aspect of wondering just how much of this was reflected in Roth's own life, you're left with a narrator who is a hysterical coward, getting pushed into situations that no rational person would see themselves getting into and then twisting himself into psychological knots attempting to justify both his reasons for staying and going.  To Roth's credit, all of the other characters seem more than capable of calling Tarnopol out on his crap, but it's cringeworthy watching him make one bad decision after another even as people warn him of the consequences of his bad decisions.  The fact that Maureen is an unrelenting lunatic gives you an upclose look at what it's like to live with an actual madwoman but it also slants the book so much that it's hard to feel any sympathy for Tarnopol to any degree beyond basic human decency about not wanting to see a guy get screwed constantly.  She's so terrifying that you want to feel bad but when he ignores good advice to stay with her anyway after a while you stop being sorry for him and wonder who's going to bleed first (it's sort of a tie).Saying the book is narratively biased is probably putting it mildly.  To that end that book feels less like a story than a nightmare Roth is trying to wake himself up from.  With most of the women stripped of their nuances (lover Susan is inactive to the point of being a paperweight, passive beyond sanity and another damaged case, although one can suppose she's in good company) and Tarnopol surrounded by people smarter than he is despite his inability to recognize that, you wind up marveling more at the car wreck aspects of it than any kind of emotional investment in the story itself.  It's brutal and uncomfortable to read, though probably not half as much as it was to experience it in real life, but the more you find out how much of it was based in reality (I didn't know until after I read the book), the more you start to wonder if this is another example of Roth playing a clever game to blur the line between life and art and fiction, or just a way for him to present the evidence and say, ""Look, see, none of this was my fault . . . what else could I do, she was crazy!""  Drawing from all aspects of the real world is an admirable trait of any writer but here at points it feels more like Roth had decided what he wanted to do, and then wrote a book to try and justify it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30011B30746DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067974827X#wasThisHelpful","R30011B30746DF","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of baseball basically due to marriage, as my spouse is a near lifelong fan of the local pinstriped team and as such my shelf of ""stories about baseball"" consists of Michael Bishop's ""Brittle Innings"" and, er, this one (I do have the ""The Natural"" around somewhere and that odd Robert Coover novel, which I'm not sure is really ""about"" baseball, per se).  I find all the various number crunching aspects of the game fascinating in an academic sort of way and while I haven't been able to sit through an entire nine innings yet, if they somehow compressed the game to a nicely succinct five innings or so, it would be just about perfect (though thanks to the magic of extra innings, it's theoretically possible to play a game that just never ends, which can be a version of heaven or hell depending on your perspective).With that said, Philip Roth would be among the last people I would expect to write an entire satirical novel about the sport of baseball, and make it actually entertaining.  Out of all his books I've read so far, this one feels by far the most relaxed, the one where he really lets his hair down and just has fun with the concept to see how goofy and ridiculous he can make it.  While he's written novels that are funny, most of the fun and games seem to exist in service to a larger point he's trying to make, or wrapped in so many layers of symbolic irony that you don't even lose sight of the fact that Important Things Are Being Said.  Here, he writes scenes where midgets try to kill each other on a baseball diamond and you can almost hear him giggling to himself as the scene plays out.The novel is structured as the story of the third American baseball league, the Patriot League, which according to the narrator was wiped from existence and history by the US after it was revealed that Communists were behind the whole thing.  The narrator is sportswriter Word ""Smitty"" Smith and if you can power past the first fifty pages or so of the novel where Smitty basically engages in a degree of alliteration that would characterize a very specific form of Tourettes the rest is fairly smooth sailing.  And by ""smooth sailing"" I mean absolutely absurd.  What Roth does here is take pretty much every cliche that had been seen to date in baseball stories and films and blow them up to the point where they seem like living cartoons.  He gives us players that go beyond athletic into god-like, and a rivalry between a pitcher and an umpire that runs the risks of turning into a hysterically brutal ""Tom and Jerry"" short.  He takes every situation and puffs it up to the breaking point of insane, and then plays it all perfectly straight so that even the people on the outside are staring at the mess going, ""What the heck?""Breaking the novel up into digestible sections, with each one telling its own story even as it incrementally furthers the main plot in some fashion, gives the book the feeling of linked short stories and probably works better than if he had tried to tell the whole thing straight through (the sections are generally just long enough not to overstay their welcome).  The plot, such as it is, takes off when he focuses on the Ruppert Mundys, the only team that has permanent away team status due to their field being commandeered by the US military during World War Two.  He gives us a band of motley players that consists of teenagers and drunkards and dwarves and the handicapped, all of which seem to be drawn from real life (better baseball historian than I can probably have a grand time playing ""spot the reference"") and exaggerated so that it all fits in with the weirdly circus like atmosphere.  Bizarre event stacks up on bizarre event and if you're the kind of person who would marvel at the number of strange configurations between these people that Roth pulls out of his rear over and over again, this book will seem like one of those neverending games played on a summer night just as the sun goes down, oddly magical and charming.  However, it's also quite possible that none of this will seem realistic at all and you'll heave the book away in frustration, wanting an actual human character to at some point appear.Still, he gives his characters some semblance of dignity.  The quiet calm of midget Bob Yamm (hired as a pinch hitter because being so small, his strike zone is almost impossible to hit and thus he's almost automatically walked every time) contrasted with the sheer anger of his other midget rival feels like an island of realism in the midst of all the insanity, much like the frustration of Roland Agni, the best player on the worst team trying to get traded to a team that might actually win a game and being told repeatedly that he has to stay put for the good of the nation.  The sense of real people trapped in a warped funhouse and forced to play with people who are revel in the craziness works better than it has any right to and its almost a shame that Roth has to nod toward an actual plot eventually, bringing in the aforementioned Communists (and Jews, just for good measure) and a vast conspiracy to undermine the American Way via our most patriotic of sports.If he can't quite bring it home, I don't think he ever really seriously intended to.  While the satire looms large (calling a novel about baseball ""The Great American Novel"" is sarcastic in itself) in both our mythologizing of the sport and its players, as well as the inflated concerns of the American people that circa the 40s and 50s that there were Communists lurking under every rock and tree (here turning out to be hilariously true), it feels like Roth includes those concerns because he has to and his real reason for writing this was just to have an excuse to screw around with a sport he has some fondness for and see how wacky he can be (the answer: pretty darn wacky).  As such there's really no other Roth novel like it (it seems to be sort of a hidden gem in his catalog, not really discussed with high praise or low scorn) and a nice look at what happens when a Famous and Important Author decides to cut loose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E2U4R7YFZBEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679749063#wasThisHelpful","R3E2U4R7YFZBEV","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you ever wanted to imagine ""50 Shades of Grey"" but from a Jewish perspective, this may be the closest you'll ever come.  Like that hit that has redefined the taste of the masses as ""much worse than we originally suspected"", it features a sexually explicit storyline featuring a person with substantial control freak tendencies, mundane taste in women and a really exotic taste for meat in ways that the butcher never anticipated.  Unlike that future classic, however, it's funny where it's actually meant to be.  It's the novel where Philip Roth basically makes his transformation into PHILIP ROTH, literary superstar, the fellow we know and love and are sometimes frustrated by, and the sheer notoriety of the novel would follow him for years until even he had to make fun of it via sort of stand-in Nathan Zuckerman and his delightful literary book about doing it, ""Carnovsky"".  Questions of ""how much of this did he make up"" would dog him for years, as if people couldn't comprehend that a guy whose job it is to make up things for a living wouldn't be able to figure out that certain things are universally funny, and are even funnier when you add a slab of liver to it.This is the kind of novel you're either going to be thoroughly engrossed and amused by, or are going to find it meanderingly obsessive and with so many personal details that even a reality TV star would be like ""Whoa, pal, TMI.""  It basically concerns one thing, and one thing only, and that is Alexander Portnoy, and his constant quest for sexual gratification, one that seems to touch every single aspect of his life, from his relationship with his family to women to Israel and the Jewish experience in America, one that seeks to touch it all over the place, touch it gently and touch it hard, sometimes even touching itself in the process.  It's told as one long stream of consciousness rant, ostensibly Portnoy telling all his worries to an extremely patient psychiatrist, who probably never thought that a simple question of ""Tell me what's troubling you"" would lead to a breaking dam of woes, spilling out one after the other and hardly in a linear fashion.  Portnoy details his life, growing up with his pleasant but overbearing parents, discovering that his sexual flowering is more like an algae bloom, sudden, rapid and before you know it, all over the place.  He tells us about the various girls he meets in the process as he wanders about searching for love and satisfaction, not necessarily in that order.Most of the subject matter here will seem familiar to anyone who has read even a little bit of Roth in his prime, especially if you're like me and bouncing around his career at random.  For the most part a lot of the things that become tropes in later novels start out there, so the shock of the new that greeted readers on its publications may not quite be there.  Still, there's a hilarious focus to this that the other novels seem to lack and the very thing that may turn off some readers (namely, Portnoy's constant complaining) is what gives the novel the edge.  Stripped of the winking smirks toward portions of his life and the almost reflexive need to go meta exactly when the book doesn't need it, this book comes across as exactly what it should be, one guy adrift in a sea of troubles of his own creation and not completely understanding how that happened, even as the recollections of bizarre events pile on top of each other like madly breeding pancakes.  Even with the familiarity of some of its concept, a lot of it comes off as new and fresh because of the sheer singlemindedness of the affair.And it helps that it's funny.  Roth would rarely be this funny again and a large part of that is how well he captures Portnoy's speaking voice as he monologues seemingly in one long sentence, this great rush of words that only gets more and more hilarious as you imagine him getting increasingly hysterical as recounting his life story only winds him up further, until you can almost hear the veins popping out of his neck as he strains to convey the sheer tortures that follow him around every day.  He pleads, he cajoles, he rails and rants and pities himself to such an absurd degree that it goes past narcissism into something far greater, like he becomes nothing but pure ego.  And when sex really enters the picture the book takes off completely into another stratosphere, featuring prose explicit enough to make a dominatrix blush, especially when his sexuality blossoms and he discovers the manly joys of self-gratification, proceeding to reenact the song ""Orgasm Addict"" to an insane degree, his narrative voice nearly rising to a screech as he attempts to express just how far he's willing to go, even to the realm that is nowadays probably relegated to weird fetish sites in dark corners of the Internet.The prose (and by definition, Portnoy's voice) is more than strong enough to carry it and it helps that Roth hardly pauses for breath when he gets going, allowing our narrator room to argue with himself, adore himself, berate himself, all the while presumably while his poor psychologist sits there and wonders if he should be doing something professional to stop this.  But he's as amused as the rest of us are.  Portnoy seems to possess some self-awareness of how obsessed he is but is unable to stop himself to any sane degree and given a captive audience, he spills everything in the same way he spills his seed, holding nothing back and not really caring what it stains in the process.  A novel for both the literary sophisticated thirty-five year old in me and the thirteen year old in me, he proves that James Joyce didn't steal all the good dirty jokes.  A lot of what transpires here will crop up again (and again and again) in other Roth novels in various configurations but this is where it all starts and probably the only time you'll ever see all the components assembled at once in an unstoppable force.  It's a kind of synergy that's hard to replicate, the kind that comes with a ""here goes nothing"" attitude and while he would go on to write novels that were considered better or more important, he never would write anything quite like that this.  But the genius of it, of course, is that you only need to do it once.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VHFCDUF7HQJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679756450#wasThisHelpful","R3VHFCDUF7HQJB","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having depicted your characters attempting to live day by day during the most involved conflict that the world thus far had ever known, where do you go from there?  Well, if you're Anthony Powell, apparently you veer headfirst into domestic drama against the setting of a post-war backdrop.  People get married who shouldn't get married, people cheat on their spouses, explore their sexual identities, hang out in fancy places.  And talk about books a lot, pretentiously if at all.  It feels like I'm among friends.To that end the last three novels in the, ah, twelvetet (?) are sometimes considered a bit of a letdown when compared to the first nine that comprise the beginning sequences.  The characters have become older and a bit more set in their ways and to some extent it feels like Powell is struggling to find interesting things for them to do that are within the realm of possibility (it's not like Widmerpool can become prime minister, as amazing as that would be).  The newer characters that are introduced are generally interesting but he doesn't seem to have as much of a handle on them as he did the original set and even that precise control slackens by the very end, where the plot dictates as much how people should act instead of letting their personalities guide us to the end.Part of the problem is that coming off the peak of World War Two, pretty much almost anything can feel like an encore, or at least an epilogue (mirroring no doubt how some soldiers felt returning home, after being a part of saving civilization as we know it, sitting at the table to the same pot roast every night for the rest of your life probably felt initially like an anticlimax of sorts . . . although not getting shot at constantly may be a fair trade-off) and coming back to your old life can feel a bit boring in comparison.  Having taken us through the boom years before the war and the war itself, he's got us in the much more austere 1950s, where conformity still has a stranglehold on culture and all the attempts to let loose and be free come across as very odd to all the old guys.  This is still rich fodder for a single novel, unfortunately trying to stretch that theme across three separate novels winds up pushing it and they suffer from a combination of spinning their wheels and a gradual sense of ""who cares?""Powell's prose and eye for characters hasn't quite lost a step, it's just that the subject matter doesn't quite live up to what's gone before.  In all honesty, the tone isn't that far off from the pre-war novels but there we had the shock of the new, getting to know these people, while here it's more a settling of accounts as people inevitably drop off for the great multi-part series in the sky, in a much more sedate setting.  When things get wild here, it feels more artificial, like he's trying to insert drama where it doesn't quite belong.As I said, the settings don't inspire much optimism.  The main plot of ""Books Do Furnish a Room"" centers around the attempts at publishing a literary magazine called ""Fission"", which Jenkins gets involved in with some other characters.  The hijinks as all the personalities collide isn't quite as exciting as all the dinner party escapades from earlier novels, and by the fortieth time Jenkins mentions Robert Burton you want to reach into the book and slap him.  He manages to get one decent character out of oddball writer Trapnel, who should come across as a collection of tics masquerading as a human being but manages to turn into an actual conflicted artist.  The main problem here is the focus on Pamela Widmerpool as someone we should care about.  She gets way too much time in this book, not only hamstringing the latent awesomeness that is Widmerpool (who becomes a member of Parliament here, of course) but dragging the book into soap opera territory by becoming a character straight out of ""Dynasty"".  Granted, she's supposed to be hot but she's so unrelentingly mean to every single person in striking distance not only does her marriage make little sense but you wonder why anyone even bothers with her.  She's just angry for no reason all the time and while she's certainly distinctive, it becomes rather tedious after a while watching people attempting to be polite to her before she snarls in their direction.  It does become hilarious how none of this fazes Jenkins, however.The drama ramps up toward the end, with Widmerpool and Trapnel and Pamela all circling each other, leading to some interesting setpieces but everything prior to that is drenched in Powell's silky smooth prose, it goes down nice and easy but leaves very little aftertaste to remember.By the time you get to ""Temporary Kings"" you can almost hear the steam coming out of Powell's ears as he endeavors to make any of this simmer above even a low boil.  Moving the action to Proust's narrator's favorite place, Venice, isn't exactly the ""what do ordinary blokes do in that time period"" feel we're hoping for, as Jenkins attends a literary convention that somehow manages to encompass almost every single person he's ever met that's still alive by this point.  More soap opera elements are introduced (spying! murder! infidelity! sometimes all at the same time!) but there are times when it feels like he's throwing things against the wall to see what sticks.  Very little does.  Again, some of the new characters find room to distinguish themselves from all the other genteel men we've encountered before but even when events start to pick up here comes Pamela Widmerpool again to do something cray-cray even as another male foolishly throws himself at her despite the fact that even if she were twice as nice as the book portrays her she'd still be an utterly miserable person.  Her caustic presence basically neuters whatever benefit you might get from Widmerpool and whatever plot seems to be involving him doesn't seem to go much of anywhere at all.  Once again, things pick up toward the end, especially with a surprise appearance by local weird witch psychic person Mrs Erdleigh, who I always imagine as one of those strange ladies from ""A Wrinkle in Time"", but it's kind of too little too late and most of the juicy stuff is recounted to Jenkins by other people after the fact.  It does get bonus points for being set in a foreign city I've actually visited, however.By the time we reach the supposed finale of the last volume, ""Hearing Secret Harmonies"", it's more of a grand finally.  While the subtraction of Pamela Widmerpool should only improve matters, Powell decides to go completely off the rails here and have a countercultural cult figure heavily into the plot.  That would be weird enough but having Widmerpool join the cult is pretty much the last straw for hoping gentle satirical realism would win the day.  The character becomes nearly unrecognizable in this book, and while you can suggest that part of that is because he's going out of his mind, it removes the one defining thing about him, that even though he's absolutely mediocre in every possible way, he succeeds through sheer singleminded willpower.  Meanwhile there's a sense of wrapping the loose ends up, as the few characters who are old enough to die generally get around to doing so while the younger ones gradually drift away.  As the plot begins to focus more and more on the cult (culminating in an interesting chain of events at a wedding) it starts to take on an air of ridiculousness and by the time we receive word of Widmerpool's final fate (fittingly, it basically closes out the novel), it almost seems like the character himself went ""the heck with this nonsense""and did the logical thing.  And thus it ends.That said, after three thousand (or close to) pages, is it all worth it?  To a good extent, yes, even if it doesn't show day to day life in the earlier part of the century as much as it seems to think it does (how often do you hang out in Venice?), the earlier novels especially are excellent at conveying the subtle shift of society into newer classes, as one way of life gives way to another.  The war novels are by and large both exciting and funny, and there are enough scattered decent moments among the final three books to remind you that Powell hasn't lost his talent, just misdirected it.  He gives us one of the strongest literary figures of all time in Widmerpool, a man sturdy enough to move both with and against the tide.  But Powell's style is so consistent that it all hangs together nicely and never becomes a slog.  With Proust (to compare one last time), it often felt like reading it was akin to engaging in an arm wrestling match with an opponent who didn't know how to tire.  Here, Powell guides you along and treats you nice and while he never achieves the emotional highs or lows that Proust manages, it's never less than engaging and you never forget that you're in the hands of a master.Still, there's an emotional distance to the proceedings that all the best prose and funniest scenes in the world can't overcome.  For all the hullabaloo of people living and dying and cheating and loving, ultimately Powell's decision to have Jenkins keep himself as merely the window through which we observe the series keeps you from really feeling the century or the passage of time through it.  By the time we reach the end we don't feel that we know him better than we did at the beginning and it never feels like he learned anything from all he's seen.  Instead he's had a front row seat for the antics of Widmerpool, a far more dynamic character and while it probably wouldn't have worked, you almost wish the book had been narrated by him.  In the end, it winds up being the view of a century and a vanished time as seen through glass that is perfectly clear and perfectly insulated: while there's nothing to obstruct the absolute clarity of the view, no matter how close you get to the barrier you never feel the heat being generated on the other side, or when the fire starts to go out and the chill starts to set in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OTXOIKVX85U6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226677184#wasThisHelpful","R3OTXOIKVX85U6","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's an interesting moment in the third novel of this particular segment of Powell's series where our fearless narrator, Nick Jenkins, not only extensively quotes from Proust but winds up visiting the seaside villa where Proust's narrator experiences quite a few knotted clauses.  Given how often the series is compared to Proust's magnum opus, it's either a sign of Powell having some fun with all the people who saw it as Proust clone, or his way of differentiating it from that other massive novel, putting the two prose styles against each other as if to say, ""See, we're nothing alike.""  It's an odd meta moment in a series that has been more or less realistic, if not a bit comically so.  Jenkins may have this odd knack of running into random friends in the most random places (""Here I am in some obscure French villa but . . . hey, I think I met that guy at a party one time!"") but this series is grounded more in a darkly sardonic sense of the absurd.  It's gentle mockery of a thing that I've probably never experienced, but fairly constant all the same.This book pretty much comprises a mini-series of sorts within the series itself, as Jenkins finds himself embroiled in the war effort, much like every other British citizen over the age of two.  To end that he winds up not on the front lines, which would probably have made this series at least four books shorter given the casualty rates in Europe, but basically on the homefront navigating the bizarre bureaucratic nightmare known as the military, where people seem to spend all their time scrambling around to get a whole lot of nothing done while convincing themselves everything is totally vital, once in a while reminding each other that people are off getting shot at somewhere.People who complained that the first six books in the series weren't so heavy on plot aren't going to be much more thrilled here, as all semblance of anything resembling a plot becomes almost jettisoned entirely, instead focusing on a variety of scenes from within the war effort, as Jenkins observes what changes war does to a person, dealing with both superiors and junior officers.  However, to me at least the first two books here are some of the best in the series thus far, as the war seems to be focus Powell's eye for observation to new degrees of sharpness, as well as allowing him to find a new balance between the comic and the tragic.  Rest assured, this isn't the despairingly black humor of ""Catch-22"" but more of a sense that everyone is trapped inside this big machine called The War and everyone is doing their tiny, tiny part that they're told is supposed to add up to victory even though all the news coming from the continent is telling them the exact opposite.  So they just shrug and plod on because what else can you do, really?  The fact that Powell makes this at all amusing is probably a testament to his skill at constructing characters and placing them in scenes that are comic without being overwhelmingly slapstick.This is probably best illustrated by maybe the best moment in the entire series: Blackhead.  An obscure civil servant who somehow manages to control the flow of pretty much everything with his stamp and a book of regulations, Jenkins gets exactly one scene with him that nails everything you need to know about the British military circa-1942, coming across as both terrifying realistic in its mundanity and hilarious in how true to life it rings.  We've all experienced a guy like this, mostly at the DMV, and the fact this guy who is in the book for probably less than twenty pages and I can only imagine as a surprising Philip Seymour Hoffman cameo in the movie version of this (in some alternate universe where he was still alive) is probably the most memorable thing about all three books shows how well Powell can sketch his scenes so meticulously.  Consider that I'm rating Blackhead this against such things as surprise suicides and at least two buildings being blown up with characters we know and it's high praise indeed.Fortunately, he's in the last book here (""The Military Philosophers"") so things don't peak too early.  Unfortunately, he's in the beginning of that book so the rest of that novel winds up being all downhill from there, especially as Powell's careful precision starts to overwhelm him with a parade of characters and scenes that don't stick as well as the characters we met in the books before this.  If anyone was to complain about the war books not being as good as the previous six, this would the one I'd agree with them on, as even the presence of the awe-inspiring tower of willpower that is Widmerpool can only do so much.  He elevates every scene he's in, to the point where you don't even care that the rest of the Core Four characters we started out with barely appear anymore.  A lot of this culminates in the book's second most memorable scene, as various characters come and go while everyone waits outside during a German rocket raid, showcasing the absurdity of life going on as normal even as death is raining down from the skies and could hit you at any moment.  But by the time Jenkins gets out of the military and into regular clothes, we're about ready to leave the war as well.  It's also gives Pamela Flitton more time to shine but while critics seem to praise her as a ""beautiful and dangerous"" presence, for the most part she's memorable because she's unrelentingly mean to everyone.Still, it's telling that the first book in this set ""Valley of Bones"", is so strong that it can hold off on the obligatory Widmerpool appearance until almost the very end and you don't even especially notice.  The characters are stronger this time out, as Jenkins has to deal with an entire unit of bankers who have suddenly become soldiers, and navigate the internal politics where the best he can say about the people around him is that one is incompetent and the other is a drunk.  This one definitely feels more episodic than the previous novels and as a result comes across as more even . . . there's a lot here going on that's entertaining as all heck but it lacks the undercurrent of dramatic heft that would underscore the best moments of the next two books (the best scene is probably someone falling in love with a barmaid, which just like in real life, ends poorly) and it's mostly a series of very dry, very witty observations on what it's like to be in the sanest part of a madhouse and realize these are the people who are going to save you from tyranny.  Stiff upper lip, indeed.""The Soldier's Art"" pretty much takes what was decent about the previous novel and ups the ante by adding the two things it was missing: more Widmerpool and a massive body count.  It continues the plotless trend already started but gives us more frustrated bureaucracy to chew on, as Widmerpool pretty much heaves himself through the military ranks based on sheer naked ambition (with Jenkins forced to work under him) and winds up sparring with the men in other departments, most of whom don't like him but have to admire the singleminded of his trajectory.  Meanwhile Powell starts to whittle down the supporting cast, almost mocking the series' tendency toward bald coincidence by having people Jenkins knows get caught in a rocket blast, not once but twice and fairly close together to boot.  It's still a startling moment and a good depiction of what the war was like for people on the homefront.  Sure, you didn't have to worry about a tank rolling over you but at any moment you could be minding your own business and then discover you had a front row seat to a bomb explosion.  It adds an edge to the series that was lacking previously, an air of menace that all the genteel hanging out at parties or offices couldn't quite manage.  Suddenly life isn't just a thing you drift through, gradually getting older and meeting all the people you knew in high school over and over again, but something you have to actively work to keep going, and even then the whims of fate could make it all for naught.  Add into all this an appearance by one of the increasingly rare Core Four (the idea that the series was going to follow these four young men throughout the century seems to be abandoned once and for all in this volume, if that was ever really a plan) and you can understand why people feel the series is all downhill from here.That's not completely true but it doesn't seem to ever achieve these peaks again.  Much like the rest of England, the war forces the books into a kind of hyper-focus, automatically elevating the mundane into something fascinating and making the quest to file the right paperwork every day a struggle for survival, where every stamp you put down on a requisition for underwear means you made through another day and if God and Queen prevail, and as long as people complain that they don't have enough crummy towels, you can exult in the majesty of life and lay your head down on the pillow each night satisfied that you have done your part.  It's war through the eyes of the office clerk and as its a perspective we so rarely see, it's worth it just for that glimpse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRN41YHSHJBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226677176#wasThisHelpful","R1BRN41YHSHJBW","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stories set just before WWII are almost automatically interesting, especially when the story is written some time after the events depicted, thus allowing the author to indulge in delightful bits of foreshadowing, giving the whole affair an atmosphere of impending doom the likes of which the characters simply cannot conceive.  It'd be like watching footage of a town going about its business right before a tornado hits.  You know something bad is going to happen and they're got a pretty decent idea that something bad is about to happen but beyond that feeling it's impossible to really put into words and as it turns out, words aren't quite adequate for the sensation of having not only your whole world upended but an entire way of life being swept away in the matter of a few years, never to return again.If you have any idea what this sensation is like, congratulations, you were probably a member of the British upper class in the waning days of when being rich was your ticket to printing your license to being absolutely awesome.  It's one thing to have an idea that you're better than other people, it's another to have God and circumstance prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that you are better than everyone else, except for your peers, who are pretty cool, too.  At least when they're not trying to steal your spouse or otherwise overshadow you.  But these are petty details, old bean.In the second movement comprising the next group of three novels that ultimately number to twelve, Powell continues to march his narrator Nick Jenkins through both society and those aforementioned pre-war years in merry olde England.  For the most part anyone who liked the style in the three novels is going to be just as amused here as Powell seemed to enter into the series fully-formed, there's very little sense of him finding his footing or getting used to a certain prose style.  While it's a little disappointing to not really see him striving for new heights or experimenting with the format slightly (except for a notable sequence in the sixth novel here, which we'll get to) there is something to be said for comforting consistency and anyone who reads this series is probably going to quickly discover whether it's worth their time to read all twelve books or not.Part of this is because Powell does make this look extraordinarily easy, using the narration to cleverly mask or wallpaper over what should be blatant plot-hammering coincidences (such as Jenkins being the 1930s English equivalent of Kevin Bacon, not only connected to but capable of running into pretty much anyone he's ever met ever at any random place he happens to be at, by the sixth time this happens in the course of a single novel you pretty much have to just roll with it) and allowing that smooth, gently comic voice to let the characters dart at each other as they find themselves ranting, arguing, agreeing, debating, pontificating about life and art and politics whenever the need arises, all the while letting Jenkins remain the detached commentator on the scene.Powell's gift for characterization and his ability to set a scene are the reasons to stick with this series beyond anything else.  Jenkins as a narrator remains likable but the insights come more from watching the characters go through their paces than anything he says or does in particular.  Once in a a while he gets a good line in (most of them involving that unstoppable plot-bending phenomenon known as Widmerpool) but he also continues to be frustratingly obtuse, hardly relaying any information to the reader about his personal life beyond what he tells other people (a personal tragedy is only commented on in dialogue and you'd even think the guy was married for all the scenes that exist with his wife), which means that the scenes themselves better sing or we're going to be in for a very boring three thousand page journey.But it delivers.  Novels like ""At Lady Molly's"" basically exist to continually feed us set pieces where the characters run into each other and have excuses to interact, but the initial party at Lady Molly's and the later encounters with the head of the Tolland family at their cottage all sparkle in how true to life they seem even when the scenes are structured for the maximum comic effect.  Powell has a gift for making some characters come across as both buffonish high comedy and realistic eccentrics (notably Errige Tolland) and their interactions only seek to liven up the story.  At the very least their scenes kill time until Jenkins inevitably runs into Widmerpool, who then proceeds to twist the novel without fail into a shape more pleasing to him, as if he has a certain gravity and thus the ability to warp all of space around him.  He's one of those characters that in a movie version would probably be played by Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Road"" era, not whatever acting muscles are required to play a Kryptonian general), and his rampant singlemindledness and inability to be kept down no matter what the situation is make you not care that Jenkins seems to run into him around every corner.Things start to get more serious with ""Casanova's Chinese Restaurant"", despite the goofy name.  The interweaving of flashbacks in a story that seems to be all flashback start to become more purposeful, as Jenkins runs back in time to give background details he missed the first time before roaming forward in his roughly linear fashion.  Not only are worldwide events heating up (the Spanish Civil War is often a topic of conversation) but the series starts to achieve something resembling a body count (inevitable in a series called ""A Dance to the Music of Time"" and ""Yay Everyone Lives Forever"") as at least one minor character bites it and another commits suicide, all the strayings and arguments beginning to take their toll on people as they leave each other for other lovers with an offhand casualness.  A standout scene set at the unveiling of a new symphony showcases Powell's ability to weave all the characters and themes together seamlessly, moving from comedy to drama to a darker kind of drama as one longtime character's drinking problem stops being so funny.  It never goes as dark as you might expect, hardly deviating from the lightly witty comic tone set by the earlier novels (if I've got one complaint about the series it's probably that it's like smooth jazz, it seeps into the brain nice and easy but never hits the real searing emotions that a story like this probably should) but Powell keeps events proceeding like a well oiled machine.""The Kindly Ones"" probably has the most surprises (mostly that it's not the pivotal Neil Gaiman arc in ""Sandman"" although both titles are referring to the same thing, i.e. the Furies of Greek mythology), especially in the opening sequence flashing back to British life and Jenkins' homelife just before WWI breaks out, giving us a day in the life before British society experiences its first seismic shift, and then proceeding to the rest of the novel in the days before society cracks open entirely and never becomes the same again.  There's a gentle daffyness to it but again, knowing what's going to happen later adds a weight to the events that the novel never has to explicitly state.  The onrush of the nearing war puts a thin coat on everything, putting a blinking but blurred sign in the background that proclaims ""This Is About to Get Real"", whether it's the sight of Widmerpool in an army uniform, the constant talk of whether Germany is going to invade Poland (and whether the non-aggression pact between Russia and Germany is a bad thing or not (hint: yes)), or Jenkins' attempts to get himself enlisted as an officer so he can do his part.The novel is bookended by two of the more remarkable scenes in the book, the aforementioned opening in the pre-WWI days (almost a short story in itself and showcasing Powell's ability to convey a history without delving into too much actual detail) and the closing scenes as Jenkins has to clean up after the death of a relative as war breaks out around him.  He runs into an old flame of an old flame, watches a man go through the throes of a drug addiction and even gets to mix it up with Widmerpool one last time before everything goes abruptly downhill.  That thematic weight winds up making the book thus far the most memorable the series, if only because they feel more attuned to history and about something more than simply watching people be mean to each other at parties.  The whole point of the series seems to be giving us a front-row seat to the gradual collapse of a way of life without the people in that way of life realizing what's happening but the start of the war is such a pivotal shift that it's like spending five books watching all the dominoes be set up so that everything descending into madness can knock them all down.  The question will remain who will still be standing when all the dust settles (my money is on Widmerpool, the legend that walks like a man) and it's that infusion of real history that quietly accelerates a series that is gently amusing but has been so deliberate in its laying out of what it's trying to say that you could start to wonder if the series was just going to smoothly skate over its own themes with all the grace of an expert but never let you get close enough to see the sweat forming on their brow.  I don't need Powell to show me the work but six novels in that strike different subtle variations of the same tone it's fair to wonder if we'd be in for six more novels of this before Jenkins calls it a day.  The ending of ""The Kindly Ones"" suggests both a shift and a focus and the fact that it comes at this moment is probably yet another sign of how precisely planned this whole enterprise is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W88B6KBD83PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226677168#wasThisHelpful","R2W88B6KBD83PW","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult to write about this series without mentioning Proust at some point, so I might as well get it out of the way now.  It's probably not a coincidence I'm reading this series not long after finishing a certain doorstop of a translated French novel, for one thing they stack really nicely together and if you're browsing in a well-stocked bookstore they're shelved conveniently near each other thanks to the last names being very similar.  It doesn't take long for the eye to wander from the shelf devouring Proust behemoths to the equally epic looking series of Powell novels and perhaps wondering, ""Which one should I read?""  And in case you're wondering if I'm overstating this slightly, at least two pull quotes from noted authors or critics on my edition of this volume distinctly compare it to Proust (implying that it's better, frankly, although Evelyn Waugh is kind of on record as not being that fond of Proust in the first place), so it's almost like they expect you to draw comparisons.  Geez, as if the fact that both works are gigantic as all heck isn't enough.Honestly, it's really two different experiences, not completely dissimilar but akin to standing outside of an aquarium and watching the fish go by instead of being utterly dunked inside the tank to let the whole ocean envelope you.  I'm early yet into Powell's epic but the almost suffocating thematic weight and laser-beam like focus on the internal crises of the narrator that distinguish Proust aren't quite on display here yet (let's remember that I'm only a quarter of the way through, it may be a bit of a slow burner).  The concepts of Time and mortality and memory and how we're the sum of the intersection of all those forces are felt more strongly in the Frenchman's work and despite the narrator's weirdly obsessive quest to prove that every woman in Paris is a lesbian, you come away from that work feeling like you know what makes him tick, even if some of that understanding just wants to make you slap him.  And that's going to be my last Proust/Powell comparison.  At least in this review, I can't make any promises for the future.Still, the pleasures here are much more immediate and go down far easier, eschewing sprawlingly complex sentence structures for ones that human beings can actually reach the end of in their lifetimes, but maintaining a vocabulary level that would make your high school English teacher weep with joy that you got to use all the words she taught you.  Powell has a smooth and easy style, along with a light touch that makes everything delightfully digestible and while some people label these as comic novels, it's not so much a comedic tone as delicately prodding, the narrator skipping over events with a refined and witty eye.  There's very few lines that made me laugh out loud and there's nothing explicitly harrowing here but there are moments when you can see the start of things that could go to very dark places later.What is it about, though?  Four lads that we first meet at school in the wake of World War One.  While all the adults are still properly shellshocked around them for experiencing what they'll consider for a little while the worst mankind has to offer, our narrator Jenkins and his three friends (or two friends and one sort of persistent hanger-on) navigate their way not just through the post WWI/pre-WWII years of British high society but also the thorny paths of becoming adults, with all the expectations and dreams colliding in ways that don't always work out.  And meeting girls.  Many, many girls.A couple things make the structure interesting, at least for people who wonder how someone can write what is essentially a three thousand page novel that doesn't quite bog down under its own weight or disappear up its own rear.  For one, Jenkins is clearly narrating the tale some years down the line, and often makes references to future events or that he won't see people for years at a time, which gives a sense of the scope of this affair.  It's not clear that we're actually leading up to anything other than ""My life is a series of lessons on how my friends refuse to make smart decisions) but it does helps reinforce the epic quality (even if it's more ""hey, we're at another party"" epic and not ""ancient knights and warlords"" epic), despite those events being decidedly mundane.  In true Dostoevsky fashion, the boys can be divided into their basic human elements, for those who like charting the vaguely satirical nature of their progress through life.  And the tone has that particular British melancholy that they might as well to bottle and sell in shops for pale, lonely boys who are true poets on the inside, with the narration leaping without warning into some lyrical insights, sometimes giving the impression that what is superimposed on the narrative are two overlapping concerns, a young man so in the moment that he can't ever imagine being old, and an old man desperately attempting to imagine what it was like to be young.But for the most part, the plot resides in a rambling and vaguely episodic series of events as Jenkins pilots his way through life somehow convinced that even though he's telling us the story we don't need to know anything about him except what he tells other people.  In true epic novel fashion, a good chunk of events are spent at parties and sometimes the book seems to be a chronicle of the incidences where Jenkins runs into people he knows over the years, no matter how coincidental it seems to be after a while (London's a small town after all, wot?).  There are points where you can't quite tell if he is stalking fellow former classmate Widmerpool (by far the novel's most finely sketched character) or vice versa, since they don't even seem to like each other that much.  He plunges through his life like the slow trickle of an ice water leak, drifting every so often back into the orbits of his former schoolmates, like checking in with old friends to see how successful they've been, or time has already started to ravage them.It would make for a very even reading experience, like a smooth drink that barely leaves behind any hint of a burning sensation, if not for the huge cast of characters that Powell creates to populate his fictional world.  Not only are there Jenkins' classmates but a quite varied assortment of characters, from old uncles to artists to Communists to old authors to women of dubious virtue, all of whom are delineated with a painter's eye and make the book come alive in a way that reading about the five hundredth high society party Jenkins attends and barely affects events can manage.  Even the characters that only appear for brief stretches liven the book up, whether it's Jenkins' uncle popping in like some sitcom guest star, or the strange lady who may or may not have psychic powers.  Powell's ability to cram these people in the novel and not have them fight each other for superiority, where they have space without sucking up all the oxygen, is a pretty remarkable feat and while I may have trouble remembering some of them come book twelve, it gives Powell an endless combination of scenarios to concoct, even if the basic setting is more or less the same (and despite some dips into a vaguely middle-class pool, we're hanging out in Gatsby territory here).  The only character that comes close to stealing every scene he's in is Widmerpool, whose intense focus on himself to the exclusion of all else makes him like a model for Ricky Gervais' character on ""The Office"", unaware of how ridiculous he comes across but utterly serious in his aims.  In fact, he probably wouldn't even care if he realized how he came across (there's a hilarious scene toward the end of the novel where he gives a completely inappropriate political speech and when someone has a stroke in the midst of it, seems more put out that he couldn't properly finish).It's those and other scenes (a Communist march where Jenkins witnesses an unexpected attendee is another standout) that surface throughout the novel that give us the feel of real life, the dry comedy that exists underneath the seriousness, or the desperation that sometimes underlies the comedy (you can almost see the horror in ""any girl that moves is fair game"" Templer's eyes as he tries not to contemplate what he'll be like in fifty years).  It may be a real life where you seemingly run into the same twenty people over and over again but it's that's dance the title of the series refers to, where you can lose yourself in the rhythm and flow of it, until somebody trips and you suddenly look around, still caught in the dance but suddenly very aware of how much everything can change, especially when you're not looking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PDB896QIJ6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226677141#wasThisHelpful","R19PDB896QIJ6J","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're going to base your entire premise on a narrative conceit, you might as well make it a good one.  The right experimental touch can take a fairly recognizable story and give it a resonance beyond the simple getting from point A to point B (alternatively, get too experimental and you can turn an otherwise coherent story into a complete mess) that is the general hallmark of fairly basic storytelling.Here, Amis tells us everything in reverse.  We emerge into the story as the body of Doctor Tod Friendly is coming back from dying and get remarkably better.  From there we watch his life wind in reverse, and the rest of the world with it, while a narrator inside his mind witnesses it all and gets rather confused at the sights he sees since they do make a consistent logical sense and yet, don't.  But he seems just along for the ride anyway.On some level this is Vonnegut's ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" (only without the nonlinearity, here things happen in a straight line, just backwards) crossed with ""Benjamin Button"" (he ages backwards but it's more like a film being rewound).  What's impressive is how committed Amis is to the premise, we see pretty much everything with a backwards eye, and the narrator constantly expresses wonder at how doctors seem to heal people, that people constantly get younger before being inserted back into their mother's bodies and disappearing, how couples always seem to meet by fighting and then grow much closer together before parting again.  There's not a huge amount of dialogue in the tale but he manages to make it coherent when read both forwards and backwards so it's not completely possible to shake the sense of dissonance even when you're going back to experience things properly.Much like ""Slaughterhouse-Five"", this means that cause and effect are often screwed up, one attributed to the other.  This becomes more marked as the book races toward its ultimate goal, the one event that Friendly is both racing away from and racing back toward.  It's a unique way to handle that particular topic and instead of coming across as a dilettante author dabbling with a weird narrative structure just to amuse himself it does become another way of looking, horror strewn about in reverse and somehow made better.  The narrator watches Tod flee backwards with decreasing guilt to his past and emerge from it with a sense of freedom, gaining innocence as he goes along.  The reversed world suddenly feeling normal.To Amis' credit the book doesn't read like a narrative told the wrong way round, it starts at a breakneck clip and never lets up, putting events together in such a way that a new logic emerges from the reversal so that a life told in this fashion makes perfect sense.  If he fails in any sense it's that we don't feel the horror and guilt of Tod as acutely as it seems we should, we don't feel the tragedy of his breakups with his lovers (or the women that are in addition to his lovers) and when we reach the defining events of his life, it's just another stop on the way toward the beginning.  Only as we reach that beginning does it reach a quiet sense of contemplation, and in that moment lifts it from being just another literary exercise, and becoming a new question of what matters more, what we have done or what we will do and how much that perspective can depend on which way you're looking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11EDMTF5NCLIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679735720#wasThisHelpful","R11EDMTF5NCLIX","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will give McCarthy credit for taking the time to warn readers about what kind of novel they're in for via the title.  ""All the Pretty Horses"" doesn't give you any kind of clue that it should have been titled, ""You'll Never Get Anything You Want, Cowboy"" but ""Blood Meridian"" pretty much tells you that nothing adorable is going to happen here.  Unless you find casual, brutal violence adorable, in which case, please don't even find out where I live.This one tends to get tagged as McCarthy's ""masterpiece"" even though you could probably say it's just another book of his where unpleasant things happen to people who sometimes ride horses.  But it sets itself apart in a couple different ways.  One is the tone, which comes across as ""apocalyptically ominous"" on nearly every page, and the more or less unrelenting brutal violence, told with a clear-eyed and rather dispassionate view.  It's probably safe to say that you won't read any other McCarthy book like it, although it isn't for everyone, that's for sure.Here, we follow the adventures of a nameless ""kid"" as he ventures through the West in the 1850s.  Having a proclivity for violence much like every single other person in the book, he has several misadventures that often result in death and/or destruction before hooking up with John Joel Glanton and his gang, whose sole purpose in life seems to be to gather as many Apache scalps as they can get their hands on.  Presumably it's for the money (the state has set up a bounty, probably not their finest moment) although it soon becomes clear that they really just enjoy killing things, wandering through the landscape more or less murdering every man, woman and child they come into contact with, not seeming to worry about the consequences or even asking, ""Is this really a good idea?""  But then, as pretty much everyone else is okay with murder all the time, maybe they're just trying to fit right in.To make matters worse, coming along for the ride is the abominable Judge Holden, a massive hairless man with all the morals of someone who doesn't have any morals, who kills children as easily as you or I crack open eggs for breakfast, and might be a personification of pure violence, albeit one that likes to dance naked.  But who doesn't?If this succeeds at all, it's pretty much because of the strength of the atmosphere that McCarthy sets up and his commitment to depicting utter depravity in all its forms.  His prose had a loose eloquence to it earlier (the run on sentences that set apart ""All the Pretty Horses"") but here he's definitely sharpened his game and from the very beginning the prose sets a mood of Biblical doom that doesn't let up.  Spare in all its detail and odd in its sentence construction at times, on some level it's like another main character, pulling you along and immersing you in a landscape that should be a nightmare, except the blood splatters shouldn't stain quite this much in a dream.  He captures the charred open spaces and the smaller places where men become so close the violence they do to each other is a strange form of intimacy, brought on by promises and whispers.Into that the judge and Glanton fit into the landscape more than the kid ever does, and it's probably not surprising that as the novel winds on the two of them take center stage by sheer force of personality, Glanton acting as the steady center of the chaos that can't hold forever, and the judge doing something abhorrently riveting pretty much every time he appears.  They act as the rotted beating heart of this whole enterprise, unshakeable in how pure they are in their devotion to Doing Bad Things.And it's the Bad Things that will probably scare off some readers.  For one, there's barely anyone to admire in this book.  The judge and Glanton and mostly everyone else in the gang are human monsters and while the kid is slightly better, it's like saying that an amputation is better than a disemboweling.  These are not pleasant people and the landscape they inhabit mirrors them.  There's very little nobility here, very few redeeming qualities in anyone or anything.  The Indians are no better than the Americans and in that sense the book mostly erases all racial lines, leaving two groups of people: those doing the violence and those having the violence done to them.  And it's very easy to cross from one to the other.  As they ride through the land they cause or encounter one act of violence after another until it becomes nearly numbing.  By the fourth time you see a corpse hanging from a tree it stops being shocking and starts becoming wallpaper, and for those people who manage to withstand the first few times they may wonder if the book is just a litany of awful things that can happen when everyone abandons morality like we abandon heavy coats in the summer.It all combines to exert a kind of drawing power, probably due to the combination of prose and characters, probably due to its commitment to singlemindedly depicting the worst in humanity.  McCarthy leaves much open to interpretation (including the ultimate fates of some characters, which people might find frustrating although if you're not used to ambiguity in a McCarthy novel then you must be new around here) giving an elusive air to any attempt to search for true meaning in all this, as much as that rewards rereading.  It's too simplistic to say that it's merely concerned with showing various degrees of violence, that it spends three hundred some odd pages telling us that deep down inside, we're all bad, awful people with a boundless capacity for slaughter.  There's very little light at the end of the tunnel here and no attempt to turn it back toward the reader as aggressive revelation, taunting then with ""This is what we're like.  You think you're better than this?""  You're going to have to find that notion within yourself, ultimately.  There's no uplift here, no descent even, just a burned and bitter landscape that seems to extend forever, forward and behind and sideways, far out of view and beyond, suggesting that there's room for all of us inside.  And if you've escaped past the borders touched by the elongated dancing shadows, and gone elsewhere, then it's quite possible you've pulled off the hardest trick of all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZN5WNLYPH885/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679728759#wasThisHelpful","R2ZN5WNLYPH885","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's probably a segment of people who wonder why attempting to tell a fairly straightforward story in the most complicated way possible is in any way beneficial to actually getting people to read your book or achieve some kind of clarity in what you're attempting to do.  There will always be people who will read intentionally ""difficult"" books for the pure challenge of it, or just to say that they were able to finish it but if you start treating books like a decathlon, some feat of endurance meant to be conquered, that's not quite what reading is about, is it?The important question I suppose to ask is whether you could have told a particular story in a different and still be able to capture all the nuances and resonances, or if someone is just being arty for the sake of being arty.  There's something to be said for ambition, but if you're just dressing up fragile bones in opulent clothing, that's not exactly high praise, is it now?Suffice to say, I don't know how else Gass could have told this story.  He hasn't written many novels and none of them seem very easy to digest (""The Tunnel"" is apparently even more difficult and I suspect I'll be getting to it sooner than I think).  This one, oddly enough, seems the most straightforward.  Set in a Ohio town circa the 1890s, it tells about the arrival of the Omensetter family, the head of which seems to have amazing luck that pretty much keeps him from worrying about anything ever.  So he doesn't.  The family lives in town and seems to be doing okay, but his presence is a constant source of friction against the good Christian values of the local preacher, Reverend Furber, who starts to wonder if he can do something about all of this.It's a novel both direct and elusive, told in impressionistic layers and winding streams of shifting text.  The first two sections barely have anything to do with the main plot of the novel, featuring different points of the story told during and after the fact from the point of view of two other townspeople, both of which seem steeped in a kind of inevitable sadness, both for what did happen and what was about to happen.  Gass captures the scenes in flittering streams of consciousness, concerned not with what we say to each other but with what we say to ourselves, or what we want to say to other people when we can't express the words.  Concerned with the mundane rhythms of the texture of the life of the times, it focuses on the inner dissolutions as people seem content to unravel, aware that they're falling apart but unable to do anything but fall apart (Henry Pimber's final sections have an unrelenting ache about them, like being told you're going to die instead of someone else purely because of a coin toss and there's nothing you can do about it).But if the novel consisted of only those sections it might be remembered as an interesting experiment with some rather startling prose.  As it turns out, those sections are merely warmups for Reverend Furber's sequence.  Taking up the last chunk of the novel and longer than both previous sections combined, it takes us directly into the mind of the good preacher, probably closer than any of us would like.  Taking its influences from the Joycean school of stream of consciousness (in which we have every thought we're ever going to have all at the same time) and pushing it toward stuttering extremes, we get the story of Furber without ever having been told anything directly, as his thoughts flutter and strut and wallow and wail, trying to hold the thoughts of God and the decadence of his desires together simultaneously, and at times failing to do either.  He sings dirty songs, curses out his fellow man, has grandiose plans for what kind of preacher he could be and as the sequence goes on it becomes quite clear that the presence of Omensetter and his amazing luck is slowly causing him to lose his mind.  He gives sermons (or thinks about sermons) that sound increasingly unhinged, even as they inadvertently dive into passages of great beauty (the section where mundane activities are listed with a repeated chorus of ""For this?"" are scathing in their sarcasm and howling dismay, a sequence that Gass seems justly proud of).  He tries to turn the whole town against Omensetter, as if engaging in a contest that nobody asked for, with consequences nobody can predict.Yet if the novel was just about Preacher Looney McCrazy and his journey into everyone figuring out that he's nutty it would just be a stylistic exercise in figuring out how many ways to express dirty thoughts.  Or if it turned into a standard confrontation between two opposing poles of faith it would be dramatic for all the wrong reasons.  Instead Gass focuses on why we do things, and how it fits into the world around us, and how both can affect each other in ways they don't expect.  Using the homeostasis of a somewhat isolated village and the introduction of an unexpected element, he puts it in a bottle where good and evil can percolate and be examined more easily, where each piece becomes central to the whole.  While Furber's section casts a long shadow, without the light thrown off by the first two sequences, it wouldn't make any kind of impression at all.  We need the slide as a buffer instead of the direct plunge.  And yet despite the inclination toward the downward slide, the seeming rush toward a degraded bottom, ultimately Gass becomes more interested in redemption.  Someone dies, yes, but someone always dies.  He could have ended the story in a flailing of glorious crazy but opts for the quieter and more difficult ending instead, the one where nothing really gets resolved but the ones who remain make the decision to become better, not simply because being a better person means more people like you but because you become aware that nobody is in this alone and what we do affects not just ourselves but the world we live in, a village or a country or a planet.  The shells of our bodies hide the chaos colliding in our brains but we're able to express in ways that can change how others feel, and they in turn.  The fact that we're able to do that is a kind of luck in itself, although whether it's good or bad ultimately remains to be seen.  I think in the long run, it skews toward the former, but that's just me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPR3Q91P9186S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141180102#wasThisHelpful","RPR3Q91P9186S","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cowboy quest stories leavened with a heaping slice of existential despair embodied by the seeping knowledge that the way of life as you know it is disintegrating as you live it?  Sign me up for the drive!I don't get the sense that McCarthy wanted to write a cowboy story (or stories) as much as write a long dissertation on why there's no way to write a cowboy story anymore.  Or at least why he's not going to write one.  A lot of the elements are present, men in hats, guns, the windswept scenery, bandits and wolves and horses but it's like someone put them together in the wrong order, resulting in something horribly downbeat, a series of ingredients left out for far too long and already starting to show signs of decay.  It can make for immersive reading and at times even gripping reading, but it's not exactly feel-good stuff.This compact hardcover brings together three of his more famous novels, one of which was turned into a movie.  There aren't so much a trilogy as connected thematically, with the main characters of the first two books joining forces in the third book to finally see the idea of the Wild West as we know it to the great dirt nap, or at least helping it come to the realization that it's been crippled and needs to be put down for its own good.With that cheery introduction, let's get to the good times:""All the Pretty Horses"": This was the one I've heard of, mostly because they made it into an apparently not that great movie that I've never seen.  This on some level is probably the most accessible of the bunch even though the prose style doesn't quite lend itself toward that at first glance.  John Grady Cole, faced with the prospect of his ranch being sold, heads into Mexico with his best friend to find work wrangling things, presumably cattle.  Among other things, they meet a potentially psychotic teenager, John falls in love and they get a tour of the Mexican prison system in a way that doesn't require paying admission.  None of it, other than a stab at a tragic love story, could be considered pleasant or even life-affirming.Except.  The prose in this novel struck me the most out of the three, even though the style isn't that much different.  It may be the shock of the new, or it may be that McCarthy has a tighter control over his looseness, if that makes any sense.  His sentences come across as layered fever dreams, knotted and running into each other before suddenly untangling into glorious descriptions of the scenery.  The lacking of punctuation elevates what could be a story of routine melodrama into something a bit more epic and mythological, three young men touring the crumbling ruins of an old way of life, trying to find their way inside of it even as it attempts to chew them up.  It's brutal in parts, and unsparing in that way that cluster bombs are.  McCarthy depicts all the degradations that the boys go through in  prison with a jaundiced eye but the summary execution of someone is handled off-screen with a minimum of fuss, as if the book was too concerned with other matters to even bother with someone being snuffed out.None of it would work at all if John Grady wasn't drawn so rigidly, defined in opposition to a system that keeps changing shape to smother him.  Absolutely no one is on his side and he basically survives by being unyielding, implacably refusing to bend no matter how much of a good idea it seems.  He has poor judgement in women but an unswerving moral bend and his conviction to not only do the right thing but see the right thing be done drives the core of the novel and in that sense he seems to be attempting to maintain the spirit of the plains and the old West through sheer will and gravitational pull alone.But if there's some small hint of romance in ""All the Pretty Horses"", ""The Crossing"" dispenses with all that entirely to go frolicking with wolves.  Actual wolves, as opposed to metaphorical wolves.  The description of the plot for the novel leads one to believe that the entire novel could be titled ""A Boy and His Muzzled Wolf"" when in reality it takes up a very small part of it.  Instead it features a series of jaunts into Mexico by first young Billy Parham solo and later joined by his brother Boyd.  The first part of it involves a wolf, the second part involves a journey for revenge and the remainder deals with the aftermath of that revenge and an attempt to get some closure where the wound has been already cauterized.  Nothing makes sense, and all he can do is cope.  But even the act of coping could change him utterly.It's a harder book to get into.  For one, the prose here seems scaled back into something resembling normal and while the descriptions are still vivid, the rhythm lacks the headrush fire of the first novel.  Where it does succeed is turning Mexico into a kind of alien fairyland, a place that is heaped in mystery and mythology, an aura that can be felt every time Billy and (later) Boyd make the crossing into that other territory.  It's not quite as simple as going to a place where people speak a different language but a place where all the rules are different, with an internal logic that has to be deciphered before any progress can be made.  Since the book tends to focus more on Billy becoming a man (or ""not a boy"") the plot is a bit more rambling than the first novel, with the story lurching from point to point like a series of short stories featuring the same people.  In portions it speeds up to attain a kind of power, an attack by bandits, a family revelation, a harrowing search but it never builds momentum for very long, leading the less patient to probably wonder ""where is he going with this?""  The fact that large amounts of the dialogue is in Spanish doesn't help . . . it highlights the Otherness of Mexico since (at least for me, being monolingual) having great swaths of the book rendered incomprehensible except via context (which is possible) makes you feel as if you've stumbled into a place where you really don't belong.But it's necessary as a bridge to get us to ""Cities of the Plain"", where all the themes come together just in time to come joyfully crashing down.  John Grady and Billy are working on the same ranch where things seem to be winding down due to a drought.  The spectre of the US Army hovers nearby, never seen but existing in sideways dialogue, ready to take over the lands at any moment.  But everything seems to be going well, with John Grady furthering his skill at breaking horses (""All the Pretty Horses"" revealed him to be a master horse whisperer, which probably looks better on  your resume than ""failed romantic"" although ""survived Mexican prison with only minor stab wounds"" could be a useful life skill) and Billy rarely mentioning that he used to have a brother and a wolf, neither of which are necessary for anyone to know but might be nice conversation starters for those long nights out on the range.Of course, a book about everyone having a good time on a ranch wouldn't be as much fun for the rest of us and fortunately while John Grady has learned many life lessons, making good choices in the world of romance clearly wasn't one of them as he falls in love with not just a prostitute, but one with a seizure disorder.  And not just an epileptic lady of the streets, but one whose pimp might have fallen in love with her.  Oh, and did I mention the pimp has a nasty violent streak?  All the ingredients for a tragic ending are present and this elevates the book considerably over the one before it, making the entire trilogy's tendency to suddenly tangent into philosophical digressions easier to take when the aura of doom hovers over everything.  The presence of John Grady helps as well, his steady intractability and sureness contrasting with the ""live and let crumble"" attitude of everyone else on the ranch.  Once a plan takes hold for him to marry the young lady and get her away from the life she leads, we lurch into a plodding escalation that verges on the Biblical, everyone fairly certain that none of this will end well but unable to stop themselves from ensuring it ends even worse.The literary quirks that color McCarthy's work, the elevation of the mundane into the mythical, discussions of dreams that practically scream ""This is fraught with meaning"", the desperate circling of the characters in such a fashion that reminds you of nothing more than a drain set over a garbage disposal, all of that comes into play here but with the entire book focused on the notion of ""This is the end of a way of life"" it means that every stray line of dialogue becomes twisted toward that end, regardless of whether it wants to or not, adding weight to all these circumstances that can't be entirely ignored.  It turns a story from a cautionary tale of why bringing a knife to a knife fight is more useful than you'd think into a mediation on what happens when no one bothers with knife fights anymore.  Nobody ends up happy but, as the song says, even if things had worked out they probably wouldn't have been happy anyway because the life that feeds that happiness is disappearing.That disintegration is heightened in the epilogue, picking up with one of the characters years later, in a world that he has no place in but may still have a place for him.  ""Elegiac"" seems too easy a word to describe it, but after reading a good chunk of three novels that seem to be funerals for a body that hasn't died yet it's considerably more optimistic than anything that came before it.  The people who can't adapt are better off staying behind, it seems to be suggesting, because the new contours of the world would have left them no room to breathe anyway.  The ones that survive are the people that allow their bones to be broken so they can fit inside and keep on living. It's a trade-off perhaps, and if the price of life is the sawing pain of the sharp edges of the shattered splinters inside that never quite goes away, well, they'll take that as a last reminder of the world they once had and consider it a trade made fair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARRLL26YHPX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375407936#wasThisHelpful","R3ARRLL26YHPX2","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read enough books where the science is more magical realism masquerading as science or it takes place so far in the future that the author isn't necessarily required to prove anything with charts, it's nice to read fiction that has a kernel of theoretical plausibility about it.  Note that I didn't say that the scenario was plausible but at least the underlying science has some degree of believability about it.That said, it's about an intelligent black hole that wants to devour the earth.  Let's just get that out of the way right from the start.So if you were under any impression that this was the biography of one of those people who keep winning the hot dog eating contests, rest assured that this is probably far more palatable to read.  Basically, a small team of scientists discover that a entity that looks not unlike a black hole is heading into the solar system and appears to be deliberately changing its trajectory to steer itself toward Earth.  This is weird enough, but at least sort of within the bounds of something they might expect, even if it sounds like one of those things scientists dare each other with during late night conversations when someone has to come up with the most unlikely provable thing ever.But then the black hole starts conversing with them, and all heck breaks loose.Benford has been doing this long enough that he can take something that probably isn't really explainable within a high level degree in a field I can barely pronounce and have the characters explain it to each other without sounding like they're dumbing it down for the slow members of the audience, and manage to write a coherent plot about it.  His characters feel real in their foibles and likes and petty disagreements and even if he tends to take shortcuts in terms of development sometimes (two people get together pretty much because the book decides they should be together but the actual relationship, once established, feels honest).  His mistake, then, isn't so much in the scenario itself but in how he handles it.  Presenting himself with a situation where humanity comes in contact with something that is truly alien, he decides to convert the story into a hard science version of ""Armageddon"", where the characters must bring all their science tools to bear in order to beat back the crazy black hole that keeps calmly attacking them.  He's good at a lot of things, but pulse pounding tension isn't quite his forte, and while I was invested in the characters to some extent, it's not enough that I cared if the entire planet was devoured in a manner not unlike leaving me inside a marble glazed doughnut factory.His story more or less centers around four scientists (although one stays absent for long portions of the narrative to the point where I thought he forgot about her).  Benjamin and Channing are husband and wife, and along with sort of friend/rival Kingsley (as others have pointed out, he and Benjamim are positioned in the beginning as polite but bitter rivals but the story seems to forget about that) they do most of the theoretical legwork in figuring out what the Eater is and what exactly it wants.  Channing is unfortunately suffering from terminal cancer, which means Benford telegraphs a sacrifice that needs to be made later right in the beginning but the scenes of her struggling with the disease that is overtaking her body faster and faster pretty much adds the only spark to the beginning sense, which mostly consist of people politely and enthusiastically debating scientific points.  He has a natural and easy way with conversation, and is able to convince you that these people have known each other for a long time but in the best Asimov tradition, large chunks of the book consist of urbane conversation.  Anything with Kingsley winds up having a little bit of spark and by default he winds up becoming the main character as Channing's involvement with the narrative becomes more limited and Benjamin turns out to be not that interesting anyway.Otherwise the book mostly involves dealing with Eater, your world consuming black hole pal.  He's able to talk to planet Earth and for me the book falls flat around here as even though we're told that Eater is something utterly alien, he communicates in English quite well, alternating between pithy observations of human nature and what sound like just random statements that don't make a huge amount of sense.  Given the opportunity to have the characters confront something truly frightening and beyond understanding, it just becomes another obstacle to overcome, pitched somewhere between ""Rendezvous with Rama"" without the thrill and mystery of discovery and Unicron from the Transformer movie without the complete awesomeness of being a robot planet in disguise.  Beyond one of the characters getting a nicely played if ignoble death, the remainder of the novel feels matter of fact and I never get the sense that the scientists have their backs to the wall or that the outcome is ever in doubt.  Even the ending, meant to be a transcendent revelation, comes across as rather flat and honestly I half expected something along those lines anyway.  You're left with the impression that Benford's first inclination was to have the book consist of debates amongst and with the crazy black hole and he was told at some point to jazz it up slightly with some planet threatening peril.  And while the results are still pleasant the temperature never rises over a lukewarm pitch and if there's one thing you don't want to a book about scientists fighting a potentially insane intelligent black hole with an appetite for our deliciously juicy world to be, it's mild-mannered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BAOQG8PR553H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380790564#wasThisHelpful","R1BAOQG8PR553H","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another day, another novel where a plague wiping out a good portion of humanity is presented as a good thing, to the point where a guest appearance by Batman villain Ra's Al Ghul wouldn't feel completely out of place.This one is the usual mix of Tepper Topics, this time for whatever reason leaving out the swipes at organized religion (don't be too disappointed, the usual nature centered religious types appear and come across as fairly decent if eccentric types, although you may not like them too much by the end) but focusing more on her views of nature and what we're doing to the planet and what might happen if nature decided to strike back.  Our viewpoint lady for this venture is Dora Henry, who starts off as an utter doormat to the point where you have to wonder if Tepper is even trying at this point or it's just a feint.  Turns out, it is a feint, which I was thankful for, as the early scenes with Dora and her husband Jared where she ""yes dear""'s someone who has no desire to interact with her beyond cooking and cleaning even as her friends openly wonder why she married the big lug.  Dora just smiles and shrugs, meek and passive.  Oh, did I mention she's a police officer?  She is, although we never really see her arrest anyone.  What she does do is spend most of her time (when she isn't cooking dinner just the way her husband's mother does) investigating a rash of slayings of scientists, all stabbed in the back.  With no leads and no one seeming to think it might be a serial killer, there's plenty of extra time to wonder about how the weed in Dora's yard has now grown to the point where its seeds are starting to take over the town.  Which is fine because she can talk to it and it seems to listen, especially if you say ""please"".If you've ever read the Alan Moore written issue of ""Swamp Thing"" where his girlfriend gets arrested in Gotham City and Swampy gets his revenge by basically turning the whole place into a jungle, you have some idea of what this is like.  People who are mean to the plants get the receiving end of a sharp stick and people who are kind and gentle to our friends the foliage finds that it works with them.  Meanwhile, there's a whole other plot!Yes, in what appears to be the far future a bunch of characters gather together to go on a vague quest.  At some points the quest is adorably meta and while it's not entirely unpleasant it's difficult to see at first how this connects with the main plot, although by this point the main plot mostly consists of Dora chatting with plants and enjoying life away from her husband (with a new love interest to boot! girl works fast).  There's some domestic pleasantness to these sections, as Dora comes across as a genuinely nice person, although her penchant for suddenly spouting very sharply defined views of how to treat the planet pretty much out of nowhere begins to come to the fore.  These parts often feel out of place and more a vehicle for Tepper to spout her own views, Heinlein style . . . although given that Dora gives the plants more or less a pass for stealing babies because the parents clearly didn't know when to stop having kids, it starts to verge a little bit on the unsettling after a while.In the interim, the future plot does connect with Dora in a way that actually infuses the book with some new energy but also feels like a cheat . . . we're treated to a revelation about those characters without having been given any hints as to their true nature and as they don't really act like you imagine they would, the reveal doesn't feel quite earned.  But it kicks the plot more into gear, leading to various amusing situations as Dora and company try to stop an evil from the end of time (although the identity of who it is winds up being so obvious you're screaming at the characters to figure it out fifty pages before they actually do), Dora and new manfriend Abby make their tentative way through romance (like every good man in a Tepper novel he's utterly sensitive and charming and there are points where the novel starts to veer towards a very chaste romance novel), and maybe some sense of harmony will be reached.  But not before the psuedo-druids show up.This is one of those novels where it feels like she came up with the message and decided the plot merely existed to hang her feelings about what we're doing to the planet onto it.  Compared to the complexity of something like ""Grass"" (I had some problems with ""Grass"" but it's a multi-leveled masterpiece compared to this) it comes across as utterly simple and one-dimensional.  The revelations are telegraphed or simply told to us, the logic of the plot mechanics feels a bit rusty sometimes (I know the geneticist was a genius and old but to get the results he had would have required way more generations of breeding than his lifetime could hold, you're not talking about working with animals that live for three days) and everyone is so nice it's hard to get worked up about anything.  Dora is nice but a bit of a wet towel, and those goes for almost everyone.  They have about one layer and even if the layer isn't unpleasant it doesn't make for super-compelling reading at times, even if you're a hundred percent behind Tepper in her views.  All the twists don't feel like something we could have figured out from clues which means we're reading because everyone is just so darn likeable.Part of the problem is that the tone is so light and charming that when Tepper attempts to interject seriousness through mouthpiece Dora, it's the same effect as blindly swinging a hammer at the glass store, sure you get results but it's not like you're being careful with your targets.  Getting away from her husband leaves Dora free to espouse all kinds of views that border on the crazy at times (the aforementioned ""Take all the babies, super-trees, you know better"") or oddly specific (her stab at politicians and Congress isn't unwelcome but she hasn't given us any hint prior to this that it's really something that's bothering her all along) and by the time you reach the ending you have Dora basically saying that a plague that murders half of humanity is okay because frankly we all deserve it, and there's not one dissenting argument to contest her.  Which gives the book the impression that it's in a self-satisified monologue with itself, and the noise from the echo chamber is often so loud you can't hear the quieter parts that are actually worth your attention.  She's good enough at her craft to make this readable but I think she wanted it to have more of an impact than it does and instead it comes across as a trifle.  It's a sad clown gone paper-thin, it may put a gentle and bemused smile on your face but it never gives you a reason to delve into the reason that no one else on stage seems to be laughing.  You just figure they don't have a sense of humor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SRKJL548BUV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380791978#wasThisHelpful","R2SRKJL548BUV3","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read a handful of her books now, it becomes pretty clear that a number of elements pop up in one form or another from book to book.  Tepper Tropes, as it were.  Generally a plague is threatening or has already taken out part of humanity.  There's a culture that lives in harmony with the land and both genders that is shown to be better than everyone else.  Men with manly traits are worse than men with more feminine traits.  Organized religion veers toward the crazypants, mostly because its male dominated.  I'm sure you can think of others.  There's nothing inherently wrong with going to the same basic well of ideas time and again, she clearly has a distinctive point of view that she wants to get across.  It's when those tropes start to overwhelm the plot and it's all you can see that the book becomes less a book and more a list of things the author doesn't like and would like you not to like either.This, surprisingly, is not one of those books.  I say surprisingly because it hits pretty much all of her cliches and yet shows how much a little focus and sharpening can do for the story itself despite the fact that there's maybe three actual characters in the whole story.Tepper's latest attempt to show us the error of our ways takes us back into the realms of SF and to the world of Grass in the distant enough future.  They live in the style of the English manor-born, with the ruling families often going on ""hunts"" with ""horses"" and ""hounds"" to eventually track down and kill a ""fox"".  Which sounds pretty lordly until you realize that the people who aren't in the hunts think the hunts are terrifying and the rate of people being injured in the hunts is quite severe.  But it's something to do, I suppose.  Things get stranger when you realize that except for the people riding the mounts, everything in the hunt is alien and native to the world.  There's no chance that any of this could be an example of things about to go awry.Meanwhile, outside the world of Grass is the rest of humanity, many of whom are suffering the effects of a deadly plague that the local dominating religion, Sanctity, are actively denying.  Sanctity, like every religion in every Tepper book, is totally guy-dominated and completely crazy, copying people's genetic codes so they can be brought back someday after a presumed Rapture, but otherwise press-ganging people into service and making them generally miserable.  When word gets out that the world of Grass is not only utterly untouched by plague but plague-ridden people who have been there seem to have been cured, Sanctity wants to send some folks there to investigate how to cure a plague that none of them are capable of admitting exist.  To this comes Marjorie Westriding and her husband and family.  Being her husband is a nephew of a high church official and their horse-riding hobby should in theory make them fit right into a culture that loves riding, it seems like a no-brainer to sneak them in under diplomatic auspices (the only way in since the ruling class pretty much hates everyone who isn't themselves). Easy, right?  The problem should be solved just in time for everyone to take a victory lap around the veranda.But it's not that simple, as the Westriding family quickly discovers.  The ruling class bons are super-unfriendly as anyone who doesn't Hunt isn't really a man.  The beasts they ride are far from horses and are intelligent animals called Hippae.  The Hunt itself is creepy as all heck and to top things off, all the cast-offs of Sanctity are stuck at an archeological dig for a vanished race that used to be prevalent throughout the galaxy and might have died off due to a plague as well, a plague that might have started on Grass.From the start it seems that Tepper is well in control of both the plot and the message here.  Previous books of hers I read tended to meander while she walked us through the scenario before the story actually got started, here there's a welcome sense of menace pervading the scene from the start.  You know things are wrong on Grass, it's just a matter of waiting to find out how wrong.  By the time it becomes clear the ""horses"" are stealing young women, Marjorie and her family are trapped in a slow motion horror movie where no one is even trying to reassure them that things are all right.  Because they aren't.  The only way to get out is to play along and playing along means dying.  Is it too late for a return ticket?She constructs the world and culture of Grass in such a way that it feels believable in a way her worlds sometimes don't.  The Commoners feel grounded in a fashion that belays the condescending obviousness of them being far more worldly than their supposed lords and masters, and the interactions between them and the Westridings has an easy charm to it, offset by the encroaching sense of danger and urgency as her family is slowly ensnared further into a world that means them no good at all.  Having the Hippae as the enigmatic villains of the piece, remote and clearly malevolent in a way that no one is capable of explaining properly, pitches things higher and even when they're not in a scene their presence lingers in the background as a bad dream that won't go away, whispering promises that are both deadly and irresistible.  She deftly manages to juggle a plot that should be far flung, with the head members of Sanctity balancing off the isolation of the archeological dig balancing nicely with the headache-inducing stubbornness of the bons, along with Marjorie's rising sense that everyone is starting to willingly march toward their own doom.Marjorie remains one of Tepper's greatest characters thus far, a woman captured in all of her facets, rounded and fiery, focused on her family and a wish to do good, informed by her faith but not overtaken by it.  She acts as the moral center of the book and is strong enough that she pretty much carries the book in her wake, as very few characters can even stand up to her level.  But she makes them better simply be being around them, turning her husband Rico, who is a Man in the finest Tepper tradition, consumed with himself and his pleasures and seeing women as a convenience and a means to an end, into something more complex than he has any right to be.  Most everyone else falls into the usual categories of ""men traits"" and ""lady traits"" something Tepper only makes more obvious by having Marjorie's son Tony more like his mother and thus blatantly sympathetic, while daughter Stella is explicitly compared several times to her father and comes across as a shrill teenage harpy, improving absolutely nothing.But what really surprised me here was her treatment of religion.  Sanctity is a bunch of lunatics and nobody seems to really believe in it as much as are forced to be in it (and its eventual head a typically frothing ""women are my playthings""), but the Westridings are Old Catholics and with them come two priests, leading to several theological discussions that come across as nuanced and well-thought out.  She's still on the side of any religion but this one but having intelligent characters able to argue for their own faith is a big step in the right direction and keeps the book from being a polemic.  The trading back and forth of ideas against the backdrop of ""what the heck is going on here"" drives the book quite nicely, giving us the sense of how people screw things up without beating us in the face with it.  The details here win the day, whether she's delving into the ecology of the planet (it's no Dune but it makes as much sense as anything else) or the mysteries of the vanished race, or even the notion of whether human emotions can even apply to aliens.It's all working so well that it hardly matters she can't wrap it up properly.  The battle scenes are the best she's ever done, equally shot through with brutality and momentum and all the more exciting for how visceral they are.  The novel loses some of its luster once we realize the Hippae aren't on our side, but since we never get to really know them they wind up devolving into psychotic horses, a unique category for one but probably a concept that needed a little more meat on it.  Her explanations for things could use a little work as well, the ultimate source of the plague and how it was spread comes across as nonsensical if you stop to think about it for more than thirty seconds, which isn't bad unless you consider how the whole book hinges on it.  It feels like she wrote the book up until that point, then looked at it to see how she could fit it together, and it doesn't quite work.  She also doesn't bother explaining why the crazy horses were taking young ladies and doing what they do to them (unless I missed it) . . . I get that not every mystery has to be explained but there's not even an attempt to put it into some kind of context, it's just dropped, unless you want to accept ""psychopathic ponies"" as your reason and simply stop there (and it does seem a little weird that one girl actually improves as a person in the aftermath, as if it were an excuse to shave off all the annoying parts).With that all said, this is probably the first Tepper book I didn't have to cringe at certain parts or roll my eyes, all the parts fit together nicely and she definitely seemed inspired here.  Whether it's because she had a bad experience with horses at some point in her life I'll leave to her biographer to uncover (and if any of her characters have to return in a later book, I'm quite okay with it being Marjorie) but for a while she made me believe this was possible, which is something her books not set on far off worlds had some difficulty accomplishing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJYPQ3C072E8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055376246X#wasThisHelpful","RJYPQ3C072E8Z","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whoa hey, what's this?  A world in crisis?  If there only was a way for the book to painstakingly link it as a blatant metaphor for the ills in our current civilization and proceed to show us how the world should be run.  You know, in harmony.  Seems easy.  But first, let's cue ourselves up some trolls!Tepper's novel is somewhat positioned as a fantasy tale at first, with its ""farmboy destined for greater things"" trappings and hints of blackclad enforcers stalking the landscape looking for a certain child orphan.  But all that goes out the window when trucks start appearing and before long it becomes clear that we're in a future version of our world, presumably after some disaster leveled the playing field somewhat (it's not a Tepper novel if civilization isn't reeling from a plague in its past or bracing themselves for one to come), and all of this is before the villain starts to plan how to get to an old space station.  So it's the future but all the cool people left.  Got it.Our story centers around Abasio, a farmboy who lusts for adventure like my classmates in middle-school lusted after the swimsuit edition of the latest sports magazine, and goes off to seek it.  But there's little adventure to be found around here, so instead he does the logical thing and joins a gang, a bunch of purple people, who teach him that life is more than stabbing people and sleeping with their women, but being open to stabbing those people, too.  Meanwhile we have an Orphan growing up in an archetypical village that is literally inhabited by archetypes, a Hero and a Burning Man and a Seeress and so on.  As the story goes on it becomes fairly clear that she's the young lady in question that the more nefarious elements are looking for, embodied in the form of the Witch, who keeps a small group of families in line by basically being entirely crazy and unpredictable.  She's looking to get up to that space station, you see, and the only thing they're missing is someone with the right genetic code to plug into the navigator seat.  A genetic code that is not unlike the poor dear Orphan's.If what I'm describing sounds like the ingredients for a mess, part of the fault lies with me for not being able to describe it correctly, but there's a very real chance at several points for this to go completely off the rails and it's basically only because Tepper's a veteran at this that it doesn't.  The setting has echoes of several better novels, unfortunately, with the idea of archetypes hanging out in the wake of all the cool toys that the majority of mankind left behind when they got the heck out of Dodge bringing to mind both Delany's ""Einstein Intersection"" (an alien race evokes Jungian archetypes on an Earth abandoned my mankind) and Crowley's ""Engine Summer"", both of which had ideas and style to spare.  That isn't quite the case here, although she tries very hard.Part of the problem is that it's very hard to immerse yourself in this world as any sort of real construct.  Half the trick of creating a fantasy world, or any fictional world really, is to make the reader invest not only in the characters but the landscape they inhabit.  And the landscape that we get here is such a hodgepodge that half of it seems to be a deadly serious didactic examination of the trends of the current world we live in and the rest is a winkingly meta version of a fantasy world convinced that it's not at all like other fantasy worlds.  Which is true, it isn't.  But it isn't like any other world I recognize, either.  We get all the pieces here but it's hard to imagine them fitting in any coherent way and the far future setting allows her to throw in elements without having to explain them at all.  Why are there archetypical villages at all, with some of the lesser inhabitants only existing as robots?  Why is the world flush with monsters of old stories?  What is the Edge like that everyone keeps referring to?  I can get behind inserting mysteries in your novel without having any intention to explain them, it adds a little allure and color to the proceedings.  But if the world doesn't feel fully realized to begin with then we're going to need all the details we can get.Fortunately the characters do save it.  Tepper has a good grasp of social dynamics and even if I rarely agree with her conclusions that those dynamics inevitably lead to, she can make the interactions compelling enough that it hardly matters in the short run.  From the clumsy machinations of the gangs to the burgeoning romance between Abasio and Orphan, to the political maneuvering of the remaining families around the increasing nuttiness of the witch (the mystery shrouded sections of the novel are deployed best here and watching everyone trying to enact desperate plans before the crazy woman notices and unleashes hordes of killer androids upon them is probably the most exciting part of the book), there's plenty of material here to keep the book moving even when the plot seems to be meandering out of reach.Which is just fine because when Tepper's usual stylistic tics appear, it starts to put the story in fairly standard territory.  The Witch remains another in a long line of irrationally frothing Tepper antagonists, though I will give her credit for making the villain a woman this time and upending expectations, not crazy enough to be excitingly unpredictable but so nuts that you know she has no chance of succeeding because she's way too over the top.  We take a detour into a land that seems inhabited by the descendents of Native Americans so she can have the characters give us a lecture on yet another variation of her Perfect Civilization that lives in harmony with the land, where men and woman are completely equal and candy is available for all.  Still, the battles that take up the back chunks of the novel are exciting (but not as visceral as ""Grass"", which probably remains the high point for her entry into the SF Action Hall of Fame) and watching all the plans come together is glorious in itself, even if the land they live in still doesn't make much sense.If you're reading any of this and thinking, ""Wow, I can't see she can pull together a satisfying ending out of that"", you are apparently thinking along the lines of the author, who upon finding that it would be difficult to tie it all together . . . didn't.  In what is a daring use of both anti-climax and deus ex machina, the ending pretty much gets handed to the characters and by ""handed"" I mean nobody at all gets what they want.  But Tepper gets to indulge in yet another plague so that itch is scratched.  We're treated to yet another discourse about men and women and her somewhat disturbing tendency to have her characters insist that there's too many people in the world so its perfectly okay for nature to knock off a bunch of them.  I'm no stranger to ambiguous or downbeat endings but here it feels more like she couldn't think of an organic way to do it so she let the plot shove itself sideways in an attempt to elicit some kind of ending.  Needless to say after five hundred pages it doesn't make for the most satisfying reading experience, bordering on the frustrating.  Yet there's enough moments lingering inside to make you wonder what she could do with a concept like this if she wasn't constantly indulging her need to the plot be dragged toward her standard topics, like a magnet trapped inside its own field and assuming that's what attraction really is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23LKRKK9KJFUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553568736#wasThisHelpful","R23LKRKK9KJFUD","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's probably a case to be made that Tepper could get herself a nice career creating fictional worlds for other writers.  I've only read three books by her and two of those showcase someone with a more than decent imagination giving her characters rich worlds to romp around in, with some thought given to intricate construction and a nod toward how the various moving parts would actually fit in together.  Not all of it adheres to the strict principles of logic (""Beauty"" sometimes resorted to the all-purpose get out of jail free clause of ""It's magic!"") but the true test if any fictional world is worth its salt is whether the reader can immerse themselves in that world and buy into it for however many pages.  It may fall apart under closer inspection later, but if you can convince someone in the moment that ""this not-real place is totally real!"" then for most writers that's half the job right there.Which is good, because when it comes to the actual plotting sometimes, she seems to let that slide slightly.Here Tepper gives us the world of Newholme, which is having its second go-round as a settled colony after the first colony (settled by manly men, but we'll get to that later) decided to go pull a Roanoke and vanish entirely.  The second attempt seems to have gone much better . . . except for the virus that keeps killing half the girl babies.  But the colony winds up functioning quite well, with society stratified in a sort of odd homeostasis, with Hags and Men of Business jointly calling the shots (or the Hags letting them believe they're calling the shots) and pretty, pretty boys that they call Hunks trained as male concubines for when wives want a bit of recreation, or at least someone who knows how to talk about art.  Things are going fairly well with all this and then two bad things happen at once: first the planet seems to be slowly shaking itself apart, and the Council of Worlds has decided to send the Questioner on an auditing mission to see how well the colony is following the council laws.  The answer: not very well, but they're hoping that with all the cracks opening in the ground she might not notice.For the most part the story follows the training of Hunk-in-progress Mouche, from his sale to the local House for Hunkifying to his involvement with the Questioner as she arrives to start making everyone really nervous.  Along the way we get hints of an indigent population that everyone has pretty much agreed doesn't exist (which is reminding me of another story I read recently that I can't for the life of me remember right at this very second) and hints that the original vanished colony hasn't quite actually vanished, but they aren't actually keen on living in harmony with the land either.It's all very fascinating and Tepper's method of taking us through this society in both a grand sweep and up-close view is riveting in its own way, especially in seeing how she's worked out all the sociological implications of it.  Which is good, because it quickly becomes apparent that the main plot is going to be a slow train coming, especially when it takes almost a third of the book for the Questioner to even arrive.  Meanwhile we dally in smaller stories, like a girl passing as a man, the confusions of two dancers recruited to assist the Questioner, Mouche's repeated encounters with two mean boys.  It's all very nice and reads well but the narrative thrust seems to be ""We'll get there when we get there.""The presence of the Questioner livens things up quite a bit.  Possessed of the ability to make a entire colony miserable (i.e. dead) if they tick her off enough, she has a dry sense of humor and a self-assuredness that is a fun contrast to everyone else's obvious nervousness around her, as they smile and insist that nope, nothing is wrong here.  Most of the other characters don't make as strong of an impression despite a sometimes intense focus on them and most of them exist more as plot devices than anything else (the dancers are nice but strangely convenient when the time comes, and I'm not even sure what purpose Ornery even serves).The problems sort of hit when the actual mechanisms of the plot start to kick in and she has to fuse all these elements and themes into the narrative.  Anyone reading Tepper for even a short time picks up that writing about gender relations is a focus for her and those issues tend to skew slightly toward ""aggressive men screw everything up.""  And while the colony itself is an example of a mostly functioning woman dominated affair, when she starts to drag in mutated members of the first colony (known charmingly as ""Thor"") and basically collectively sounding like the cigar-chomping old men in the local lodge talking about how the world would be better if the womenfolk went back to what they were best at, namely making pies and babies (not necessarily in that order), you get the impression that someone has opened the window and let subtlety escape.  Coupled with the plot beginning to meander when everyone goes underground (characters disappear for large chunks of the book at a shot) and you're basically reading to see what snarky thing the Questioner will say next.  Which is every page she's on, and its great.Unfortunately as the book drives closer to the end it starts to become more mystical, with gods inside planets and Gaia-type organisms.  I feel like Gene Wolfe could have elevated all this to exquisite if baffling metaphor but it starts to come across as near gibberish after a while as everyone starts dancing and jumping in pools . . . by the time she unleashes her climax off-screen and then has one of the characters comment that it's just like in a story and better for not knowing the whole thing in detail, you're not sure if she's being clever or just lacks confidence in her own resolution.  It never quite feels as alien as it should and instead of giving the sensation that everyone involved is out of their depth and forced to make it up as they go along, there's a sense of casual inevitability as our heroes are merely guided to their ending.  Even the bad men are more or less disposed of so rapidly and without fuss that you wonder why they were even introduced in the first place.Still, it goes down without too much choking and there's nothing horribly off-putting.  For me what stuck the most was how she seemed incapable of society run by women as capable of doing terrible thing in an effort to keep the peace . . . her own revelation about the nature of the virus suggests for a second she's willing to go there but then she pulls back for a more feel-good stance that makes little logical sense in the universe the book inhabits except as a way of more sharply delineating the divide she sees between men and women.  Even so, the world she gives us a glimpse into is worth the tour despite the plot at times having all the weight of a very puffy cloud, and I enjoyed the view of the countryside even if the people I met along the way didn't make as much of an impression as she probably would have liked.  That said, however, I will give her this: I did not see that last page coming under any circumstances.  I don't know if I liked it but in terms of not giving me what I expected, well played, I must say.  Well played.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJ7W920DV9SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380791986#wasThisHelpful","R2JJ7W920DV9SF","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's something to be said for revisiting old fairy tales.  A lot of us of a certain age were most exposed to them via cartoons from the company run by the guy in the mouse ears and while they didn't completely shy away from the inherent darkness that inhabits such tales, they certainly threw a bit of a gloss over it, if only because it was easier to sell related merchandise that way.  In our slightly more cynical latter part of the century and for so far most of the new one, there's been a trend to revive those old fairy tales but in a way that stays true to their original roots and highlights how kind of messed up they were in the first place.The problem remains that if everyone starts doing that then it becomes a cliche in itself and you find yourself expecting the same literary devices and themes every time you start to read a book and realize that they've once again returned ""Snow White"" to its roots as dark metaphor for the unconscious fear of stunted underground mine people saving you from your own terrifying reflection (if that was even a concern) . . . there's only so many ways you can bring on the darkness before the darkness starts to wear predictable shoes, especially if you've read more than one attempt at blowing your mind with a fairy tale the way you've never seen it before.So, in this case, I give Tepper credit.  She didn't blow my mind, but she managed to throw a curve ball in the proceedings that I have to admit I never saw coming, and while the book doesn't entirely surpass that one ""what the heck"" moment, it manages to keep itself at pretty close to the same level for the remainder of it.  Here, she has the story narrated by Beauty, a young lady in the fourteenth century with a marginally absent father, a mother who is presumed dead and maybe part-fairy and the vague concept of a curse hanging over her head where if she gets her finger pricked by a spindle on her sixteenth birthday, she'll drop dead.  Or fall asleep (which is probably just as bad as the physicians back then probably couldn't tell the difference between death and a coma and would just bury you anyway, although maybe you'd get dissected in the name of incorrect science), as her weird aunt may have heard her other weird aunt wrong.But as Beauty's birthday approaches and it seems like we know where this is going (i.e. a modern retelling of ""Sleeping Beauty""), Tepper goes and pulls the rug out from under us with a left field development.  Beauty manages to dodge her fate to some extent, but its not clear if the napping people in the castle or her got the better end of the deal.  What happens from there is a journey across time and space and fiction, as Beauty does her best Billy Pilgrim impression and becomes unstuck in both time and genre, reeling back and forth, spending time guest-starring in a Robert Silverberg novel with a friendly transvestite, hanging out with new friends in a work of fiction so awesomely perfect its dull, and learning along the way that you can't go home again, but you can go home for a third or fourth time as long as no one recognizes you.It's the constant shifting back and forth of both genre and setting that gives the book its momentum, as Tepper never allows us to get too comfortable before revealing that Beauty has dropped herself into a messed up version of ""Cinderella"", as she both begats and enables famous fairy tales.  In the process it gives Tepper a chance for some commentary on the nature of art, as she comes to realize that art and beauty is draining from the world as time goes on and that there's very little she can do to stop it.  Selfishness and greed and pettiness seek to take the general wonder that permeates the world and leave it nothing more than a pale and gasping version of itself before fading away entirely.  It's not so much a race against time as racing against a race against time, a battle already lost as soon as time began, but with the vague hope that someone will recognize what might be lost before it vanishes forever.In that spirit she has very little nice to say about the modern world or the genre of horror and sometimes the novel seems to take a back seat as Tepper wedges her views into the narrative as best she can.  It can make her come across as a bit of a crank at times, to be honest, but there's little doubting her sincerity.  But the best portions of the book more than make up for it, with Beauty subtly shifting from a too talkative young lady (with slightly annoying meta-commentary from her aunt) to an old lady that has only lived for a few years and gained a sort of wisdom in the process, while the world goes even greyer than her hair around her.  For me, the scenes with the fairies worked the best as she manages to recreate that timeless, crystalline feeling that fairyland held in something like Lord Dunsany's ""King of Elfland's Daughter"", as a country that is just like ours, but better, and then takes that feeling and slows it down even further into something glacial and stifling and dark, a place where the languid pace becomes cellophane wrapped around the nose and mouth, smothering even as it leaves the beauty all too clear.  It's a haunting  portrayal, almost the flipside of something like Crowley's ""Little, Big"".  In that novel, the land of Fairie was a place that normal people weren't able to visit, a dream that existed just long enough to let you know it wasn't a dream.  Here, waking up doesn't even help and you realize that the reason that nobody is complaining anymore about waiting for dinner to arrive is that dinner has arrived and it looks like you.Despite a decently sized section seemingly devoted to telling people who write horror fiction what terrible people they are, Tepper manages to ease the book into a elegiac and graceful place, guiding us into the understanding that if beauty is hidden its because we let it hide, or covered it over with brasher, louder facades that are as thin as paper can be.  She could be accused of meandering slightly in the course of the journey and at times the plot seems less that Beauty makes things happen as things happen to Beauty that she has to react to but even as we're waded through the grimness that is our stacked and degraded centuries, she still finds a sort of contentment to finally rest, suggesting that even as the book itself rarely seems hopeful, hope can exist where the pockets abide, and if bodies can be buried and consigned to eternity then so can seeds, and from there lies the chance to spring forth a different kind of eternity and in such a way survive us all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RMLK0PTO9JH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553295276#wasThisHelpful","R20RMLK0PTO9JH","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's something to be said for reaching for a hammer when perhaps a more delicate instrument might do the job nicely.I never read anything by Sheri Tepper before and as a woman writing SF I didn't want to automatically paint her with the ""feminist"" brush and assume that because she's a woman everything she writes is cloaked in metaphors about the dichotomy between men and women, just set on other planets or in the far future.  Fortunately for me, she didn't bother with the metaphors and went straight into just spelling it out.This can probably be classified as science-fiction only because its set in the future from when the book is written (the turn of the current century, which now that we're fourteen years past it really makes me wonder where all the flying cars we were promised went) or even ""speculative fiction"" if you want to be like Margaret Atwood and not go near any of that yucky SF stuff, as if people aren't able to tell the difference between stuff like this and ""War of the Worlds"".The Atwood comparison doesn't entirely come out of left field.  Much like her, Tepper has gone and written a novel that serves as sort of a thematic prequel to ""The Handmaid's Tale"" as both have to do with the idea of a fundamentalist conservative hierarchy of men taking over the country and turning women into walking Pez dispensers of infants.  In Atwood's tale, we got a life during wartime type of view where the nightmare came true and we got to see just how unpleasant it would be.  Here, we get to be on the cusp of it, where men collectively start to think that all the world's problems would be solved if women just spent more time in the kitchen making pies and sandwiches.If that sounds like I'm trying to be funny, it unfortunately is about the level of subtlety we get here.  Our tale follows the world through the eyes of six women who meet in college and decide to band together as friends despite the fact that most of them seem to exist more as checkboxes on the scale of archetypes (the radical lesbian, the religious one, the one with the eating disorder, etc).  One of them, nicknamed Sophy, appears to be more special than most , something that becomes more pronounced when the narrative jumps ahead about forty years to the end of the twentieth century and we catch up with the ladies in their various states of success and failure.  They've all kept in touch except for Sophy, who seems to have disappeared at some point even though some of the women still hear her voice or see her occasionally.  In the interim the world has become more man-oriented, with a wave of conservatism growing that threatens to relegate women to third class citizen status after cats and dogs, promising a new world order that won't be pleasant depending on which restroom door you go through.Part of the enjoyment of this book is going to depend on how on-board you are for Tepper's gender politics here, as a good chunk of the plot exists to deliver them and conveniently show how a women-oriented world would be better.  While I'm not completely behind her on the notion that everything is men's fault, I'm not unsympathetic either (certainly aspects of the last few years of political debate has proven, whatever your personal politics, it's still a valid issue for discussion), but the book seems blatantly designed to prove that she's right in a fashion that borders on the ham-fisted.  The gap between the beginning and where the plot picks up doesn't help, as we don't get to see the insidious chipping away of women's rights, the slippery slope of compromise over the decades that puts people in a position that they didn't quite intend.  Instead, we're given multiple scenarios with the various women that basically boil down to ""men stink, and they're ruining everything.""Which isn't surprising given that the book features more or less two kinds of men, ones that are sensitive and compassionate and caring (and thus are helping our heroines, if they aren't already married to them), or complete jerks who feel that women are worthless and should only exist to bear children.  One of the lead men of this ilk, a lawyer named Jagger, is almost a teeth-gnashing parody of manliness, flailing about with a hatred of women that would only border on the irrational if it hadn't already annexed everything around it.  He's part of a group called the Alliance, a shadowy organization that in the spirit of every shadowy organization ever, is working with the government and religious leaders (look, fundamentalist Christians and Muslims actually agreeing on something!) to undo every right women ever had and make it a man's man's man's man's world, baby.The problem that all of this is over the top that its hard to buy into the scenario.  When every man they come into contact with is spouting the same ""get thee to a kitchen, babydoll"" nonsense and the Alliance is bwah-ha-haing about the World To Come in the background, it starts to become so much static as the plot appears to go in circles.  Look, Helen is afraid of her husband.  Look, Agnes is questioning her faith.  Look, Carolyn is defending a Symbolic Person.  And golly, everyone keeps hearing Sophy.  There's very little nuance to be found anywhere, and if you're at all religious you are going to find this book making you very unhappy at some points.  I'm far from the most religious person in the world but even I had to wince when Agnes the nun of the group isn't able to coherently articulate a counter-argument to anything anyone else says, and then gets slapped down by the head male priest anyway because he hates women too like everyone else.  Having everyone wearing a priest's habit either be bigoted or deluded (in Agnes' case, clearly its because she's denying part of herself) sort of stacks the deck for the book, especially when Sophy's stories of a women-centered goddess are meant to be taken as entirely reasonable.  The book would have been far more electric as a debate if Tepper had been able to a conceive of a rational argument for religion that the characters could argue against, instead of making everyone religious seem like idiots and making it clear where the book's sympathies lie.Even if any of that was manageable, she sort of shoots herself in the foot by allowing the book to descend into vague magical realism and mysticism, undercutting the ultimate point of the book that the sickness comes from man himself.  Instead, the book comes across as unfocused, with the Alliance conspiring hitting against Carolyn's defense of a young girl hitting against religious arguments hitting against a plague that seems to suddenly make men less macho out of nowhere hitting against the dueling faceless armies of old women and men with torches.  She's trying for a global cross-section but it never gathers the momentum would give it the horrifying drumbeat of inevitability.  By the time we reach Sophy's secret and the origin of the sinister old man Webster who heads the Alliance, it's lost almost all sense of the real, giving mankind a way out by suggesting all these bad, bad men have just come under the sway of a force beyond space and time, making it into another facet of the timeless battle between Good and Evil, where the messier truth would have hit harder, that we are responsible for our own actions ultimately, both as individuals and as a society, and that we must constantly be on guard to ensure that the rights of others are not trampled upon or diminished, as they so easily can be.  In that light, the SF element comes across as more awkward than anything else, spacesuit people blundering into your finely wrought drama and wrecking the whole tone.  With well-drawn characters and a focused scenario it would have been off-putting.  In this case it's more white noise stacked on incoherence.It's telling that the sharpest and most coherent section of the novel is the trial segment, where Tepper through Carolyn argues that society has to take some responsibility for the way a person is, not by abandoning them and then passing judgement when they don't know how to act.  The debates here, while still somewhat one-sided, gain a passion and drama that the rest of the novel is lacking and while the later inclusion of the SF element spices things up slightly, it's still too little too late.  We needed to see the world as it could be, not as it almost was, and its a shame that she wasn't able to make a world that I recognize, especially when I can open the newspaper and see these same arguments played out across the world, in shouts and knives, in bombs and laws.  While most fiction can function as escapism, I don't think this one was intended as such, and yet with this world and that one facing each other, I'd almost want to escape to hers.  At least there, despite the window-dressing touches of grey, I can have some assurance that things will ultimately turn out to be okay, while here we remain a work in progress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U09TL3Y50V7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553573985#wasThisHelpful","R3U09TL3Y50V7L","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow"" there was a sequence that noted that the worst fear of a paranoid wasn't that all their fears were true and everyone really was out to get them, but just the opposite: that nothing at all was connected and the universe is just a string of random coincidences that we superimpose a kind of purpose onto to make ourselves feel better.With that said, let's go watch one of Lem's characters try to solve a mystery! Ha-hah!I came to Lem mostly through his more SF oriented work (Solaris, Pirx the Pilot, etc) and no matter what the topic there's a certain sensibility that keeps creeping through, a refusal to accept the previously accepted, a probing and questioning tone that stops just short of cynicism and a dark, dry humor that must be a beast for the translators to capture properly.  Most everything, no matter how absurd, is played absolutely straight-faced, and you're not sure if you're supposed to laugh or he's just daring you to think that this is funny.This one is barely SF, although elements keep cropping up here and there.  Our main character is a former astronaut that winds up becoming a private detective, if detectives can call themselves that before they solve any cases.  A number of middle-aged men have wound up dead, some going completely insane first, all of which seem to follow a certain pattern of visiting hotels and spas before their untimely demises.  Is it a serial killer, a mad scientist, a terrorist group testing out a technique before seeking the real targets?  Everyone has the dots connected but the picture doesn't make any sense and its up to our hero to recreate the pattern as best he can in the hopes of triggering what killed the other men and with luck not himself in the process.  Along the way he converses with various experts who have their own theories, all of which could be true and false simultaneously and very few seem to explain ""why?""This is a talky book, mostly consisting of characters debating their points with each other Asimov-style, with occasional detours into stream of consciousness (the somewhat bravura beginning sequence, where his thoughts skitter along with a ragged intensity, aware of the possible danger if unaware of the source and trying to be on guard by not being on guard) and action (a rather terrifying terrorist attack that may or may not have anything to do with the possible going-ons), which at times can feel like the prose equivalent of a one-room play.  It's to Lem's credit that he makes the chatter interesting enough and the central mystery intriguing enough that your attention doesn't flag too much during this version of ""CSI: Amateurs"", which is fine because it's about the only thing the book really has going for it in terms of heft.  If you aren't invested in wanting to find out the ultimate solution to the mystery at hand then you're pretty much here for the travelogue.Yet he does fill it out in ways that make the book spread out beyond its pages.  Our former astronaut is a failed astronaut due to allergies and the slight desperation of that missed opportunity does color the narrative.  A brief discussion of astronauts having to deal with the rest of their life failing to live up to the glory of being in space is handled so succinctly and deftly that it conveys the emotion other writers would use to fill up an entire book (and one did, see Dan Simmons' ""Phases of Gravity"", which is quite good in itself, if the complete opposite of this).  The terror attack is truly frightening, both in the seeming randomness of it, and the bloody confusion and chaos that follow, eerily presaging images we see probably too often in our own present day.But it's still a book that can be read in a scant few hours and lives or dies based on the outcome of its mystery.  The explanation here may not satisfy everyone but Lem was never setting out to be the next Agatha Christie, his mysteries come wrapped in theories and ideas, with the conclusion here seeming to be that in a world grown increasingly more complex, we find the patterns that we want to see as a way of convincing ourselves that we have some measure of understanding how this world operates, and its' the thinking that we know what we're seeing that only proves how blinded we've become.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQKQ8S8VFY092/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0156165007#wasThisHelpful","RQKQ8S8VFY092","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicholas Urfe is spending time on a beautiful Greek island where he doesn't have to work that hard, gets all the benefits of hanging out with a rich old guy and seems to have attracted the attention of the hottest girl around.  Even better, she's got an equally hot twin sister.  Yet he's having the worst time of his life.That sounds like all the elements of a bad eighties romantic comedy and a good chunk of the novel can be filed under ""Problems I Wish I Had"" but if anything Fowles proves that you can take any scenario and save it from cheesiness by dropping in as many mythological and literary references as possible, and then cranking up the weirdness factor as far as his genteel English soul will allow.How did we get here?  Nicholas comes to the island for a teaching position after basically ditching a girl back home in England because he's too shallow to actually want to fall in love with anyone.  It doesn't help that he's sort of incapable of making friends with anyone thanks to a combination of arrogance and a complete lack of social skills that might endear him to another human beings.  The only people who seem to like him are the island inhabitants, and that might be because they only speak Greek.  So it's not too long that he wanders to an old house on the other side of the island and meets local mysterious millionaire Maurice, who might have collaborated with the invading Germans in World War II (the novel is set in the mid-fifties), who quickly seems to take a shine to him.  And by ""shine"", I mean, ""wants to indulge in endless mind games"".  Cue the girls masquerading as his dead wife, and the people wearing animal heads, please.Your enjoyment of this novel is probably going to depend on two factors, neither of which are entirely dependent on the other.  One is whether you get a kick of out playing ""spot the reference"" as Fowles proceeds to have Maurice invoke pretty much every myth he can grab his hands on in the course of messing with Nicholas, with some of them more over than others.  The other factor will depend on how invested you are in why they're putting Nicholas through all this and whether our young cad will come out of it unscathed.  I actually wound up sympathizing with Nicholas after the first hundred pages or so, mostly because after a while I hated to see the poor guy kicked while he was down and frankly, Maurice and his cronies come across as rather smug, wrapping all their explanations in Jungean terms, but a lot of it seems to come down ""We did it because you're here, and because we could.""And boy, do they.  Clocking in at a bit over six hundred pages, it's probably a valid question to wonder how the heck Fowles manages to fill all that space up with mindgames.  Yet, he does.  Endless mindgames, to the point where it becomes useless to try and figure out what the ultimate reasoning is for anything and simply go with it.  If you've ever seen the 1997 Michael Douglas box office bomb ""The Game"" you may have some idea of what you're in for, as the shape of the games quickly becomes apparent.  Maurice tells Nicholas something, Nicholas doesn't believe it, events are manipulated so that it might be true, one of the lovely girls that hang out there admit that it's all a game and they're all playing parts, and then everything resets and you find out that all the stuff you were previously told about none of it being true wasn't true either.  There is a sense that Fowles is attempting to strip Nicholas down in layers, with Maurice as the catalyst, but a lot of it seems to boil down to how many scenarios he can concoct, with the book finally ending when he's run out of patience with his own literary gyrations (it should be noted that most versions of this novel that are out there are revised from the original publications, as Fowles wasn't happy with the first attempt and decided to tinker with some bits, with some of that tinkering apparently either changing or clouding some of the original intent).But he's good at constantly upping his own ante, escalating the intensity of the games with each succeeding variation, until it starts to seem actively dangerous, with people being drugged and beaten and kidnapped, until you just want to tell Nicholas to go back to England and get away from all this nonsense.  Without having to explain too much the mechanics of all this stuff it allows Fowles to go all out and do whatever the heck he wants, even it seems like a lot of money and time spent in pursuit of what later comes across as an oddly minor goal.  That alone keeps the book interesting, seeing what Fowles will come up with next but he does manage to ground in some semblance of humanity.  Nicholas reacts like an ordinary to most of this craziness and after a while you start to feel for him being way out of his depth.  His relationship with the twins comes across as touching at times, even as the motivations for everything just keep sifting and shifting, like realizing the wonderful beach you've discovered is actually hiding a giant worm underneath.  This grounding in Nicholas helps the book pivot because with everything else constantly being a lie, there's very little reason to get emotionally attached to anything here, as fifty pages after you learn about it you find out that it was all untrue.Still, he manages.  Nicholas' reaction to a long-distance suicide remains one of the book's best moments, both self-centered and numb, and the scenes where Nicholas starts to puzzle things out better carry a small sense of triumph after watching the poor guy get batted around like a cat's plaything for pages and pages (it's a measure of how much the book stacks the deck against itself that on two separate occasions Nicholas slaps a girl in the face and you can't a hundred percent say it's not deserved).  Fowles constantly evokes the magic and majesty of the setting, a feeling he's able to carry over when the action shifts back to England, draping everything in a sort of hazy mystique, as if Nicholas has crossed a fence into another land but hasn't bothered to look back to see the border.  All of this keeps it readable but can't quite disguise the factor that it's a lot of hullabaloo over what amounts to something fairly minor, and after a while you start to wonder if it the stated goal was worth all the effort it took to get there (especially since by the end it doesn't seem to have changed anything) and all the words that were spent in that effort.  It's clear to someone that Nicholas needs to change but Maurice and his band of merry misfits taking it upon themselves to arrogantly force the issue makes me want to root for Nicholas staying a complete tool that much more, which I'm not sure was Fowles' intent.  But then, maybe the whole thing is metaphorical in which case I suppose it worked out the way it was supposed to, a layer of misdirection where you're told it holds meaning from any angle but like the best magicians you're manipulated in such a way that you're only seeing the side the author wants you to see, with all the other facades hidden from view, and in doing so are convinced it was your idea the whole time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N4M2L10R3E3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316296198#wasThisHelpful","R3N4M2L10R3E3M","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Early on in Chris Ware's graphic novel ""Jimmy Corrigan"", there's a scene where Jimmy looks out his office window and sees a man dressed in a brightly colored superhero outfit standing on top of a tall building.  He waves and Jimmy waves back, only to watch as moments later the man takes a flying leap off the building to comically splat onto the street below, where people stare at the strange intrusion of color into their midst, before shrugging their shoulders and returning to whatever routine had just been interrupted.  In some sense that's an encapsulation of what superhero comics mean to people.  For some, they're a source of wonder, a minor sort of proof that the world may not be as boring as it seems to be on the surface, while for everyone else, its a bizarreness not even worth noticing until suddenly its in your way.To Joseph Kavalier and Samuel Clay, comics are both an outlet for wonder and an endless source of frustration, thwarting their dreams and fulfilling them at the same time.  Without them, they'd probably be two guys working on some mundane clock-punching job but every page they produce is a reminder that as successful as they are, they'll never get everything they're entitled to.There's a certain frustration involved in being good at something but being unable to make any money out of it, but it's even more grating to know you're only making a pittance compared to what you're really worth.  Such was the delightful comic book industry of the 1940s, where you could have million dollar ideas but still only make a fraction of what the company is making.  But with that the only game in town, its either that or nothing.  After all, what are you supposed to do: print it yourself?Chabon probably could have doubled the book's length and still not covered all the injustices done to the comic book creators of the early superhero days, all in the name of contracts and business, but in doing so he would have turned it into a book that most people would have assumed is about two suckers unable to tell the difference between a good contract and a bad contract.  Instead he goes a bit broader, trying to find the proof that everything can go wrong and yet still turn out okay, as long as you keep trying.  Even when the Senate is questioning you about possible homoerotic tendencies in your work (which, not that I'd want to do the committee's work for them, but turning the discerning eye of the government on Wonder Woman and her seemingly constant quest to get tied up in as many ways as possible would have raised a more delightful line of questioning).Sam Klayman is a young man with dreams of working in comics, with some good ideas but limited artistic ability.  When his cousin from Prague comes to live with him after escaping from the Nazis, the combination of Sam's flashy pulp ideas and Joseph's greater artistic skills winds up taking the form of the superhero the Escapist, the guy who escapes from things.  No odder than anything coming out from DC Comics at the time, it winds up being a hit for their company and the two men become two highly paid employees, even as they start to chafe against the boundaries imposed by their artistic medium and the conflicts that inevitably arrive as you grow up and start to figure out who you are when you aren't detailing the adventures of men in tights punching each other.As I noted, Chabon could have turned this into a lark and a cross-section of the comic book industry circa its early days as seen through these two men as they alternatively triumph and get screwed over.  And at times it does seem like he's giving a slightly skewed alternate history of the industry, with the Escapist joining the ranks of Superman and Batman as one the highest selling books, getting his own radio show and serial, as well as all the merchandising you can convince a child to buy.  He details how everything the men create is owned by their company, and whatever profits are sent their way are just scraps the company deigns to gift them with, taken away as easily as its given.  He uses their career to parallel the changes the comic industry saw in a rapid period of time, moving from rather simplistic stories to the shades of complexities that were seen later (and apparently turning Kavalier into Will Eisner in the process) and culminating in Wertham's ""Seduction of the Innocent"" (also known as ""All the Innuendo I See Is True"") bringing the party crashing down forever and forcing a G-rather phoenix to rise from the ashes.Anyone who has more than a passing knowledge of comic book history are going to find these sections very familiar (and somewhat watered down, for all their travails Kavalier and Clay get off far better than Superman creators Siegel and Shuster, who only received pensions after DC was publicly shamed into granting them a tiny slice of the mint they had already made off the character, or Batman co-creator Bill Finger, who died in alcoholic obscurity while Bob Kane got full credit thanks to having awesome laywers) and probably a little like ""Forrest Gump"", for better or for worse, as our heroes interact with various famous personages of the time.  Mentions of famous cartoonists like Caniff and Alex Raymond can come across like so much name dropping and there are times when I thought, ""Okay, I get you've done your research.""But even if as a cautionary tale of the comic book industry it has no new insights, where it succeeds is how it moves through the times and shows us how these men are dreaming both inside and beyond the limits of their society, trying to make the impossible come true in real life just as easily as they made it come true on the printed page.  And Chabon's great talent appears to be making the world come alive on the printed page as well, his prose darting along and dancing like a highwire act, stuffed so full of details of sight and smell and color and sound that you expect it to collapse under its own weight at any given second, bringing the plot to a leaden halt.  But he never lets it fall apart even when the story rambles along into tangents, even as we leave the menace and challenging exuberance of the World War Two years for the excitingly conformist 1950s.  It skips along through the years like a glider with a magnifying glass, showing us every detail even as it swoops overhead, hardly bothering to pause for a second to land.  Untethered it would be a shallow skimming, a checklist of Important Events that every novel dealing with this period of history feels compelled to touch upon.But we have Kavalier and we have Clay and in them we can understand the difference between the history you live and the history you read about.  How events far away that every schoolchild learns can have no impact at all on your life, until it does, and how something you can never hope to affect can drive everything you do in the mad striving to alter the inevitable by even the smallest fraction of an inch.  How the most important parts of history aren't the body counts, but the bodies that are never counted.  They stand affected and desperate and hoping, untouched and raw, torn by loss and praying for the smallest ounce of triumph to make the losses worthwhile, even as they know that some holes can't be filled in.  Chabon douses them in ink so thick that even when they no longer have pens in hand it stains them as much as blood would, with the only difference that blood will one day wash off while the ink never really leaves you.  He gives us a country gradually facing horror and reacting to it, and the men who attempted to funnel that terror and rage and helplessness into poorly printed pages, four color and yellowing year by year.  He shows us a medium coming to understand the limitless nature of its own creativity even as society seeks to squash it down, as if everything could be solved by everyone smiling all the time.  We see weird psychologies struggle and try to find voice in opposition to its own stilted boundaries, and the gap between the love you want and the love that satisfies, and how comfort can never make you happy.  He finds the place where magic stops being slight of hand and becomes myth, and how a myth is just a good story that's been around for a while.  He shows us men who tried to make new American myths to carry us through a dark time, and what happened when society tried to grind them up as a way of pretending that darkness didn't matter anymore.Its not about comics and its not about men and its not about history but instead balanced at the intersection of all three, careening down streets of fading neighborhoods and racing toward a future that all the hoping can never make happen, threatening to run you down even as it begs you to climb aboard, whispering the truth of the pages, that the panels we place between the borders are arbitrary, and can be easily altered, or discarded entirely, that we can be restricted on four sides and still have room to move forever outward.  That it sounds convincing is no surprise.  That we were never fully convinced is the real tragedy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZS715YAKTL9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312282990#wasThisHelpful","R2ZS715YAKTL9I","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barry Malzberg is not well-represented by the world of in-print things and I'm not even sure how well-know he is by the current generation of SF readers.  Most of his best novels (""Herovit's World"", ""Beyond Apollo"" and I have a soft spot for ""Galaxies"")  were written in the seventies and take some tracking down to find, although none are difficult to find or expensive, for those so inclined.  He was then, and continues to be now, a bit of an anomaly in the world of SF, a satirist flush with ideas, both hilariously funny and savagely downbeat.  His novels often take a situation that was becoming a fairly common SF cliche and destroys it with a thousand cuts, inverting it while taking it to offbeat extremes.  Most of this requires characters who are mentally unbalanced or somewhat unreliable, giving it the dual perspective of both critique and commentary, along with a fair shade of depressing nuttiness.  He's worth rediscovering, if only to see where the current crop of satirists probably learned their craft.With that said, having three of his novels in one place at least gives the reader a chance to figure out whether his style is worth the hunt.  None of these are his best work (for one, all of them are marred by so-so endings, but we'll get to that) but it gives you a good cross-section of what he's capable of, all of which seem to have a theme of people not succeeding, even while they're pretty sure they are succeeding.  Spoiler alert: they don't succeed.Of the three, ""Scop"" is the one that goes over the most familiar ground, a short novel where the title character spends his time attempting to stop terrible assassinations of the twentieth century, and repeatedly fails.  Most of the assassinations were ones that were recent for the time (both Kennedys, MLK) but Malzberg attacks them from unfamiliar angles (a brief scene with RFK dying in the hospital is particularly affecting) and while he gets some initial mileage out of the depressing hilarity of a time traveller failing again and again, but in different ways, Scop's determination eventually becomes somewhere between crazy and noble, a desperate attempt to prevent his own future and what he sees is a history built entirely on murder.  Less SF than commentary on the twentieth century and the mess it eventually became, he sees the people becoming less people than abstractions representing ideas as the gap of history keeps putting us further and further away from the events themselves, and in some ways the only way to stop them is to cause them all over again.  He packs a lot into a scant number of pages, switching perspectives and locations frequently and if the story more ends than finishes, that could be commentary itself or just Malzberg tacitly admitting he painted himself into a corner.  Fair enough.  I probably couldn't have done any better.For me, ""In the Enclosure"" has the best central premise, even if it was probably more radical when the story was first written.  A ship of aliens crash-lands on Earth and are immediately captured and stuck inside an enclosed camp while therapists and scientists pump them for every last stray bit of information about their technology.  Every day.  For years.  The problem is that the aliens don't remember their own world and are aware their memories have been deliberately erased, even while they are compelled to relay whatever information is needed.  That's the central mystery here but from another perspective Malzberg does a neat thing and turns the typical curiosity of the human race that you normally see in SF into something much darker.  The aliens are kept in a prison with no hope of escape, bribed with treats and perks and made to work against each other to keep everyone in line, all so the humans can strip-mine them of knowledge and use it for their own purposes, all the while claiming its for the good of the human race.  He grasps the tediousness of prison, the mundane routines, the decisions between being comfortable and being free, and that little bit of Stockholm Syndrome that starts to creep in when you look at your captor and think maybe he isn't so bad, maybe he's just doing his job, maybe all this information can really help them so you're doing a good thing after all.  When he's capturing those shifting mentalities, the book really comes alive as it attacks the notion that we're always the good guys and we always have the best interests of everyone at heart.  It doesn't turn the humans into total aliens, but it does turn us into total jerks.As the notions of escape and the mystery of why the aliens have been sent start to take over the narrative, it becomes that much more important for the novel to give us a really interesting twist and while I thought I had some pretty decent theories (they're tricking the earth into softening the planet for an invasion, they're from the future and trying to make sure its brought about) the end result winds up being strangely straightforward, not that far away from something Kurt Vonnegut would have done, a build-up to an absurd whimper but a bit of a ""let's kick him while he's down"" thrown in.  It winds up not being as revelatory as you hope, but there's a charm (if that's the word) in the desperation of getting there.The title story is probably the most cracked, as Commander Folsom and his small crew land on another world to integrate it into the Federation, their mission to communicate with the local aliens and educate them, get them ready to deal with Earth.  Except things have already gone wrong, or maybe they haven't, the crew is acting strange, or maybe the Commander is just seeing them as strange, and Earth isn't being helpful at all, sending back odder and odder messages (my favorite being: ""Is something seriously wrong with you"" in response to a rather mundane question).  The natives are somewhere between learning and being taught, or maybe they're teaching the crew.  Oh, and there's a magic rock.  This one comes the closest to being Malzberg in his prime, with a narrator who is quite possibly out of his mind and with everything filtered through that perspective you either have to go with it or puzzle out what is really going on.  Which, given you're on alien world in the future, means you have about zero frame of reference.  The Commander is convinced the weird stuff is all perfectly normal and the normal stuff is the mission going off the rails, and with the tensions rising between the crew and the natives and him you realize that none of this is going anywhere good.  The fact that Malzberg makes this readable is his insistence on keeping everything from Folsom's perspective and winding the crazy tighter and tighter so that by the time things go really nuts you're already so immersed that its both familiar and inevitable.  It's like being psychedelic without the drugs so you don't get the benefit of being high while everything goes bizarre around you.  Space makes you crazy, Malzberg seems to suggest, but you'll be the last one to recognize it.  The ending muffs it slightly, bringing in a twist that is sort of telegraphed but actually seems normal compared to all the wackiness that preceded it.It seems odd to recommend something that isn't the author's finest work, but even second-tier Malzberg is worth reading, especially with the scarcity of his in-print material.  But there's a focus here on the underside of SF, not just the seamy, gritty end of things but the flip side of the shadows created by the bright ideas and the boundless optimism.  In his world, other planets are okay and the future, too, as long as you're adjusted to it.  But the only way to really adjust is to become unhinged.

"Because part of me is perpetually ten years old, I will always be a sucker for ""Lost World"" type novels, all those stories of people winding up on remote islands or lost continents or hidden sections of the Arctic and finding a land full of extinct creatures, especially dinosaurs, who make everything better simply by being large and scaly and awesome in a way that mythological creatures so rarely are.For me, the better examples of this sub-genre of pseudo-science adventure are the ones written in the early days of the last century (or the waning days of the century before) simply because in a world that hadn't been fully explored it seemed quite plausible that one day we would come across a previously unknown continent teeming with life no one had ever imagined.  And since Australia was already settled, people had to look elsewhere.  I have no idea how much the authors themselves believed in their own concepts but the possibilities of the thinking of the time in context seems to add an extra weight and charm to the proceedings.  Much like when everyone believed there was potentially life on Mars, that veneer of possible reality, no matter how far-fetched, tickled a sense of adventure that went a little bit beyond entertainment.  These days, we have Dan Brown.  You make the call.For most people, Burroughs is the guy who created Tarzan and is indirectly responsible for the movie about John Carter, although we really can't hold that against him.  But like many other pulp writers, he churned out stories like a fiend.  Not everything was the same decent quality but some of the stories have enough imagination and flair to lift them above the more pedestrian stuff.  This is one that people tend to remember fondly, basically a novel in three parts (despite the habit of publishers at one point to split it like a trilogy, which anyone making the mistake of reading them separately will realize makes no sense) and all of them involving the same wonderful land where men get to be men, women get to be like men except when they need to be ladies, and there's plenty of creatures about lusting for combat.While it's fairly easy to dump a bunch of guys in a mysterious land filled with dinosaurs, it's not as easy as you'd think to make it interesting and even harder to make it entertainment.  There's a fine line to walk between having the heroes fight an endless parade of monsters and turning the novel into a travelogue as the author checks off the places he's made up to ensure said heroes visit every single one.  Splitting the novel up actually covers both bases . . . if he tried to tell it as one sustained four hundred page narrative, the pace would no doubt falter and you'd start to get dinosaur fatigue.  By giving each section its own protagonist (with a lady to liven things up) and area of the land to explore, we get to essentially hit the reboot button every hundred and fifty pages or so and start fresh with a clean slate, ready to go diving into savage combat again.  This allows Burroughs to vary the scenery and perils . . . by populating Caspak with several different tribes of people, all at various stages of evolutionary development, not only does he give the reader a built-in mystery but it ensures everyone isn't having the same converation over and over again.Which is good, because you wonder when everyone has time to stop and talk.  As it typical with a pulp novel, the action more or less hits the ground running and never lets up, but not where you'd expect.  Starting out by staking out its place in the ultra-narrow genre of WWI-submarine-mysterious island adventures, our heroes set out on a cruise before running into a pesky German U-boat (one of the interesting aspects of this, as SF-esque WWI adventures aren't super common, especially in this case where the Great War is still fresh in everyone's memories).  The submarine shennanigans go on longer than you'd expect but once they hit the island the story becomes all business.Each of the parts has its own charms.  The first has the submarine hijinks and a sort of fun opposites attract subplot.  The narrator for the second segment is a bit more level-headed and features some explanations for the weird mystery of how the different tribes are connected.  The third dispenses with first person entirely but has some eerie set-pieces (set in the city with the flying people, reminiscent of the strange creatures from Gene Wolfe's ""Book of the Short Sun"" series) and probably ventures the closest to the Conan the Barbarian territory before wrapping everything up with an explanation that is rooted in science at the time (i.e. it makes little sense but I give him credit for trying instead of saying ""it's magical!"").  The little links disguise the fact that we're basically reading three novellas and almost wallpaper over the fact that we're essentially reading the same plot three times (burly man gets lost, finds attractive woman and falls in love, fights off creatures, makes friends along the way).  What distinguishes it is Burroughs strong sense of place and eye for detail, rendering a land that is lush and dangerous, flush with mystery and a chance for a man to survive on his own wits.  Burroughs won't win any fancy prose awards (although the third part has some startling scenes and desciptions, including a particularly gruesome and brutal bayonet stabbing) but it's that unflagging pace that keeps you reading (if one were so inclined this is the kind of book that could be devoured) and if there's anything that attacts us to it today, it may because it triggers the faint hope that in a world that has been explored and satellite mapped to the nth degree, there may remain pockets that exist purely to be discovered, and mysteries yet to be plumbed, dark places on the rustling underside of memory, just out of reach.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUSSL2COQJZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803261543#wasThisHelpful","R1EUSSL2COQJZ1","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a Magnetic Fields song called ""I Wish I Had An Evil Twin"", in which the singer fantasizes about how great it would be if his evil twin did exist, since then he could do all kinds of bad things and the twin would (probably gladly) take the blame.  Which raises the question, ""what makes the bad twin"" and although this book was written way before that song came out, you wonder if it's the kind of thing he had in mind.  Or maybe he never even read it.  No one ever asks the hard questions.Subtitled ""A confession"", Roth's book here takes a rather absurd premise and then proceeds to both play it straight and play it for laughs, just not when you expect.  In it, he discovers that a man who is calling himself Philip Roth and seems to look just like him has been going around promoting the idea that the Jews should all leave Israel and go back to where they were originally from.  Because he is a well known and widely respected author (hey, he did write the book), the concept is getting some press and traction, and the regardless of what the real Philip Roth thinks of the idea, he can't go around having someone pretending he's saying stuff.  So he goes out to stop him.What happens is he winds up going to Israel to cover the trial of a suspected concentration camp guard , and runs into his double, who is still going around promoting his bizarre idea of everyone clearing out of Israel and really doesn't seem to mind being constantly mistaken for the ""real"" Philip Roth.  Against this backdrop Roth debates the nature of the contemporary Jewish experience, among other things, and gets involved in a strange variety of escapades, some involving Palestinians, or Jews who are sympathetic to the Palestinian plight, or maybe secret agents, or merely trying to figure out what one does with a million dollars that one never asked for.This is one of those novels that if you don't understand the context of it, a lot of it is probably going to slide right off you.  I'm fairly new to Roth and from what little I've read, this one seems to go out of its way to synthesize his usual themes of his relationship with Jewish culture, with writing and being a writer, with the relationship of Jews to history and rest of the world, as well as a semi-tongue in cheek analysis of his own quirks.  It's a lot to toss into one novel and as the novel careens from one scenario to another, you start to wish it had just a little more focus.  At times the situation with the fake Philip Roth is played absolutely straight and other times it veers toward metaphor (although it does become haunting when the character seems to dissolve from the narrative in the style of something from Paul Auster, leaving Roth to chase the remnants of a ghost around an ancient city), both commentary and criticism.  Other times the novel focuses with a laser-like intensity on what it means to be Jewish in the modern world, especially in the context of Israel, and long passages are devoted to Roth's (or at least his fictional persona) thoughts and the contrasting thoughts of other characters.  The novel doesn't lack for points of views, but if you don't understand who John Demjanjuk was (and why his trial was a big deal) or the significance of finding diaries from Leon Klinghoffer then even having a passing knowledge of the conflict between the Jews and the Palestinians isn't going to ground you enough.  There's a specificity to it that roots it to a certain time and place, and even if some of the issues are still lingering today, this is enough of a snapshot that the ultimate impact can remain elusive, like looking at a picture from a hundred years ago and thinking that the point of the shot is that everyone dressed funny that day.But as much as Roth bounces around Israel the novel isn't content to stay in one place for very long.  Small doses remain fascinating as there's a number of monologues and passages that remind you how frighteningly good he is at coming up with tightly wound speeches that only seem to come across as rambling and  improvised.  The hints of secret agent spy conspiracy stuff adds a little bit of zest to the proceedings but ultimately there are quite a few times when it seems that unless you're Philip Roth or writing a psychological analysis of said Mr Roth, you might not get what you should out of this book.  It seems keenly attuned to his own sensibilities, so much that it makes it hard to connect at times.  It can cause your attention to drift, waiting for something to grasp onto (thanks to being distracted due to moving to a new home and preparing for a wedding I almost forgot key points to the plot . . . fortunately he rehashes the plot about halfway through, almost as if he expected this).  There's a definite amusement factor to seeing his frustrations with having a double who seems to have the opposite of his point of view wandering around the city but I can't find myself feeling that bad for him, especially as the odor of post-modern meta-ness hovers over the entire affair.  I can be engaged with the issues at hand but the story itself sometimes eluded me, too often you're questioning how much of this is artifice and how much is sincerity.  Moments when Roth pretends to be his double make you wonder if he's doing it for the irony factor, or if its somehow a depiction of his own changing views on the subject, or if it's all to make you question whether he's questioning himself and its all part of the overlying conceit.  Which may be what makes or breaks the book for most people.  If the author is going to play games with you, there are worse things than being toyed with by a master at the craft, but if the ultimate stakes are seeing Philip Roth's miserable no good very bad post-modern day, you have to shift your expectations slightly and resign yourself to enjoying the smaller moments, and let the complexities of the background stay too big to be fully seen.  Which he probably intended as well, darn it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJAMO9LCNMKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679750290#wasThisHelpful","RYJAMO9LCNMKY","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's something charming in discovering how in pre-WWI society, everyone is so unfailingly polite to each other, even they're mercilessly stabbing everyone in the back.  If you thought your high school contained high drama, narrator John Dowell is here to show you that when people of the early 20th century ruined each other's lives, they did it with a sense of class.I read a good chunk of this while standing just outside a concert.  Not needing to see, I stood in the foyer, leaning up against the wall with earplugs in.  Separated from sound until it was a shifting melodic roar and eliminating nearly all conversations, its weird to say this, but it might have been the most fitting way to read this novel, standing both immersed and apart inside a crowd I only had the barest connection to.  In the same way, the book exists inside groups, standing solitary while remaining oblivious to the damage going on around it.  I was engrossed, and the band wasn't half bad either.Written almost a hundred years ago, this is one of those novels that seems to have been fairly famous in its day and then everyone went and forgot about it until it turns up on a ""Best of 20th Century"" list and sends people scrambling to find out more about this book they've never heard of.  I had heard of Ford Maddox Ford because of his delightfully catchy name and his large set of novels ""Parade's End"", mostly because large novels catch my eye.  I had expected this one to be a WWI-set tale not unlike Dos Passos' ""Three Soldiers"".  Instead, its the story of four people, three of whom lie to each other a lot to get what they want and thus wind up with nothing at all like what they want, and one person who is hilariously clueless, until someone painstakingly explains it all to him, leaving him just as miserable as the rest of them.The novel is billed from the very first line as ""The saddest story I've heard"", but its not so much sad as deserved, as shallow people make ill-informed decisions to further their own short-sighted and petty desires, then wind up suffering for it.  ""Sad"" would imply some kind of tragedy, but here everyone seems like a willing participant, at least until things go south and the piper, as they say, must be paid.The novel is narrated by essentially the last man standing and to me, the narration is what makes the book.  Ford's ""voice"" for Dowell is extraordinary in how normal and conversational it sounds, capturing perfectly the shell-shocked tones of a man who just realized he was living someone else's lie for over ten years and is forced to reevaluate everything he knew.  As such, he's a bit of a sad sack, having been treated like a doormat by his wife and then cheated on anyway, with someone who is way more of a man than he is.  That wussiness can get in the way in the early stages of the novel, as there's more of a self-pitying tone as he sorts himself out to tell the story (if one wished to make a drinking game out of how many times the word ""poor"" appears in proximity to his wife's name ""Florence"", even the hardiest of spring break champions would find themselves being treated for severe alcohol poisoning) and coupling that with a slight long-winded style can make for rough going in parts.But stick with it and slowly it starts to grab you.  The people in question aren't necessarily people you want to hang out with, given the choices of Dowell's wife Florence (a lying monument to opposites not attracting), the ""my way or the highway"" Leonora or her husband, the good soldier himself, virile and manly Edward, whose goal in life it seems is to sleep his way through the entire population of the surrounding area but feel marvelous conflicted about it later.  But stiff upper lip and all that, old bean.  But when they all meet and become friends, it seems like nothing more than a lifetime of air kisses (or however people greeted each other when Prussia still existed), at least until the amount of air between kisses becomes very little indeed.Dowell takes us through every step of this in glorious detail, spinning a rambling narrative that you don't realize is being precisely controlled and his constant skipping back and forth over the years, filling in and revising as details come back to haunt his memory, mimics the way that people tell stories in real life, eschewing anything resembling a linear progression of events as he gets to the good stuff, then steps back to give it some context and then fills in what remains, all the while maintaining an air of swiftly dissipating disbelief even as the reader wants to smack him and say, ""How the heck didn't you notice?"".  Except he's already pulled you in.  The salacious details are mannered but often surprising in the degree of emotional brutally occurring under the noses of everyone else and what's most startling to me is the heat that Dowell brings to the narrative, occasionally bursting out with instances of raw emotion, as more than once he talks about how he hates a person (such as his wife), both for being weak and for what they've done to him.  We could have had it all, he seems to want to say, if you all weren't so bloody stupid.What sticks with me is not only how complete this all feels, that we're taken into a world that has long vanished forever and in those pages is just as real as the world outside my house, but how Ford doesn't shy away from the ripple effects of all these people acting like jerks.  There's a true cost to these proceedings and while the outcomes seem inevitable, as the story moves toward an actual body count that doesn't involve the principals, you keep waiting for someone, anyone, to open their eyes and drag these people back to their senses.  Except, it's all terribly too late.  In the end you're reading merely to find out if it all doesn't turn out as badly as you expect, and when that winds up being a false hope, you hope that someone makes it out intact.I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you that absolutely no one gets what they want but they all fail to get what they want in spectacularly different ways.  The devastation is complete, with Dowell wandering through the mess that everyone left behind, ears still ringing and blood and soot covering his torn clothing, attempting to make sense of the destruction and wondering if being a survivor is still a consolation prize for discovering what manner of fool you are.  I expected this novel to be quaint in its way, these well-off people acting frivolous and free, not realizing the horror that would be bearing down upon the continent in just a few years.  Instead it seems to be ""The Great Gatsby"" taken a step further, with rich people doing whatever they want, except instead of scampering back off to their great glitzy castles without a scratch, everyone's a casualty.  Its not the inevitability of it that haunts me, but the very fact that after a certain point you have no choice but to perceive it as inevitable that gets me.  I shouldn't care about any of these privileged, selfish people, but when I finished it, I thought ""what a sad, terrible waste"" and therein lies the trick of a novel.  To see the tragedy in mis-spent lives is to believe they had some potential to begin with, one that was squandered for reasons that any child could see would lead to nothing good.  To find the humanity in people who insist on wrecking themselves on the shore of their own lives is a rare trait, but to make you see where the humanity might have been and make you feel the ache for the loss is rarer still.  There is grace in the graceless, unseen sometimes until its laid open and bare.  It makes the story worth rediscovering, or better yet, not letting it become forgotten.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MRP8TYIU45LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679722181#wasThisHelpful","R2MRP8TYIU45LX","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Judging by the cover of the book, the title should be ""Thursday Nights at the Hefner Household"".  I hate to disappoint people who rely on their book covers to give them an accurate reflection of the contents, there is no rich people's blind grope-a-thon party taking place here.  If that should sour your prejudgement of the novel, then so be it.  At least someone was kind enough to warn you.There are times I think that Banville reads with utter glee the reviews of his own novels, rubs his hands together while cackling and says, ""Think that last one was ambiguous and oblique?  You ain't seen nothing yet!""  Only with a cool accent (I assume he speaks with an accent, at least to these American ears).  Then he comes out with something else delightfully enigmatic, with that finely tuned prose laid so softly that you can easily hear the gnashing of teeth from people attempting to ""get"" it.If you're someone who likes to feel like you're on a similar wavelength to whatever the author is transmitting, this one is probably going to frustrate you.  I can't even say it's his most evasive plot, as I thought ""Athena"" was as solid as fraying gossamer and from I remember of ""Book of Evidence"" I suspect I'd have a different interpretation of the book if I read it a second time.  The plot itself, or what persists of it, is fairly straightforward: Alexander Cleave, former famous actor, comes back to his old house and decides to get lost in memories.  Along the way he hangs out with the guy who takes care of the house and his teenage daughter.  He argues with his wife.  He waits for his daughter.  Things happen without really happening.  At some point, life happens, or at least Banville's fractured stained glass version of life, pristine from a distance.  It's only when you get close enough that you can see where the moisture is starting to seep in.If there's one word to describe the book, it's probably ""static"".  We're not quite at Beckett levels but from a very real standpoint the book is completely wrapped in words.  Snatches of dialogue poke through, like that one Pink Floyd album everyone likes but for the most part the voice that breaks through is that of the narrator, telling us about himself.  But like most Banville narrators he's not exactly vibrant and full of zest, instead for the most part he's clinical and slightly distant, speaking with a precise diction that lights a slow fire without ever bursting into screams, like that weird town in Pennsylvania that never stops burning underground.  You can see the signs that things are getting hot and that someday something bad is going to happen but for the most part, it's not so bad to visit.None of this would have a prayer of working if Banville didn't have such control of his prose.  While his narrators are often cut from the same dry cloth, he's often able to shade things so that one can never be mistaken for the other.  His other characters might have given off a tinge of menace, but here Cleave comes across as both weary and sad, wandering through the haunted rooms of his own life and not sure if he's become a ghost himself or he's doing a fairly good impression of one.  Along the way he treats us to scenes from his life, memories, ruminations, like someone who has dumped out all the contents of his life onto the floor and is trying to figure out whether it's worth sorting out or if he should just chuck it all in and say the heck with it.  As such, you're not dealing with a conventional plot and any enjoyment of this is going to depend on how much you tune into Banville's ""voice"" via Cleave, as all the events come across as somewhat incidental, stray instances from a life that has been in the process of slowing down.  If you're like me and you enjoy his writing style, you could read about him describing the exits on a highway all day and derive some interest out of it.  If you're waiting for a plot or mystery to kick in, you're in for a long wait.  He throws in ghosts and hints of buried memories but those come across as feints, something to keep the kiddies interested as he digs deep into the character.  There's even an undercurrent of ""Waiting for Godot"", as he and his wife alternate waiting for their daughter to arrive from wherever she is, talking about her as if she's right outside.That alone probably keeps the novel from being as effective as it could be.  It hums along pleasantly enough but as soon as it starts to gather enough mass to steer itself into the direction of Cleave actively affecting events as opposed to merely drifting through his memories, the book is practically over.  A late tragic event shows that Banville still retains his ability to infuse some good old fashioned emotional power into the proceedings, as we're touched by the death of someone we never even meet.  But is the point of the book to lead up to all that, or are we meant to find other reasons and meanings in the displays?  It's hard to say, and as typical for Banville, he's not quite saying.  Sometimes his prose seems to me a wondrous approximation of a version of life infused with a shimmering poetry, all ice vowing never to be melted.  And for all the seemingly aimlessness of its episodic structure, this is one of his few books that is willing to let that ice crack slightly, and allow a little blood to seep to the surface.  Only a little, and you have to stick with it to find it but its enough to remind you that a heart can exist underneath those stacked prisms and its more than an empty construction of exquisite words.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY4683K9XDZZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375725296#wasThisHelpful","RY4683K9XDZZS","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I think the hardest concept to explain to people who don't write about the act of writing itself is the idea of presentation, that just because a story essentially boils down to ""this happened, then this happened, then this happened, and then it turned out it was the dog all along"" doesn't mean you have to write it that way.  Many a person has an amazing idea for a plot but doesn't quite grasp that you can tell me what happened, but that doesn't mean I'm going to find it all that interesting if you don't dress it up a little bit.  Good ideas don't automatically translate into gripping reading.  Just like my parents told me when I drew my awesome schematics for my volcano science project in elementary school: if you want it to come out right, you're going to have to put some effort into it.Banville seems to understand effort.  In fact, sometimes he comes across as having made it his life's goal to make us aware of just how many words exist in the English language, and how they can be used in a sentence.  I'd be surprised if he ever used the same description twice, at least not intentionally.  It makes for oddly rich reading, as if every other author you've been reading prior to this has only be using half the colors available in the palette, like Dorothy wandering out into Oz.However, there is a fairly thin line between ""marvelously descriptive"" and ""tediously overwritten"".  That line is probably going to be different for everyone depending on your taste and there's probably a subset of people trying to read any of his novels that is tempted to throw it across the room in frustration screaming, ""Just say he's in a hotel room already!""  Still, it is difficult to call a novel that is a hair under two hundred and fifty pages ""bloated"" by any yardstick and points to one of Banville's greatest strengths: it's not how many words you know, it's knowing the right place to use them.Thus: the plot.  A semi-crooked man with a shady past who narrates our story is recruited by even shadier people to authenticate some paintings they have stashed away and are probably not planning on selling to the local gallery.  Meanwhile, he runs into a woman and becomes obsessed with her, despite knowing absolutely nothing about her, not even her name.  Sometimes it seems like the cops are onto him, sometimes it seems like he's in a dangerous world that has put him in over his head.  Meanwhile, he's tangled up in prose.  Oh, and his aunt is sick.See, that doesn't sound terribly exciting.  Mix some of the basic elements up and add about seven hundred pages and it could be William Gaddis' ""The Recognitions"", but with a slightly higher chance for car chases (don't get your hopes up, though).  Yet Banville manages to make it all compelling through the use of his prose, which seems determined to plunge the reader into a languid, dream-like affair, held together by a narrator who seems to drift in and out of his own story, sometimes settling into a scene with a startlingly concrete presence, and other times anchored to absolutely nothing at all.  There's hints that he could be the same narrator that graced some of Banville's other novels but that's not really a requirement here (good, because I read those several years back and don't remember the details), instead you're just asked to go along with events, like being blindfolded with a ratty cloth and forced to fill in the details from the splashes of blurry light that you catch as you're jostled down dingy hallways, all the while listening to someone describe to you exactly what he sees.  Thing is, he could be lying.  Or maybe you just can't see very well.Plunging us in a world where it seems to be constantly on the verge of dusk no matter what time of day it is, there isn't much to grasp and so the book has to succeed on both mood and pacing.  Which it does.  The hazy nature of the narrative allows Banville to shift the scene pretty much at will, and when we're tired of the elusive sexual shenanigans of our narrator and his single-lettered sort of lover, we can have some criminals show up.  And when the vague hints of something bad about to happen linger for too long and start to lose their edge, maybe some police inspectors can come by, or we have some fun with his dying aunt.  In a sense it becomes not unlike a playland created by children under a blanket, where every fold can bring about another scene no matter which way you turn, held together by a playful dream-logic where everything makes sense because absolutely nothing makes sense.  It doesn't go to David Lynch levels of absurdist surrealism, but it seems to hover right on the edge of it, with one foot existing enough in the real world that we can start to think, ""oh, maybe this is really happening.""It's not even the kind of story where you mind that the ending isn't so much an ending as everyone deciding the story is over, like parents calling all their kids back into the house because it's getting late.  There's a risk with this of letting the story go on for too long that all the ambiguity becomes more annoying than anything else.  At this length, all the muscles and tendons lay nicely over the skeleton, with the increasingly unhinged reviews of paintings I've never seen a particular highlight, as the narrator feels things boiling to a fever pitch, even if the fever winds up becoming dissipated in a chill night.  But it hardly matters.  The images linger, like being surprised that a hand pressed that lightly into skin can leave such a mark.  It's a testament to how just any old set of words won't do, and even if the narrator never seems to be totally in control, you never doubt that the author is.  Skill and craft do count for something.  If I tried to write a story based on this plot, it would come across as an inept documentary put together by well-meaning preschoolers.  In his hands, it winds up being the dream that doesn't quite startle you enough to wake you up, but lingers long enough to make you wonder if you ever did wake up completely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8VESFB8IGRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679736859#wasThisHelpful","R2L8VESFB8IGRC","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What is this, like book thirteen?  At some point Miles is going to start running out of life events for us to witness.  Though it seems that Bujold is aware that for new readers, realizing they're stepping way into a saga can be a daunting prospect.  Especially in this case, where a good eight years separated this novel from ""Diplomatic Immunity"".  A lot of curious new readers were possibly going to be stepping but for the old fans there needs to be some sense of forward progression.  This series has always maintained the feel of life, in its ebbs and flows, in its breakneck rush and hideous stasis.But life isn't the same as life-changing and her tactic here is to show us a Miles that seems settled into his new maturity and his job as Auditor, enjoying the work for its variety and not relishing the times when it takes him far from home, but also rather looking forward to the change of pace.  This time the job takes him to the planet of Kibou-daini, a world where everyone tries to cheat death via large corporations dealing in cryotechnology, freezing people before or just after they die in the hopes of reviving them years later when their illnesses can be cured, or a way to reverse aging has been perfected.  One of the corporations is attempting to expand into the Barrayaran world of Komarr and as this seems rather fishy, Miles is dispatched to check out what the heck is going on.  As always, it gets complicated.And yet, not as complicated as it has in the past.  Sending Miles to yet another new world gives Bujold a chance to refresh and surround him with a new cast, and other than his armsman (who has appeared in at least one previous story) for the most part everyone here is new, giving the reader new perspectives on Miles (especially as this is the oldest we've seen him yet, married and with several children who are quickly getting bigger) along with the change of pace.  We get one notable guest-star (or a pair of them) later in the piece, and what impresses about their use is how Bujold has such a refined cast that they can act as a sort of repertoire, good enough to act on their own and carry the tale but also capable of being dropped in when the story calls for it to liven up the affair.  This ability to mix and match only proves how deep her bench has become, when the appearance here would have once been a big deal and now is just a routine development in the story.  Everyone's getting older.And yet, thanks to her use of young boy Jin as a point of view character, the average age of everyone involved is a bit younger.  Jin's mom is missing, perhaps frozen, and as she was an activist of sorts chances are it has something to do with the shadiness that's about to go down.  Having a good chunk of the story seen through his eyes helps the new reader get a sense of what this Miles guy is all about, without bogging them down in the now rather extensive backstory of the series, all of which seems relevant at any given point in time.  Between him and his sister, Bujold writes convincing young children, capable enough to not be totally helpless or come across as tiny adults but never childish enough to be annoying.  Having armsman Roic also lending his perspective isn't as effective, as armsmen never seem to have rich inner lives, but it does vary the approach somewhat.In the midst of all this we have the plot, and for once there is a plot, although in typical loose late-period Bujold fashion it winds up being a series of circumstances that Miles gradually unravels to reveal the deeper plot.  The effect is of a spoiler stepping in to mess everything up and with the book starting essentially in media res, it gives the impression of attacking things from one angle when the end result winds up being completely different.  Miles isn't without resources anymore and while he does more flying by the seat of his pants than is sometimes necessary, he also has a deeper pool of assistance to draw upon as well.Still, any return after an eight year gap is going to have the feel of rust being shaken off and that's no exception here.  While Miles and the various members of the cast are capable, the world here never comes as alive as Komarr or Barrayar has in the past and half the fun in a Bujold novel is reveling in the setting.  She seems to be shooting for a commentary on the practices of big banks and financial houses, with the frozen citizens still getting a vote that belongs to the big corporations (and a revelation that they may not have as many votes as they thought) but after having been immersed so deeply in both Barrayar and Miles' various life changes, dialing things back to a business as usual degree winds up making the proceedings pale a bit to what has come before.  Keep in mind that I'm comparing this book to novels that would be considered a high point for any writer, so it's not totally fair, especially as Bujold hasn't lost any of her touch for pacing or humor, keeping the plot galloping along with its various twists and turns.  The stakes are much lower here, Miles needs to save the day because that's what he does but there's very little doubt that he'll pull it off.  That invincible sense coupled with the feel of a well-oiled machine minus the slightly anarchic spirit that characterized the early novels saps a little bit of the excitement out of it, but on one level it means that the series is growing  up.  Become surer of itself, yes, but also a little bit safer.That of course is before Bujold pulls the rug out from under the reader on the very last page.  One of the things that was surprising about reading the novel is how much it wasn't a meditation on aging and mortality, while the characters acknowledge that they, and the people they know, are getting older, there never seems to be a deep discussion on what that all means.  Which is to say that Bujold rarely writes ""issue"" books.However, all the deep emotion that might have been missing from the preceding pages comes back in full force, smuggled inside an otherwise innocuous sentence.  She reminds you that bad news never decides to wait until you're ready for it and sharpens the blow by having the conversation that precedes it be so blissfully, startlingly normal.  It's a nod to the longtime readers, for whom the impact of the scene will have its greatest effect, rewarding those who have been following from the beginning, although the award may be bittersweet at best.  Her decision to wrap the novel up with a series of short hundred word vignettes, each one from a different perspective, may be the best way to split the difference.  Having an entire novel to deal with the aftermath would have been almost unbearable sentimental and sad, but skipping over it entirely would lessen the weight.  This way concentrates the emotions into five bursts, all of which sting acutely and capture the feeling as a quick sketch of a bird would, the eye completes what the hand cannot fully relate.  Its a masterful feat, bringing the longtime readers in to share in the now substantial history of this series, while also taking the opportunity amidst the sadness to invite the new readers as well, saying to them in effect: see how these people are?  See what you missed?  Doesn't that make you want to go back and see how it all started?It's a shame we won't get to see the events followed up for a while (the next book takes place earlier and seems to star mostly Ivan) but it continues to show how remarkable this series is, how it can work on more than one level and yet remain accessible to people for whom all the Vorness might otherwise run all together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CEE4H6AJ1E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451637500#wasThisHelpful","R30CEE4H6AJ1E6","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Turns out making one more or less stand-alone does seem to make a difference.Thus far in the life of Miles, we've seen him go from being a child to a fake admiral, to a secret agent/fake admiral, to a dead fake admiral, to the emperor's troubleshooter and in his latest endeavor, a married man.  What other obstacles can there left for such a man?How about: children!  As things open, newlyweds Miles and Ekaterin are just finishing up their honeymoon and getting ready to head back to Barrayar in time to witness the birth of their children (in Bujold's universe, babies are born in safe replicators and not torn from a woman's body, to which men are probably like ""wusses"" and women punch those men in the nether regions in reply).  All is going well until a message from Emperor Gregor requires Miles to detour to Quaddiespace to solve a diplomatic incident before it becomes a shooting incident.  From the sound of it, Miles can sort it out in a day or so and then be back on his way in no time.  Easy, right.  Until it stops being easy.The Quaddies, for those not versed in the Bujold-verse, are descendents of the protagonists in her novel ""Falling Free"" which depicted how genetically engineered people designed to work in zero-gravity environments got their freedom and went very far away.  Much like their name suggests, quaddies have extra arms in place of their legs and there's some early mileage from the Barrayaran culture shock of seeing what they consider mutants roaming about without a care in the world.Miles is initially given the impression that the issue is merely a combination of desertion and boorish behavior on the part of the visitors and once he unruffles some feathers and pays some fines everyone can be on their way.  Except he can't find a missing soldier and has to keep digging deeper.  Which of course is when all the fun happens.  But this time, there's the extra special bonus of having his wife along.This one feels like a concerted attempt to return to the business as usual far flung space adventures of yore, when Miles was a bratty short punk breaking all the rules and surviving by the skin of his soft, soft bones.  As such it often feels like Bujold has to shake out the rust or she just isn't sure how to get the tone right now that everyone is old and mature.  A guest appearance by everyone's favorite person of indeterminate gender feels like an attempt to recapture the good old days but for one reason or another this one feels . . . off.  At least in the beginning.Even at their most relaxed paces Bujold's novels often felt tightly wound, constantly uncurling and bursting with a sense of motion that we can't even see until the plot exposes enough of it.  The urgency came from the constant wondering of which way Miles was going to jump as the situation changed on the ground, and how that situation would twist and turn.  For a good two-thirds of the beginning the story feels like it's mostly vamping, as Miles wanders around investigating what happened to the missing soldier, trying to get another soldier out of prison and not shot for desertion, and argues with the quaddies.  There's hints that more is going on, but mostly because you're over a hundred pages in and Miles hasn't figured it out yet.  Even someone getting shot at doesn't ramp up the tension.  Bujold's such a professional that all of this comes across as entertaining in little moments but where before we'd get caught up in the great sway of events and marvel at the little dots of humor along the way this one does feel like it's marking time.  Maybe it's because the quaddies are so nice, for people who never have a problem reaching an itchy spot.Fortunately the real threat kicks at about that two-thirds point and suddenly the novel becomes the Bujold we all know and love.  Once events start happening and collapsing, it all happens stupidly fast, which makes you wonder why it took so long to get to this point.  Those sequences show that she's lost none of her touch for action, putting everyone in mortal peril, giving him an enemy both crazy and smart and worth sparring with, and actual stakes, both local and political.But even so they lack that certain special vibe that we've come to appreciate from Bujold, especially in Miles' stories.  Maybe it's because after several books focusing on Miles' maturity and growth, switching back to pure adventure feels like diluting the series somewhat.  Ekaterin, having married the little lug, seems to get relegated to adoring wife and supporting role at the same time . . . still in the honeymoon period everything is lovely and with the births happening somewhere else it's not like they're ever in danger.  Not giving her a point of view here, as we got in the last few books, seems a mistake . . . contrast the Ekaterin we see here with the masterful depiction of her reading Miles' impassioned apology letter in ""A Civil Campaign"" . . . even silent there was real emotion in every gesture.  Here, we care it seems we care more through longevity than anything the book has earned.Shifting this (ahem) milestone in his life may have been a mistake, because instead of the focus on becoming new parents, we get space action with the promise of the emotional heights the last few books have shown us.  Instead, we get a happy couple and there's never any real doubt they'll get what they want.Still, it's never less than readable.  The revisit to Quaddiespace is welcome, and as I said, when the plot kicks in, it kicks in hard, giving us the intensity of a battle without guns or explosions.  At this point she could make Miles grocery shopping into a masterpiece but I think it's also clear she can't ""just"" do a space adventure story anymore.  Miles the character has seeped into this series enough that it needs to be about him as much as about what he does.  If anything proves that an endless series of ""Miles Adventures"" never would have worked, it's probably this one.  We need to see his growth and not just him but everyone around him.  We need to see them rise, and fall, in their own ways, tied to this impossible little man.  We need to be reminded that stasis is death and that when you stop expecting and welcoming change, you die a little bit.  There's consequences we ask for and the consequences we get and at it best this series is about understanding the difference, and living in that space between.  That's the very heart of it.  This is good, but in relation, it's just a trifle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5H1N7LT2FN71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007360HO8#wasThisHelpful","R5H1N7LT2FN71","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I get actually started, has anyone else noticed Bujold's penchant for using the word ""saturnine"" multiple times in pretty much every book she's written?  It's such an unusual word that it caught my attention and it seems that at least one character per novel gets that word tacked on as a description.  I feel on some level it's a subtle running joke but maybe she just really likes it.  And if you never noticed, now you'll probably be unable NOT to, or you'll go back and count.  She's probably cornered the market on its usage in fiction.  Just as well.It's an interesting word choice because this book is explicitly described as ""a comedy of manners and biology"" and it seems to be a deliberate attempt to ramp down the intensity level of the last few books into something a bit more light-hearted.  As most of the books fall weighted into one of two camps (i.e. ""Space adventure"" and ""milestones in Miles' life""), it shouldn't be a surprise that this one seems geared toward all the people that look forward to seeing Miles get older and encounter the same hurdles of maturity the rest of us do.This time, it's about love.  In fact, all about love.  Ever hear the Wilco song ""I'm Always in Love"", well, we have that here in spades as pretty much every character in the book undergoes a romantic entanglement of one form or another (the only people who escape unscathed seem to be his parents, and they're already in love).  Miles is still trying to figure out a way to confess his love for the fairly recently widowed Ekaterin, who kind of digs him as well but is a bit shy, and dare I point out again, a recent widow (relax, he sucked).  His clone-brother Mark is visiting from Betan colony along with his young love Kareen, recruiting her into a venture that involves bugs who make the tastiest waste of all.  Unfortunately for him, coming from a relatively uninhibited world sexually to a planet that seems to require a gobetween to hold hands throws some snags into how much togetherness they get.  Meanwhile, preparations are being made for Emperor Gregor's wedding, which has roped in Miles' cousin Ivan, generally a lad-about-town.  His mother's work in organizing the wedding and her own budding romance with the former ImpSec commander has kept her from steering every available woman toward him but Ivan has noticed that available women are becoming few and far between.You would think with all this going on there'd be little time for an actual plot but Bujold also manages to shoehorn in two issues with Counts that are up for votes . . . one fellow is about to lose his Countship because an ancestor sowed some wild oats while the other is attempting to break the gender barrier in a bit of a roundabout fashion.  Oh, and someone is accusing Miles of murder.  Got all that?Needless to say, the book carries a five hundred plus page count (about the length of ""Mirror Dance"" without the fiendish sense of urgency) and for the most part she justifies it.  She's breezy enough to keep all the balls juggling in the air and doesn't let one plot fall out of focus for too long before shifting back to it, but gives it all enough heft so that book never feels padded.  Indeed, you can read this one in hundred page clips without really coming up for air, not easy with a book that lacks a degree of suspense and except for one scene is almost completely action-less.Where she does succeed is characters.  Relying on the fact that we're invested in these people, she writes them with the easy familiarity that makes us believe they've known each other for years.  Some of the most fascinating parts are the conversations that feels deceptively easy, such as Miles talking to his father, or Mark with his mother, or Miles with Ivan, there's just the right mix of love, exasperation, goodwill and teasing that only comes when you've known someone long enough to know how far you can go to joke, or what to say that will finally make them listen.  Miles, as usual, is the driving force behind all of this, both on the political and domestic ends, and there's some amusement in watching him approach romance the same way you plot storming a beach: at dawn, full speed ahead and darn the torpedoes.  As the newcomer, Bujold has the hardest job with Ekaterin, forcing her to walk a tightrope between restrained romantic feelings and a sense of ""what am I getting myself into"", someone who isn't worldly and thus charmed by Miles but also isn't willing to let him goodnaturedly steamroll over her.  She more or less pulls it off, finishing the job that was started in ""Komarr"", and some of the most honest conversations are between them, as they try to determine what boundaries, if any, to set, testing each other, afraid of taking the plunge but afraid of walking away either.The other attachments work their way in as well, generally centering around Mark and his concerns with his ladyfriend.  The ""bug butter"" scenario shouldn't seem to work in the context of the book, especially when coupled with the more real-life concerns of paying for school and learning when your parents can stop telling you what to do . . . but it blends in with all the other mishaps easily enough.  Mark remains tricky to write, his social awkwardness has to be played both serious and for laughs, but she never has to forget that he's recovering from a serious mental illness.All of it, honestly, works better than it should, although at this point its probably completely inaccessible to new readers.  In the hands of someone with less sure footing, it would have been a total mess.  But she balances all the concerns nicely, giving us small peaks and victories (and one disastrous dinner), coasting on the edge of farce without truly succumbing and pulling it all back into realistic emotions before it gets too cartoonish.  Even the stuff that should be the comic relief (a gender change, or any scene with Ivan, really) feels grounded in a way that would be difficult for anyone that lacked her longevity.  And amazingly, it all comes together in a bravura Council of Counts meeting that handles all the multiple threads with alarming ease, with a pacing and momentum that keeps the victories coming, the suspense in play and even allows time for a sidebar without evaporating any of the mood.  You get to it and you want to cheer because everyone gets what they deserve, and what's more is that it never feels forced.  Barrayar really is home-field advantage for her.And thus Miles gets launched into a new stage of his life and while Bujold apparently doesn't believe in normal dating, it does feel earned.  One thing Bujold did well with bringing Ekaterin into things is giving us an outsider view of Miles' world and how utterly intimidating it must seem to normal people.  As readers we're too used to the setting to be anything but jaded but seeing Miles just hanging out and chatting with the Emperor from her point of view reminds us of what rarefied circles he travels in, and what it's taken to get him there.  With all the famous people he knows, from his parents on down, it's like finding out that the guy on your softball team grew up with the British royal family.  It gives us a fresh view on something we've probably started to take for granted.Any quibbles I have feel like quibbling.  You may it odd that the book seems to take for granted that marriage is something that pretty much everybody wants (although to be fair, Mark and Kareen never talk marriage, and Ivan's mom has someone else's wedding to plan) and moreso there's no real hint of relationships involving anything but guys with gals.  Granted Barrayar is a bit of a restrained planet culturally but coming from a woman who used to write a hermaphrodite (Bel Thorne) and an entire gay planet (""Ethan of Athos"") it's like painting with half the colors on the palette.  Even the sex change winds up in a fairly conventional guy-girl pairing, although we'll see how that plays out.Still, she makes the whole thing so enjoyable that on some level it feels like anyone who doesn't like it is actively trying not to like it, or it's just really not your cuppa, as it were.  This many books in we have to admit that Bujold has something fairly impressive here, ""Cerebus"" crossed with ""Gasoline Alley"" crossed with Poul Anderson's Ensign Flandry novels, something that can play to a fairly broad audience with an appetite for science-fiction, yet can accommodate its own in-crowd as well.  It feels like the kind of thing people develop twee secret clubs for, and honestly, it's rather worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30MVMK1PVFZ6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671578855#wasThisHelpful","R30MVMK1PVFZ6Y","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Or ""The One Where Miles Falls in Love"".The end of the last book promised a new direction both for the life of everyone's favorite short hyperactive person and for the series in general, with Miles' new occupation of Imperial Auditor (where the job description basically entails ""investigating anything the Emperor wants"") giving him new excuses to go looking for trouble while freeing Bujold from any restrictions on the type of story she wants to tell.  Covert outer-space adventures are now out and in its place comes more overt operations requiring someone for whom giving a complete lack of rules may not be a great idea.  By changing the nature of the adventures that underscore the series, Bujold acknowledges that we all get older and can't do the same stuff that seemed like great fun when we were younger as well as gives Miles a chance to grow into a different guise.  It's a radical shift in structure but not in tone, which is why even if the game has changed significantly, the series still feels essentially the same.This one details Miles' first big job as an Auditor, teaming with another one of the Auditors to investigate why a spaceship hit a solar array on the planet Komarr.  A colony that was taken over by Barrayar some time back, it's still in the process of terraforming and having a mirror taken out sets them back somewhat.  Miles' mission, which he has been given to accept, is to figure out if it was an accident or the result of plotting from factions of Komarr who aren't very fond of the relationship between their world and Barrayar.  And if the latter is the case, to find the persons responsible and bring them to justice before they cause any more damage.As usual with her novels Bujold does a balancing act between the main plot and the furthering of Mile's life, with the Komarr investigation unfolding as Miles undergoes on-the-job training in how exactly to do a job where the parameters are basically ""do whatever it takes to get the job done.""  To make matters even more complicated, a good portion of the planet hates his last name because of an incident during the initial occupation that happened under his father's watch but his father didn't actually cause.  What could make any of this better?  How about romance?As the cover of two people gazing mysteriously into each other's eyes while things blow up in the background suggest, there's an undercurrent of love going on here.  The good news is that Ekaterin is from Barrayar, from one of the Vor clans and seems to pick up what Miles is throwing down in terms of vibe.  The bad news is she's married.  Not only married but undergoing a rather quiet form of emotional abuse from her husband who is a tad on the controlling side.  If only events would conspire.Bujold switches the structure up a bit for once and instead of having the book narrated from Miles' point of view at his unrelenting pace for the duration, we alternate between chapters with him and chapters with Ekaterin.  It gives us a different perspective on our supercharged hero, though he's presented in such a flattering light that it's almost impossible to imagine how Ekaterin wouldn't fall for him, such is the force of his personality.  But even though we've seen Miles in love before, this winds up being his first serious adult crush and she handles the matter deftly, twisting the plot through Ekaterin's rather emotionally battered existence, Miles swallowing his affection, and the actual matter at hand, finding potential terrorists.  The shifting between viewpoints worked in ""Mirror Dance"" but Miles was absent for a portion of that.  Here he still feels like the center, even when the focus isn't on him, and in doing so it makes the novel Ekaterin's story as well as his, an attempt for someone to find themselves after being smothered for so long.It's a measure of how skilled she is that none of this feels like a risk even as we are pushing into new territory, replacing gun battles with more politically oriented fights, and exploits of derring-do with more mundane domestic concerns.  She's managed to change the character of the adventures without changing the nature of the adventures themselves.  For longtime readers who have been growing up with the series, it will seem like a logical progression and an exciting change.  Everyone else will be kind of lost inside the context but there's enough to intrigue that would make a person want to run off to find a better starting point.  Yet she still manages to keep it tense, where a negotiation between parties with a lot at stake can be just as thrilling as a standoff with guns.  She has to make people sifting through paperwork worth reading about, not an easy feat.  Her characterization of Ekaterin early on shies just on the right side of not making her seem like a doormat and while she doesn't veer away from the nature of her abuse, quiet as it is, we're not exactly in Margaret Atwood territory either, and the shades of grey aren't exactly where you'd expect them to be.But she takes the elements that made the series work and switches them all around, so that the blood is spilled where you aren't expecting blood, the triumphs are arranged in side avenues and without explosions and meanwhile despite everything life goes on.  The subplots, such as they are, tend to make this series the rewarding read that it can be, as we skip along with a life that's being fully lived even as we wonder where it's going to take us next.  The surprises don't always come in the grand scheme (as soon as Ekaterin and Miles meet, you know the plot is going to somehow conspire in their favor) but as with most things in life, it's the little victories, whether you were expecting them or not.  Those wishing for the marked intensity of some earlier novels may be put off by the somewhat lighter tone here (even with the abuse angle) but as part of the building block of a series with a scope and a depth (and longevity) that probably no one could have predicted from the onset, it's essential in its own quiet way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39FPNSTLM66J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671578081#wasThisHelpful","R39FPNSTLM66J1","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bujold runs a real risk of having her novels turn into ""Friends"" episode in how they can be described, i.e. ""The One Where He Makes Up Some Mercenaries"" or ""The One Where His Mom Intimidates An Entire Planet"" since she has to walk that fine balance between telling us a story and narrating a portion of Miles' ongoing life, both of which don't always get equal billing.In essence, this one could have been termed ""The One Where Miles Deals With Mortality"".  Coming off the events of the last novel, where he basically died and got better, he attempts to deal with the recovery from that and discovers that you can bring a body back, but you can't bring it all back working perfectly.  This causes an accident early on, where leads him to cover it up, which leads his superiors at ImpSec to realize he's been covering it up and then he gets fired because covering up stuff like that is considered poor form.  Oh, and he's about to turn thirty.  Cue the early mid-life crisis!This one by definition winds up being a companion to ""Mirror Dance"" but it really exists as a triptych with that one and ""Brothers in Arms"" taking up the theme of ""The good times are over, now what?""  After having spent a couple novels building Miles up as the resident super-genius hero of two identities man with a plan in every instance (which she could have ran with forever, potentially), she takes the more interesting tactic and spends those three novels planting the seeds that will break him down utterly.  If ""Mirror Dance"" took Miles' as far as he could go physically in terms of breaking him down, it functioned even better as Mark's story and showed what kind of an impact his absence made.  But having broken and put him back together, now she goes to break him down psychologically by taking away the one thing that he felt gave his life meaning and forcing him to figure out what the heck to do now.What impresses here is how permanent it feels.  As I said, Bujold could have given us an endless string of space mercenary stories, her imagination is certainly strong enough to come up with dozens of scenarios for Miles to plot his way out of.  But it becomes clear here that there's no real reset button about to be pressed and that we're entering a new stage of things (""Mirror Dance"" at least gave us a hint that things were going on as they were before, once the pieces had been scooped up and put back together).  Going in with that mandate, it makes her somewhat fearless and there's a slight going for broke vibe at play here, stripping away all the things that Miles relied on to make himself interesting and then daring us to find other reasons to keep reading about a mopey short man with bones made of fragile Nerf.With that in mind, the plot becomes secondary.  Almost.  Partway through the book and after Miles has passed through his lowest ebb, he winds up trying to investigate why his former superior Simon, who is supposed to have a perfect memory thanks to an implant, is starting to forget things, or recalling events that happened quite some time ago.  Miles' attempts to unravel this mystery drives the back portion of the book and sets the results of the consequences into play.  It's not Bujold's most twisty mystery (the person you think it is winds up being the culprit and like Columbo you're merely waiting for Miles to catch up and figure up how it was done) but that almost seems beside the point.  It's the event that brings Miles back into action, gets his juices flowing and gives Bujold the excuse to launch us into the next stage of his life.This is one of the Miles' novels that will make little sense unless you're invested in not only his success but that of the supporting cast as well.  Her decision to dip in and out of Miles' life with each novel, moving the timeline forward a few years at a time with every new life event (if the events are of varying importance) winds up being quietly brilliant, especially when you consider that most of the supporting cast has stayed intact since that beginning.  We've not only seen Miles grow up, but the rest of the cast as well, so that dropping in on his parents or Ivan feels like visiting old friends and finding out what they're up.  And with the cast steadily aging we're made well aware that some of the older members of the crew aren't going to be around forever, even in a universe that can cure most ills.  It adds a rather sobering level of context and if one is neurotic enough it can make you want to stop reading, the same way we don't visit the terminally ill in hospitals, because we want to remember them as young and vital.But it's a testament that a novel with such heavy themes winds up being lighthearted at its base.  Even when Miles is at his darkest, the novel never reaches the crushing psychological depths that ""Mirror Dance"".  Maybe it's because Miles is slightly more mentally put together than his rather off-kilter clone brother or because the events this time out aren't as shattering, but there's a familial and friendly vibe to the whole affair.  We see Miles at his lowest but we're also constantly reminded that there are people out there who love him and want to see him get better, to get past whatever is holding him back and move forward and move onwards.  You get the sense that even the people who are disappointed with him are hoping that he'll find some way to overcome this.Without the intensity that has highlighted her very best work (and I'm not sure two super-intense novels in a row would have worked, we need a breather) we're enjoying the scenery of Barrayar (where she consistently gets her best results) and watching people we've met as teenagers growing up and finding new passions before our eyes.  As I said earlier, the plot itself is almost beside the point, it's the opportunity to witness yet another step in the journey of a remarkable life and Bujold crafts it with an ease that makes you hope she really sweats over this because if this comes to her easily then the rest of us must be doing something wrong.To me, one of the final scenes demonstrates her subtle touch and her ability to inject hope into the more despairing of circumstances without seeming cloying.  Two lovers realize they can't come to terms with what the other wants and thus a romantic evening becomes a long goodbye, not just to each other but to what they represented as a couple, closing off a portion of their lives they'll never get back to, even if they manage to sleep together again.  It reminded me of the final song off Los Campesinos' album ""Romance is Boring"", which ends with a chorus of voices singing ""I can't believe I chose the mountains every time you chose the sea"" before ending with a burst of white noise that gradually sputters out, as if the song just gives up trying.  It's intense and sad and wraps up all the complicated emotions that go into the realization that no matter how much you love each other, sometimes it's just not in the cards and it's not fair and there's nothing either person can do about it without compromising themselves utterly, in a way they aren't prepared to do.Bujold does the same thing in however many pages that scene takes, but with a crucial difference.  Instead of disintegrating into clenched despair, she manages to infuse a sad event with a note of hopefulness, saying in essence to both parties: you're better for having done this and you will go on to better things.  To make it both true and real and optimistic, without blunting the sadness of it, only proves the strength of her writing, and of her characters, and why she's so necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZRETOCM4J7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067187845X#wasThisHelpful","R3FZRETOCM4J7O","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so the last one wasn't a fluke, she really does mean to get serious.  After the first few books that mostly consisted of well-done military-esque SF and jaunty space opera as directed by a man with bones made of silly putty, starting with ""Brothers in Arms"" Bujold seemed to signify that playtime was over, at least in baby steps.  In that novel, the roots of an identity crisis for Miles was sketched out (is he a Barrayaran Lord or a mercenary admiral? or maybe both at once?) and then a giant spanner is thrown into the works with the introduction of a clone brother, who Miles names Mark.  For the first time a deepening focus with the psychologies of the characters was on hand, and not just a series of examples of why Miles is extraordinarily clever.  There crept in a sense that almost anything was possible with the character, if only he could be broken down enough.Here, the breaking commences.  As part of a plot against him that becomes defused, Mark is let go to make his own way in the world at the end of the last novel.  He resurfaces here and tricks his way into the Dendarii mercenary group by pretending to be Miles.  Unable to tell the difference, a bunch of them become commandeered for a mission to rescue clones from a house in Jackson's Whole, where Mark knows from experience that clones aren't treated very well (essentially they are raised to have their brains scooped out so the old barons can insert their wrinkly old cerebrums into the empty spaces).  And in the first of many instances where Mark learns that he is not Miles, the mission goes horribly wrong, forcing Miles to step in and salvage what he can.  Then that goes horribly wrong too.At times it almost seems like Bujold was challenged with a ""why don't you write a book about your main character without actually using your main character"" and this seems to be her response.  Great portions of it are devoted to defining Miles by his absence, and depicting how difficult it really is to do what he does so easily.  Pulled out forcibly from the narrative, it forces everyone to fall in different directions, adjusting to new configurations and attempting to determine how permanent those new configurations will be.  It asks the question of how everyone copes when the lens that the story is seen through becomes cracked and missing.The answer is: not well.  And here Bujold takes us into the real heart of things.  Left behind in the aftermath, Mark is forced to live with the consequences of an act that may have taken everyone's favorite short person away forever, while being constantly reminded that he can't even hold a candle to that short person, even though he's the same height.  Gift-wrapping herself a version of her own character with deep psychological scars, Bujold goes to town and gets further into his head than any other character prior.  It's by far the most brutal of her novels, with a sometimes alarming degree of both physical and psychology torture, as Mark attempts to understand just how screwed up he is and if there's any way to come from it, to something resembling normal.It makes for an oddly intense read at times, especially for something that starts off as a routine space adventure, and it benefits from being smack dab in the middle of a series. Having established a consistent supporting cast, she's able to use them as a buffer and a foundation for Mark to play off of, finding new wrinkles in previously established relationships.  Taking the story to Barrayar doesn't hurt either, as the locale seems to consistently inspire her.  It's probably no coincidence either that one of her finest novels is also the first in a while to extensively feature Miles' parents, who suddenly learn that, surprise, it's another boy.  She walks a fine line, making a complete headcase sympathetic and dragging him slowly back to normalcy without making it seem pat or trite.In these circumstances, the plot itself becomes an afterthought.  Once the initial setup is played out, the story becomes more about Mark and his attempts at becoming a real person.  When the plot does drift back in, furthering the ""What happened to Miles?"" mystery, it's merely another reason to develop Mark and maybe redefine Miles in the process, with everyone else along for the ride.  She takes chances here, not only with the length (easily twice as much as previous novels) but with the subtraction of the person who made all of this possible and turns those risks into triumphs.  You don't just root for one person here, but for everyone, because they are so painfully human and as before, the weight of the shared history almost becomes another character in itself.  If you've read this far into the series, you know these people, you know how a loss weighs and how a new joy stabs, and the uncertainty of whether things can go back to how they were before, when they change too much to be comfortable.  When the answer, of course, is simple: they can't.  It's the best and worst thing about life.  There's consequences here, and a suggestion finally that the series won't be a sequence of problems for Miles to solve impressively.  It's gone from a place that it can't go back to, depicting the moment that  you can point to as everything changing, even if you didn't realize it in the moment, and illustrates the sad and glorious fact of it all, you can have other days, and better days but there will always be days that you can't retrieve and that nagging longing for a slipped away special time you can no longer properly define but can still feel, may be the first sign that you're finally growing up.  It's not that you want to go back, it's knowing that you can't is where the real sting occurs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHC48LUCD03OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671876465#wasThisHelpful","RHC48LUCD03OS","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the point where the series begins to reward people who are reading it as a continuous series and those who are just dipping in and out at leisure.  Because while I think its the best and most mature volume in the series yet, its also the one that is most likely to be incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't started from the beginning.  While she does her best to bring new readers up to speed, if the reader doesn't have a passing knowledge of ""Warrior's Apprentice"", ""Borders of Infinity"", ""Ethan of Athos"" or even to some extent ""Barrayar"" then they're going to be playing catch-up for a good portion of this book or at least not get the context of the references.In a series that isn't sequentially numbered (despite Bujold's helpful time line in the rear of every book) you have to wonder if it's better to make every volume completely accessible to the newcomer (especially as the history piles up) or simply let the people pick it up as they go.  There's merits to both approaches and it probably depends on someone's tolerance for getting every single reference, like the kids in the in-crowd.  I know for myself, I read ""The Vor Game"" totally out of order years ago and while I liked it, I found that without the weight of previous events, it didn't make enough of an impression for me to immediately track down the rest of the books in the series.  All the history does add some emotional resonance to events, and it makes a difference.Especially here, where Bujold is attempting more ambitious plotting and ambitious emotional concepts.  Fresh off the events of ""Borders of Infinity"", Miles and his band of fiendish mercenaries park themselves at Earth to repair and get paid, but the close presence of a Barrayar embassy means he has to juggle both sides of his life (most of the mercenaries don't know he's also Lord Vorkosigan and just think he's their wacky genius admiral), attempting to get the mercenaries financially afloat while arguing with the embassy about why payments seem to be coming so slowly.  Miles has to ask himself some hard questions about whether he's developing a split personality while also trying to figure out if he should relax the policy on dating coworkers, as he and right-hand gal Eli Quinn circle each other like two kids at a middle-school dance.While previous Miles books succeeded on both momentum and the force of Miles' personality (half the fun was watching him paint himself into a corner and then have to work his way out of it without erasing any of the lines), there wasn't really a lot of thematic meat on the bones, so to speak, it was merely a series of ""this happened and then this happened and this happened"" before eventually it was over.  Bujold probably could have churned out pleasant novels in that vein that would have been lapped up by eager fans for years to come and been content . . . here she attempts to delve deeper into the characters while still maintaining the breakneck pace of plots in the past, bouncing characters off each other with a breeziness that belays how serious things are becoming.  Between the financial particulars of the mercenaries, the relationship (such as it is) between Miles and Eli, and Miles' relationships with his double lives (his weird moral code exemplified by the comment ""It just happens to be very important to me to win with the hand I was dealt""), as well as the force that Barrayaran history imposes on the proceedings, Bujold has a lot to manage and that's before the actual plot rears its head and the story becomes about the nature of identity and what makes a family.  It makes for a heftier and more substantial read than in times past, with the sole exception (in my mind) of ""Barrayar"" and maybe ""The Mountains of Mourning"", with everyone acting like adults in a fairly realistic situation.  There's still the standard moments of humor (Miles being dosed with future truth drug fast-penta a sort of key comical moment) but now it also comes from unexpected places (my favorite is Miles' exasperated ""Oh come on!"" reaction to a the villain's insistence on sticking with an admittedly absurd plan).Even when the plot does morph into something that isn't expected, it doesn't have the grafted on whiplash sensation that other stories caused and while you sense that Bujold is saving the deeper implications of it for a later novel (one of the other problems with reading a series) it manages to expand on the plot and its themes without obliterating everything that came before it.  It changes the status quo to an extent but the fact that Miles' reaction isn't exactly expected and still feels very much in character is a nice demonstration of how far she's come with the character, moving him from a cheeky and clever man with something to prove to a man finally realizing that he can affect lives and those lives may depend on him.  He starts the novel seemingly traumatized by the events of ""Borders of Infinity"" and finishes with a note of compassion for someone who's tried to kill him.It's probably telling that for the first time the setting feels like more of a backdrop for Bujold to sketch out her concerns (ironically the cast hangs out in places we all should be familiar with) so we wind up with more of a plot-driven piece than a plot hung onto an excuse to showcase a new colony or setting that Bujold has created.  This all works for the better.  Maybe it's because we're getting into the novels that Bujold wrote with actual audience feedback (her first three or so were written all together before she was published) or she's getting more comfortable with her characters and her style.  Either way she has just about managed an interesting feat, crafting on a jumping on point that requires you to go back and read what happened before, and not make it feel like work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHGIPHK1TMJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671697994#wasThisHelpful","RJHGIPHK1TMJK","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Short stories are notorious for allowing authors to try different approaches, ones that might not have worked or don't warrant the all-out expansiveness that comes with a full-fledged novel.  Bujold isn't exactly known as a short story writer, the vast majority of her famous works (and most of the award-winning ones) all seem to be in novel form and even her short stories aren't exactly short.  Which, as almost any writer will tell you, is typically how it goes.  Novel and short story writing are two wildly different approaches and just because a certain author is good at one doesn't necessarily mean they'll be good at the other format.  SF in particular is littered with those who were brilliant short story writers but couldn't exactly hack it as a novelist.  Nevertheless, I'm sure the shelf of short-story awards they've garnered will keep them warm at night.  Bujold is probably quite comfortable writing novels, as her rather prolific output will attest.Case in point: this collection.  Three stories, each of which averages about a hundred pages.  So maybe novellas?  Or junior novels.  Either way, all three of them star her most famous character, Miles Vorskosigan, and all of them center on the early years of his career.  None of the stories are related to each other, although for the collection she attempts to craft a framing sequence featuring a laid-up Miles and his security chief attempting to foil a plot that coincidentally involves Miles telling stories of his latest adventures.  Frankly, that section of things can be almost dispensed with entirely, it's a bit perfunctory and not exactly memorable when compared to the stories themselves.The stories, however, only shows Bujold's developing skill with her favorite character and her ability to vary the setting and types of threats.  The first tale, ""The Mountains of Mourning"" may wind up being her masterpiece, or at least her first.  Set with Miles on Barrayar, his father tasks him with solving a murder in one of the villages on his lands and dispensing justice if need be.  Miles, hoping he can wrap this up quickly, goes along with a bodyguard and a doctor and proceeds to run headlong into complications.It was a baby that was killed, you see, and the mom is accusing her husband of doing what the village would call a mercy killing as the baby has a cleft palate and is thus seen as damaged goods.  Not exactly a perfect physical specimen himself, Miles is forced to figure out who the actual killer is while cutting through the prejudices that cause a large chunk of the village to believe that the baby was indeed better off dead.Barrayar is probably her richest setting and any of the stories set there seem particularly inspired.  This one is no exception.  The mix of technologically backwards village and future technology is striking (just as it was in ""Barrayar"", it's just the differences are more extreme here), like taking a 19th century play and having the cast of ""Star Trek"" suddenly appear, with everyone playing it straight.  It plunges Miles into a setting where culturally he's an outsider and has to figure out the rules before people succeed in killing him and come up with a solution that both satisfies his father's demand for justice and is something that the villagers can live with as well.  It's an ache for a way of life that is fast-disappearing, with the added notion that maybe it's not such a bad idea for some parts to go away and never come back.  Here, Miles thrives.  The best stories force him to think while he's on the back foot and a lot of my criticism of his early stories centers around him seeming to always know what move to make, despite his age and relative inexperience.  Here, he has no idea what he's doing for most of it and fumbles through guided only by a moral compass and a need to see a baby's death avenged and a justice done that he can live with.It plunges toward an ending that on some level you can see coming and yet isn't quite what you expect.  And Miles earns it, and in earning it becomes changed, emerging from that backwoods forest different from how he entered.  It's a story that doesn't necessarily need the SF to make it work, and yet becomes a more perfect entity in the hands of SF.  It's a very human story, it's emotional impact immersing you in these simple people, making you judge and ache with them at the same time.  They're wrong and the part that hurts is that they're just learning it didn't always have to be that way.Coming off that, ""Labyrinth"" can only feel like a letdown, but it's not much of one.  I liked it, but reviewed it in more detail when I went through ""Miles, Mystery and Mayhem"" so feel free to read about it there.""Borders of Infinity"" takes us back into typical Miles territory, but this time fully in the SF camp.  Literally in a camp, as Miles allows himself to be captured so he can infiltrate a Cetagandan prison and make contact with someone inside.  The camp is fiendishly designed to not only fulfill the strictures of whatever equivalent of the Geneva Convention is around these parts, but to drive everyone in the camp crazy.  Bujold takes great pleasure in detailing a camp constantly teetering on the edge of a breakdown, and part of the fun here comes from watching Miles worm his way into putting himself in charge and rallying everyone to his cause.  It's a gambit that basically has to be carried on personality alone and by this point Miles has that in spades.  And even so, he struggles here, and it's exciting to see him upend the existing structure and make it work for his purposes.But then the story curveballs and not in a way that enhances things.  The tale goes from ""Cool Hand Luke"" to the beach scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"" on a dime in a way that doesn't exactly feel organic.  The sudden shift is jarring but the weird part is, taken separately, both segments are brilliant in their own way.  The battle that ends the story is fueled by desperation and adrenaline, as Miles space chickens all come to roost and he tries to believe that everyone can be saved even when the odds are stacked against them and ignoring the cruel and fickle finger of random chance.  Most of the emotional gut punches come in this sequence, as Miles reels and reacts and has to accept that a partial victory is sometimes the best you can hope for.  If this was two stories, or one sewn together better, it would probably rival ""The Mountains of Mourning"" or one of the better known novels.  As it is, it stands as an interesting experiment that doesn't quite work.All three stories, however, rank as some of the more distinctive Miles adventures.  Stripped of the complications that sometimes overtake the longer novels, Bujold can indulge in other scenarios and show off not only the versatility of her character but also demonstrate how no topic or setting needs to be off-limits.  If nothing else, read it for ""The Mountains of Mourning"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFD1MRBRF5Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671720937#wasThisHelpful","RYFD1MRBRF5Z0","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Early Miles Vorkosigan adventures aren't exactly hard to find but these omnibuses are useful not only by bundling a chunk of these stories together but by helping you figure out which order these stories go in, especially when you start counting the various short stories that ol' Miles has starred in as well (the next volume technically in the sequence ""Borders of Infinity"" takes a big step toward that, to the point of repeating one of the stories in this volume . . . coordinate your omnibi, people!).  This one goes the extra mile by also reeling in one of the stories that are set in this universe but doesn't directly star everyone's favorite man of spongy bone, helping link some of the more lesser known but still entertaining material.It's a meaty volume we have here, consisting of ""Cetaganda"", ""Ethan of Athos"", and short story ""Labyrinth"",  none of which have anything to do with each other except that two of them star Miles in his early career.  ""Cetaganda"" is probably the initial draw in this collection but it probably isn't the best one here, oddly enough.  Miles and hapless cousin Ivan travel on what's supposed to be a simple diplomatic mission to Cetaganda merely to witness the funeral of an empress.  Before long the two of them are caught up in a behind the scenes power struggle that involves multiple attempts at murder and lots of face painting.  And hermaphrodites.It sounds like it could be a an episode of ""Twin Peaks"" but it doesn't go quite that weird.  Readers who had been following along with the saga were probably pleased to finally get a look at the Cetagandan people, who thus far has pretty much taken on the role of generic bad guys, always up to no good.  Given a chance to let Miles get shoulder deep into the culture itself, Bujold crafts a society based around several layers of people being better than other people, along with genetic engineering, women who can't be seen by men and seemingly forty-five different contradictory ways to violate tactful protocol.  Needless to say, this is exactly the place where Miles wants to be and some of the entertainment from this novel comes with trying to find the exact moment when the Barrayar ambassador gives in and starts chugging down antacid tablets off-screen as Miles once again goes off and does something he's not supposed to do.The danger is pretty specific to Cetaganda but if the novel lacks the one thing that other Miles stories seem to do effortlessly, which is find that emotional hook to reel you in.  This time Bujold seems to be coasting on ""See lovely Cetaganda finally!"" and she's not entirely up to the task.  The rigid yet groaning structures of Barrayar society seem to come easily to her and the tensions that result from those structures have made for some fascinating drama but when trying to repeat the trick with the Cetagandans it doesn't quite work.  Maybe it's because they don't seem as odd as they should be . . . given the outward nature and how different it is from what Miles knows, it should come across as some bizarre ritualized alien species and yet never seems to grab hold that way.  It doesn't help that the plot is rather similar to ""Barrayar"", which also featured an outsider to the society dealing with a threat that seem poised to take down that society . . . but having dialed the action down quite a bit also manages to excise some of the tension.  It's not that I don't find the proceedings fun, but wondering if the women in the bubbles will manage to retrieve their genetic legacy isn't quite the same as watching Miles' mom race through a collapsing Barrayar society to save her pre-infant child.But anything with Miles will be at the very least entertaining, even as I still wonder how he's so adept even in the early novels (does he have a learning curve at all?), managing to hold off both his own intelligence officers and the diplomatic corps while he tries to figure out what the heck is going on.  Having Ivan to play off of helps and does display the contrast between a genius and someone who is merely competent but you're pretty much reading this one for Miles and the scenery.Things shift gears for ""Ethan of Athos"", both forward and back.  This one stars, not Miles, but the titular Ethan of the Athos colony, where everyone leaves the toilet seat up and is looking for someone tall. dark and handsome.  For one reason or another, the Athos colony is set up to be entirely male and deliberately isolated for that fact.  The only trading they really do is for ova so they can make more babies eventually but otherwise mostly keep to themselves.  When the story picks up the original ovum that their cultures were working from have finally degraded to the point where they need more and after they get screwed out of some decent stock, they send Ethan out on a shopping trip.  Where he meets (gasp!) girls.This one keeps the pattern of ""outsider injecting himself into strange society"" with the twist that instead of having a genius like Miles involved, Ethan has no idea what the heck he's doing and winds up being terrified of just about everything.  Then people start trying to kill him.  Fortunately for him we get a Miles stand-in, ElI Quinn from ""The Warrior's Apprentice"", who we last saw getting her face blown off.  Back with a better face, she's there as part of her mercenary group on a special mission that may or may not involve Ethan but probably does.From there on it's space station shenanigans as people try to kill Ethan, only for Eli to rescue him while the two of them attempt to figure out what's going on and he wants to distrust her because she has breasts.  The charm in this one mostly comes from watching the people involve go about their business and the lethal comedy that results from Ethan being a fish out of water.  The Cetagandans make an appearance but after spending an entire novel proving how they aren't a society of generic villains, go back to being basically generic evil villains.  The best parts for me are watching Ethan get his footing and overcome his own societal prejudices (as I noted, with Miles arriving fully-formed, it's nice to see some on-the-job training) and Eli actually make mistakes and be unsure of herself, which wouldn't have happened if Miles was in charge.  She's still fairly effective but you wind up having Miles' personality essentially chopped into pieces and scattered amongst the different characters.As a whole it holds up well enough together . . . there's more action and intrigue here, or at least in a more visceral digestible form.  But there are some parts that feel like Bujold is just throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks, and she rarely sticks with an idea long enough to really follow it through (gay colonies! embryos! telepaths!) which means the scenario always seems to be on constantly shifting ground.  The climax turns on a bit of a left-field coincidence that stretches plausibility a tad and it's really only Bujold's talent that manages to wallpaper over all this and make it into a smooth experience.  It's a shame we don't get to see more of the Athos colony (probably for the best ultimately, as I don't know how actively workable it is) but what I find interesting is she doesn't call attention to the fact that they're a colony of homosexuals (which wouldn't seem odd to Ethan, being he's from there) and doesn't try to delve further into the complications that would result from everyone being the same gender (imagine that one scene from Haldeman's ""The Forever War"" where a future Earth goes same-sex to keep the population down, but expanded to a whole novel).  She tends to keep sexuality at arm's length as it is and just because they're all guys doesn't mean we should expect Big Statements from her on that topic, but it's interesting how she doesn't take the opportunity.  But it was only like her second novel.She finally discovers the emotional heart of things in ""Labyrinth"", where Miles hits Jackson's Whole in his guise of mercenary admiral to make some purchases and help smuggle a scientist off the planet.  Problems arise when the scientist refuses to leave with samples that he hid on one of his experiments that were meant for a super-soldier project, forcing Miles to break into the baron's fortress to at first kill the experiment and retrieve the samples.  When he realizes that the super-soldier is a killing machine but also a young woman he has to somehow make a break for it without blowing their cover and keeping everyone intact.Bujold seems to do better in the shorter format with these types of stories because this manages to encompass all the themes that make her stories interesting, the contrast between old school values and shiny SF (while everyone has spaceships and genetic splicing, people also call themselves ""barons""), Miles being just enough out of his depth so he's never completely in control and a huge dose of humanity that trumpets compassion over expedience and perseverance over taking the easy way out.  Because the story is so much shorter Bujold doesn't have much time for exposition and instead dives right into things once the setup is clear but with the focus off of showing us the future with a side dish of future and instead centering on what becomes a rescue mission, it's a lot easier to win our hearts.  Miles comes across as the decent man with a lot to prove instead of a very gifted intelligence officer and his interactions with the super-soldier showcase Bujold's inherent decency.  As I've said before, you wind up wanting these people to win because they're nice.Bujold's handsoff treatment of sexuality does appear again, however, with an odd scene that could be construed as either very good-natured pity-six or sleeping with a minor (though the concept of ""minor"" is debatable here) and a conclusion that imagines his spacecraft as the center of a G-rated orgy.  Bujold seems quite okay with romance, and no one is asking this to turn into a Harlequin novel, but she does seem to shy away from the stickier parts of things.But with three Miles stories (even if one is tangential) the sheer accumulation of stories winds up making it essential.  It'd be nice if we could chart some kind of growth of Miles with these instead of ""Here he is at age 24"" but there's a whole lot of novels left and plenty of time to make that judgement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQDM9ZAVYWY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743436180#wasThisHelpful","R2DQDM9ZAVYWY4","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah, and now we start.  Every famous character has to start somewhere and after Miles managed to pull off the rare feat of a cameo in his own series (in ""Barrayar"") we finally get to see him in action with this volume, which takes place smack dab at the end of his teenage years.  Here, loses a friend, loses a love, fails to qualify for officer's school and accidentally creates his own private army.  Not necessarily in that order.  And not all of them are bad.Having spent two books laying the groundwork for this series proper, Bujold starts to explore what it all means and while this plot seems to be simpler than some of the stories that would follow, it gives off a feeling of Bujold and Miles almost testing each other and seeing if this attempt at something long-term is going to work out.  In a sense, it's about limits, what the setting can accomplish, what the author can accomplish and most importantly, what the heck can Miles accomplish, especially after he fails out of the aforementioned officer's school due to having bones that can be shattered in a stiff wind.  Not exactly a confidence inducing maneuver for the troops, eh?  Thus, his father sends him off to visit his grandmother at the Beta colony (one of the oddest things about reading this in order is seeing Miles' parents reduced to essentially background players after spending two whole novels with them driving the plot . . . yet, if you haven't read those novels half the things they do will have a limited emotional impact . . . like a snowball on a hill it's the accumulation that adds the weight), along with faithful timebomb Sergeant Bothari and Bothari's teenage daughter (and Miles' best friend, and possible crush) Elena.  Before long Miles has decided on a lark to help a merchant bring his goods into a warzone in the name of profit.  It takes about ten minutes for this plan to go off the rail.While Bujold manages to make even the grimmest circumstances a joy to read, this one isn't exactly a nail-biter, which may turn off some people, especially those drawn in by the escalating tensions that informed the final third of ""Barrayar"".  While Miles spends a good portion of the book in peril, he also establishes very quickly that he's good at coming up with plans on the fly, no matter how insane they seem on the surface and once it becomes clear that MIles is probably going to think his way out of whatever is thrown at him, it becomes not unlike watching a magician where you're more concerned with the ""how"" of things.  Bujold makes him just lucky enough that you don't question how someone who is barely out of puberty has the preternatural confidence and skill to manipulate his way into owning an army.  But when you stop to think about it, he does fairly well for a seventeen year old with limited experience.Thus the fun comes watching the situation constantly threatening to spiral out of control just before Miles reels it back in by the proverbial skin of his teeth but there's more of an amusement factor to it, as opposed to the life-or-death situations that we spent two books watching his parents experience.  Forced to carry the book on his own, Miles has personality to spare and a swagger that just about manages it, but again it's the sheer weight of all the added characters that brings this book to the finish line and not the emotional gut-punches that you keep hoping for with material like this.  Instead, it feels even in tone, with a lightness that feels almost breezy.  Twice in the novel we lose major characters, one off-screen and one shockingly before our eyes.  The former feels more like an afterthought, with the years neutering the character almost beyond recognition, while the other hinges on a coincidence that Bujold swiftly brushes aside to focus on the impact of the demise.  It's probably her best slight of hand in the novel, for while the circumstance is a tad implausible (really, I thought space would be bigger) the reactions of everyone involved feels honest and it seems destined to cast a shadow that will inform some of the rest of the series.Still, the setting is fun and even if the many mercenaries start to blur together after a while and her ability to convey romance could use some work (act like you're in love, people!) you're reading for the sheer verve and because the pace won't let you slack off.  By the time Miles has to detour back home in a left field twist to short circuit the first of what will probably be a long line of attempts on his family you've already become invested in his character you've probably been already sold on these people.  She has that gift of writing decent people that make you want to root for them due to their sheer decency but gives them enough edge and spine so that they never become boring.  Even when the outcome is never in doubt (or this would be a short series) it's the relationships between the characters that stand out more than the plot, and the smaller moments that set it apart from just a swaggering space adventure.  You want to spend time with them because they seem like friends and it's your reaction to these people that determines how far you're going to get.  If you find Miles insufferable in his seeming inability to actually fail you'll have stopped before you'll want to read this review.  But if you find yourself laughing along and hoping he realizes his goals then you're probably going to stick with it until she runs out of words.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Y4DRXLQM7KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067172066X#wasThisHelpful","R10Y4DRXLQM7KF","A2YUZKPLUYQDKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YUZKPLUYQDKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I trust Creative products. But today, I learned a lesson - only trust them with audio. I don't get why a lot of people love this product. Low standards, perhaps?

I'm using this LOCALLY - not online - as a surveillance device. I'm not even trying to record - I just turn it on. Doesn't look 720p to me. You wouldn't be able to read anything it captures. Too much: noise, compression, artifacts. 30 FPS? They wish... more like 0.5 frame per second. I mean, come on!

"I got a NEXUS 7, and I was so impressed that I got one for my mom's iPad.The NEXUS 7 screen is gorgeous. However, even with the Gorilla Glass, it is still vulnerable to damage, especially when dropped face down (see drop test of Nexus 7 on youtube). Now enter the Tech Armor Matte Protector. What's good about the matte is it gives it a glare free surface. It is a trade off between form and function. I will take function. It does alter the form which is very subjective. Personally, I like it better because it creates a more robust appearance.HOW TOUGH is the MATTE Protector?It lasted a long time, before I had to replace it. The first one (1 of 3) lasted 4 months, but then I got a small deep scratch so I tried replacing it. Unfortunately, my second screen protector (2 of 3) application was a failure, so I used my final screen protector (3 of 3). It lasted for a while, until I dropped it, FACE DOWN, on a rocky surface, without any protective case. It did destroy the Tech Armor screen protector, with a lot of dents and scratches, and even small pokes from the rocks. However, there's absolutely NO damage to the NEXUS 7's screen. The screen protector took all the beating. Impressive.This is undoubtedly a 4-star rating product, until....I read that Tech Armor replaces the product if for some reason you fail to apply it properly (as in my case on my second screen), or simply from normal wear and tear. I sent them an email, and then - boom - a replacement is all the way.For the price of this thing, they even do replacements? This product is a winner.VERDICT: I highly recommend this product.Claims on the anti-finger-print. While it repels fingerprints, it doesn't do justice with smudges. I've had a matte protector back in the days of Windows Mobile and that did not smudge as much as this one. Still, free replacement on a product that actually works and does what it's suppose to deserves 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQ9SN65YPR1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AT6YGM#wasThisHelpful","R1WQ9SN65YPR1E","AZYBZEVISD0YX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZYBZEVISD0YX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE [July 2014]  Product still looks and works the same. I updated the review to reflect new [and outdated] information.This product is perfect and impressive. It simply does what it's supposed to do. It is a small tablet holder holder, which is mounted by inserting it to the CD-slot of any car's AVN system. Obviously, if your car does not have a CD slot, then this will not work.A ridiculously similar product exists on eBay called ""XENOMIX SHG-4000"", for the same price. It's probably rebranding seeing as both are made in South Korea. I have an Amazon Prime membership, and this is Prime eligible, so I decided to get this instead. It arrived exactly two days from placing an order. (Prime perks!)Personally, I like the looks of this one way better than most other mounts out there. Unlike many other monunts, this is low-profile. It does not have gigantic ""claws"" to grip and hold the tablet in place. It is thin, and looks elegant for my taste. It simply is stunning. Mechanism is also simple: just insert to slot, and flip a switch. No turning of knobs necessary.EQUIPMENT    Product name: PPYPLE CD-N7 (Dash-N7) Reviewer's tablet: Google Nexus 7 (2012 & 2013) Reviewer's car: Hyundai Veloster 1.6 T-GDIWHAT I LIKE  + + Small profile, barely noticeable when tablet is mounted.+ Frees up my entire windshield from obstruction.+ Sufficient grip strength.+ Simple mechanism: Insert and flip a switch.WHAT I DON'T LIKE    Nothing, really. A little wobbly, but that is to be expected from a heavy tablet and the way the mount works. I hardly notice the wobbling though (only on hard bumps).MISC    Includes 3 additional padding - 1.5x, 2.0x, and 2.5x thickness of the default. It locks by griping the top and bottom area/wall of the CD slot opening. It could be rotated 360 degrees, and adjusted in axis. My CD Slot is directly on top of my car's 7-inch built-in AVN ( Audio/Video/Navigation) system LCD screen, but I was able to adjust the mount vertically all the way upwards so it doesn't block the view and operation of my car's dash LCD.

"The title says it all, seriously. I've had a similar Umbrella for less than half the price of this thing. It was way more better in withstanding wind.

"Well, it did work. Repair shop said I have a gasket problem. One (1) liter of coolant in my reservoir would last exactly two days only.

"UPDATE: I had a replacement because I could not update the firmware of the original one. Also, I updated my review to correct errors and reflect my feelings for this mouse after 1 years.UPDATE: It seems on-board function execution no longer works. Taking off another star.WHAT I LIKE  + + Premium feel. It feels very expensive. Soft rubbery surface, metal underside, hard plastic buttons that doesn't feel cheap.+ Premium looks. Looks expensive too. The lighting is very natural, not overpowering. Braided cable.+ On-Board Memory FOR PROFILE STORAGE ONLY.+ High button count: 15 buttons, arranged in an ergonomic way (kind of). I disagree that it feels super awkward to use. A couple of buttons are a little harder to reach, but you assign those buttons to the least frequently used functions.+ Easy to use software, once you start using it.+ Does not look ""meh"" like the Logitech G600 and Razer Naga. (Subjective)WHAT I DON'T LIKE    Scroll wheel does not tilt. Boo! 1-key rollover. While a modifier key can be assigned, you have to use the keyboard for the 2nd key. On-board memory profile storage only. Execution still relies on Windows. Software is buggy. Poor driver too: cannot properly detect the mouse. I really wished Corsair put a button at the center-thumb spot of the mouse. Fixed DPI count. User is forced to select 3 DPI settings per profile, no more, no less. Needs some getting used to and has a learning curve.What I wish was there: Wireless, weight customization, lighting options. Selectable scroll-mode (Logitech G700 let's you choose between free-scroll OR ""click""-scroll)- - - - -VERDICT: I highly this product. | 2 stars out of 5. This is a good mouse by itself. However, having used Logitech G700, this is not as great. Minus one star for being a 1 key rollover mouse.

"I got this because I need to assign MACRO when I am working on writing codes. I can assign MACRO's to most of the extra buttons (including the FN keys), EXCEPT for the MOST important ones: favorite buttons 1 through 5. I find it dumb to exclude these buttons for MACRO assignment, since these are non-labeled buttons, making them great for MACRO's. If I need MACRO to execute command and assign it to the PLAY button, it's a bit confusing (does it do MACRO, or does it Play media?). Instead, the software limits you to choose either to use it's default function as taskbar favorites OR to assign a shortcut to each of them (file, URL, or App). The ONLY reason I chose this product was for that purpose, and for some reason, the 'genius' programmers at Microsoft did not make this an option.This is a SOFTWARE ISSUE. The keyboard itself is great.What I Like:+ Solid build+ It actually has the updated WIN8 logo for the Windows Key - neat (note 1).+ Free batteries+ Cheap (here at AMAZON) - GET THE BUSINESS EDITION. The ONLY difference is the BOX, which you throw away.+ Good incline without the pop-up feet, GREAT incline with the HUGE pop-up feet.+ THERE IS A DONGLE Compartment underneath the keyboard, beside the batteries, BOTH of which are covered.+ As with most Microsoft low-profile keyboards, it is very comfortable to type.+ MACRO's to the following buttons: Home, Mail, Favorite (STAR), Media buttons, Alternate FN keys, calculator button.+ Not only MACRO's, but the user can assign program/url/file shortcuts.+ Like most Microsoft keyboards, the zoom, volume, num/caps/scroll-lock, win keys have extra user settings.+ APP-specific button assignments.note 1: There is no round carving on the window key - just flat like the rest.What I Dislike:- My rant above. Favorite buttons 1-5 are ""special"" in that I cannot assign MACRO to it.- A little smudgy.What's not there: Keyboard illumination Wired mode option USB recharging of batteries On-board memory Spacing between the alpha keys, the arrow keys, and the numeric keys. An OFF switch to save battery.VERDICT: I recommend this keyboard.

Here is the images URL:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B003VB9FCO/[3] BUILD:The build looks sturdy enough and comparable to more expensive alternatives. I have uploaded a picture here at Amazon Images for the close-up of the product. The surface is some sort of polyester - definitely NOT the thin cloth-like type.[4] POCKETS:The pockets are plain space inside. No ""inception"" pockets for items (like cellphone, pens, etc.). Just plain storage space.[5] ROLLER:The roller luggage, even for a small size, has handles on both the top and the left side for carrying. It also has a hard plastic handle at the bottom should you need to lift it with both hands.[6] TOTE:The tote as with pictures, has a shoulder strap with small padding. It has a loop at the back so the roller's handle could be inserted into it.[7] FUN FACT:It actually has a small padlock and key included with it.[8] PURPLE:See the image at the link provided above. The images have white-balance adjusted to show the closest match possible to the actual color - when viewed under daylight (6500 Kelvin light).Purple is lighter than what is posted here in Amazon and everywhere else - not not bright either. The first uploader makes the purple look pinkish. It is not, thankfully (since I'm a dude who just likes purple).[9]  CONCLUSION:What I Like + Super cheap price (select colors) here at Amazon for what you will get.What I Don't Like - Nothing yet.

"First, I'd like like to point out that this case is for ""PRO"" (Professional) point and shoot cameras. What this means is that if you have an ordinary Point-and-Shooter, this case will be a little too big. Case Logic has exact case like this for those cameras (without the ""PRO"") which is smaller (EHC-101-BLACK).If you own a camcorder, Case Logic also has another similar case, which is bigger (EHC-103-BLACK).It makes sense that this model's part number is EHC-102-BLACK.A ""PRO"" Point-and-Shoot, a.k.a. ""Prosumer"" camera is mostly twice as thick as regular ones. A perfect example of these cameras are Canon's G-Series cameras. I tested this with a G9 and G15.What I like:+ Fits snugly.+ Padded back side.+ Shoulder strap.+ Belt loop - useful if you're riding a roller coaster. LOL!+ Dual zipper.What I don't like:- Camera fits too perfectly - that an extra battery or the neck strap won't fit inside with the camera.Mixed: The quality seems good for its price range. The shoulder strap feels cheaply made though. I've dealt with many kinds of zipper and I know this one is good. Inside pocket seems useless. They should have made it into a padding instead.Bottom line, you can drop your camera in this case and it won't break or scratch. The lack of front padding is OK, since the EVA material used in front looks durable enough for this purpose.If you are looking to put accessories into the case, I suggest you get the bigger model (EHC-103-BLACK).VERDICT: I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HU33SH5QBOUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005X64OQW#wasThisHelpful","R1HU33SH5QBOUU","AZYBZEVISD0YX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZYBZEVISD0YX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This package which costs only $20 contains two batteries, a rapid charger, screen protectors (3), and a cleaning cloth.Batteries:(+) $20 for two batteries is already a bargain.(?) Not sure about longevity or durability, but still, it is priced cheap (easily replaceable).(-) It doesn't have metal connector covers (like in the original battery)Charger:(+) Rapid charging(+) Feels solid. Looks better in person.(+) Very small, hence, portable.(+) Has car charger included.(+) Has round electrical plug adaptor.Screen protectors(+) 3 in a pack.() Universal. Con: you have to cut it. Pro: It's big enough to split in two - making it possible to have six screen protectors (for 3-inch LCD screens).(-) To be honest, I think it is junk. It is so hard to apply, and the protectors are too obvious and kind of reduces the quality of the screen. I just removed mine.(-) The squeegee is a joke. Easily bent.Cleaning cloth(+) Standard above average size cleaning cloth.Despite the CONS, I am giving this 5 STARS since the the package basically gives you free stuff which are all usable.Bottom line, these are cheaply priced - truly a bargain.

"It does what it's supposed to do. I use audiophile earphones and there are no noticeable differences when using this product. I do notice subtle differences from my different earphones, so I should know if there would be noticeable difference when using this product. So far, I am happy to report that this product does not affect quality. I DID NOT TEST THIS USING PROFESSIONAL EQUIPMENT.Those who report that the female port of the cable gets loose over time must be plugging and unplugging devices repeatedly and frequently. The product does make a tight plug. I suggest they purchase another one because this is unbelievable inexpensive in my honest opinion.Benefits of this product:+ Reduces wear and tear to the original earphone (or speaker) plug, by not having to plug it it and out repeatedly. The product does takes the wear instead.+ Reduces wear and tear to the original earphone (or speaker) plug, by preventing it from being bent (i.e. in your pocket, or in a tight closed sleeve for small devices).+ Reduces wear and tear to the device, again by preventing the plug from,bending. How? When a force is applied to the side of the plug, the device's port where it is plugged in also absorbs the force, thus possibly increasing wear, which might loosen the port.With the benefits above, this is a cheap investment if you use expensive devices and/or earphones.Verdict: I recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N7IUKP47ZMZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LGRKZC#wasThisHelpful","R1N7IUKP47ZMZM","AZYBZEVISD0YX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZYBZEVISD0YX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The In-Ear 3 from Creative offers superb quality. I have been using the In-Ear 2 for a long time since its inception, and I have been very happy with the quality. I have tried several earphones for its price range*, and I know I am a proud owner of In-Ear2. And then In-Ear3 came out, with a hefty price tag. Even until now, the price stands at $150 from the official Creative store. I got one here at Amazon for under $99. What I got surprised me.What I Like:(+) Dual Armature Driver, gives superior audio quality from single driver earphones (dual-drivers are RARE).(+) Very comfortable fit, I could wear this all day without noticing it. The In-Ear2 is a LOT lighter, but I find this one a lot more comfortable to wear. I have been wearing all my earphones over the ear, and this one is made exactly with that in mind. Very ergonomic.(+) For under $100, this is a grab. I would say comparable earphones are priced at least twice this one, like those from Etymotic and Shure. Sure, those may be a little bit better, but for the price, no one can beat this.(+) Elastic cord. Finally, they chose the elastic type cord found in their low-end earphones like EP-630, versus their ""durable"" hard cord found on both In-Ear and In-Ear2. I actually find these a lot more durable considering real-world use.What I don't Like:(-) The plug is a little easy to break because it uses a straight plug. I broke mine, as I broke my In-Ear 2 plug. By ""breaking"", I don't mean unuseable. A 33-cent glue will fix it. I am actually delighted to know that the In-Ear3 has more protection at the plug. When i broke my In-Ear2 plug, the wires are visible. With the In-Ear3, the wires are still covered by the elastic cord. A big plus. I personally think an L-shaped plug would have been better,, it it could just be from the way i use my devices and the earphones.Recommendation:I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Don't waste money on both Beats and Bose. They sound crappy and they are expensive - you only really pay for the brand name. Sennheiser is AS GOOD as creative, but offers its products at twice the price (e.g., compare Creative EP-630 and Sennheiser CX-300, you'd be surprised to know that they use the same hardware). I know, because I tried these products.I like Creative products, but this is not a biased review (See my other Creative products review, a bit more harsh).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R43PH0J1L6ADM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SNCZ3K#wasThisHelpful","R43PH0J1L6ADM","AZYBZEVISD0YX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZYBZEVISD0YX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this LED Light up Iron Man costume for my dog Teagan.She is a boxer approximately 50 pounds. This was a little bit short for her but it's because she is oddly shaped, nothing wrong with the product itself.This Halloween Costume by Pawow is very well made and super adorable. My dog is a girl but she still makes an awesome Iron Man. The back lights up which is an awesome feature and makes this costume worth every penny. I can not wait for her to wear this Halloween night , it is definitely going to be an attention grabber. Between the lights and the cuteness she will not go unnoticed. Some dog costumes are VERY high priced and them made very poorly. That is not the case with this costume.

"Love this tassel chain anklet / arm piece. It is absolutely gorgeous ! I went to a beach party / barbecue and wore this to accessorize my bathing suit / coverup. This anklet is such a beautiful / stylish design with bohemian inspiration, definitely perfect for a beach event. I was able to wear this with my flip flops on but also barefoot on the beach. The Turquoise Beads add just the right amount of color to this piece of jewelry. This piece is definitely an attention grabber and many of my friends asked me where I got it.

"These diskin headphones are phenomenal. Without a doubt the best pair of headphones ive ever owned. They look very stylish and appealing. The gold color looks so cool,  definitely an attention grabber. You can use these headphones wired or via bluetooth which is great. They are also considered noise cancelling headphones which is great because I can hear my music with no problems, I am not interupted by outside sounds.I love listening to music when im cleaning the house but sometimes my fiancee works from home and the music can be disturbing so I put on the headphones to enjoy my time but also not affect him. When I'm cleaning or moving around the wire of headphones tends to get in the way so the bluetooth feature is very helpful. The headphonesheadphones pair to my cellphone very easily.  All I have to do is hold the bluetooth button on the headphones for ten seconds, press a few buttons on my phone and within moments they are synced perfectly. I have used beats headphones and other expensive brands and in my honest opinion these head phones from Diskin are way better ! Some may say they are pricey, but if you want a quality product I suggest you purchase these. They are worth every penny and are a smart investment . You can tell they are made to last, I can confidently say I believe I will not need a new set of headphones for at least a few years.Not only are these used for music, you can use them for phone calls as well. So in the middle of my music jam session I can easily answer or make calls. This headset is so practical, I love it.

"This Bombex Big Guy Waterproof Silicone Rabbit Vibrator came packaged is a nice white box that included two packets of lube.I found the lube to be a great bonus because this toy is indeed a big guy ;)It is not too big where it is unusable or painful but it is larger than some toys I've encountered before.This definitely is an enjoyable product. The shape is great for internal and external pleasure at the same time. The silicone material is nice and smooth so it glides in comfortably with barely any friction. When applying the lube it allows for an even easier glide. The silicone is easy to clean afterwards which is great because nobody likes dirty toys. This rabbit uses 2 AAA batteries and once you insert them and turn the toy on let me tell you, it has a lot of power! This 10 Function G-spot Vibe has different patterns, pulses and speeds. It is very powerful and enjoyable but also very discreet. Usually toys that pack this much power are way louder but that is not the case with this Big Guy from Bombex.

Every morning she shakes the bottle well and then adds the 10 drops to her breakfast shake and doesnt even realize its been added. It is tasteless and easy to use. I tried the drops too , just to see if they really were tasteless and they really are! The dropper is easy to use also, and actually drops the perfect amount each time, it's not a sporadic dribble.  WE both found the liquid drops to be favored because having to swallow a pill is a total pain in the butt sometimes. This way is just easier, less of a hassle. The benefits are unbelievable. I know that this has helped supply proper nutrient not only to her but to her baby.I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10QF4O9L2532T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X08RTGW#wasThisHelpful","R10QF4O9L2532T","A3OYO2DJLYWSCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OYO2DJLYWSCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely LOVE these bibs! They are soooo cute ! I got them for my cousin and everyone always asks where they came from. They are very stylish and practical. The mustache is my absolute favorite. Their easy to clean and reusable which I love ! Its to the point where my cousin matches her sons outfits to the bibs rather than matching the bibs to the outfit haha.  The quality is phenomenal.

"This tote is seriously amazing. I am a huge wino. My family is too. Whenever we have large gatherings I always bring a few bottles with me. They live in the city so I always have to walk a good distance from my car to their house. Before having this bag I always had trouble carrying more than one bottle with me. There was more than one occasion where I smashed bottles into each other and made a huge mess. Now with this Wine Carrier Tote from Diner's Delight, I never have to worry. This high quality tote has a perfectly stitched divider located on the inside. It holds 4 wine bottles perfectly ! The bottles do touch a tiny but but they are not moving around and causing any kind of collision or breakage. I love that this bag is fold-able because once I arrive to my location and unload I can make sure to fold the bag up and put it in my purse. Id be devastated if I accidentally left it anywhere. The material of the bag itself does seem thin and at first I was a bit hesitant but after using it a few times, I noticed it is made VERY well and SUPER DURABLE ! I also love the cute design on the bag, its very chic and stylish.

"I LOVE these aviators. I absolutely love the polarized / mirrored affect. I have seen very expensive companies such as Rayban sell glasses styled such as this but theyre super expensive. These Bertha Classic Aviators from ASTAR-EYEWEAR are made to be very high quality, very comparable to its competitors. I love the different colors you can pick from. I personally ordered the dark blue ones but there are many more wonderful colors to choose from. Some of the colors include green , grey, orange, mercury, etc. They are very durable but also lightweight. Usually glasses with the nose pieces bother me but these rest on my face very comfortably. They are  very stylish / unisex sunglasses that are made with a full rimmed stainless steel metallic frame.  They lenses definitely protect from UV rays. They also come in a very durable case with a really awesome screwdriver tool / keychain.I really am pleased with these sunglasses. Theyve very affordable which is great because they are the quality of very expensive sunglasses. This is honestly the only pair of sunglasses that have actually made it so I can drive when the sun is out, usually I get blinded and can't see a thing.

"This dildo from UTIMI is great ! The suction cup is sooooo strong. A lot of other suction cup base dildos that I own do not hold strong when suctioned to an area. This one stays put ! The dildo is VERY life like ! It is sized / proportioned to look very realistic; it even has veins ! This dildo is a bit on the thinner side, but the length is great ! I have a few dildos that are smaller and a few that are larger, this is very good for an intermediate ""self-pleaser""  I also like that this dildo can bend, its not too flimsy but it can bend and move with me to hit all the right spots. I say intermediate rather than beginner because the length is  a bit longer than average. It may be considered a bit much for a newbie to handle. I definitely recommend this toy.

"I really like this ""magic"" wand by Shibari  .. It is a multi function product , it can be used as a muscle massager or even a personal / intimate massager . I have tried this product both ways.  I like that its on the longer side because I can reach all my problems area, especially both ends of my back. I like that the top part bends a bit so I can apply pressure when needed. This wand massager has two speeds. I have a few products that are similar to this but they have numerous speeds, pulses , etc and I dont like that. I personally do not like the pulses or patterns, so those end up being useless extra settings for me. This one only having two speeds makes it easier and more user friendly . This plug in magic wand massager is definitely a fantastic item that I am so happy to own ..

Our relationship and lives will grow, forever connected. This beautiful pendant also comes with a 22inch stainless steel chain that is very durable. I like that the chain is on the longer side, I hate when necklaces stop on my sternum area, I prefer longer dangley necklaces.

It does not rust and has not gotten dull what so ever.  I also like that it came with a bonus stainless steel vegetable peeler.

"Perrier  Aromatics has absolutely changed my baking experience with this Haitian Pure Almond Extract. I ordered the 8oz bottle and can say its more than I need. A little bit of this extract goes a long way ! It absolutely blows away generic almond extract.Around Christmas time I make Almond Shortbread cookies:1 cup butter 1/2 cup white sugar 2 teaspoons almond extract 2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 1/3 cup granulated sugar for decorationDirections:In a large bowl, beat butter with 1/2 cup sugar and almond extract until light and fluffy. With wooden spoon, stir in flour until smooth and well combined. Divide dough into 2 parts. Refrigerate, covered for 2 hours.Preheat oven 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).On lightly sugared surface, roll out dough, one part at a time, about 1/2 inch thick. Using a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut out cookies. Place 1 inch apart, on ungreased cookie sheet. With end of wooden spoon, or cookie press, make an indentation in center of each cookie.Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until light golden brown around the edges. While still warm, roll in sugar. Cool completely on a wire rack.I wanted to try the recipe out once I received this extract, so now instead of using 2 teaspoons almond extract I use 1. I can almost say 1 teaspoon is too much because the flavor is even more bold and taste-able than using generic almond extract.

"I have tried Shibari condoms before and was very pleased with the quality so when I came across the Triton Spray I had the same expectations. My boyfriend rarely has a problem with ""lasting"" but sometimes when we 'sext"" all day or have been away from each other for a bit when we are finally in front of each other things get too hot and heavy too quickly. This 1oz bottle of Shibari Triton Spray is a small bottle but it goes a long way. It's very affordable and worth every penny. Like I said before , it's not something we need to use often but when it is needed it is a major helper.  This spray contains a larger desensitizing agent than its competitors. It has the maximum amount (10 mg) of lidocaine that can be used / needs to be used for this purpose. It's safe and easy to use. You just spray it (2 - 10 sprays) and let it set for a few minutes. In our personal experience we used 4 sprays, let it sit for 10 minutes and then went at it. It allowed him to last 20 minutes longer than expected in that situation.  I have told many friends about this product because I know that some women take much longer than the man to climax. Having this spray will definitely allow more couples to have a session that will leave both partners 100% satisfied.I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJ9YS1XJ7YMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU9RSLG#wasThisHelpful","R3DJ9YS1XJ7YMG","A3OYO2DJLYWSCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OYO2DJLYWSCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Papaya Wear Retro High Waist One-piece Swimsuit is amazing! I have trouble finding bathing suits because I have a large bottom so if I buy regular sized bottoms they never fit and if I try one pieces its nearly impossible. I have tried a bunch of Papaya Wear's clothing / lingerie and absolutely love their products. I figured I'd check out their bathing suits. When I saw this one I instantly fell in love but than realized it was plus sized and scrolled past it. I kept finding myself coming back to this bathing suit because I absolutely love the design. Its a very sexy one piece but still simple at the same time. It didnt show of too much and I figured maybe trying a plus size would result in the bottom half actually fitting. When I ordered it I was so eager for it to arrive because I was anxious to know if I finally had found a bathing suit to wear. Well let me tell you, it fits like a glove! The fabric is wonderful, very light weight and soft, but not thin and flimsy. It is not see-through or sheer like some of the competitors poor quality bathing suits. This bathing suit along with all of Papaya Wears products is made of such high quality.

"Absolutely love this Meaneor women's cocktail dress. I had been looking for a dress that looked classy but could also be considered causal. I had found a few black dresses but because the ""little black dress"" is everyone's go-to I felt I needed to find something better. Finally I came across this dress and knew it was exactly what I needed. When I ordered it, i received it super quickly. Meaneor has fantastic customer service and their products are fantastic. This sleeveless dress is made out of super comfortable material, the material feels so amazing on my skin and it's very breathable. I love that this light / airy material is still very durable. It's not cheap and flimsy like some of the competitors dresses. I love that the dress has a deep V neck, it gave it a bit of sex appeal. Also stripes are very popular this summer so this dress instantly became my go-to dress for numerous occasions. I highly recommend this dress, its very flattering and fits wonderfully. I was afraid because I have a pretty large butt that it would be too short, but it's not! It's absolutely perfect.

"About 7 months ago I had surgery on my wrist and my elbow which resulted in the loss of pretty much all strength in my right hand. This is such an issue for me because I am right hand dominate. I was going to physical therapy for a few weeks but then unfortunately I lost my health insurance. I was devastated because I was only making small progress on strengthening my wrist. When I came across the LifeStyle Lite Hand Gripper it had my attention immediately.

"Wow, at the current price for this watch, under one hundred bills, this is a great buy.  This watch looks very modern and classy.  The two tone metal is the way to go these days in my opinion and this one does it very nicely, not gaudy or cheap looking at all.  This watch is heavy too and seems very well made.  I love the face of it, a light grey color which blends perfectly into the silver metal.  White faces on a watch are too bright and cheapen the look in my opinion.  I have to admit I have no idea what the three smaller dials on the watch face represent, other than that they make the watch face more interesting.  Sorry, I use a watch to tell time and the date if that is available.  The other things on a watch are just extra goodies that I don't need. Womens watches usually can't fit all those extras in, so we aren't used to having it anyways.  But back to the price, wow, this is a steal.  My husband has about 7 watches and this one fits its own niche.  You need a black metal band watch, a black faced watch, fun watches, leather band watches and low profile, simple but elegant watches like this one.  He has paid more for other watches, but this one is just as good as those and I think it looks great on the wrist.  I do have to say the picture used to represent the watch makes it look like a brushed gold and silver metal, but it is really more of the polished gold and silver, so it is shinier, but it still looks fantastic all around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ET58SZT758K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JMKPPY#wasThisHelpful","R12ET58SZT758K","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Widow is an engrossing tale, told mainly from the viewpoint of Jean Taylor, the wife of Glen, with Glen either being an innocent victim or perverted husband.  You wonder is Jean just a naive devoted wife or co-conspirator here?  No spoilers given.  The book encompasses a 4 year time period, going back and forth many times throughout the 54 chapters.  Thankfully each chapter has a date on it so you know where the story is picking up  each time.  I believe the book had been compared to Gone Girl which I had also read.  Perhaps there are vague similarities, but I think Gone Girl was much more diabolical and complex in a sense.  The Widow is not as intense or psychological as Gone Girl, but it is still a very good book.  It has over 300 pages to it, and on a few short occasions I felt the book was spinning its wheels as it danced around the main question of what happened to tiny Bella.  It is like the story just continuously circles around that question, sometimes getting close to it and then veering away.  It isn't until the very end that it is resolved.  It did keep me up late reading and thinking about the book during the day, so that is always a sign of a good book to me.  It is close to being a 5 star book for me, but those are reserved for such books like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with their complex, detailed plots.Overall this book is a quick, enjoyable read.  The cast of characters is small, the settings are few so you stay familiar with everything throughout the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIL0U6W5RIZ59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101990260#wasThisHelpful","RIL0U6W5RIZ59","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very attractive, and slightly out of the ordinary watch for a man.  And it is definitely a man's watch with its sizing.  The face is about 1.75 inches in diameter and about 1/3 of an inch thick.  Much thicker than most watches I've seen.  The glass over the face has a mild dome to it, giving it a slight retro look.  The band is genuine leather and has a pattern to it, not a flat leather at all.  It feels pretty thick and should hold up well to wear.  My husband has worn it a few times to work and says he likes it quite well.  It is easy to see the time on it, and he likes the little window for the date also.When he first put it on, he said that setting the time and date was not very intuitive, he had to fool around with the 3 different dials to get it all right.  But of course, it does come with an instruction booklet, so that would answer all the questions on how to do it.  I have a picture of it on my wrist, which is quite small, so you can see how big it is.  Not something I would wear, but great for my tall husband.This is one of his more unique watches now, I told him it makes me think of Sherlock Holmes, or something from the past because of its shape and styling.  It is definitely a nice change from all the shiny metal watches with  modern faces to them.  It is quite classy in its own way. and seems to have quite an attention to the little details, like LP etched on the stainless steel clasp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DX2V7018UN27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QM072O#wasThisHelpful","R1DX2V7018UN27","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is quite a stunning bracelet.  It has just enough glitz to give it a fancy,dressy look, but it is also simple enough to wear with casual items.  It is not overly heavy and with a little pressure, you can conform it to fit to your wrist.  I would say I have smaller wrists, and after I put it on, I can squeeze it together a little so that I have no worry of it falling off.  At the same time I would by no means consider it a fragile item even though it has bendable qualities to it. Truthfully, whoever created this design, did it pretty much perfectly.  There isn't a thing I would change about it.  My wrist measures exactly 6 inches around, and the bracelet is 7.25 inches, so if anything, I could go smaller, but this does not look  large on me.  Large wristed women might need a bigger one if they don't like bracelets that grab on, although it can be opened wider very easily.  It shines and sparkles very nicely and does not look like a piece of cheap jewelry.  A great all around attractive bracelet.  I am glad it doesn't have that overly shiny look, but has texture to it.  If guys are looking for a gift to give, this would seem to be a very safe bet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIJCS8MDE0P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3WYBVW#wasThisHelpful","RVIJCS8MDE0P7","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not one for glittery, big fancy pieces of jewelry, and glad to say this ring is none of those.  It does have some glitter, but it keeps it low key, and the size is modest.  I was glad to see the metal in the ring is thick and sturdy.  Some rings have thin metal for the band, and over time they can lose their circular shape.  I do not see this happening with this ring at all.  The 2 gold tone hearts on the side make a nice contrast to the sparkling heart in  the middle.  I think it is more of a rose gold color though, as I had a true 14kt gold ring on next to it, and the gold on this Hallmark ring definitely had a copper shade to it.  I don't mind it, as I find rose gold to be very nice itself.My teenage daughter definitely liked this ring too, and if her finger was a size 7, then I am sure I would not see much of this ring. She is modeling it in the picture and it is too big for her.  Lucky for me.  The setting  seems strong and for the price, this ring seems like a good buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A4ZXKMG23L83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XK1HXRY#wasThisHelpful","R3A4ZXKMG23L83","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice, and large water bowl, but not sure if 100% necessary.  Almost like it is one of those things for the dog that has everything else.  The 120 oz size bowl is the way to go for multiple dogs.  I have 2 pitbulls and one senior fox terrier and cute little bowls don't do the trick.  This does hold a lot of water, but you have to be careful it does not go too low, then you could damage the water pump recirculater thingie.  Admittedly, one of my other water bowls can run dry, so I have to be careful to watch this one.It replaced a ceramic bowl in my basement that my dogs would eagerly drink from.  Once I plugged this one in, they gave it a wide berth for a day.  It makes a humming noise, similar to a fish tank sound.  There is no water bubbling and you can barely see the ripples in the bowl. Still, it took about 2 days before my dogs would drink from it.  I don't want to make it my main water dish as my old dog has the gift of making the water bowl gross, like he rinses his mouth out in it, and this one would be too much of a pain to constantly change the water out of it.  I am not overly thrilled with the suggestion to change the charcoal filter every 2 to 4 weeks.  Really?  I am more a 2-4 months kind of owner.  So we will see how that goes.  If nothing else it may become a glorified water bowl with no running pump.So, if you like the idea of circulating water for your big dog, this one is a great idea.  Just know it takes more upkeep than a plain old water bowl.  It is a sturdy plastic bowl, and when you do have to clean it out, you don't have to unplug from the wall, it has a connector near the base to make it easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0L2ODRV3ORX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151JV6MK#wasThisHelpful","R2P0L2ODRV3ORX","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been an Otterbox fan in the past, having used the commuter and defender series for iphone 5's, and find this one to be the same quality of workmanship.  I don't feel it has half the protection of the defender series and is still a step below the commuter, but compared to the average slap on phone cover, this one has a thick edge to it and does offer some protection.  My daughter quickly put it on her iphone 6 and simply said she liked it.  She doesn't like the bulkier, more protective ones.  She does like the idea that she can put any type of photo or picture on the back of her phone and it will be seen through the back clear cover.  Nifty idea. Gives the phone lots of design options.The one thing that gives me a little concern is how shiny and smooth some of the plastic is, it makes the phone feel a bit slippery to me with this cover on.  The edges of the cover are more of that rubbery plastic and has a grip to it, but the curved bottom side is hard plastic. Larger, sweatier hands certainly won't have a concern with it, but I do like a nice solid grip on the phone, one slip and the phone itself could crack, that is always my worry, but that is with any cover on it that isn't super rugged.I also like it when the phone case/cover  goes over the ports for plug in, and this one doesn't.  I feel that helps the phone last a lot longer by keeping dust/dirt/junk out of it.  I currently use the Otterbox Resurgence that has the extra battery power in it.  It is a heavier case, but a nice rubber feel and the charging port is protected. OtterBox Resurgence Power/BatteryCase for Apple iPhone 6/6s - Retail Packaging - Glacier (White/Gunmetal Grey)  But it is nice to have options and Otterbox has never disappointed me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4OJTFNKO8PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53TU64#wasThisHelpful","R2B4OJTFNKO8PG","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wrestling game, who'd have thought I would have any interest in that?  Normally, I would have passed this game by without a second thought, but I currently have a foreign exchange student in my home who is borderline obsessed with wrestling.  I figured this game would interest him and give us something to do during the upcoming winter.  So far it has been working out great.  I have played lots of board games beyond the standard store ones, while he is pretty much only familiar with video games.  It is fun to introduce someone to the world of boardgaming beyond such games as Monopoly or Risk.  Many have no idea these kind of games exist.  It has taken a few slow learning games to get the hang of it all, but each time it gets a little better and we can develop a bit more of a strategy.  I was pretty much the Queen of Randomness when we started, while he studied the cards a  lot more.  He loves the miniatures included and the great pictures and quality of the cards.  I have seen photos of some of the minis painted and that might be a project for him.We make sure to rotate the 6 different wrestler player cards as they each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and he is already asking if more cards are available.  Not to beat a dead horse, but yes it is rock-paper-scissors mechanics, but that is fine, keeps game play moving along and lets me continue to test my intuition against my opponent.  Admittedly I am not a huge wrestling fan, find it a bit odd to watch, but the sport does provide a base for an interesting game.  Also love the fact that games can last 10 minutes or 30.  I imagine the better we get at planning strategy, the longer it will last.  At this point we haven't tried the tag team, and I don't plan on bringing it up anytime soon.  He will probably be quite happy to play this for a long time, but I hope to make it a jumping off point to many more games as it is a great introductory type of game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MO4RRSW3RKSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0P2W3S#wasThisHelpful","R1MO4RRSW3RKSD","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am no perfume expert by any means and rarely purchase any.  There are some perfumes that you can smell and right away your head starts to throb a bit from the odor.  I was worried this might be one, but my first smell test of it showed that I didn't have to worry about that.  It was very light and airy smelling...at first.  I put some on my neck and wrists and forced my husband to sniff it and he approved.  I then got in my car to drive, with windows up, and soon it became a much stronger smell and a little thicker in scent.  I worried my workmates would get put off by it, but that proved not to be a problem.  I really didn't even smell it much later on during the day, and alas, no one commented on it.  I guess the lesson learned was to put on a bit less and do a more indirect spraying of the mist when putting it on.To me this seems like a pretty safe bet of a perfume purchase.  It might not be someones favorite, but I don't think many people will hate it because it does come off as light and fresh smelling.  The bottle is by no means eye catching, but I for one am appreciative of its wide base.  Tall skinny bottles just get knocked over too easily, and don't get me started on cats and knocking stuff over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23WZ4OY1X15FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOJGITI#wasThisHelpful","R23WZ4OY1X15FZ","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love games, love the show A Game of Thrones, so this was a must have.  I never played the first edition so I can not compare it to that.  Thankfully the Fantasy Flight website has a tutorial for the game which is quite helpful https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/a-game-of-thrones-the-card-game-second-edition/  It consists of a 17 minute youtube video, but it can make understanding the  learn to play guidebook much easier.I have only been able to attempt the tutorial joust version of the game, and I can see that will be enough for me for awhile.  The tutorial game has you using the Lannister and Stark decks (2 factions), and a prepicked number of cards.  There are 8 factions available, so you can definitely branch out in the game.  Fortunately I have played Magic, the Gathering before, and it has similarities to that, so that made it a little easier.As others have said, there is a learning curve of getting familiar with the cards and what happens during the marshaling and challenge phases.  The guide book will be your best friend as you learn to play at first.The quality of the cards, fake gold pieces and power counters are good, nothing feels cheap or flimsy.  The guide and rule books seem well written and should answer almost all questions.  If not, there is an amazing game site, www.boardgamegeek.com that has a whole forum for this game.  It is also nice that this is not a collectible card game where some people can get rare/valuable cards and you spend too much money trying to get them also.

"I work in an independent pet food store and love to read ingredient labels and try out the new foods on my cats and dogs.  I know Wellness has a pretty good reputation for food and this food sounds great, so I had to give it a try.  My 3 cats are not very picky though, and they did eat this up without leaving a kibble behind.  There is even a stray cat at my work, so I put some out for her (she is spayed!), and she ate it up, but that isn't too surprising, she is no doubt hungry.  They do use peas as their binder for food and I did read somewhere that peas are not very palatable to dogs and cats.  Some canned foods have peas in them, and cats are notorious for leaving the peas untouched.Normally I give my cats Orijen dry kibble and Friskies canned food (I know, that one is not the best, will be upgrading).  This Wellness air dried food is almost twice the price of Orijen, and Orijen is not cheap.  I have to give the ingredient panel to Orijen the winning points though.  The first 16 ingredients in Orijen are meat/protein ingredients, followed by fruits/veggies, natural herbs and then more meat goodies.  Their list of chemical vitamins and minerals is much shorter than the list in Wellness.  I prefer that my pets get their vitamins from their food, not synthesized chemicals.  Taurine is an essential amino acid for cats, and a lot of foods have to add that to their ingredient panel to get the recommended levels.  Orijen doesn't need to add the supplement because all the meat they use in the food supplies the necessary taurine.  Got to love that.  I am not an Orijen rep by any means, I just read the labels and do my own research.Raw food is also great for cats, so much meat and moisture in it.  Remember, cats are carnivores, while dogs can deal with grains, cats struggle to digest them.  Stella & Chewys sells frozen and dehydrated raw foods.  Your cat needs moisture, so they should never be fed just a dry diet.  I had one customer at the store I work at say that she would only feed her cat dry food so her teeth would stay good.  For one thing, that doesn't prevent dental issues by any means, and secondly you can cause more damage to the cats health by being ignorant of what they should eat.  Does any wild carnivore eat dry food only?  Well, enough ranting I guess.In all, this Wellness Core Air Dried food is way above so many other dry foods in quality, i.e. Science Diet, Iams, Purina, 9 lives, and so many others.  I wish people would read the ingredients and realize their cats should not eat corn in their food, nor animal digest, nor artificial flavors and colors.  Just because your cat likes it doesn't mean it is good for them, and the health effects don't always show up immediately.  If this food were more reasonably priced, I could see it doing a lot better in the market, but it will still have its followers, or be used as an occasional rotation food.  I am just happy to see more quality food come out for pets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQ4S1RE7844S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ03O0E#wasThisHelpful","R1WQ4S1RE7844S","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a mom with teenage daughters who also like reading.  We have done the Hunger Games series, Divergent, Maze Runner, Graceling books and plenty of other YA books.  I remember when this book first came out,  I passed on it.  While recently shopping I saw this book with a sticker on it saying it would be a major motion picture in 2016.  That was enough for me, I decided it was time to read the book then, as I much prefer to read the book before seeing the movie.  Needless to say this book sucked me in right away, I really liked the way the character of Cassie thought and was portrayed.  She was sarcastic, saw the irony in things and certainly didn't take herself too seriously.  She knew that she and her family (as well as the planet) was pretty much screwed when the mothership appeared in the sky.This book reminded me a bit of The Host, but with much more death and invisible aliens.  There are many that complain about how the aliens drag out the decimation of the earths inhabitants, when they clearly could do it quicker, but that is how the author wanted to play it out, and for me it works.  The story resolves in a plausible way, but realistically in an unlikely way.  Still, it made a darn good story for me.  I already purchased the second book and hope it lives up to this one.  I have also told my 14 yr old that this is the next book she is reading, and she will :).  Then she will thank me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JX6B8FTDENJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142425834#wasThisHelpful","R3JX6B8FTDENJV","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, short and simple, my 3 cats gladly eat this food, and it does not come back up so that is a good thing.  With 3 cats, they all split one can in the morning and one can at night, getting dry kibble during the day for snacks.  The only thing I am not thrilled about with this product is that the third ingredient is meat by products.  The type of meat is not specified, and the by products can be a range of items. So in some ways, you can't be 100% sure what your cat is really eating.  But I also realize in some ways, so what, my cat will catch a mouse and eat the whole thing, so I hope Purina is actually using edible, non-diseased meat by products.  This has made me think about my cat food a bit more though, I had been feeding them the Friskies cans, and lo behold, their first ingredients are water, poultry by products and then meat by products.  Yech.  After doing a little internet shop searching, I have been able to find cat canned food cheaper than this case and the ingredients have no by products and no grains, i.e. BFF brand and Weruva.So while this food is quite palatable to my cats, and I did once read that ANY wet cat food is better than the best dry food (because of moisture), I will step up my game a little and try to get my cats something that is a little more purer than this, especially if the price point is the same.Also, this food is a pretty dense pate mixture.  I can spoon it out of the can and hold the spoon upside down and it sticks to it.  That is neither a good or bad thing, and I suppose it beats a food being too watery, but cats are not known to be big drinkers, so moisture in food is very important to them.  Their natural diet of animals would consist of 70% water, similar to moisture content in  canned food, while dry food has about 12% moisture in it.  I believe I also read once that if you just feed  your cat dry food, it has to drink a cup of water a day to equal moisture in its natural diet.  That also plays a part in why some cats get constant urinary issues, not enough water to dilute the urine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ9I13G4W0REX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVMMK8K#wasThisHelpful","RJ9I13G4W0REX","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised to be able to give this mineral/cream foundation a try.  For the last year I have been trying various powders and liquids to try and find one I really liked.  At 50 years old,  I have the lovely trifecta of slight rosacea, dark circles and visible pores. Not fun to try and hide. I have tried Smashbox, Estee Lauder, BareMinerals, DermaBlend, Hope in a Jar and a few others in powders and liquids.  My favorite had been the Laura Geller balance and brighten face powder, but now I feel that this product with the mild moisturizing product in it, does a better job of blending onto the face.  I found that liquids tended to highlight pores and get shiny after awhile.  As for this product, Borba's Anti-Fatigue 8 hour mineral foundation, it does a great job.  I suppose it is that hybrid between a powder and a liquid, the mixing of the 2 elements in the case gives it an easy to apply and stay on foundation.  It is by no means a heavy makeup, but does enough to give the skin a healthy look while staying matte.  It does not hide pores (nothing does!), but I think I can say it minimizes them, blurring their edges,  while other foundations I have tried actually made them look bigger, who wants that?!  The medium color is by no means dark, and I would imagine most people would use that unless you have very pale skin.  I have no noticed any shimmer in it either.Applying with a good brush is a must, and although it is a bit costly, if it saves me experimenting with other lines, then I am happy to continue using it.  I think it is also important that they DO NOT TEST ON ANIMALS.  The SPF of 29 is also good to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93EDORL3D2DH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RJQ9WY#wasThisHelpful","R93EDORL3D2DH","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glad to see that Hill's has stepped up their game in the cat food arena.  My mother is into cat rescue and has over 40 cats (all fixed! and all stray, previously injured) on her property.  She can't afford great food for them, so sticks with the Purina which contains corn, by products and other junk.  They also get decent canned food.  I let her try this food on her cats and she said it was a big hit with them, great for the cats that were picky.  I like this food because it doesn't contain the corn, wheat, by products and other cheap ingredients.  I still believe cats should have grain free, so the barley and rice prevent that from being grain free, but it isn't horrible, much better than the Purina stuff.Still, even though it is a good food, you can buy (what I consider) better food for almost the same price.  Acana's Wild Prairie for cats is grain free, has more protein and less synthetic vitamins and minerals in it.  If you cat(s) throw up, pull out fur, have a dull coat, then you really need to check out the ingredients of their food.  I have seen people try quality food for their cats and really notice a difference.The Hills Crafted is a solid cat food, there are much worse foods out there (science diet i.e.), and it is nice they have a variety of flavors.  If you are a Hill's fan, they by all means try it.  I would love for my mothers cats to have this over Purina, but the cost would prohibit that.  Instead, she will get some as a special treat for them now and then.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B4ERZK7TL2TR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI32FIK#wasThisHelpful","R3B4ERZK7TL2TR","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I am no expert on vitamins, I buy them in the hopes they are helping in some form or other.  These SmartyPants Gummy vitamins seem like a good vitamin without artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, no GMO's, milk, or gluten amongst other things.  They have added fish oils from anchovy and sardine, which seems rarer to find in a child's gummy vitamin.  I already had a bottle of Max & Ruby chewables and there are some big differences. SmartyPants has vitamin B-12 (as methylcobalamin) at 67 mcg, equaling 1117% of a 4 year olds requirement.  Max & Ruby has vitamin B-12 (as cyanocobalamin) at 3 mcg, equaling 50% of 4 year olds requirement.  My adult vitamin has B12 at 6 mcg, 100% requirement.  I have no idea why there is such a difference in the 2 childrens vitamins though.As for the taste, my teenager and I find them tasty to eat.  Although she did say not to give her the yellow ones. She does prefer them to the Max & Ruby chewable . They all seem to taste the same to me.  3 years and older are supposed to take 4 gummies a day, but I just dole out 2 a day, no particular reason though.  At 4 gummies a day, you only exceed your requirements with B12 and the D3 vitamin.  I am still not sure what I believe about vitamins, so I take them on a non regular basis and try to get vitamins from healthy foods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2762YCKRDC22O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2Q3WDS#wasThisHelpful","R2762YCKRDC22O","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book seems to have come at an interesting time, when police shootings are unfortunately becoming commonplace.  Most likely our awareness is raised about these shootings because of people video recording the incident.  There has been a history of the judicial system believing the police over the citizen, but now that is coming under fire with those in authority being able to see the incident instead of just hear reports about it.  This relates to the book, in that Benforado (in my opinion) seems to imply that people become conditioned to behaviors, and even though they think they are being impartial, they still follow their own beliefs.  Such as the Supreme Court judges, if they all have the same Constitution, same rules to follow, same sources to gather information, why aren't all their decisions the same? Their beliefs skew their research so that what they research agrees with what they believe to be right.  Basically, you can always find information to support your belief, and that works for both sides of the coin.  Even though the author does not write about recent shootings, in the past the belief that the officer would not lie, and if there was no proof he was not lying, then his version of the shooting would be believed.  Technology is changing all that, and the truth becomes easier to find and the human variable reduced greatly.  In the book Benforado gives some interesting examples of how human fallibility hurts the justice system.  One story that sticks with me and made me think was the story of a woman who was raped and was then asked to view a police line up of 5 men.  The police had their own suspect in mind (who was innocent) and they pulled the real suspect (by mere coincidence) into the line up also.  The victim picked out the innocent man, and that moment pretty much sealed his fate.  It makes sense that now the victim, who didn't have a clear look at her attacker, now has the face of the innocent man to fill in the blanks for her attacker.  The police went along, the prosecutor and eventually the jury decided that this woman was sure about her attacker even though physical evidence didn't prove he was the one who raped her.  This victim now believed the innocent man was her attacker and in reality, was she suddenly going to change her mind during the trial and say, oh, I made a mistake?  Not likely, instead the man spent 28 years in jail, and the guilty man went on to commit more crimes.  What a horrendous snowball effect.  There are more examples and it does make you think how much reliance we put on others to prove or disprove a persons guilt.  Goodness, how many times have we heard the stories of multiple witnesses to one incident, and those stories  vary immensely as to what the people believed happened.  Why does one story stand out as true and the others don't?The book is written with the anecdotes, then with occasional studies and then with the authors viewpoint and explanation of human behavior.  I can't say it is a light, easy going read, and as I am not involved in legal work at all, I found some of it a bit too rambling for me as I just wanted some insight into human behavior, preferably with anecdotes.  I would hope that lawyers, police officers, judges and people working in the justice system would read this book and have their eyes opened, at least  a little.  But the sad truth is that while we can be enlightened for awhile, we tend to fall back into our old habits and beliefs.  Thus, the hope for improved technology to improve our justice system. Humans have shown they make too many costly mistakes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25QPTOSQTVO86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770437761#wasThisHelpful","R25QPTOSQTVO86","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dogs love to chew fabric, and so I don't expect this to be a miracle toy and be impervious to my dogs teeth.  I got it fairly cheap and it felt sturdy, so I let my two 55 pound pitties play with it.  It is holding up after one day, but I know eventually I will be picking up the stuffing all over the place.  Such is life.  If you don't want your dog to destroy it, they need antlers, raw bones, ruff roots, water buffalo horns or something else like that to chew on.  But the reality is they love to tear apart fabric, to hear the ripping, I suppose it simulates them making a catch/kill out in the wild.

"This is a gorgeous brush to look at and feels good in the hand with a nice weight.  The packaging with it said good for pressed powder and loose powder, but I think it should just say loose powder.  The first time I tried it, I was trying to put on a finishing pressed powder, just to swipe here and there, but the brush would not pick it up, I saw no color transfer on it.  The bristles are not extremely firm, and would just glide over the pressed powder.  The next time I went straight for the loose powder and it did fine with that.  I compare it to a kabuki type brush I also have that I also use as a finishing brush.  Both work well I would say, although the kabuki has firmer bristles to use with a pressed powder.  The advantage me be that with loose powder, this brush won't pick up too much at a time.  This one is supposed to mattify, but I couldn't really tell if that works,  I don't see how the brush will affect my skin or the type of powder I use.  It is a nice thought at least.For the price it is a nice brush to have in your arsenal, but it has no super powers in it.  It is nice and easy to pick out amongst your other brushes as it has bright white bristles and the pretty blue metal on it.  That will also make it easier to remind you to clean it more often when you see the powder build up on the white bristles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R80VHT8NX2FB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPNUUJM#wasThisHelpful","R80VHT8NX2FB4","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I give it 5 stars because this workout video is tailored to me, middle aged used to be in shape person.  If you are a hard core workout person, then this would probably be too easy for you.  I had it on my shelf for a year (my bad), and finally took it out.  LOVE the short 20 minute work out options.  If they are too long, it is too hard to want to do them.  And you can stream the 3 together, so you really have the option of 20, 40 or 60 minutes of working out.  I prefer doing the circuit segment, which is more motion and light weight use.  20 mins of it and you feel like you did something.  The other 2 are by no means easy workouts, but just a different intensity.I truthfully remember doing the Kathy Smith videos back in the 80's and 90's and she sure hasn't changed much...stayed in better shape than me for sure.  I didn't find her noises and peppy attitude annoying, she definitely keeps the energy level up so you don't have time to slow down.

"This is a great feeding tool at a great price.  Not real fun to clean the slimy lickings off of it, but it is dishwasher safe.  I don't really have dogs (3) that are gulpers, so this was more of a fun exercise thing for them.  Plus I feed them a mixture of kibble, meat and water, and although that would clearly work in this bowl, it just gets messy.  I like that it is a good size for large dogs, you could get their whole feedings in this bowl.  Might be overkill for small dogs, but it would still work.  I also think it is a great thing for cats, of which I have 4.  They obviously can't stick their noses/tongues in far enough to get the food, but it makes them use their paws to fish the dry food out.  With their un-busy lifestyle, they have plenty of time to fish kibble out of this bowl.I would recommend this one over the other slow feeder, Northmate Interactive.  That one almost looks painful to use.And remember, you shouldn't free feed your dog, have scheduled feeding times for them at least twice a day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9CGHDF643HZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPKNRF0#wasThisHelpful","R1I9CGHDF643HZ","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forget badminton.  With speedminton, if you play it right, you will work up a sweat.  The racquets are much more sturdier than badminton ones, but not as bulky as tennis racquets.  I have spent many an hour playing with my kids and a neighbor.  You can really whack the birdie with these racquets.  A tennis court size playing field is about right, although you play with a net (imaginary one for me) that is higher.  You usually loft the birdie up high instead of doing low shots.  You will get some good exercise moving to hit the birdie and swinging with almost full force.  So nice that you can play on grass, sand, cement, almost anywhere.  I never play with a defined court, just do a lot of hitting back and forth.  With the kids, we are lucky to get 10-15 hits in a row, with a good player, you can easily go 40-50 till someone makes a mistake.  Can't recommend this game/sport enough.

"I recently purchased the ZAQ Mirage Diffuser, but had problems with the adapter working.  I then decided to give this one a try so I could use my oil blends.  This one is nice and worked right off the bat.  The way it is set up is a little clunky, at least compared to the ZAQ one.  The lights and timers are nice, but the buttons and writing are small.  It does not rotate through as many colors as the ZAQ does, but that isn't a big deal. The ZAQ does not have a timer, but just stops when the water dries up, as does this one, but it also has timers.  The Samyo has its mist come out from the side of the rim, so you sort of point it in the direction you want the mist to go.  The ZAQ's mist comes right out of the top of the diffuser.  The ZAQ has a bigger footprint, so might not be able to fit in all locations, while the Samyo is just a little bigger than a soda can.  There is about a twenty five dollar difference in price and that is pretty substantial.  I am glad I have both, I feel the Samyo is great for a kids room, while I keep the ZAQ in the kitchen/living room area.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJUBJY4DK9YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP9ZE10#wasThisHelpful","R1HJUBJY4DK9YS","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The picture of the ZAQ Dew pretty much looks like the Mirage without the plastic base around the bottom, probably added to keep it stable.  Anyways, I am thoroughly enjoying the ZAQ Mirage.  I am just slightly worried about the longevity of it.  When I first took it out to try, I followed the instructions. Add water to the line, add oil drops, plug in.  Push the button to start it and a brief flash of light, then nothing.  Pushed button to start again, and it ran about 5 seconds and shut off.  Rechecked the connections, and after about 3 minutes, it starts working like a charm.  It just seems a little fiddly to start every now and then.

Still, it makes a great mist and the 4-5 drops of oil do a great job of filling up a room.  At night I put it in my bedroom, in the daytime it goes in the kitchen/living room.  I think it runs a good 5-6 hours on one fill up of water.The Mirage does not come with a handy filling container, that would have been nice, but livable without it.  I don't use tap water, just filtered water and make sure to dry it out when it runs empty.  The instructions that come with it are extremely basic.  I have been using oil blends from Edens Gardens, one of my favorites is Joy, which contains bergamot, geranium,  jasmine, lemon, mandarin, palmarosa, chamomile, rose,rosewood, sweet orange and ylang ylang.  Wow,, all that goodness in one inexpensive bottle.  They have so many other great blends and sell them on amazon.I would recommend this diffuser and really hope it lasts a long time, and that my issue with it turning on is just a quirk. **UPDATE** After less than 1 week of having it, its quirk has turned into a problem.  It won't turn on...unless I continuously hold the wire tightly against the adapter when it is plugged in.  And to be honest, I don't feel like doing that for 3 hours.  Plus the slightest movement and it turns off.  I think the unit itself is fine, the adapter is a piece of junk with loose wiring inside. GRRRR.  Looked for similar adapters in my house, but none with the same volts and output. Shame that something that should be easy to work ends up being another poorly made item, and not cheap at that.**Another UPDATE**  The company, Bombay Electronics did respond to emails about the adapter and promptly sent a new one in the mail. The wiring to the new one feels more secure, and the diffuser started up immediately without any issue or hesitation.  Thank you Bombay Electronics.  Rating upped to a 4 again.  I did also purchase aSamyo 100ml Aromatherapy Essential Oil Purifier Diffuser Air Humidifier with 4 Timer Settings & 6 Colors Changing Light for another area of the house and was pleased to see the adapters are the same.  I must say I do like the ease of use of the ZAQ Mirage better than the Samyo.  The Samyo seems to work fine, and it is cheaper, but I would keep the ZAQ one over it.***May 2015*** The diffuser has worked perfectly since the new adaptor. It might  get used once or twice a week, and probably hasn't even been cleaned properly, but it lights up and spews the delightful aromas every time I turn it on.  5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4296VQS1E5DW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ29ICO#wasThisHelpful","R4296VQS1E5DW","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With 2  daughters with kind of difficult hair, I am always on the look out for non drying hair products.  I am so tired of all these fancy shampoos and conditioners that promise the world, and then when I read their ingredient panel, they all sound the same, chemical after chemical, alcohols, sulfates and petroleum products.  I saw this bottle and one daughter has become borderline obsessed with argan oil, swearing that it is making her hair softer and grow fast.  So this one has water as its first ingredient, then argania spinosa kernel oil, vitis vinifera seed oil, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone/silsequioxane copolymer, ceteareth-10, boswellia carterii oil, peg-4 sorbita stearate, cetrimonium chloride, hyaluronic acid, parfum, hydroxypropyl guar, phenoxyethanol.  So, it is not fully ""natural', the last ingredient is a bit controversial, but at least it is last.  Nonetheless, I have only used this conditioner once, and normally conditioners pretty much all leave my hair feeling the same, but I did notice it felt softer and not so fly awayish, kind of a silky feel to it.  Very nice.  Might splurge for the shampoo half of it now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYV01SYDCPLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HG1MRNY#wasThisHelpful","R1GYV01SYDCPLG","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 2 kids with varying degrees of asthma and often a cold turns into some kind of bronchial problem.  One daughter did get sick recently and I insisted she try this.  I also recently started using colloidal silver, and they make a sore throat spray, so she was taking both of those medicines each day.  Coincidence or not, she did not develop a full blown chest cold and did not miss any school.  Borderline miraculous considering she has had pneumonia and often has had to take nebulizer treatments. I realize it is hard to tell if this medicine did much to prevent the cold from getting worse, but seeing how it won't hurt her, I will  make sure she takes it again if the same symptoms rear their head.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M703OED4AH4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00618IKZW#wasThisHelpful","R3M703OED4AH4M","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You have to have a little faith when you pop pills and swallow them.  The write up on these Krill supplements sounds great, and I suppose if they do half of what they claim, then it is a good thing.  I know the smaller the fish, the better the oil for you, and Omega 3's are all the rage now.  I used to take regular fish oil pills, but wanted to try and get more bang for the buck.  I don't know if there is any coincidence, but my skin feels smoother!  Whether that has any relation or not, I will continue to take this pills as they ARE supposed to be good for you, and there is no discomfort or negative issue in taking them.  Especially since I do not consume much fish, I don't worry that I am overdoing it at all.  Do your research and you should find that these are a good brand with high quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZDU9K5H5ATDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005YC0KQ8#wasThisHelpful","RZDU9K5H5ATDI","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this as a second roller, I thought the printed instructions on it was a brilliant idea.  Our other roller is longer, but plain, and was used quite a bit.  It would be almost impossible to print on the foam part, so there does have to be that special covering with the printed material on it.  Still, it doesn't impede the function of the roller, so it's benefits outweigh any bad.  Like someone else wrote, you probably could cut that part off, but that just sounds like crazy talk.  It will definitely feel firm and uncomfortable if you aren't used to using one, but when you are sore, it ""hurts so good"" to use.  My daughter is currently dominating it, recovering from ACL surgery and trying to get back into shape.  If you need/want a roller, this one should not disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NGN9O986F571/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8DKTX2#wasThisHelpful","R3NGN9O986F571","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have so many books I want to read, but yet at the store, I saw this one and put it in my cart figuring I would get to it one day.  Somehow it made it to the top of the pile and after finally finishing another book that wasn't worth my time (took me 2 months to read!), I started this one.  Less than 24 hours later, the book is finished and I just marvel at how good it was.I often pick up animal stories with trepidation, I don't want a cry fest about a sad story that just makes you feel bad about whatever happened to the animal in the story.  Thankfully, this book wasn't like that at all.  In all honesty, it wasn't so much about the animals, rather about humans, dead and alive.  There is no unbelievable animal talking, but pretty much all the animals in the book act like animals generally do.  The story line does go into a research chimp and its ties to the main characters.  But still, it isn't a depressing story filled with awful details.  I managed quite well, and am a wimp with that stuff.  The picture on the cover of the book will likely grab you, as it should, because when you start reading, make sure you have enough time to finish the story.  You will want to.This is a debut novel and the author is tied to animal rescue endeavors. I completely cheer him on with his future writings and rescue work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HGBHPBQV4CGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599954095#wasThisHelpful","R1HGBHPBQV4CGE","A1ZO9D554VQO9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZO9D554VQO9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
