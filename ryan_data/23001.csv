"This is a very clever set for decorating that offers tremendous ease and flexibility. The set consists of three black plastic ""frames"" that are affixed to the wall using adhesive strips with velcro on one side. This allows the frames to be removed easily for swapping out pictures or repositioning. Each of the three frames can be hung flush with the wall, and you get one base extender that can be added to position one of the frames further from the wall. This allows you to overlap frames for a ""stacked"" effect or to add a sense of depth. The base extender adheres magnetically and is very easy to add or remove. All of this is kind of hard to explain, so I've uploaded pictures to try to show the pieces and finished display.Along with the 3 frames, there are 3 ""pictures"" that adhere to the frames magnetically. Two of the pictures are art prints (blue abstract nature prints in our set), while the third is actually not a picture at all but is a white display tile which is used to display a photo or art print of the user's choice.The plastic used for the frames and tiles is lightweight but sturdy. I had no problem setting up the display following the enclosed instructions. Each frame has a built in bubble level which is brilliant. The art prints are pleasant if not quite pretty, though one could very easily wrap tiles in fabric or paste on prints of their choosing to come up with a display more to his or her liking. The ability to remove the magnetically attached tiles super easily is a great idea and promotes changing things up whenever the mood strikes.All in all I just think the whole system is a great idea that's been executed well. Flexible, customizable, easy to remove or reposition, sturdy but lightweight construction, expandable, attractive prints...this gets a big thumbs up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27W28VA81G8P6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7MOM#wasThisHelpful","R27W28VA81G8P6","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this for my wife and she really likes it.  The product page here uses the descriptive phrase ""aquatic floral scent"" which is very appropriate.  The scent is primarily floral but maintains a nice light and crisp aura that's more youthful than some floral perfumes.  It's not too strong but lasts a surprisingly long time.  The bottle is also really pretty!  A classy, fresh, delicate scent that lasts all day - wifey likes it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P7V20UVG5UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095OZ854#wasThisHelpful","R1P7V20UVG5UG","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a reasonably good TV stand with a few issues.  First, the good:  The finished piece is very sturdy (and holds my TV just fine despite the fact that it weighs 25 or so pounds more than the recommended 65 pound max weight).  It looks nice with a handsome black finish on the sturdy particleboard pieces and handsome nickel plated handles.  It is large enough to work with large TVs (certainly at least 65""+) while maintaining a pretty compact form factor.  The drawers provide a lot of good storage space too and provide a nice complement to the open storage compartments just above the drawers.There are, however, a few issues.  The instructions are okay overall but a few times it is unclear which side of a piece you need facing up or down.  Even worse, 3 of the pre-drilled holes needed to assemble the unit were not drilled out properly (see photo).  I had to us my drill press to fix this problem and would have been really ticked if I didn't have the tools to correct this problem.  The last issue could be a plus or minus - the storage drawers are supported by caster wheels underneath instead of drawer rails inside the unit.  I have carpeted floors which makes opening & closing the drawers difficult since the wheels don't roll especially well on carpet.  Because of the wheels, this unit will work much better on hard floors.  It is usable on carpet, but less than ideal.  Removing the wheels isn't an option since there are no rails supporting the drawers - they would simply sit on the floor without the wheels.Overall I think this is an ok unit which is priced about right.  I would not recommend it for carpeted floors (unless your carpet has a really short pile height).  If you have hard floors, this is a versatile unit that's sturdy, nice looking, and which provides good storage.  I hope the issues I had with the non-drilled holes was a fluke, but my experience didn't engender confidence.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R214UZ6N3EGXJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTQCZ96#wasThisHelpful","R214UZ6N3EGXJ2","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our favorite car seat we've owned during our kids' baby years was a Britax model our first child used.  The main advantages were how easy it was to strap our son in and how simple it was to tighten or loosen the straps.  We've owned a couple of cheaper brands & models and they invariably involve more convoluted strap systems.  The downside of the Britax, however, was the high cost.  Enter the Evenflo Titan.  This is a comparably nice & simple to use seat at a much lower price.  Adjusting the straps to tighten & loosen is very easy.  So is strapping in.  The seat has ample padding and looks really handsome to boot (even nicer looking that the Britax).  Overall we love this car seat and the price is right.  Thumbs up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R299N3SXTY1H1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8RQTW4#wasThisHelpful","R299N3SXTY1H1E","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the mid 1970s my parents had me and my brothers each make one of these plates as a gift for our grandparents.  We were so excited when we got to see our finishes plates!  Decades later, after my grandparents had both passed away, the plates made their way back to us grandsons, and I cherish mine.  I decided it was time for my kids (10 & 6) to make a plate and they enjoyed it just as much as I did!  Hopefully they'll do the same with their kids some day...The plates themselves are durable (my 1976 plate is still going strong!) and the images are bright and vivid.  The kit provides one free plate and others can be ordered for a reasonable processing fee (approximately $10 per plate depending upon how many you order).  There are 7 design sheets included in the kit, so you can create multiple designs from one kit (again, with a processing fee for all except the one free plate).  Everything you need it included.  The turnaround time for getting the plates made isn't too long (a few weeks) though it will seem like an eternity for the kids!  It is definitely worth the wait.I can't recommend this more highly - encourages creativity, gives kids a tangible sense of accomplishment, provides a quality keepsake that will last for decades.  I loved it as a kid, I love it as a parent, and I will love it when I become a grandparent someday too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2Y9USFNLT9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ID1EYA#wasThisHelpful","R1C2Y9USFNLT9W","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 4th grader son and I read this together and both really enjoyed it.  It is a little creepy & melancholy for some younger readers, but for those old enough to appreciate the emotional pull there is much to like in this somewhat dark adventure.  Our protagonist Anastasia finds herself suddenly and unexpectedly informed of the death of both of her parents and whisked away by two very odd & previously unknown ""aunts.""  Now residing with the aunts at their home in a converted insane asylum, Anastasia tries to make heads or tales of her new life and its terribly strange trappings.  In short order, she realizes that things are not what they seem and resolves to uncover the truth behind the series of unfortunate events she's experienced.  Yes, the story my not be entirely original, but it's still engaging and a lot of fun.  With a sharp wit, sympathetic characters, and a very well-paced unfolding of its central mystery, The League of Beastly Dreadfuls is quite delightful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ONIEB442HJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385370075#wasThisHelpful","R38ONIEB442HJ8","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our 4th grade son, who is a pretty avid reader, really enjoyed this book.  He read through it really quickly, which is always a good sign of his approval.  He gave it 5 stars & particularly liked the alternative Jack & the Beanstalk setting, which was richly detailed and fully-developed.  He also liked the fun spirit and plentiful adventures.  My wife read through some of it with him and she echoed his sentiments almost exactly.  Thumbs up from both kid's and also parent's perspectives!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1NNITAMFC5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385755791#wasThisHelpful","R2O1NNITAMFC5A","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Full Disclosure - I received this item free for review purposes***  Having tested the Hoover FloorMate Cordless hard floor cleaner, I can say that I am mostly impressed with it.  It is relatively simple to use, provides good freedom with its cordless design, and  does a good job of what is most important - getting hard floors clean.  The price point is on the high end of what I would consider to be a good value, but overall this thing really works.Operation of the unit is mostly intuitive and dummy proof.  Put the water/cleaner mixture in one tank and you're ready to go.  A single power switch turns the unity on and toggles it between two modes - scrub mode and suction mode.  There is a bank of cleaning brush heads on the underside of the cleaner that spin and scrub the floor surface.  Cleaning solution is dispensed by pulling a trigger on the handle.  Scrub mode simply spins the cleaning heads so that dirt, stains, etc can be scrubbed until loosened and cleaned.  The suction mode activates the vacuum feature which sucks the dirty surface water into a second tank.  Generally I operate the unit in scrub mode at first, cleaning a section of the floor first and then switching to suction mode to remove the dirty water from the area.  Then I move on to another section and repeat that process - scrub, suction, scrub, suction, etc - until I've finished the whole area.  I appreciate that the tanks for holding the cleaner/water mixture and for collecting the dirty water are very easy to remove and reattach.  The only part that really requires some practice is the dispensing of the cleaning solution via the trigger - I took awhile to get a feel for how many trigger pulls I needed as I went and how often to apply the mixture.  A little practice, however, and it becomes pretty easy.I found the unit to be very effective for cleaning both my tile and hardwood floors.  If you have any really seriously pernicious cleaning jobs - set in stains, chewing gum, etc - don't expect a miracle.  This will readily loosen and remove normal dirt, footprint, foodstuff kinds of stuff, but it's not a commercial grade floor stripper.  Overall it did a great job and my floors looked clean, vibrant, and streak-free.The battery life is good but not what I'd call stellar.  I was certainly able to clean at least one large room on a single charge (and our kitchen is pretty large with dedicated dining, cooking, and sitting areas).  I was able to get a little more than the 1/2 hour claimed battery life out of a charge.  Don't expect to do multiple rooms on one charge unless the rooms are smaller sized (such as bathrooms, laundry rooms, etc).  Removing and reattaching the battery is ultra-easy.  Being cord free is nice and made it easy to reach far corners, tight spaces, etc.The suction performance was great.  I loved being able to get the dirty water up quickly and having the floors dry in no time.  This is one of the best features of the unit to me - continuously removing dirty water so that you are cleaning with fresh water the whole time.Overall I really like this cleaner.  As mentioned in the intro, my only issue is the price ($250 as of the time of this review).  I was fortunate enough to get to demo a free unit, but I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay $250 despite my appreciation for the device.  The unit is pretty small and seems a bit steep, costing more than other carpet shampoo vacs I've used in the past.Other than value, I really like this cleaner.  Simple to use, well designed with easy to remove & reattach parts, very effective at getting floors clean, long-lasting enough battery to tackle reasonably sized jobs - lots to like here.  Seems a little higher priced than it should be, but if you're not turned away by the price and are interested in an effective hard floor cleaner, it's definitely recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q70DFLVQS1TC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU3JG#wasThisHelpful","R2Q70DFLVQS1TC","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our six year old daughter is, like 99% of little girls, a big Frozen fan.  She adores this comforter!  The colors are bold and vivid, the graphic looks great, and it is soft and comfortable.  And the icing on the cake is that the reverse side is quite lovely on its own - perfect if you ever want to make things look a little ""older"" since it lacks the character images while retaining the pretty color scheme.  As a parent, I was quite happy with how durable and well-made the comforter seems - better than expected for a licensed product that could have probably sold well even if of a lower quality.

" 2:30 Mins ***The video was created using Corel VideoStudio Pro X8 for basic demonstration purposes.  I didn't attempt to demonstrate the advanced features of the software but just created a quick project so I could experiment with it and show a sample clip.  The video was captured with a Contour Roam2 action cam.  Please note too that the video quality here suffers from Amazon's processing - it looks far better natively than it does here.""Corel VideoStudio Pro X8 is a relatively powerful and user-friendly video editing program that fits nicely between more advanced programs that are hard to learn and more basic programs that don't offer much flexibility.  I have experience with the much more expensive Sony Vegas software on the higher end and a plethora of cheaper and bundled programs on the lower end, but I love the balance offered by Corel's VideoStudio Pro x8.I won't recap the features (stop motion, motion tracking, etc) as those are readily available in the product description here.  Suffice it to say most amateur home users will probably rely on the more basic features, which are plenty good to make appealing video and slideshow productions.  More advanced users will find quite a bit more power under the hood for more customized editing and production.  As expected, the level of flexibility isn't quite as high here as with more expensive programs.  I noticed, for example, that the fade-in and fade-out effects for audio tracks are not as advanced here as they are on Sony Vegas.  Whereas Vegas offers a large variety of preset sound curve profiles for audio fades, VideoStudio applies one simple straight line sound curve fade (though in fairness, you can manually tweak the fade curve to approximate the more complex ones from Vegas but it's time consuming and not quite as nuanced).  This is an example of the kinds of differences you find between this and more expensive programs.  The majority of users simply won't care about the curvature of the sound wave if they choose to fade in or fade out an audio track.  For those who do, the option is there to customize it to a point which should satisfy all but the most demanding users.I have found the software to be stable and perform reliably and smoothly with Windows 7.  The rendering speeds are very fast compared to other programs I've used.  The quality of the effects and transitions are also really good.  The interface is attractive and very similar to that of other video editing programs.  If you've used consumer video editing software programs before you won't find much of a learning curve.  If you haven't, expect to invest some time learning how to use the software.  Corel's website has a number of helpful tutorial videos to help you along the way.  There are also some basic preset templates included which you can use to make videos very quickly through a kind of ""drag and drop"" approach - great for entry-level users or banging out a quick home movie.  I haven't really found anything to complain about other than the slightly scaled back feature set - and given the price difference between this and more powerful competitors even that isn't really a complaint.If you're looking for affordable video editing software that nails the sweet spot between price vs performance, this deserves a long look.  Inexpensive, powerful enough for most any consumer level application, accessible for new users and able to go deeper for the experienced user, stable and reliable - VideoStudio has a lot to offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WMHCZ5IG7SOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0I6J9E#wasThisHelpful","R1WMHCZ5IG7SOO","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This has the same fast absorption of the COQ10 cream and also does a great job under makeup. I haven't had any issues with my makeup not going on perfectly and it has the added bonus of getting some sun protection while moisturizing your face. Unlike the last SPF infused moisturizer I was using, this one doesn't turn my face into an oil slick within seconds after application. Of course you want to apply this like a moisturizer, not a sunscreen which means that it isn't going to be the same level of protection that you would get if you ere to slather it on like you were going to be outside all day.

"This cream is highly moisturizing without being greasy, it absorbs quickly and is light enough to wear under makeup without having sliding or a meltdown. I don't detect much of a scent (if any) so it's great for those with a persnickety sniffer. I have extremely sensitive skin and experienced no negative reactions.

"Tips on how to use and dilute Neem oil :I have listed some recipes / ways to use Neem oil below - but a rule of thumb to remember is to keep your dilution of of Neem oil to about 2 - 5% of any mixture that you apply directly onto your skin. Some of the recipes below use higher percentages - but keep a lookout for any skin irritation.Cuts, wounds, minor skin disorders and mosquito and insect repellantMix with Vaseline or a carrier oil in a ratio of 1:5 and apply to affected area.Athlete’s footAdd 15 ml to warm water and soak the feet in this preparation.Head liceMix 50/50 with a carrier oil and massage into the hair and scalp. Leave on for 1 hour and shampoo. Repeat once weekly for 3 weeks or as long as the problem persists.Stop mosquitoes breedingSpray or pour oil on all breeding areas. The oil can be emulsified (to mix with water) by adding normal dish washing liquid to it.Plant protectionAdd 30 ml to 1 liter of water and add 1 ml of dishwashing liquid. Mix well and spray immediately for plant protection. Do not store the mixture; make fresh formulation for each spray. Spray the mixture on top of all the leaves and on the undersides where insects often hide – you can also spray it around the roots.Lamp oil to ward off mosquitoesAdd 5 – 10% oil to any lamp oil and burn lamp normally.Dandruff and itchy scalpAdd a few drops to your regular shampoo.Ticks and fleas on animalsAdd a few drops to your normal pet shampoo (ratio should be 30 ml (1 oz.) to 240 ml (8 oz.) shampoo). (Personally we have found that plain baby shampoo works the best.WartsApply 1 drop of undiluted oil directly on warts once per day. Watch carefully for any possible irritation, and should that occur discontinue use. Continue for 2-3 weeks.Psoriasis, cold sores, eczema, athletes foot, skin ulcers and other fungal skin conditionsMix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) with 4 ounces (120 ml) carrier oil such as jojoba or grape seed oil and apply twice a day to affected skin. Should skin irritation occur, discontinue use, or make mixture with less Neem oil.Pet and livestock spray for ticks, fleas, mange mites and other pestsMix 1 ounce (30 ml) oil with 1 gallon (3.8 liter) water and add a few drops of dishwashing liquid (to emulsify the oil). Place mixture into a spray bottle or other type of sprayer, and spray animals once every two weeks. (This mixture can be used on indoor and outdoor plants as well as flowers and vegetables.)Cleaning the houseAdd to carpet shampoos and spray mattresses to kill dust mites.Hand washAdd a couple of drops to liquid hand soap for antibacterial properties.FOR ALL THE ABOVEAs Neem oil has a rather strong smell you might want to add a few drops of your essential oil to any mixture to mask the smell. Lavender or lemongrass essential oils work well – but you could add your personal favorite.I received a sample or discount in exchange for my honest review.

"The active ingredient in the fruit's rind, hydroxycitric acid, or HCA, has boosted fat-burning and cut back appetite in studies. It appears to block an enzyme called citrate lyase, which your body uses to make fat. It also raises levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which may make you feel less hungry.I noticed a change in my appetite right away; I was less hungry and started eating smaller meals. Since my scale needs a new battery and I've been too lazy to get one, I can't tell you if I've actually lost weight, but yeah, the appetite has definitely gone down and I'm satisfied much faster.Unlike most weight loss supplements, since this one doesn't work based on a thermogenic method you don't have those godawful jitters and lack of mental focus.

"I've tried a number of supplements from V Health Tech and have been pleased with the quality across the board. i'm particularly happy that this is oil from wild caught fish- makes it much more effective. I am a huge fan of fish oil. I've been taking it for years but always hated the nasty fish burps. FINALLY, one that doesn't stink or cause burps period! You get a good sized bottle, so this is not only a great product, but a great value as well. I particularly like that they come in an opaque bottle, protecting the efficacy and longevity of the product. I've got my husband now taking these which is amazing, because he refused for a long time after a bad fish oil experience in the past :-) He now takes them daily as well and even carries some around with him in his work bag!

"If you’re baking or cooking with matcha, you absolutely should not use artisanal matcha — it would be a complete waste of both money and great matcha. But, someone might  ask, wouldn’t the quality of the baked goods be that much higher if an artisanal matcha were used?No, it wouldn’t, and here’s why: heat destroys amino acid structures, so everything that’s great about your expensive matcha — its intense umami, its wonderful acid structure, its phytonutrients, and its long finish — gets annulled. Oh, you’ll still get a great green tea vegetal taste, but you can get this taste with culinary matcha which is much more affordable. Fats and sugars make matcha taste pretty good! And besides, many recipes that call for matcha do so in large-ish quantities (multiple tablespoons), so you need a cheaper, but still decent, matcha to not go broke every time you want to use matcha in your cooking.Lots of people have been asking me for a culinary matcha, and I’ve been testing a bunch of them and doing lots of baking and smoothie-making and we have a leading candidate based on color, taste, and affordability!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGHPZE1L0R75K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M6BTFU#wasThisHelpful","RGHPZE1L0R75K","A3BD6F65OKRDUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BD6F65OKRDUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This training collar worked wonders with a six month old black lab. Within two days the jumping on people, tugging on the leash, standing on hind legs with front paws on the counter, chasing the cat and eating his food are now a thing of the past. The lab is now attentive to her owner and the adolescent actions are under control without diminishing her spirit. I got this collar for a friend who was considering giving her up for adoption since she was becoming unmanageable. The effect of this collar has my friend wondering if it's the same dog. After two days of using infrequent lowest power shocks if the vibration is ignored (done immediately after a verbal command is ignored and while the action is happening) the lab is now an obedient pet. Having seen the transition for myself, I would strongly recommend this training collar to reinforce verbal obedience. The results really were amazing.If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate this as ""helpful"".

"You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application. You don't want to use this in lieu of a moisturizer (serums are meant to be applied underneath moisturizer). Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin. make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the serum; it's always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums, you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin. I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in.I received this at a discount as a blogger, however all opinions expressed are 100% my own","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C3M3YFBPB677/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9Z4KUC#wasThisHelpful","R2C3M3YFBPB677","A3BD6F65OKRDUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BD6F65OKRDUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm REALLY impressed with this case!

The hubs and I like to play Draw Something and Words With Friends together while sitting on the porch swing and enjoying the breeze but I am unfortunately an EXTREMELY clumsy lady.

So far so good- the phone is still perfect but what surprised me was really how the case itself still looks brand new.As far as appearance, this case is slim fitting and sleek, you don't feel additional bulk when you hold your phone and it's lightweight enough that no extra weight is added.

"First of all, let me point out that I have sensitive skin and retinols are notorious for sometimes irritating some people's skin. I did not have this problem at all. After applying I do feel a slight tingling, but it's not painful, it's actually somewhat refreshing! I even put it under and around my eyes with no problem (slightly stingy here, but very slight and it went away quickly ). I saw an immediate superficial difference on my first application; my pores were tightened as was my skin in general.Fine lines were minimized though my deeper crevasses were still visible; from what I understand about retinols, after about a month of use I'll see a big difference there too.In the morning my skin has a glow after absorbing this overnight. I've been using this over a serum and alternating using this under my eyes with an eye cream. After about 3 weeks use, I'm seeing a vast improvement in my skin's texture and evenness and the fine lines are really lessening across the board. My skin feels soft and plump and looks good even without makeup. The circles under my eyes are diminishing and tightening. To get the best out of this stuff, make sure sure your skin is super clean and exfoliated to really absorb the benefits, though this will help with exfoliating and getting rid of dead cells. You can also use this on areas that you feel need a youth treatment, like gnarly old lady hands! (guilty as charged!) I also recommend applying this to your neck and chest for an even look from your face down. These oft neglected areas are actually the worst for showing our age, so treat them well!

"Very simple and relatively pain free way to clean out your first line of defense. So many people don't realize that your digestive track is so important to your entire immune system. If you aren't moving well (inside) then you won't be moving well on the outside for long. I have to take these on the lower end of the recommended dosages as my system is fragile and hypersensitive. But even at the low end of the dosage, I feel so much lighter and energetic. The on-going digestive issues that I have dealt with my entire life, while not completely gone, are gentler. Stomach cramps, intestinal cramps, things not moving along as they should, etc. Now, just like a infant, if I eat a meal, I then have to visit the bathroom.

It comes with two 3/8"" female to 5/8"" male adapters, so you can use it with any standard 3/8"" or 5/8"" mic mounts.Pros:----------------------------+ Strong and durable, the construction quality and finish are both excellent.+ Adjustable mic mounts work perfectly, very easy to mount and unmount mics to them or adjust the position.+ Includes 3/8"" to 5/8"" adapters+ Bottom female 5/8"" threaded mount is perfect, large easy to grip textured outer casing+ Great value for the moneyCons / Considerations:----------------------------- Included 3/8"" to 5/8"" adapters can get stuck in your mic mounts. Taller adapters with some grip below the threads for easy removal would have been better.Note: the item I received differs from the current product picture on Amazon. As of this review, the product picture shows a threaded stud in the middle of the mount. The item I received does not have a middle stud, only two outer adjustable studs.

"These clamps are so incredibly useful for many different jobs. They are primarily designed for clamping to light stands, booms or tripods, but will clamp onto just about anything. Motorcycles and vehicles, fence or patio rails, doors, tables, and counters are just the beginning. The included wedges make these clamps easy to use on flat surfaces.The build quality is excellent. The main clamp bodies are made form beefy thick aluminum, with steel and brass hardware. The main tightening handle is plastic, but it is very strong and I have never been worried that it might break. The side pin tightening handle is also plastic, everything else is metal.The rubberized grip surfaces are very durable and won't peel off like cheaper clamps.This clamp has one 5/8"" (16mm) hex stud receiver (this version comes with a stud) and one 1/4 - 20 threaded female that is centered in the clamp. The hex stud receiver has a quick release and also a bolt with a plastic handle on the side that can be tightened to firmly secure the stud.There are an limitless pins and accessories you can use with these clamps to mount virtually anything.Accessories that I use regularly:* Joining studs: Manfrotto 061RA Right Angle Joining Stud for Super Clamp and Manfrotto 061 Joining Stud for Super Clamps - Replaces 2913* 1/4"" male for the 1/4"" threads Smallrig 1/4"" Male to 1/4"" Male Threaded Screw Adapter (2-pack)* 3/8"" Stud Manfrotto 036- 38 Stud for Super Clamp with 3/8-Inch European Thread or Manfrotto 088 Stand 1/4-20-Inch Female to 3/8-Inch Male 20mm Long Adapter - Replaces 3103 for included 1/4"" stud* Short stud Manfrotto 037 Reversible Short Stud - Replaces 2907* Perfect fit hex stud grip head Kupo Grip Head with Hex Stud KG202011* Full size pin Avenger E600C 5/8-Inch Snap-In Steel Pin for Super Clamp* Magic arm Manfrotto 244 Variable Friction Magic Arm with Camera Bracket - Replaces 2929You can even use 3/8 to 5/8 microphone thread adapters to mount full size microphones with this clamp.The possibilities are pretty much endless.I have tried a few of the cheaper knock-off super clamps from various vendors, but none of them came close to matching the original Manfrotto build quality. these clamps might seem a bit expensive compared to the knockoffs, but they will last forever and you really do get a better clamp for the extra money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26E3EDLDO1IDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018LQVIA#wasThisHelpful","R26E3EDLDO1IDU","A2GYV87WW0DMSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GYV87WW0DMSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The nylon washers in this set are excellent. The fiber washers are just ok.The case is a soft plastic which is great. It's not the brittle hard plastic hat breaks so easily, but it's thin and doesn't feel very durable. For keeping these washers organized it's fine, but I wouldn't expect it to hold up forever or withstand much abuse on a job site.The fiber washers are rough around the edges and there's a lot of fiber splintering off them.

"This clamp will come in handy for so many situations.It's fast and easy to set up, can grip to just about anything, and the construction quality is top notch. The jaws are primarily designed for gripping a rod and work beautifully without damaging the rod surface, but will also work on flat objects or tables.I prefer to use a Manfrotto Super Clamp Manfrotto 035 Super Clamp without Stud - Replaces 2915 for anything that is very heavy, but this clamp is perfect for smaller or lighter things like LED lights, GoPro, reflectors, etc.The  combination of 1/4"" and 3/8"" threads make it easy to mount just about anything to this clamp. The 1/4"" threads are on the side of the tightening handle that stays at about 90 to your clamp surface. The 3/8"" threads are on the side of the clamp opposite the tightening handle, they will move slightly when the clamp is opened or closed. This gives you the option of two different mounting angles and can be very useful.Compared to the similar Manfrotto Nano Clamp Manfrotto 386B Nano Clamp (Black), this clamp is about one third of the price. It's a bargain and represents a very good value for the money.The soft grip surface does appear to be the weakest point in the construction quality of this clamp. Fortunately, it's easy enough to remove and replace it if necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LJLC0F8B0TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PMJVS8#wasThisHelpful","R13LJLC0F8B0TS","A2GYV87WW0DMSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GYV87WW0DMSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short stud will join two super clamps together, back to back. One half of the stud fits into each super clamp, so they fit together tightly.It's made from aluminum and is very light, but it's also thick and very strong.This was designed for the Manfrotto Super Clamp Manfrotto 035RL Super Clamp with 2908 Standard Stud - Replaces 2900 - Black but will also work with Impact Super Clamp Impact Super Clamp with Ratchet Handle, Kupo Convi Clamp Kupo Convi Clamp with Adjustable Handle - Black, KG701511, and all the other other super clamp knockoffs that have the same size female stud socket.There are two versions of this stud available, each will allow you to mount the clamps at different angles to each other. One stud cannot achieve all angles due to limitations of way the studs can fit into the 5/8"" hexagonal female receiver on the clamps. This stud (Manfrotto 061) will mount the clamps in parallel, or at 180°, 120º or 60º but not at 90°. The 061RA right angle stud Manfrotto 061RA Right Angle Joining Stud for Super Clamp will allow you to mount the clamps at a 90°, 30º, or 150º offset.It's a good idea to get both studs if you use them often, you can get almost any angle you need with both of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JWRGVN07DK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M4HTF2#wasThisHelpful","R21JWRGVN07DK9","A2GYV87WW0DMSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GYV87WW0DMSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A tire repair kit is essential to carry on all offroad trips.Compared to other similar kits, this ARB kit is one of the best but does have some disadvantages.These plug kits will allow you to repair punctures by removing the foreign object, reaming the puncture hole to make room for a plug, and inserting a sticky self vulcanizing tire plug to seal the hole. These plugs work on the tread area of a tire, they are not meant to be used on the sidewall. You will be repairing the tire form the outside only, so it's not advisable to keep this as a permanent fix. For a permanent fix, the tire should be dismounted and the inside of the plugged hole should be treated with a bonding agent. The plugs included with this kit and similar products will get you back home or to a tire shop where you can get a permanent fix.Pros of this kit:------------------+ The best reamer and insertion tools available+ Tool shaft/needles are not powder coated (this makes them much more effective)+ Insertion tool includes a slider to hold the plug in when removing the tool+ Includes internal valve stem parts, something most other kits don't have+ Tire pressure gauge is ok, not great but not a total POS like most other kitsCons / Considerations:---------------------- The orange plastic case is big and bulky- Contents of the case rattle and make noise with vibration- Does not include extra insert tool or reamer blades/needles- Does not include complete valve stems like some other kits- More expensive than most other available kitsThe case is the main issue I have with this ARB kit, other cons are very minor. If this kit had a soft case that was smaller and didn't rattle, it would be the best kit available. The plastic case may not be an issue for you if you are keeping it in a trunk, more of an issue in a Jeep.Comparison to competing kits:----------------------------There are a number of other high quality tire repair kits available around this price point or lower, I have reviewed some of them also, but I'll share a little about each kit I am familiar with here and how they stack up.Power Tank's kit Power Tank KIT-8133 Tire Plug Kit has a far superior nylon roll case. It's smaller and does not rattle. The Power Tank tools are not as good as this ARB kit, and the tool shafts/needles are ridiculously powder coated.Safety Seal's kit Safety Seal 30 String Pro Tire Repair Kit has the best plugs. The case and kit is similar to this ARB kit but with steel tools instead of aluminum. Safety Seal has been making the best tire plugs for decades, get them as replacements no matter what kit you end up with.Rugged Ridge's kit Rugged Ridge 15104.51 Tire Repair Kit is less expensive and includes extra tips for the tools. The tools are decent quality, not powder coated. Has a similarly bulky and rattle-prone hard plastic case.Smittybuilt's kit Smittybilt 2733 Tire Plug and Seal Kit is very similar to the Power Tank kit. The Smittybuilt kit is currently available at half the price of the Power Tank or ARB kits. It has a zippered nylon case that is quiet, easy to carry and pack into your rig. Unfortunately, the Smittybuilt kit suffers from the same powder coated tool issues that the Power Tank kit has, and the insertion tool is also missing a slider. This kit is a very good value for the money.All of the kits mentioned above are good kits, any one of them will serve you well. It's nice to have so many good options available. I hope this will help you choose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I96YNBZGIMT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P91FCO#wasThisHelpful","R2I96YNBZGIMT8","A2GYV87WW0DMSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GYV87WW0DMSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Global G-16 is an extremely versatile knife due to it's length, blade shape, and weight. It's very well balanced, the weight feels perfectly distributed.This is unquestionably one of the best knives you can get in this price range.This is my go-to knife for almost everything. It's excellent for chopping and slicing vegetables, herbs, greens, and meat.Due to it's thin blade profile and edge, the G-16 is not particularly great for extremely thick or hard things like butternut squash or chicken bones. For those tasks I prefer a thicker knife with more heft to it, or a cleaver.I have owned this knife for more than 3 years and have used it almost every day since I got it. I also own its little brother, the 8"" G-2 Global G-2 - 8 inch, 20cm Chef's Knife, a great knife as well. I use the 10"" G-16 much more often than the 8"" G-2. I could do without the 8"" knife, but not without this knife.If you are not a professional chef, this may be the last chef's knife you will ever need to buy. Sure you will need some smaller knives for specific purposes, but this knife will handle almost any job and with proper care the edge will stay razor sharp.This knife will brunoise an onion perfectly with ease, make quick work of a whole bundle of herbs such as parsley or rosemary, cut through large carrots like butter, and finely slice a tomato or anything else with precision.Take good care of your Global knives and they will last a lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQHOIMKXFLCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005OL4O#wasThisHelpful","RHQHOIMKXFLCR","A2GYV87WW0DMSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GYV87WW0DMSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I tried almost a dozen different gaming mouse pads over the past 6 months or so, looking for the perfect combination of durability, control, precision, speed, and non-slippage on my glass desk. The Razer Destructor 2 is it.This mouse pad has a 'control' surface, the texture has enough 'grit' to it give you the perfect combination of precision without sacrificing speed. Some 'speed' mouse mats are faster, but lack control. This one is well balanced.The entire backside is covered in rubberized grip. It does slide a tiny bit on my glass desk, but it stays put better than any other mouse pad I tested. If the grip surface could be improved a little so that it would not slip at all then this mouse pad would be 100% perfect.It's thin which also helps it to not slip so much, but it feels well constructed. It's not completely stiff like aluminum pads, it's made from a slightly flexible plastic.I'll post an update if there's any issues with durability or anything else in the future, but so far this mouse pad is awesome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2525N1BA67SGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B829UU0#wasThisHelpful","R2525N1BA67SGB","A2GYV87WW0DMSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GYV87WW0DMSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent product that works to keep your ear buds safely stored and tangle-free.My only complaint is that there is not enough room for the cord to wrap around the outside. I don't think my ear buds have a particularly long cord, but the cord just barely fits and sometimes parts of the cord pop out. The 'tabs' on the top to hold in the wrapped cord are very small and don't really do the job.There is a lot of space on the inside where the ear buds themselves go, probably much more than anyone needs. The design of the product could be improved a lot by redistributing some of the extra space on the inside to allow for more room to wrap the cord on the outside.This is still a great product and does work well, better than any other solution I have found.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IILOTJIWH4H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096JQ4FQ#wasThisHelpful","R3IILOTJIWH4H3","A2GYV87WW0DMSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GYV87WW0DMSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price, I didn't expect much from this mount. Sadly, I was still disappointed.The construction quality of this mount is very poor. The whole mount is flimsy and several parts on it are made from thin brittle plastic that looks like it will break easily, such as the folding support for the bottom of the phone.I would not trust this mount to hold my phone during bumpy rides or even for the suction cup to stay attached.Then there is the smell. Upon opening the box, I noticed that this mount has a very strong chemical smell. It smells like tar/cigarette smoke. Every time I handled this mount, the smell got on my hands. I've experienced similar issues with a few other items made in China before, usually they just need a few days to ""air out"". After 3 days the smell is still very strong.I returned this mount and ordered a RAM mount to replace it.

"This is an unusual spin on the classic ""Alice in Wonderland"" tale, with nuances best appreciated by adults. The story is good... odd, but good. The casting was very good. The performances were very good. The set designs and special effects were impressive.Depp brings an interesting interpretation to the Mad Hatter, and while his performance seemed a little restrained (both for him and for what this movie could have been), he also brings magic to this film.It's not quite ""great for the entire family,"" unless your children are 10 years old or older. (Younger ones may not understand what's going on in some scenes, and little children might actually be frightened by some of them.)The ""big head"" and other physical distortions was amusing, but barely held up as a running sight gag. It seemed almost like filler for a story that needed more substance.Alice... I'm not sure if it was the casting or the direction, but I found it difficult to care what happened to her. Frankly, she was pretty to look at, but seemed rather vapid. I didn't see much character arc there.Tweedledee and Tweedledum were charming, and probably could have had more screen time.The White Queen was confusing. I didn't dislike her, but I didn't like her, either. Her character didn't make sense... but not in the charming, ""nonsensical"" context that Carroll had provided in his stories.The Red Queen did seem nonsensical and delightfully warped. Helena Bonham Carter can shine in any role, and I think this one -- between the script and the makeup -- probably challenged her more than most roles she's played. I wish we'd seen more of her character's eccentricities.Depp's role was enigmatic, but something seemed lacking; I'm not sure if he was distracted, or not given enough to work with, but -- whatever the issue -- he did a very good job in this role.. just not what it could have been.I know this review sounds as if I didn't like the movie, but I did. It just wasn't as good as it could have been, and not quite up to the standards I expect from Disney, Burton, and the cast. If I'd watched it with lower expectations, I might be giving this a better review.On balance, this movie is intriguing enough to be worth watching, if only as a preparation for the 2016 sequel... which I hope will be more dazzling, stylish, and whimsical. This movie didn't quite achieve what I'd expected, in those terms, but it came close enough that I can say I liked it and I'm glad I purchased the DVD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32BV1O04GFAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HN694K#wasThisHelpful","R32BV1O04GFAV","A3VAAX926BOJC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VAAX926BOJC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea this was going to be an a shallow send-up of the original TV series, but I would have been okay with that... if this had been a good film. Unfortunately, its deeply self-indulgent and not quite campy enough (or ridiculous enough) to be hilariously funny.Unlike the TV series, there's no attempt to make this believable. Depp's makeup and styling are so preposterous, there is no way anyone would take him seriously. So, yes, it's a parody.The problem is, most of the performances lack commitment and the fun I expect from a good parody. If Depp had brought even half the whimsy and flair of his Jack Sparrow performance -- not the drinking, slurred speech, and so on, but the added style and energy this part deserved -- he could have saved this film, all by himself.Helena Bonham Carter's performance did have some sparkle, but -- with far less screen time -- even her talents seemed subdued. (That's saying a lot, if you're familiar with her work. She has an innate gift for taking roles to an extreme, with so much authenticity, even the silliest characters become fascinating and vibrant.)To be perfectly honest, this movie is awful if you're watching it for entertainment. Especially while sober.However, as a reference for traditional Gothic storytelling, this film excels. The character profiles, sets, and story elements -- while often overdone -- hit the key points expected by fans of Gothic romantic mysteries.If you're an aspiring traditional Gothic novelist, buy the DVD. Watch the film and take notes. Also, the brief list of iconic characters -- and too-short insights in related interviews -- make it worth the low price (and time) you'll spend on this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y79U013T8UHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QE9XD2#wasThisHelpful","R2Y79U013T8UHI","A3VAAX926BOJC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VAAX926BOJC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Fortunately, my husband thinks that's hilarious.And, as a back scrubber, this brush definitely holds up better than the ones with ""optional removable head"" (that always falls off at the wrong time).It's sturdy, a little shorter than its counterparts we've seen in stores, but it still reaches the entire back. The bristles are fairly soft (not scratchy in a bad way), and seem more densely packed (and in larger supply) than store counterparts, as well.The added nylon (cord) loop is a nice touch, and makes this easy to hang up in the shower.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN1HF3SQDZALO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DG7YJQA#wasThisHelpful","RN1HF3SQDZALO","A3VAAX926BOJC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VAAX926BOJC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was trying to decide between one star (""I hate it"") and two stars (""I don't like it"") and realized I didn't care enough about it to hate it.It's sort of Gothic, and sort of bellydancing. The performer -- the only one I saw, as I turned this off after about ten boring minutes -- has some bellydancing skills. The music was sort-of good. The costume was a little confusing, but the production was okay. Just okay.This could have been a great video if it had been created with real commitment to bellydancing and the Gothic aesthetic. Instead, I felt that I could probably find better at YouTube.Yes, this is free to watch with Amazon Prime.

"This was okay. I watched it to the conclusion, but it didn't really hold my interest. I felt as if this story would have made an excellent movie, but as a series, it lacked depth. To me, there was a constant sense that things were being held back, and would be revealed in future episodes. However, so much was held back, I didn't really care about the characters. Ricci's performance was adequate; had she been given clearer direction and better dialogue, I think her performance would have been impressive. She seemed to be trying to bring sparkle and whimsy to the role, but didn't have much to work with.The script, the sets, and all those little details that make a period piece stunning... they just weren't there. Instead, viewers were presented with stereotypes that could have been from any ""flapper defies her dysfunctional family and community standards"" story.The image that goes with this series says it all. It's overly simplistic, cliche'd, and -- literally -- two-dimensional. This could have been a rich, vibrant story, and fascinating, even to those who know the real history.

"For at least five years -- possibly longer -- I've been using the speech recognition software that's built into almost every Windows operating system. Before that, I'd used Via Voice (from IBM) from its earliest days.I wouldn't have considered Dragon (since its Windows counterpart is free), but I saw Dragon demonstrated as part of some training I watched, online. The instructor's results with Dragon were far better than what I'm accustomed to with Windows' speech recognition, even when it's been ""trained"" for years.I researched Dragon options. I'm using Windows 7, so I was looking for great reviews from people using the same OS.To me, it looked like Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11 was the best for my purposes. (I'm a writer. I dictate my articles and books in my home office.)  Not 11.5 or anything higher, but specifically version 11.So, I bought this. As I installed it on my computer, I panicked. I have 2GB of RAM and the software advised me that was half of the 4GB they recommend.I hoped my Blue Yeti microphone would offset any issues, during use.I needn't have worried. I did use my Yeti microphone, and I did ""train"" the software with the four-minute reading from Alice in Wonderland.Then, I tested Dragon in my Scrivener software.Results: 100% accuracy, from the start.I'm impressed and recommend this to anyone who wants genuinely smart speech recognition software.

"Wow. I had NO idea these toothbrushes would be SO much better at cleaning teeth, with so little discomfort, and do such amazingly good things for my gums.I have and use floss. I have and use regular, soft toothbrushes... even extra soft, when I can find them. I have and use a water-pic device.Nothing comes even close to cleaning my teeth and getting between the gums (for cleaning and better gum health) like these toothbrushes.Despite my previous, usual attention to my teeth & gums, I was amazed at the amount of bleeding during the first week I used this brush. I was also astonished when my teeth felt like they'd just had a thorough cleaning at the dentist's office.A couple of weeks later, I was equally surprised (and delighted) to see how much healthier my gums were.If I'd had this kind of toothbrush years ago, I'd have saved myself a lot of dental work and gum issues.My advice: Stop using grocery store and pharmacy toothbrushes... even the fancy/expensive ones.

It explained so much about people who've annoyed me long past the point where I should have walked away from them, and not looked back. I kept giving them a second chance. Or, I thought it was just a misunderstanding, and we could talk it out.One of the most liberating parts of this book was understanding the chilling logic behind sociopathic behaviors. (This isn't always an on/off switch. Many people aren't wholly sociopathic or completely free of those behaviors.)I also liked learning that my tendency to be polite with them, no matter what, is a waste of time. I canNOT offend them. I need to quit looking at them through the ""do unto others"" filter, and invest that level of caring and energy in situations where it will make a positive difference.The genetic component was troubling, but -- remembering difficult people in my past -- it made sense.This is a fairly brutal book.

"This book was a total surprise. It's an engaging story with well-rounded characters. The author definitely knows how to write. She's clearly a cat lover as well.The plot is simple. I noticed one inconsistency early in the story that led me to suspect the actual villain. However, I wasn't sure enough to put the book down, and read it in one sitting.When I reached the conclusion, it felt a little like an information dump. Then, I realized the author had shown us the clues all along. She'd just explained them -- through the eyes or dialogue of the protagonist -- and I took her explanations at face value. It was a clever, effective, and stylish deception!I'm surprised by how much I liked this book. I had low expectations for such a short mystery, especially one that provides so much information about multiple cats, they're pretty much secondary characters.The author didn't rush anything. This is a well-constructed story told in just a few pages.Cat lovers will definitely like this book, and probably the others by this author. Mystery lovers may be as impressed as I was, and enjoy it as an entertaining read that can be completed in one sitting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252SGGQJVCOAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8FMIUU#wasThisHelpful","R252SGGQJVCOAF","A3VAAX926BOJC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VAAX926BOJC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I struggled to stay interested in this book. That's saying a lot since I love mysteries, and I've written a few myself.Initially, I had the feeling this book was outsourced. The writing doesn't have a clear ""voice."" While I could attribute that to the way the co-authors worked together, I think it's something else.Frankly, I think they took a detective how-to manual and tried to rephrase it so it sounded like they were speaking as mystery writers. For me, that didn't work.For starters, this book has a narrow focus. It's for people writing detective stories and police procedurals, not cozies. Mostly, this book discusses the mechanics of being a detective, interviewing witnesses, and so on. It's not especially stylish, and some of the material... it's rather boring. I felt like they were trying to fill pages, not share helpful insights.While I gleaned a couple of good insights from this book, the writing didn't flow. It was difficult to read.I feel like the authors' assembled this book with good intentions, but the book isn't chatty enough to be fun reading. Maybe my first guess -- that they hired someone to write this for them -- is correct.Others have written better police- and detective-related guides for mystery writers. I especially like the ""Howdunit Series"" for writers, and give those books my highest recommendations.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OQLMI17BD4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RSMT1G2#wasThisHelpful","R19OQLMI17BD4A","A3VAAX926BOJC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VAAX926BOJC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pretty sure this was part of a serial, so I was fine with the brevity of it. The writing style is good, probably better than most among indie books in this genre. The book ends on kind of a cliffhanger, but she's set the stage pretty well. The story begins like any other blog or journal you might read: a little of this, a little of that, and a pretty good sense of personality. The focus narrows to the paranormal near the end of this book.I'd have liked more paranormal content in this story, and I think many readers will prefer this in a bundled set so they feel as if they've gotten more for their money.However, it's a good start. While I'm not sure if I'll read the next book, I didn't feel let down by this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PJYATTB0Z4N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N89UWEE#wasThisHelpful","R2PJYATTB0Z4N5","A3VAAX926BOJC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VAAX926BOJC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It reads like a really great presentation.A beginner will learn a lot from the advice in this book. Also, it includes many beautifully phrased insights that can inspire almost any writer.It just didn't dazzle me as the cover did. The tone was conversational, not powerful.

"As I said in my review of her other book (about marketing Kindle books), this appears to be a very weak attempt at parody.It fails, badly. We're not included in the joke.For example, instead of saying ""How I Make $40,000 a Month...,"" it could be ""How I Make $4 Billion a Month..."" or something equally silly. Then, the reader would expect parody. Then, it has a better chance at being amusing or even zany.I can only assume that this is an inside joke among the author and her friends, to see how many people will download this book and expect it to deliver anything helpful.Or, it's a Dada-inspired attempt at performance-art-as-books, and it's intended to be mundane and annoying.Either way, it's not funny, it's not very creative, and it's not worth your time. It's not bad enough to hate, just a blatant copy of basic writing information, repetitious and peppered with typos.The good news is: At least this book is free.

"I'm embarrassed to admit that -- despite the title -- I didn't realize this was a parody. Hey, in real life, I know people earning that kind of money with their Kindle books, so I thought this book (and the companion book about writing Kindle books) would offer some fresh insights.Yes, I know. The hyperbolic book description, title, and exclamation points should have been a hint. The shameless use of Amazon's trademarks, ditto.And, before downloading this, I should have looked at her other silly book titles -- ""... Get Rich Quick!"" and ""... Be A Women Magnet Without Doing Anything!"" -- to realize these are a running joke.The thing is, I've read other books with similar titles and equally ""oh dear heaven"" descriptions, and they were by authors who'd stumbled onto some great writing or marketing technique. The rest of us were making things too complicated, and -- by sheer accident -- the author had a breakthrough.But hey, this was a free book. I download nearly every free book related to writing and the arts. More often than not, I'm pleasantly surprised, and buy other books by the best authors.The thing is, this book isn't funny enough to be a parody. The information inside is the same, very basic information you can find all over the Internet. Ha, ha? Umm... no. Not for me.Maybe some people find this funny. Maybe it's a Dada-inspired form of performance-art-as-books? I don't know. For me to laugh, this book needed to be more over-the-top ridiculous. For me to consider it art, it needs to be more clever.I'm pretty sure the horrendous formatting -- every line centered (and no, that's not a setting on my Kindle reader) -- was part of the joke. Ditto how often she ""accidentally"" uses a lower-case i when she meant the upper-case personal pronoun.So, yes, I'm embarrassed that I opened this book expecting something either insightful or full of zany fun.It delivered neither. If I'd spent money on this, I'd have asked for a refund.The only reason I'm posting this review is so no one else thinks this is a serious book, or one funny enough to be worth your time.It wasn't awful enough to actually hate (a one-star review), just stupid enough that I don't like it (two star).","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35VSK8EB52YX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWA2INI#wasThisHelpful","R35VSK8EB52YX5","A3VAAX926BOJC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VAAX926BOJC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have admired Hunter Thompson's writing for years. It has always been a wild ride of fact, impressions, pure fiction, and satire. It has been a source of pride that Hunter Thompson grew up in my hometown, attended my high school and still managed to be a free-thinker and more than a little crazy. And, like so many writers of Thompson's generation and mine, I have wondered what it would have been like without the booze, the weed, the cocaine. Better? Worse? Who knows, and Juan Thompson's book doesn't answer that question either. In many ways, he was as mystified by his father as the rest of us were, and yet he knew him pretty well. Some folks are just unknowable in the long run. This book is the story of a son's love and confusion, adventures with some of the great names of our time, and of a family -- broken, as many families are, but fundamentally loving. Not everyone's love is expressed in the traditional ways, but it remains love -- love of a father for a son, love of a son for a father and reflective of the times we live in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQX73MZ9YSJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307265358#wasThisHelpful","R2IQX73MZ9YSJY","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love curling up on a rainy day with a cozy mystery novel, and The Fruitcake Murders fills the bill nicely. The story is complex enough to keep you guessing as you read, and the characters are engaging and interesting. There is a sexual tension between the detective and the reporter in the story that also keeps you guessing throughout. I am guessing this is one in a series featuring these characters since there is clearly history here, but I haven't looked into that. The settings are good, the clues and red herrings dished out regularly, and this book catches the mood and character of the postwar twentieth century. And, true to its genre, you can trust the author to keep it interesting without being as explicit as today's crime novels seem to be. It is a great read for a winter evening by the fire!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHA008X2P16Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426771894#wasThisHelpful","R1DHA008X2P16Q","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Olivier Le Carrer will take you for a creepy trip around the world has he tells you about scary places. From ancient times through today these are indeed scary places, described in a light narrative which is easy-to-read and accompanied by wonderful maps that show exactly where these scary spots are on the globe.Some of these spots will be familiar to most people, others not so much. For instance, most of us know that Beirut is a dangerous place to visit and that it is unwise to sail into the Gulf of Aden. War torn or rife with criminals, we do know about them. And most have heard of the Bell Witch and the Lutz house in Amityville, but this book tells us a bit more. Sometimes the author’s tongue-in-cheek descriptions are just plain fun and sometimes they will give you the shivers, but they are always entertaining. This book will send you scrambling all over the internet to actually see some of the places in photographs, but it is a rewarding search, and I adore maps, so the illustrations in the book, which are largely maps, are fun to me.

"I love the speakers, but I hate the batteries. Still, I wanted speakers to share my digital music collection on my iPod, and this speaker set is just the thing to enjoy that music with guests when entertaining. I group my music into playlists on the iPod, pair the Bluetooth with the speakers, and, voila, the perfect selections for the perfect mood, ready to go. This worked great in our den, producing a far more full-throated sound than I had hoped, and not as well on the deck where ambient noise and the greater area lost some of the sound depth. However, they would be perfect for tailgating or a party at poolside. The soft light that emanates from them is a nice touch. On an Indian summer evening last week, we set the speakers up on the deck and watched the stars as we listened to Cissy Spacek read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" on an audible book. It was very nice. The only drawback is that  I do hate anything that requires so many AA batteries, and they are necessary to achieve the wireless look. The batteries seem to last for quite a while. We listened to the book for three hours the other night, and listened to music a couple of other times, in the house and outdoors as we tested the system and we are still on the first set of batteries. Since we tend to listen to books mostly on earphones, we probably will not use them daily. but to utilize the music stored on a device with Bluetooth capabilities for a special occasion, indoor or out, these are fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21W9EYKW25540/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01686P1XA#wasThisHelpful","R21W9EYKW25540","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished reading “The Survivor”, and am glad to see Mitch Rapp back, but find him a bit different than he has been in the past. He is just as tough a customer, and his surrounding cast of characters are as one expects them to be, so it might just be my mourning the passing of Vince Flynn and a mild annoyance at seeing his name used when he is no longer with us. The action is all there, though, and the book is fun to read. It is suspenseful in the right places and properly descriptive of the action, so I recommend it. Reading about Mitch Rapp again is like visiting an old friend that you have not seen for a while, and I think Vince Flynn would be pleased at this continuation of his creation’s adventures.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RILDP7O5GJW11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476783454#wasThisHelpful","RILDP7O5GJW11","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read through this book last evening and think it will be a great aid to journalling. Sometimes you simply are not up to writing a narrative of events, and a simple list is enough, but these are not simple lists. These are lists that require thought, some actually require soul searching, and many will be ongoing and not delineated by season. In fact, I am not sure setting this book up with different lists for different seasons was a great idea. Actually I will be returning to winter lists in summer and spring lists in fall and vice versa, and so it will be an ongoing endeavor for me. It is fascinating how a heading, such as a heading for a list, starts a process of recollection that will be ongoing.

"I found this book too romantic for my tastes, and rather disappointing for someone who has liked Trigiani's work in the past. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop in order to make this book interesting, and it simply did not happen. It seems unfair to put words, perhaps scandalous to the memories real people have of the stars portrayed, in the mouths of those who are no longer living. There is simply no way that a novelist can come close to what happened between two young people in love. It would have served the story better to have made these characters fictitious rather than putting fiction in the mouths of real people who are not around to say, ""Yes, that's it,"" or ""No, I never would have said that."" I found it disappointing, but for people who are fans of romance novels and gossip magazines, this should be a fun read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QV397PD4KCZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062319191#wasThisHelpful","R3QV397PD4KCZS","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new version of the Sonicare is wonderful! We have used these toothbrushes for many years. They are by far the best for minimizing plaque and for keeping teeth shining clean and breath fresh, and the improvements in this set are amazing. If anything, the motion of the brush head is more exacting than the previous set we used. Its variable speed is useful indeed and the charging system is a vast improvement over the last version we had. That the brush base keeps a constant charge is such a good idea. The brush is always ready to use when you need it. And the different colors on the brush heads is brilliant. We used to differentiate between our two brushes by leaving the travel top on one and not the other. This is such an easier system. And the fact that the brush heads come off the base unit each time says you from getting the whole thing loaded up with toothpaste drips as our old system did. I found the heads difficult to remove from the base though, especially when the handle and tip are damp from use.  With that exception, this a great new system, and I really like it a lot!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZCQPJH07ODEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","RZCQPJH07ODEK","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah, the beautiful people of the golden age of New York. And this golden age is the 1950’s and 1960’s. It was a time of elegant lunches in glamorous settings that no one dared to eat lest they gain so much as an ounce. It was a time of lolling in the sun on yachts and Caribbean beaches without a thought of sun screen. It was a time when chain-smoking was oh-so-chic and took the lovely ladies out just as their hands started to show veins and dark spots. Champagne and Darjeeling tea, finger sandwiches that jeweled hands never picked up. The characters in this book are lovely ladies, these swans of Fifth Avenue. They are rich women who nursed a viper to their elegant bosoms and experienced the ultimate betrayal.In a “To the Reader” from the author, Melanie Benjamin, there is a cautionary note that readers will need to Google the names in the story she relates, but not all readers require that caution, Ms. Benjamin. Some of us remember those days well enough to reminisce with you of this glamorous time. We all wished we were swans in the era when these beautiful people had the headlines!While this is a novel, it is generously peppered with truths and rumors. Some of the wealthy and famous folk will glitter less after reading this book. You may find yourself at a loss if you try to separate fact from fiction. Good luck with that; the author has skillfully knit together a new fabric of story, telling the tale with insight from every possible angle, even that of the viper himself. It is a fascinating read, and will remind you of the gossipy magazines that were everywhere in that era as it sheds a harsh light into a world that no longer exists. It is the ultimate beach read for next summer, and might be a lovely Christmas gift to the women of a certain age on your gift list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RUB7HKL6LLHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345528697#wasThisHelpful","R1RUB7HKL6LLHR","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading Homer Hickam's writing is like slipping into a pair of favorite bedroom slippers. His narrative style is easy, friendly, and totally engaging. He draws you into this family yarn with ease, and one finds this journey from puppy love to the real thing in a car shared with an alligator and a chicken is delightful to curl up with at the end of a busy day. Along the way, Hickam manages to tell the story with all the surprises his stories usually bring. The young couple runs into literary giants, bootleggers, bank robbers, union agitators, and a few Depression era ne’er do wells as the Hickam’s story. This unlikely story of one strange adventure after another is, in the long run, about love -- the different kinds of love that season our lives, or maybe it is about kismet. It is hard to tell one from the other.Whatever the deeper message you draw from this story, it is told so lovingly that one cannot help but be completely wrapped up in the evolution of these characters. Hickam's regard for the folks who became his parents is evident in every line of this story. A loving son relating a family legend that involves his parents told from a fresh perspective that sheds light on his parents’ view of the events as well. You simply cannot take sides, but have to just sit back and understand all the viewpoints as their lives work out, as lives are prone to do in spite of our best efforts to control things. Ah, kismet!When you read a lot of books, and I do read a lot of books, you seldom finish one and start right back up to read it a second time, but that is what I did with “Carrying Albert Home.” As the cliché goes, you will laugh; you will cry, and I did. I hope you do too. This is a lovely book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJR6NFRXLBI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325892#wasThisHelpful","R1UJR6NFRXLBI4","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice standard-weight set of potholders for kitchen use. Nothing fancy, but the charming print and cute trim. However, they are quite serviceable and are thick enough to provide adequate protection from hot surfaces.

"Lincoln Child is one scary writer who takes you for a harrowing trip through an upscale think tank housed in a creepy old New England mansion. Following enigmalogist Jeremy Logan through this maze of brilliant scientists and the sorts of horrors great brains can create is an adventure you won’t want to miss. Weaving carefully several  fields of knowledge, Child will frighten even the boldest reader into turning page after page as Logan struggles to decipher the convoluted path of reason from decades past, resurrected but still not fully understood. It will appeal to the techie in one as well as the detective, and is a very satisfactory read!Anyone who has toured Newport, Rhode Island and speculated about the mysteries of the great summer houses that dot its shore will enjoy exploring Dark Gables and the erudite collection of brillant scientists who populate  the policy institute, Lux. The gothic structure is designed after an English manor house and Child’s detailed descriptions of it will fascinate those with an architectural bent. As the mystery unfolds, Child makes full use of this setting and one is caught up in its luxurious appointments as well as its sinister atmosphere.As with any quality mystery, a few red herrings show up to keep the reader considering the options of who or what is causing the odd schizophrenia that seems to slip into victim’s mind and forces suicidal behavior in even the most stable individual. Logan himself must fight to keep from following this frightening path.Although I am long familiar with Child’s collaborative work with Douglas Preston and the Pendergast series of stories featuring a quirky protagonist’s interaction with the world, I had not read any of the Jeremy Logan series that Child has created on his own until this one. You can bet I will be reading the others in this series right away!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDWLA8IBWRNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385531400#wasThisHelpful","RBDWLA8IBWRNZ","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this 5-Minute Pizza Oven cooks a pizza and frozen snacks as advertised -- quickly and efficiently -- it takes up too much space to be practical in a kitchen with a functional oven already. It cooks a frozen pizza great, but isn't great if you tend to add a lot of ingredients to jazz up the dish before cooking. The bottom crust gets too done before the top is ready if you do. It does frozen breaded fish filets quite well, but watch smaller snacks as this unit heats up to some 600 degrees Fahrenheit, which is why it cooks a pizza so quickly. It comes complete with little pegs to affix to the side of the unit and hang the pretty-darn-cool handle that clamps on to the ceramic cooking shelf like the ones you see in the pizzeria to pull the pizza from the oven, but do NOT cut the pizza on the ceramic surface because it cleans so easily that you don't want to mess up this nice cooking surface.I would suggest using a pizza peel to remove the pizza for cutting and serving. If I had a big enough kitchen or way more storage space, I would love this device, except that  lugging it to a storage space in the basement is going to be a nuisance and I am troubled by the high temperature it reaches. It seems excessive for a countertop appliance, and especially for one that is liable to draw youthful and potentially careless users.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LYXUS66LU7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R21LYXUS66LU7E","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I brought this book on our fiftieth wedding anniversary trip and I have found it a perfect beach read. Annie Barrows has I troduced a charmingly quirky cast of characters that are drawing me into her story. I cannot wait to see what happens next which makes this book perfect for the distracting envieronment on the beach or at poolside. You can easily lay it aside when you take a dip and be easily drawn back into the plot when you pick it up again. It is essentially the story of a poor little rich woman sent out to earn her living through the WPA Writers Project. Her job is to write a history of a town in West Virginia named Macedonia. The narrative voice shifts from one character to another giving insights into the official chronicling of a small town named Macedonia through the varying perspectives. It is a totally absorbing tale with a satisfactory resolution, and certainly speaks again of the skill of Annie Barrows!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD1FP032CZ3IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385342942#wasThisHelpful","RD1FP032CZ3IB","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put this seed down in one of our problem areas last month.  I followed the clearly written instructions on the bag, but, whether the seed is simply wrong for this region or whether it washed away from excessive rain hereabouts, germination was poor so a fair judging of its performance in this region is unlikely. Still, the idea of mulch and seed together is a good one, and the seed really wasn't intended for Kentucky anyhow.

"Just finished ""The Little Paris Bookshop..."" about an hour ago, and I am still thinking about it. What reader doesn't love a bookstore?  And a book about a bookshop on a converted barge on the Seine in the heart of Paris was too appealing to not give this book a try. And, to make it even more intriguing is the notion of a bookseller who finds books to heal the reader. Monsieur Perdu doesn't push the latest bestseller, but seeks the right title for the right reader, and his uncanny ability to mend broken hearts through books is a lovely device that Nina George applies deftly to the narrative. Poor Perdu is mending every broken heart but his own it seems until the plot thickens and he begins to sort through Perdu's deep sorrow and the harm it has done him. Circumstances and a found letter take Perdu on a quest for lost love, and a trip on the Seine with an unusual cast of characters who seek elusive love, in its myriad guises, throughout the French countryside wherever the river takes them. Along the way, surprising revelations about profound joy and sorrow. It is an amazing journey. There are so many insightful quotes in this book, that it is dogeared already on my shelf and has drawn me into its pages twice. The most insightful is a summary in a sentence of what the online world has become. So perceptive! After the past is sorted out,  will Perdu move into the future with grace and hope? Read the book,sail away, and perhaps discover a bit about yourself along the way. I certainly did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EHZVBPE4BE1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418777#wasThisHelpful","R3EHZVBPE4BE1U","A2X1IIDFC7YSZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X1IIDFC7YSZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Viper Specter Bilingual Electronic Soft-Tip Dartboard arrived on a rainy spring day, and we opened the carton immediately and set the board up. It was so easy to do! We didn’t opt for a total wall installation, although complete and clear instructions to permanently position securely for a proper dart game. Being new to this, we eyeballed the distance and height and chose the recommended simplest game to start. The darts are clearly weighted exactly right, and the soft tips reassured me that I wasn’t going to destroy the house with a wild throw, and they are great to throw.The company that manufactures this system clearly knows what is required for novice and advanced players, as the system is designed with 50 game choices along with rudimentary instructions for play as well as a number of scoring options, since these games can vary greatly as to number of participants. Plus, there are a couple of dozen extra tips for the six included darts. The target lights up and tells you exactly whose turn it is to throw next as well as scoring each throw. The tips lodge properly in the bristle board surface too, so a good shot is there for all to see.Our afternoon session of dart play was great fun, and, while I suspect I will never be a dead shot with darts, I am looking forward to playing it again.

"This spreader arrived just in time for us to spread SnowMelt on our driveway after shoveling away 14"" of snow, and I love it. The new ergonomic handle is GREAT; it keeps your wrist from wearing out as you distribute fertilizer, seed, or whatever else (this time SnowMelt) you need to distribute. There is a guide on the side of the device to set how heavily you want the material to spread, and that works find. The crank handle is placed for right hand use while your left hand threads through to the trigger on the device so you can distribute when you need to and stop it quickly when you do not need to -- very handy for those turns as you fertilize or seed. Today, a warmer and sunny day occurred and we were able to give the Handy Green II a run with the early spring fertilization of the yard. I couldn't be more pleased at the performance and the end result. The fertilizer spread evenly at the rate we chose, and the job was finished with ease. This spreader is great. And, since this lightweight unit is mostly plastic, we were able to wash it to remove  the SnowMelt material before using it for fertilizer.

"I just received and assembled this yesterday, and am genuinely surprised that this has received as many positive reviews as it has. The quality is cheap, even for the price of $195 I paid for it.- One of the holes for the fastening studs was misdrilled, or drilled too large. Instead of screwing it in, you could push it in by your finger. Also, one of the six cam locks broke on me instantly.- The wood had large stress cracks in one corner on the table top.- The finish is really uneven. It was missing stain completely by the bottom shelf, above the wine rack. You can tell visually, and by feel, that the stain is not applied evenly.- The two large vertical boards at the end of the fold out? You can easily see that they are both severely warped, or bowed.- The wine bottle rack is made from compressed paper/wood particles. Extremely cheap. It wouldn't be so bad if it fit snugly into the wine bar, but unfortunately it does not. if you put one wine bottle in the left box, it tweaks the other 8 boxes out of shape. I will modify this with some corner brackets.Otherwise, it is nice to look at, but you will quickly realize how cheap it is when you put it together. Its made in Thailand, and its pretty obvious that the assembly workers take no pride in making these!In the end, I plan on keeping it. I'm going to have a piece of tempered glass cut for the top, as I don't think the wood finish would last for long. If you have kids, you should definitely keep it folded up when not in use, as it easy to damage the fold out leaves when they are extended.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R372IM25RR5NRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B2PA6A#wasThisHelpful","R372IM25RR5NRB","A1LHSZKJ7MLEHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LHSZKJ7MLEHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very disappointed with these headers. I wanted to give my 2.2L a slight performance increase to help with towing a small boat. My problems with this header are:1) The header and pipes are painted with cheap, non-high temperature paint. There is even a decal on one of the primaries stating that the paint on it is not high-temperature. So it will burn off readily after some light use. I went through the trouble of stripping this paint, and applying some vht flame-proof primer and flat black paint. You have to sand/strip/blast off the old paint because you cannot use cheap paint as a substrate for high temperature paint.2) The angle of the air injection tube was wrong, and would not allow me to install the air pump check valve that is supposed to thread on to it. The way it was, the air injection check valve would've been right where the oil fill tube bracket is. I would've had to seriously notch the bracket (remove 1"" of material) and remove the rear engine hoist bracket on the cylinder head. Instead, I realized the thread for the air injection check valve was 1/2 NPT, so I went to a local hardware store and picked up a galvanized 1/2 NPT 45 degree street elbow to clear the oil tube bracket and engine lifting bracket.3) The two other exhaust pipes slip into each other. The flare was too large on the one and caused an exhaust leak. I clocked the exhaust clamp in several different positions, but the flare was too oversized and would not seal no matter what. By the way, the included exhaust clamp is a super cheap one, with a 5/16 bolt shank. Every exhaust clamp you buy at the auto parts store is a 3/8"" bolt shank. I installed a better quality 3/8 shank clamp, but even with the clamp crushing the pipes together, it still leaked. I ended up welding this connection.4) The bung that the oxygen sensor goes into is unbelievably cheap. I expect it to strip out or completely break away from the header collector the next time I change the oxygen sensor. I applied a very generous amount of anti-seize compound to the threads. If I were to do this header install again, I would definitely buy a oxygen sensor bung (M18x1.5 threads) on ebay and weld it in place.5) Performance? Well I definitely feel absolutely no increase, but it is too early to make that call. I need to do some more test driving before I can reach a verdict on that.6) The bolts were too short for connection the header ball flange to the downpipe. Pacesetter includes 3/8 by 3.5"" long bolts. I ended up getting two stainless steel m10-1.5 by 110mm long bolts. You could also pick up 3/8-4"" long bolts at your local hardware store too.7) The primary tube coming off of cylinder #1 runs very close to the lower radiator hose - about 1/2"" away. I definitely plan on fabricating a small aluminum heat shield to go in between the radiator hose and header.Bottom line, would I buy them again for another 2.2L S10? No. I bought this on Amazon for about $180, and even at that price, its a waste of money.  If you are serious about getting a little more power out of your s10, consider swapping to a 4.3L V6, traditional small block Chevy, or even better yet, a LS motor (4.8L, 5.3L, 6.0L etc).","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WNCS2387WUN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CI2NKY#wasThisHelpful","R2WNCS2387WUN2","A1LHSZKJ7MLEHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LHSZKJ7MLEHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good quality seal, this particular national brand seal I received was made in Brazil for those interested. Replaced seal on passenger side on a 2008 Sierra 1500 4WD 5.3L with a 8.25"" ring gear in the front differential.

Loosen or remove upper strut to frame bolts. Move strut off to the side a little.3) Remove 6 bolts holding outer CV axle to inner axle shaft. Move CV axle aside.4) Unplug the electrical motor on the front axle and move harness to the side.5) Unbolt the axle shaft tube from the differential. You will loose a small amount of gear oil. Remove slowly and cautiously and pay attention the spring inside.6) Put the axle shaft tube on your bench or in a vise. Remove and set aside shift collar. Remove axle retaining clip with a small pick or pocket screwdriver. Use a soft faced hammer and gently pound out axle stub from axle shaft tube.7) Use a large screwdriver and pry the old seal out.

And you get a better battery in the process with practical benefits!Weight is 1.76 lbs.Also, no liquids whatsover, so nothing to maintain, nothing to cause corrosion to the battery box or tray.Dimensions are 5.27"" (134mm) length x 2.55"" (65mm) width x 3.62"" (92mm) height.PDF manual for these lithium batteries are available through battery tender's website.At the time I purchased this, I found it cheaper through Summit Racing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F7FJOLE6FDJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9LPJ8S#wasThisHelpful","R3F7FJOLE6FDJ2","A1LHSZKJ7MLEHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LHSZKJ7MLEHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically to use it you:1) Put your cartridge in the included holster.2) Peel back the top label.3) Grab the syringe and fill it (at least for my 61XL cartridge) up to the 2.0 mark with ink and inject it into the hole on top of the cartridge slowly. The amount of the ink you inject is not as critical as you would think.4) Take the needle off syringe, put the syringe into the hole underneath the holster and pull a little bit of ink out. This helps pull ink through the sponge and into the printhead of the cartridge.5) Install the cartridge in your printer. I like to give it 5 minutes or so for the ink to evenly absorb throughout the internal sponge.DONE! This will save you so much money, it's ridiculous!

Keep it mind the reflective strip is more prominent than this picture shows.Just use google images to find a more accurate picture.It has a very flexible sidewall, but is very strong where it counts; at the tread. Because of the sidewall, it is unusually easy to slip onto the rim. Thorn resistant tubes (Twice as thick as a normal tube) are a nice complement to these.

"This headlight is extremely bright! I have been using it for the past few months on a motorized bicycle, averaging 20-25mph at night on my commute from work. It is really fun to take this on the back trails at night. I was lucky enough to get these for $9.99 a piece, with Amazon Prime shipping!It must be used with a 2.0A or higher port, and not the average 1.0A port! If you do, it will shut off due to the internal circuit breaker that any brand/model of battery backup has. For what it's worth, I have used this with a Blackbox Ocho 5000mah battery backup, which is equipped with a 1A port and a 2.1A port (which is just okay but the USB ports are poor quality and will wear out in time. I would recommend a high quality product made by Anker instead, like their Astro2 8400mah battery, which is equipped with a 2.1A port).I bought two of these, and unfortunately on both, the USB connector is starting to flake out after 2.5 months of use. I've verified that with several USB ports on different devices.I was riding home one night and the light started flickered and went out completely. I jostled the USB connector a bit, and it would work until I hit the next bump. Not what you want on a dark road on a moonless night! Luckily I had a backup flashlight.I will exchange it for a new one and try again, but I might just go for a Cygolite headlight, which are EXCELLENT quality, and made in the U.S.A.!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TC41X5N16BE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXU24NM#wasThisHelpful","R2TC41X5N16BE1","A1LHSZKJ7MLEHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LHSZKJ7MLEHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this chain for a gas powered bicycle because it is a 415 chain, and 110 links long, which is an ideal length for motorized bike applications. The other reviewer mentioned it is lighter than the chain that comes with the Chinese two stroke engines, which is obvious because it is so much lighter duty. The links use thinner steel and are not as tall as the china engine chains. I was replacing the china chain due to its stretching characteristics, but this worksman chain (which is actually a standard kmc chain with 110 links) is suitable for a pedal bike or tricycle, and not a motorized bicycle.

When I'm working on the computer, it's headphones.Benoit is a master and this album struts its stuff.  Reaching #5 on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz chart, Benoit put his heart into this one and it shows.

"There's something about this album that makes me laugh every time I put it on. Best of all, though, was the single attached ""You and Me Baby Ain't Nothin' But Mammals So Let's Do It Like They Do on the Discovery Channel"". Being your average older white guy, I probably wasn't the target audience when this released. But the heck with that. I snort laughed when I first heard it on CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) radio and knew I HAD to get this stupid thing.Everybody's already beat me to it - sophomoric, silly, sexist and sassy. Would that make it S to the 4th power? Could be! Hooray for Boobies is tongue in cheek from the get go. If you don't believe me, read the words printed on the label that aren't part of the advertising rubbish. If you don't laugh, you probably shouldn't have bought this album in the first place.So here's to my bud, F-word and I present the Bloodhound Gang's ""...

"Big Head Todd & the Monsters was one of those groups that occasionally pop up that hit the ground running and then seem to run off the map.  That said, before they go they manage to put out a few decent CD's.  In this case, BHT&tM's third album, Sister Sweetly, was the name of the game.Sister Sweetly in addition to being a pretty decent cut was a pretty decent album.  Here we've got their biggest hit, Broken Hearted Savior in the first position.  The title song rolls in as cut #2, Tomorrow Never Comes - another great one - at #4, It's Alright at #5 and Bittersweet at #9, Circle at #10.  For a disc with 11 cuts, about half of them were radio worthy.  Not bad.Sister Sweetly was probably Todd's best effort of the five albums released.  Sadly, it never cracked above the #100 mark in Billboard's Top 200.  Be that as it may, it was on the charts for over a year.  Todd Park Mohr and crew did a great job here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q89IZO8YH4B3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002L12#wasThisHelpful","R2Q89IZO8YH4B3","A1PGC1GEBY9CZU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PGC1GEBY9CZU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're searching for a swanky-looking wool/cashmere beanie to show off while munching on après-ski aperitifs in the Swiss Alps, then this ain't it. But if you're looking for an inexpensive hat that keeps you warm and doesn't look too bad, then you should consider the Chaos Men's beanie, which is warm, decent-looking and well-made.For the second straight year, we've had an unusually cold winter here in New York City. Every time I step outside I need a warm hat to keep me warm. The problem is that I keep losing them! I've gone through two already this winter. So this time I decided to purchase a more affordable hat in case my occasional forgetfulness reared its ugly head once more. And that is what led me to the The Chaos beanie.The fabric is comprised mostly of acrylic, with a small percentage of both wool and polyester. Even so, it feels supple, soft and a little fuzzy.

"Let me be very clear: these GoFit gloves break down pretty quickly. More on that in a moment, but first a little background.For several years I've been lifting weights once or twice a week to round out my (running-centric) exercise routine. I use weightlifting gloves for two reasons: to improve my grip and to prevent the development of calluses on my hands. In the past I've purchased Harbinger lifting gloves, which are relatively inexpensive -- $15-30 price range -- and adequately protect my hands. However, I found that the padding on the palms was so thick that it hindered my grip. And so I went off in search of a new pair, which led me to try the GoFit Diamond-Tac gloves.Initially, they were a perfectly snug fit, and the low-profile cushioning offered an excellent balance between protecting my hands and providing a reliable grip. But that didn't last for long. After a couple of months of use, they began to stink up and, as they instructed, I hand washed them using cold water and a small dollop of Woolite. Then I rinsed them and allowed them to air dry overnight. After that first wash, the gloves began deteriorating.With each subsequent workout, the gloves stretched out more and more and the seams and stitching busted open more and more. After the second wash, things got even worse. Within three or four months, the gloves were in rough shape. In an attempt to be fair, it's true that these gloves are pretty inexpensive, but still... They should last longer than a few months and a few washes. In sum, these gloves work well UNTIL you wash them -- after which they start to fall apart.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SHKFXFLBKTP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007W2FGS#wasThisHelpful","R2SHKFXFLBKTP3","A246GOYM3S1QVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246GOYM3S1QVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have several tiki torches on my apartment terrace. I purchased these tiki torch canisters to replace my old ones, which were all rusted out. Unfortunately, these new ones also simply cannot seem to stand up to the elements AT ALL.

I don't have the luxury of a shed where I can stash the torches when they're not in use.

"I have several tiki torches on my apartment terrace. After burning through the rope wicks that came with my torches, I decided to spring for these ""Long Life Fiberglass Replacement Wicks."" And yes, they do last much longer than the rope wicks -- perhaps twice as long. But they have two other distinct advantages that should be highlighted...1) They stand up to the wind much better. My terrace can get very windy, and when I'm hosting people I hate having to constantly relight the wicks every time a gust of wind rolls through. But these fiberglass wicks rarely lose their flame even during really blustery wind.2) They're more durable after having been exposed to the elements. Sometimes I forget to put the covers over the torches after I blow them out. And they get rained on, or frozen in cold temperatures. And unlike the rope wicks, which quickly disintegrate in the face of the elements, these fiberglass wicks bounce back even after they've been soaked in rain or suffered through below-freezing temperatures -- provided they're first allowed to dry out a bit.All in all, these fiberglass wicks are a significant upgrade. They still seem a tad too expensive, however. And that's why I couldn't give them a five-star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CX6HL5ZP8LUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C79KPM#wasThisHelpful","R3CX6HL5ZP8LUN","A246GOYM3S1QVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246GOYM3S1QVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was searching for something other than an iPhone armband to use when I run outdoors. I wanted something small -- but big enough for my iPhone and also a set of keys and my money clip.

With its two pouches, I can easily fit my keys and my small money clip in the tiny mesh-zippered pocket, while keeping my iPhone in the easily accessible larger pouch. (See attached photos.) The material always provides for a comfortable fit. I never seem to have to adjust the strap during my runs. And the stretchy, elastic pouch provides just the right amount of give when you need to cram a little bit more inside of it.Importantly, this waist pack NEVER bops or bounces around during my runs. I wouldn't even notice it was there if I didn't need to occasionally adjust the volume on my iPod.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the reflexive label on the pouch has begun peeling off.

"I need to say right off the bat that I only read one other in this series. But because Nina Levine is such an incredible writer, never once did I feel like I was lost or couldn't follow the story-line. In fact, this book has me clamoring for more and there is no doubt I will be playing catch up and reading those I've missed.This beautiful love story between Scott and Harlow made me sigh right from the start. Getting each of their POVs in alternating chapters gave me such insight into not only their journey but those of other members of the MC club. The author gave enough background that I was able to follow along seamlessly. This couple loves hard. They are both patient and hot-headed with each other. Playful yet wildly erotic. They fit so well together and by the looks of things, their past heartache has only made them stronger.All the characters are well-written and completely captivating. No one felt as simply an add-on and each and every character had purpose. The loyalty shown not only to each of the club members, but those that are family whether or not by blood, was truly heartwarming to witness. I liked that they were mature and forthright and no nonsense is tolerated.Scott  is one heck of a President and considering his family tree, he is one of the good ones for sure. Harlow is a feisty, big-hearted, and selfless woman. It's no wonder these two are together.  They handle all of the underlying issues that continue to plague the Club with determination and I loved that Scott was completely honest with her every step of the way. There is plenty of danger for this crew but it's handled sensibly and I loved every word.I'm thrilled to have been able to read this part of the series and honestly can't wait to see what the author has in store for us next. There are plenty of secondary characters that caught my eye so I'm hopeful they will get their time in the sun and soon.A solid 5 stars!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OILFLGTX36MJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S4KBDU#wasThisHelpful","R1OILFLGTX36MJ","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, I thought this would be a very sexy read, full of forbidden scenes and plenty of voyeurism and erotica. But what floored me most was that this book was that and so much more. I was so pleasantly surprised at how this story-line unfolded and thrilled at how the author weaved this tale.I loved watching as Heidi and her hard-as-nails persona, completely disappear when thoughts of Ransom filled her mind. From that very first passionate encounter, the woman was a goner. And rightfully so. Right along with Tucker, I was both mesmerized and turned-on at the scene they all participated in. Again, I thought this book would have just been a series of trysts between the trio. But what struck me the most is how we get to witness first-hand just how broken Ransom truly is and the curse (if you will) of being a hot rockstar and exceptional in the bedroomHis life is spiraling downward and Heidi, very surprisingly, becomes his reason for wanting to be better. Heidi's all-consuming dilemma into wanting to stay with her 'perfect' husband and in the meantime, never feeling what she does, every time Ransom is near was quite the roller-coaster ride. I could feel her being pulled in two different directions. She wanted more. She needed more. And Ransom fit the bill. But then she would remember just how wonderful Tucker is to her, accepting of her crazy publicist life and not wanting to hurt him. All is laid out so damn well and the author wrote it beautifully.The huge twist in the story caught me completely off-guard and oh yeah, I gasped loudly at that one!!I found this book to flow seamlessly, and it held me captive until the very end. I honestly didn't know how it would turn out or who Heidi would ultimately end up with but I will say I was both torn and happy at the result. The author very cleverly ends this story with the beginnings of what I hope is more from these characters..even bringing in one forgotten person from Taint.The cameos by Justice were the perfect compliment to this book and gave Heidi that often-needed reality check.A great book that I devoured happily.Huge 5 stars!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMRREE1W0XN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY3SVA0#wasThisHelpful","RHMRREE1W0XN5","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like so many other JHB fans, I fell hard for Sebastian and Caroline in the Education series. Their love story is one for the ages and unlike any I've ever read before or since.  With Semper Fi, I was once again with this beloved couple, only this time, getting inside Sebastian's head for a retelling of The Education of Caroline.  And oh how I have missed them.The book pretty much follows the same course as TEOC. However, we get to experience for the first time, all the hurt and sorrow that Seb has endured all the years he spent apart from his one true love. Getting his POV was at times insanely heartbreaking. With all the bravado he shows as a Marine, deep down he's still that 17 year-old boy who so desperately wanted to be loved. For his Caro to find a way to stay with him. To find him when he was finally of age. The hardness he had to cover himself with, in order to survive both his military training and his reluctant hate for his woman, was so sad to read at times. But the glimmer of hope, the small window of light that was thrust upon him when he and Caro reunite in the most unlikely of ways, began a healing process that was glorious to witness.I enjoyed this book immensely and was grateful the author gave us Sebastian's POV. Moments I wanted to know how he felt from the original series are here, present and accounted for and it truly makes their journey complete. The extras at the end certainly satisfy my curiosity as to their lives now and I for one can now let them go.The insight into the horrors of war and the frustration and utter heartache of PTSD is represented well here. I had a bit of trouble with Sebastian's failure to grow up at times but understood how his psyche was still very much stuck inside that 17 year-olds' head. Not to mention his anger at feeling like a failure for his woman. Caro is outstanding in her patience and never-ending love of her man, no matter what the circumstance.

"Oh wow, here we go again. I'm sure anyone who reads my reviews of Lauren Blakely's book must think I'm under her spell or something. No one could possibly love every book an author writes. And I would have to agree with that assumption. But...the way she creates stories that draw me in from the start, the way she manages to continually blend sex with heart flawlessly AND the way she consistently gives me heroines that are both independent and sensual are unmatched in my opinion. With Sinful Longing, every single component I just described is there with the added bonus of a mystery that has slowly been unraveling and leaves the reader with their jaw to the floor at the very last words.Ok so this Colin Sloan's book and his seemingly casual relationship with one Elle Mariano sizzles like nobody's business. Their chemistry is evident from the very beginning. These two can't be within a few feet from each other without the chance touch that might occur between them. They enjoy a purely physical relationship that has certainly become adventurous at times, yet beneath the surface, both Colin and Elle want more. With complicated pasts, there is that overriding fear that more harm than good would happen should they take their relationship to the next level. It's a chance they thankfully take and believe me, it is quite the bumpy ride!!In a nutshell, this is romance at it's best. Not only do you get great passion, but a love that is meant to be. I love that the author doesn't make it easy but keeps it realistic. You do not get whiny heroines who leave at the drop of the hat or make waves just to prove a point. Elle is a strong woman, who not only runs a community center but is a roller derby warrior in her time off. The love of her son, her work, the kids she tries to steer in the right direction and her defender status when she's in the rink as Titanium are what make her soar. It only makes sense to have an equally strong man by her side in Colin.And then, with every new twist to the murder mystery, we get a bit closer to what actually happened. There is the bombshell that was dropped at the end of book 2 in this series and now Marcus is firmly entrenched in both the Sloan family and their pursuit of the truth. It seems that in every chapter, more is revealed that has my head spinning. There is still so much to uncover and I'm hopeful that in Michael's book next, we finally get the whole sordid story.I encourage you to start from the beginning and read both Sweet Sinful Nights and Sinful Desire first. Although each is a standalone, you'll get the whole story and meet all the rest of Colin's family and friends.Well worth your time, this is a book that combines desire and mystery brilliantly.A huge 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W1X7EEK09F4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142ZNO7E#wasThisHelpful","R3W1X7EEK09F4R","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was utterly fantastic. But before I gush about Dearborn, I need to point out that I do not consider myself a PNR fan by any stretch of the imagination. I tend to avoid these stories for the most part but once in awhile, a beloved author of mine will put one out and I take that plunge. This is what happened with Dearborn. And once again, I am so happy that I didn't say no to an advanced copy but took the chance and came out a believe once more.What I found most endearing about this book is that beneath all the magic and supernatural occurrences, that this was first and foremost a love story. Willow and Quinn. Two people who haven't seen each other in 15 years, who remember each other from high school but know literally nothing about the other. Quinn is back in the small town of Woodland Creek after serving time in Afghanistan and no one seems to be able to get through to him, not even his closest friends. A chance meeting in Willow's diner sets their story in motion and soon each of their worlds will never be the same.The gift that Willow has in sensing and seeing color surrounding those in front of her is beautifully described by the author. She'll actually get nauseous if someone is upset or angry or is simply having a tough time. With Quinn, this happens often since he feels so out of sorts. Watching as Willow takes the time to figure out not only what must have happened to him during wartime but why his behavior can be so erratic, had me in knots right along with her. Her power to physically feel the moods of others is meticulously recounted and you're just as anxious to set things right. I loved her dedication and selflessness when it came to now only her magical town but those she holds near. Her best friend Ryan has his own talent for reading other's minds and his comic timing was a welcome relief more times than I could count.Quinn is a complicated character but you get to see the true transformation of a man who was denied his past and his legacy. It's through his blossoming love of Willow that his true sense of worth is finally realized. Together with other key figures in Willow's life, Quinn's future is put on the right course and he comprehends fully that he belongs by her side.I found myself learning all about a genre foreign to me but fascinated just the same. There are incredible scenes concerning 'shifting' that had me completely riveted. Once I realized that love can be found in this genre just like everywhere else, I was more than happy to enter the secretive world of Woodland Creek.This book is a wonderful journey into a magical place that I am pleased to have been able to discover. I encourage those of you who didn't 'do PNR' like I did, to give this one a chance. It is well worth your time. I promise it will put a smile on your face.A solid 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327SB39WFXMIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0172RPX8M#wasThisHelpful","R327SB39WFXMIW","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first from this author and it most definitely will not be my last!A tremendously simple yet beautiful story about second chances and the courage to take them.  This poignant love story between Ray and  Holly starts innocently enough: two co-workers in a small upstate NY town decide to share a lottery ticket. And when they surprisingly win a landfall, not only are their wallets now full but their hearts are as well.Ray and Holly fight the pull for one another because they wonder if their lives can fit together, since the attention they now garner has unfortunate consequences.What I truly loved about this book is that it was their story. There wasn't a ton of extraneous side-stories or characters to try to keep straight. Ray and Holly just want to be happy and their pasts may just decide their fate. But the hope that they can conquer that underlying fear that it will all be taken away from them kept their dreams of an HEA afloat. Their hesitance and awkwardness towards each other, no matter how fierce the pull, was a delight to read. Completely genuine kind of journey that I thoroughly enjoyed.I will say I would love to read more of them in the future.Well worth your time.A solid 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6YT5E8DVVA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPQHNHA#wasThisHelpful","RY6YT5E8DVVA2","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What wonderful debut! I love discovering new authors who put their heart and soul into their writing and Leslie Pike did just that.A love story between Steven and Bliss that starts quite accidentally but quickly becomes steamy and very sexy. Living next door to each other, Steven's world as a stuntman collides with permanent resident Bliss as he and his crew take up residence in Bliss's small community while making a movie nearby.They fall very fast for one another, there are a few bumps in the road but overall they know they are meant to be and fight the stubbornness each have so fiercely, in order to make things right. There is a great cast of secondary characters including the lead man in Jack and Bliss's bestie Nicki. Bliss's ex-husband is also an important part of the story and it was refreshing to read that exes can still be friends and mean it.I enjoyed reading about a more mature group who know what they want and won't stop until they get the happiness they deserve. There is plenty of humor, together with great moments of tenderness and passion. A very impressive beginning to what I know will be a successful writing career for the author.A solid 4 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI3BE46LJS19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTPQB8G#wasThisHelpful","R3FI3BE46LJS19","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh wow. Fostered was an utterly wonderful surprise. Recommended by a favorite author of mine, I figured I'd give this new-to-me author a chance and I am extremely happy I did.From the very start, I loved Vanessa Marie's style. Written in Dante Wallaces's POV, we are thrown immediately into his thoughts as he is being driven to yet another foster home. At 17, he has seen it all and it hasn't been pretty. In fact it's been downright horrifying and it's amazing this young man is here to tell about it. With this, his last chance at a real life before he ages out of the system, we are privy to his constant fears, his dread and his resignation that this too won't work out. But as we meet the McKinley family right along with Dante, it is with pure joy that we get to witness what it's like to finally feel like you belong. To feel loved for the first time and to have your soul warmed up like nothing you've ever experienced.I laughed more times than I can count at the complete mayhem that is the McKinley household. Placing Dante with this family should have been a disaster but with the love that they show one another through the constant teasing, swearing and overall concern, our guy didn't know what hit him. I didn't either! I was right alongside him for the ride and it was insanely wonderful. And as much as I laughed, the tears hit hard and fast more than I want to admit. The way the entire McKinley crew had Dante's back when outside forces threatened to remove him from their home was so beautiful I found myself in complete awe of these characters. Holly stands out above the rest for her good-natured, easy-going yet mama-bear qualities. She cares for her brood and made Dante feel like one of her own, right from the start. As this book quite literally chronicles a positive time of a lifer in the foster system, you get to see first-hand how it should be done. How it's possible to love a young man who sadly always got the short end of the stick. The hope that is usually fleeting in Dante's mind is suddenly starting to become permanent and it's thing of beauty to see.There is a sweet underlying romance that made this story even better. Lily gave Dante the softness he didn't know he had and with just a side glance or a small smile, he knew she was special. There aren't any sexual situations or much in the way of physical expression but theirs is a slow-simmering mutual admiration that is delightful to watch. The perfect high school crush.Fostered is very simply put, a look into the life of someone who is given the chance to soar when his wings always seemed to be clipped. A feelgood kind of story that will make you smile.A solid 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LJCZCAWFD72B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165SOIRQ#wasThisHelpful","R3LJCZCAWFD72B","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes I finally got to this book. Hearing about it these past few years, I just knew I had to dig it out of the tbr pile on my Kindle and give it a go. I am thrilled I did. And kind of want to slap myself for waiting so long since it was truly a beautiful read.The author's writing is flawless in my opinion. The words flow easily and her writing style is simple. And I don't mean that it's subpar or lacking in any way. I just mean that she doesn't waste time with unnecessary words or scenes. She gives us exactly the right amount of emotion, dialogue and backdrop. I felt as I was on that island stranded right along with TJ and Anna, the descriptions so vivid and well-researched. Every small victory at creating shelter or finding food, to the dire medical situations that kept them vigilant, I felt each and every one of those scenarios like I was there myself.Anna and TJ's love, although expected, never felt forced, pathetic or desperate. Even though they didn't know their fate, I really believe they fell for each other for the right reasons and I give the author huge kudos for making their love official when TJ was of age.Overall this is a story of survival. Not just from a horrific plane crash leaving TJ and Anna cut off from the rest of the world. But to survive in a universe where others may not understand your relationship nor your desire to be together. Especially when you aren't 100 percent sure yourself.This was an absolutely lovely read that everyone needs to discover. Simply wonderful in every way.A huge 5+ stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210KXFO4NCLXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089PFZGW#wasThisHelpful","R210KXFO4NCLXR","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had forgotten how much I loved this cast of characters and it was a pure joy being with them again.We get to catch up with the entire crew and I was honestly laughing out loud at both the advice and the commentary, especially from Casey and Aidan.A great extra to this beloved series, you won't want to miss it.5 solid stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12U4YB3CB6FEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017DVIHYY#wasThisHelpful","R12U4YB3CB6FEQ","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Lover's Lament is an absolutely gorgeous read. I was hooked from the very start and I honestly did not want it to end. I was drawn into this second chance romance between Devin and Katie due to it's exquisite simplicity. The book is their story. Yes there are many outside forces that dictate their paths and the struggles to get back what they once had. But in the end, I cherished the plain fact that it's a tale about a man and a woman and the love that refuses to be extinguished.This love story gave me all the feels that I crave. Harshly separated after declaring their hearts to each other, both Devin and Katie live their lives the best they can. 10 years pass without a word from either one. Then through a pen pal program, with perhaps a bit of divine intervention and the urging of a well-meaning doctor, Katie finds her newly-found friend to be none other than the boy she loved all those years ago. Finding each other again is evidently the balm both needed to soothe not only their broken hearts but their troubled souls.Told in alternating POV's, these co-author's words flowed seamlessly. You'd never know they hadn't already written together before this debut. The attention to detail, especially from Devin, in describing the daily life while stationed in Iraq was mesmerizing. Never did it feel tedious or hard to understand. Mr. Urruela, with his first-hand knowledge in being a soldier overseas, gave us that hard-to-fathom glimpse into a world that for most of us is unknown. Yet now I feel I have a better understanding as to how our brave warriors live each day away from home. For that I am most grateful.We get to watch Devin and Katie fall in love all over again, suffer immeasurable losses, live each day missing the other and wishing it will all work out for them in the end. Their journey is never easy. It wasn't even when they were young. There are so many obstacles, hurt feelings and the inevitable doubt. But you can't help but get lost in their world and their pain becomes your own.I laughed, smiled, cried and gasped often. There were scenes that ripped me apart and others that made me sigh loudly. Devin and Katie are a well-written and very enjoyable couple. And there are secondary characters that added the right touch and made this book complete. I wouldn't mind their stories in the future should that be a consideration.Lastly I will just say this: if you are looking for a book that will stir up a myriad of emotions, yet leave you smiling broadly through tears upon conclusion, then this is the one for you.A huge 5+++ stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LJAXOV531AZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FVO6LS#wasThisHelpful","R22LJAXOV531AZ","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With book two in the Girls Breaking the Rules trilogy, Kelsey Burns has certainly proven she is not just a flash in the pan. With Alexa, we get a much more meatier read that kept me captivated from the very first words.The author pairs Alexa with Johnny, a local barkeep, and the sparks are flying off the pages immediately. Their love story is not as simple as it seems and with some mystery surrounding Johnny, our girl might be nursing a broken heart.The entire crew is on board and they provide the perfect addition to this adventure. Get ready for some extremely sexy scenes, together with the usual banter that had me rolling! Tash, Alexa and Shel are a force to be reckoned with and their men have to struggle to keep up! Thankfully the author has given this trio men who are strong enough to not only tame them but love them completely.I am enjoying every new book in this series and just know Shel's turn will be just as wonderful.Well worth your time, these books will make you smile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HG1EQH55PNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JL8TMA#wasThisHelpful","R2HG1EQH55PNE","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looks like one incredible collection of paranormal tales!!! I can't wait to dive in but in the meantime, I can offer up a review for Strange Magic Parts I & II by Michelle Mankin.My review is for Strange Magic Part One and Two: I was completely intrigued by this book. I am not a pnr fan at all but Michelle Mankin has managed to beautifully combine her love of rock and roll with the spirit world and has made me a true believer!The story, with New Orleans as a canvas so to speak, is actually two in one in that we get Billy Blade, sexy rocker who can sense, feel spirits around him, especially onstage. He isn't quite sure why and it kind of freaks him out just the same. He lays the groundwork for the true crux of this first part of Strange Magic, which is a step back to some years prior and the story of Thyme Bellerose.Thyme Bellerose, the consummate heroine: loyal to a fault, loves her family and only wants the best for her fiance Shane Lamar. But a 'chance' encounter that isn't quite so coincidental threatens both her life and her world as she knows it.Her beautiful yet haunting violet eyes are the key in my opinion to how Billy and Thyme's paths intersect. Their story has only just begun and by the end of part one I was clamoring for so much more!I was riveted by this storyline and the way it caught my attention. I honestly didn't know what to expect and was happily surprised that anything even remotely paranormal could captivate me this much.The author continues to step up her game and write stories with heart that you can't but help fall in love with each and everytime. She pays attention to detail and you feel as much a part of the story as the main characters.As a huge fan of Michelle Mankin's, I will admit I was a bit skeptical about reading this latest book of hers since I am not a paranormal fan at all. I just don't read it. However, I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I absolutely adored this story. It kept me glued to my ereader from page one.Book 2 picks up shortly after the end of Book 1,which is a great backstory unto itself. Our hero, Billy Blade, is touching down in New Orleans for a much needed break and for some time to recharge the creative juices. From the time he stays at the former apartment of one Thyme Bellerose, whom we met in Book 1 and has seemingly gone missing once Hurricane Katrina hit 10 years prior, magical things start to happen. Since Billy has a gift of summoning spirits with his harmonica, he isn't all that surprised when Thyme starts to make her presence known to him when he in the apartment. And so starts a truly spiritual love affair.This book is so engaging. From the minute Thyme and Billy start to spend time together, there is this unmistakable chemistry that you just can't ignore. Even though she is a spirit and he is living mortal, they have more in common that one might think, and as the story progresses we learn more about why Billy has his gift and how he might be able to save Thyme from an afterlife in limbo.The author pays attention to detail and this book was very well researched. With NOLA and Mardi Gras as the background, the book uses many familiar sights and sounds. In addition, the description of the 'spiritual underworld' and those that inhabit it, was uncanny. I often felt like I was really there and have to say was happily drawn into that unfamiliar atmosphere.Although this story is paranormal at the surface, in the end it is a story of true love, fate, hope and resilience. The secondary characters, some kind, some downright evil, had me completely engaged the entire time. There are some incredible revelations and some very magical scenes that truly blew me away.I encourage you, even if you were not a pnr fan like I was, to give this book a chance. If you know Michelle Mankin's work at all, you'll know she writes from the heart and gives the reader story-lines that are truly well written and captivating. I was mesmerized at discovering a genre not familiar to me, yet walked away loving every word.5 magical stars and very highly recommended.I'm telling you, just having both books at your fingertips for the low price of 99 pennies is amazing. You'll love Strange Magic and the rest of this collection is something I am looking forward to reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB71O5X86UPEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011576CZS#wasThisHelpful","RB71O5X86UPEL","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All I Need Is You is the kind of book that simply makes you feel warm all over. A joy to read and a pleasure from start to finish.This touching love story between Neve and Rory had so much more than just romance. Getting to know each other through letters while Rory was serving in Afghanistan, each became the other's sounding board. Neve as a dancer was finally realizing her dream: a tryout with Cirque du Soleil. She craved a new start and was hopeful that she would traveling the world with the famed dance troupe.Rory back home in the States for good, picks up with his pen pal after a most unfortunate tryst while he was on leave, and these two together set off some serious fireworks!What I loved first and foremost was that Neve was her own girl. We always look for that sassy bestie to keep us on our toes in a book. However, it's Neve who is the sassy one and for most of this story, Rory is the one kept on his toes. And he loves it.Their witty banter, their passionate scenes and the tender moments shared between Rory and Neve make for the perfect story. His PTSD, her fear of staying the party girl forever and their constant struggle not to ruin what might be happening between them, are all great components to make this book feel so real. It wasn't just about their love, but about them accepting themselves for who they were and wanted to be and how to go about sharing that with each other.The absolute best thing though? The fact that Wendy Marcus has given us a spectacular man in Rory who is only 5 foot 4!!! Oh how I have wanted a story about a vertically-challenged man. Proving you don't have to be over 6 feet to get the girl. I can't thank her enough for that. It's about damn time.Overall a very satisfying read. One that made me smile, made me laugh and made me swoon.

"I can't even express how happy I am after reading Desperate Chances. I have loved this series from the very first pages of Bad Rep and have fallen for this cast of characters with each new book. This is the last one and as wonderful a read that it is, I can't help but be a bit melancholy as well.We finally get Mitch and Gracie's story.  Mitch, the laid-back bass guitarist for Generation Rejects, who has loved his former bestie since they first met. Gracie, who has put herself back together, shedding that party-girl persona and surviving an alcoholic overdose. Struggling to convince her parents and herself that she can make it on her own, all the while determined to be able to be in the same room as Mitch, when all she wants to do is be his friend again. Hopefully more. After a disastrous tryst a year prior, it's all they can do to remain civil.Oh my what a story. I had such a nervous feeling throughout this book, waiting for that ultimate moment where Gracie and Mitch would be face to face and not be able to outrun their past. And when the fireworks started and they were forced to get all of their bottled-up emotions out, I was completely captivated. I mean, seriously, there was no way I could put my e-reader down! You can feel the heartache and absolute dread that both Mitch and Gracie carried with them. My heart broke for them. I just wanted to join in with the numerous pleas from all of their friends to open their eyes and just figure out how to be together already. They were truly meant to be. Their hearts knew it. They just had to convince their minds.The author once again has written a simply perfect book that not only features the unrequited love story of Mitch and Gracie, but manages, masterfully I might add, to update us on all the happenings with the other members of the band and their significant others. Jordan and Maysie, Cole and Vivian and Riley and Garrett are all there. One crazy, loving family who make the right amount of appearances throughout and add just the right touch.As they all move on to new adventures, I am so sad that this could be the end of the road. But being witness to the love that has been the glue in holding this crew together was a complete pleasure to read. Each love story made me smile, made me laugh, made me cry on occasion and overall just made me extremely happy.I'm hopeful that one day we might get an update and see how the Rejects are doing down the road. But for now I will savor the warm feeling I have after finishing Desperate Chances, celebrating the reunion of former best friends who now have that chance to be more. It is a stellar finish that I won't soon forget.A huge 5+++ stars!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WSH49TAVEMFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VOHOUS#wasThisHelpful","R1WSH49TAVEMFZ","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great short about the sexy and very confident Cyrus Fletcher and Tricia, a smart and beautiful marketing publicist who go on a whirlwind trip to Vegas.Fletcher is a sports agent and lawyer who is desperate to sign the next best thing in the NBA. Seeing as he needs a date to woo his potential client, he approaches Tricia and they come to an understanding, contract and all, about what the weekend will entail.He pretends he thinks she's a high-class call girl and she pretends he's not the arse who drives her up a wall. Together they manage to have some wild fun, tame a witty yet cantankerous chaperone and perhaps even fall for each other.A great funny yet touching read that certainly has me wanting more.

"Bewitched is an absolutely enchanting short story. Daisy Prescott proves she can write New Adult with the best of them!This sweet and witty tale of Madison Bradbury and Andrew Wildes was a pure joy to read. Madison struggles with her roommate Sam's fascination with all things 'witchy' and her sudden interest in the dark, brooding Andrew leads to the use of 'magic' spells that she isn't sure she wants to fully understand or believe in. Yet when time in the classroom becomes more for these college juniors, it's up to Madison to either start believing in the unknown or walk away from the potential love she has craved in Andrew.The author's attention to detail is evident and she certainly did her homework with respect to the town of Salem, Massachusetts. The banter between Madison and Sam kept me chuckling throughout and the charming moments between Madison and Andrew made me sigh.  It is a great cast of characters I definitely need more of and am hopeful Ms. Prescott will be giving a continuation of this story very soon.A definite pick me up that I highly recommend to enjoy during these cool fall days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H2UIP2YPSFSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VY57BG#wasThisHelpful","R3H2UIP2YPSFSU","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca Yarros has certainly given us the perfect final chapter of flight school. Having read the first two books in the Flight & Glory series, I knew how masterful the author was with her words and her characters. I fell for each flyboy and the loves of their lives and with each ending, felt utterly satisfied. But with Beyond What is Given, the author's writing has hit a new level of excellence and the only word I can use upon reading those last pages, is bliss.This book gave me the feels I have been craving. From the very start this wildly entertaining and beautifully written love story had my heart. Grayson and Samantha. Roommates who feel that attraction almost instantly and it is bursting off each and every page. Watching as they match wits, each as stubborn as the other and both knowing that anything between them will spell disaster. With Samantha trying to put her life together and get a college degree after a very humiliating event in her home state of Colorado, and Grayson, trying to be at the top of his flight class, all the while harboring a secret left back home in North Carolina, these two carry a lifetime of baggage. Yet, they clearly fit together so perfectly and I was downright saddened at the thought that they just couldn't make it work.  But I will tell you this: their journey was nothing short of incredible and I savored each and every word.What is so special about this book and actually this entire series is that you feel as if you could be friends with this crew. From Josh and Ember to Paisley and Jagger to even Carter (!), this is a stellar cast of characters who sincerely care for one another. There is abundant teasing and good-natured ribbing, but in the end they truly have each other's backs. Grayson with his sense of honor and commitment is one of THE best men I've ever read about. Although at times misplaced, his loyalty to those he loves, blew me away time and time again. You can't help but fall for him.And Samantha with her huge heart and unwavering support, she was most definitely the match for the guarded Grayson. Seeing him open up, actually relax for a change and begin to find his way back to himself, was all Sam's doing. I loved their banter, their sexy trysts and most of all, how they needed each other when no one else would do. They simply got each other and you could feel it with each passing page.The author continues to write from her very soul. This is territory familiar to her and it shows. The knowledge of terminology and procedure is made 'human' due to her intimate experience with being a military wife. She makes you comfortable with a world very foreign to most of us. And it never took away nor did it make the story drag.I honestly can't say enough about this book. I couldn't put it down. It is most certainly my new favorite in the series and it will make you smile like nothing else. A job so well done.It will take me a bit to get over this hangover and I don't mind one bit!A huge 5++++ stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9OT1HTO7SD4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P2ERCG#wasThisHelpful","R9OT1HTO7SD4W","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is one that tackles great loss for both main characters. Liz and Tristan, suffering from the tragic deaths of their loved ones. Now finding themselves living next door to each other. Both lost in their own worlds, they form a sort of mutual respect for one another and allow each other to mourn in only the way they each understand. Theirs is a relationship that on the surface seems simple, especially to those in their small town. But for Liz and Tristan, it proves to be the very lifeline that might prevent them from drowning in their grief.The Air He Breathes was extremely emotional. A story that is so heartbreaking, you wonder right along with Liz and Tristan, if there can be happiness found among all the sorrow. I felt for them. I celebrated their hard fought joys. I loved Liz's daughter Emma. She and her bestie Faye were true highlights of this book. But at times I needed more. Some extra details, some holes filled. There were parts of the timeline that felt left out as well as more interactions with those closest to them. Tristan's in-laws, the wonderful Mr. Henson, even the mysterious Sam. I know they had more to share and should have been allowed to. As much as I enjoyed this difficult journey, the ease at which everything fit so perfectly at the end kind of felt a bit cheesy. A bit too coincidental for my tastes. And I'm not sure the wild twist towards the end may have been necessary although I do understand why it was there.Overall it is well-written and I wouldn't hesitate to read more from this author but for now I'm giving this one a 3.5.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19UAEXXIR8CIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015L78KRQ#wasThisHelpful","R19UAEXXIR8CIU","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My first from Rachel Blaufeld and I am happy to have finally read a book from her. I truly enjoyed this one. A great look into how two broken people, with very sad pasts find each other and start to truly heal.This love story, although difficult at times, was a soul-grabbing read. Watching as Lane and Bess stumble time and time again, never really knowing what they deserve, wondering if the accidental meeting so long ago would either make or break them had me riveted. Each with painful demons each needs to overcome in order to find that sliver of true happiness they each deserve.Lane and Bess fit imperfectly perfect together yet there is so much underlying doubt, they can often be their own worst enemies. There is a ton of back and forth and I was left many times thinking this just wasn't going to work. Between their own issues, those of secondary characters who can't let go and the wild collision of two worlds, this is one bumpy ride.I did enjoy the flow of the book and the alternating POVs. It gave me great insight into how each character was feeling and the author never held back.  There are some difficult issues being dealt with in this story yet it was still very tender and touching for the most part.Highly recommended and I look forward to Jake's story next.  Well worth your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QAAQSUC3YB7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPPGKCS#wasThisHelpful","R3QAAQSUC3YB7Y","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just wow. I am thrilled to have this novella. As someone who doesn't necessarily figure things out easily when it comes to these kinds of stories, Initium has hopefully started me on the track to finally figuring out what this is truly all about.We get a bit of history, 21 years prior to what is happening now to Calla, and it is exhilarating!! I had forgotten just how wild a ride the Nocte series has been and this pleasant surprise has me all geared up and ready for Lux. There's even a couple of chapters of the last book to whet everyone's appetite.I strongly encourage you start at the beginning with Nocte and experience this journey for yourself.

"Somehow, Faith Andrews has me seriously considering changing teams. Once I read Man of My Dreams, I was all about Declan and was more than happy that Mia decided to stay with her husband. Noah was forced to leave town after his ill-fated affair and quite frankly I was glad to see him go. But now 5 years later, the man Noah Matheson is today is one I wouldn't get rid of anytime soon and I never thought I would say that!This touching love story between Noah and Willow has all the feels. They both have scarred hearts and are tentative to ever really begin again with someone new. However, there is definite chemistry between the two and despite the fact that they work so closely together, Noah and Willow couldn't help but fall for each other.What starts out as a comfortable friendship becomes more and both are incapable of stopping the inevitable love they soon feel. Both characters are worthy of happiness and I enjoyed the fact that Noah seemed a changed man and treated Willow with the respect and desire she deserved. In lieu of the fact that she has a sad past, I loved that Noah wanted her no matter what and just wouldn't stop at anything that got in their way. Anything including an ill-timed visit back home where he is face to face with the painful reminder of what could have been. But Noah faces his demons brilliantly and I simply adored how he was determined to get his own HEA come hell or high water! Nothing and no one was standing in his way this time. Not even the stubborn woman of HIS dreams: the sexy, stunning and sometimes silly woman that is Willow James.I am thrilled that the author fully redeemed Noah for me. He is worthy of Willow's love and his capability to not only adore his woman but take care of his friends and family, was quite endearing to say the least. He is most definitely a keeper. I will say that the brief time with Declan was not as expected and I will try not to remember him here but as the man who swept his wife off her feet years earlier.I'm hopeful somewhere down the road, we get Blaze and Sloane's story(s) as well. They were truly great secondary characters that added just the right touch to this story.Overall, After the Storm is a well-written and sweet read. Well worth your time.4.5 stars!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ0RH7AF4U3BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M1MKV8#wasThisHelpful","RZ0RH7AF4U3BA","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Lauren Blakely says this is her dirtiest talker yet? You listen. Because let me tell you, no one thus far in the author's stable of sexy men has even come close to the one and only Ryan Sloan. In fact, I'm still gasping for air at the absolute pleasure this man delivered. And quite content to stay that way I might add.How this talented author continues to up her game is anyone's guess. The way she seamlessly combines a touching and sensitive story-line with the most sensual and erotic sex scenes completely floors me. Add to that two smart, mature and well-written characters in Ryan and Sophie and you've got the perfect combination for an exquisite book.Ryan, the dominant alpha male, has certainly met his match in Sophie Winston. Although Sophie is herself a very successful businesswoman, she still craves the man that can both satisfy her mentally as well as in the bedroom. Her willingness to submit is never presented as a weakness. Instead the author thoughtfully allows our heroine to enjoy herself while letting go but is never demeaned for knowing what she wants. Ryan attends to her every need and together their chemistry is explosive. Having already experienced a short or two from prior Blakely books, it's a miracle my Kindle is still working!With Ryan still trying to come to grips with a crime that was first mentioned in Sweet Sinful Nights and what it has done to him all these years later, it is beautiful to watch as the walls around his heart start to melt as he and Sophie become closer. However, because this incident and the fallout still being felt could jeopardize any sort of happiness, it will be up to both of them to be honest, be strong and face whatever may come.Part of my love of the author's work is that she will mention characters from previous books, further extending the Blakely family tree. With Sinful Desire we get that and more. I love that Ryan's family plays a prominent role, with Shannon and Brent (from Sweet Sinful Nights) back as well as his two brothers, Colin and Michael. Together, they are all a force not to be messed with and the love and strong admiration they each have for each other made me smile. Even John, Sophie's brother, is a welcome addition to the crew. It's this sense of family, the knowledge that someone has your back, that I have come to both expect and adore. Together with an adorable dog in Johnny Cash, Ryan and Sophie can hopefully have the life they both want so desperately.I absolutely devoured this book from beginning to end and can't wait to see what book 3 in the series will bring. I can't imagine it getting any hotter but with Lauren Blakely, you just can't rule anything out. The woman is the true master of writing sex with heart.You need to grab a glass of wine, some extra panties(!), put your feet up and get lost in this journey. You will be bowled over just like I was.A very solid and wildly sexy 5++++ stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7VVZ2R9YMBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108NTFEK#wasThisHelpful","R3D7VVZ2R9YMBY","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here we are again. I just finished yet another book from Scott Hildreth and I'm sitting here like a fool with a huge grin on my face. I'm continually floored at this author's capability to create new characters that I completely fall for each and every time. Tough guys that somehow worm their way into my heart and leave an indelible mark.What I think I adore most about Blurred Lines is the underlying simplicity of the story: the blossoming love between Blake and Riley. He is the seemingly typical tattoo artist and she is the woman who has escaped a violent lover and wants a new start. Their first encounter was nothing out of the ordinary but you just knew that the seed had been planted and that they just had to become more. I was curious as to how the author would make it his own and not just the same old story about a bad boy and the girl who wants to win his heart. And when I got to about the 60% mark, THAT is when the book took a particularly wild twist and right then and there I just knew this one would become another favorite of mine.With the addition of familiar members of the Selected Sinners as a very unexpected surprise and a smart-mouthed and crazy fellow artist in Stevie, this book, again, kept me glued to my e-reader. I did not know how it would all play out since secrets revealed throughout this journey were some of the most unusual I've ever read. Yet it all fit together so perfectly. The author has developed such a unique style for giving us a tale that is full of heart while at the same time is never, ever sappy. The right mix of soul and bravado. Heartache and hope. Tough and tender. The best recipe for a happy reader.If you are looking for a book that can combine humor, passion, heartache and love flawlessly, then this one is for you. As a matter of fact, if this is your first from the author, you'll want to read about those Sinners who pay our couple a visit and their own quests for happiness. All standalones and all just as wonderful.Another job well done.5 solid stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23IGHFJ59W1MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N930YA#wasThisHelpful","R23IGHFJ59W1MR","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not having read any of the prior books in this series, I dove head-first into Beneath These Scars and let me just say that I am so happy I did. What a gem. I honestly did not know what to expect but the author masterfully guided me through this less than perfect love story and never did I feel deprived or lost at not knowing the history behind these characters and their close-knit crew. I will admit I'm mad at myself for not discovering this series earlier but now that I have, I can guarantee I will be reading the rest asap!Not wanting to give anything away and who exactly this book is about for those who have read the prior books, all I will say is that I desperately wanted to hurt the 'hero'. Talk about a supreme alpha to the millionth degree. OMG this man was nothing but rude and demanding and stubborn as all hell. Happily though, the heroine is just as stubborn and demanding and even a bit rude. She may be the only woman to be able to tame him. Talk about a match made in heaven! These two bring out both the best and worst in each other without even trying. Their extremely sexy trysts, wild yelling matches and stolen tender moments make this ride one worth taking.The secondary characters add just the right touch and never take away from the our couple or the story-line. With the added bit of mystery surrounding the heroine and her past coming back to bite her, this book truly has it all.It is a well-written and completely satisfying read that I highly recommend.A solid 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217COQEHBL27A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NAUJNE#wasThisHelpful","R217COQEHBL27A","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I literally just finished Anchor and holy hell did Mo Mabie nail it. Like completely knocked it out of the park brilliance. It is THAT good.If you've read Bait and Sail, you already know the how tough of a journey Blake and Casey have had to endure trying so desperately to get their happily ever after. It was almost torture at times having to read the missed chances, the times apart, the wrong decisions each of them made through the years since they first laid eyes upon each other. And then we had to witness the brutal encounter at the end of Sail that almost felt like the ultimate demise of this love story.Starting right up where Sail left off, we are treated to one of THE best conclusions to a trilogy ever. Not knowing what the world still had in store for our lovers, the author masterfully leads us through their star-crossed paths beautifully. Hoping for the best, wanting for Blake to survive her attack, there is no foregone conclusion here. I was on the edge of my chair not knowing how it would all play out. But my goodness, the absolute devotion Casey has for his honeybee stole my breath away. He continued to stand by her side no matter what and was gratefully rewarded with a love that he dared only let himself dream about.The book is written in alternating POV's, which is favorite style of mine, with some thrown in by both Audrey and a possible beau I won't reveal here. Surely something is brewing there and the author gave us a glimpse of what she might have in store for those two in the future. Both Casey and Blake share their deepest thoughts, their lustful dreams and all the joy that each of them give to the other. Getting to witness firsthand how their love continues to bloom was pure bliss. Not only are they extremely passionate about one another, they truly like each other. The author puts us smack dab in the middle of their lives and you can't help but want to stay there indefinitely.This well-written, sublimely delightful book kept my heart captive and I even shed a tear or two towards the end. If ever there was a couple who deserved true happiness, it is Blake and Casey. Maybe the way they went about things was not always the most honorable but you can't deny for even a second that they were meant to be. She truly is the Betty to his Lou.You must read Bait and Sail first, in order to fully understand Anchor. It is a series worth reading.

"It truly saddens me that I can't give this book more than 2 stars but honestly it was all over the place. I was anxious to read book 3 since book 1 and 2 had plenty of mystery and angst and I was hopeful that I'd get the closure I needed and the HEA I wanted for Joshua and Natasha.  But instead there are still way too many unanswered questions, inconsistencies throughout, simply silly scenes (toasting the day she would have gotten her period??? I know he was grieving, but c'mon) and everyone constantly yelling or crying non-stop.Although I'm happy that ultimately it turned out ok, it just took too long and I found myself skimming pages. The fact that there will be more in the series does not even remotely interest me. I feel let down and just can't read anymore. Adrian was a bright spot for me and I do hope his book with Nicholas is worthwhile. But I probably will never know.I know i'm probably going to be in the minority but having differences of opinion is what makes the world go 'round.

"Fade to Red is one phenomenal read. Willow Aster proves yet again how masterful her mad writing skills are at creating a story-line like no other. She continues to give us books that not only entertain but make you think. To me that is THE perfect combination and I was riveted literally from chapter 1!The story follows Roxie Taylor and her hope to be a dancer with Beckham Woods and his upcoming tour. Beckham is a rock god, one who Roxie would rather not have to see ever again, but feels it is her time to try to make something of a career for herself and her adorable son Leo. Upon seeing Roxie, Beckham immediately feels a connection but she'll be damned if she'll ever get involved with him. Even though it is more than obvious that these two were meant to be. You can feel it from the very first interactions, even though Roxie is nothing but cold and hard on her boss. However, there are some very sexy rehearsals that showcase the chemistry surrounding Roxie and Beckham which further prove how perfect they could be together. They seem to have this connection both past and present, and it is with much determination and growing affection that Beckham will stop at nothing to find out what the tether might be, that is strung between both their hearts.But what gives this book that extra pop is that beneath this budding romance is a bit of a mystery. There are chapters written in a woman's POV. Someone who is hell bent on having Beckham for her very own and is obsessively determined to make that a reality. However, it is clear that this mysterious woman is suffering from wild delusion. As the book progresses, you begin to feel that dread that something horrible is going to happen and you start to play a waiting game for when that shoe will drop. The love story between Beckham and Roxie provides the perfect distraction from what most certainly is going to happen at some point down the road.As an added bonus, Ian Sterling and his gorgeous little family, (from the wonderful True Love Story), play a major role in this book. Watching him be truly happy after such a long road to get the life he so desperately wanted, certainly was the cherry on top for me. Ian and Beckham start a tour together, become good friends and along with their bands, extended families and entourages, a genuine camaraderie is formed that was a pleasure to witness. There is no mistaking that this is Beckham and Roxie's book but the author flawlessly combines their journey with Ian's to give us one helluva great ride.I literally want to shout from the rooftops how much I loved Fade to Red. The myriad of emotions I felt while reading this book left me breathless. Then upon the conclusion I had my hand to my mouth to muffle the loud gasp that demonstrated my surprise at where the author left us. Although it is a standalone I wouldn't mind just a bit more at some point. This is one story with supremely wonderful characters that you just don't want to end. My heart was in my throat more than once and I couldn't put my e-reader down.This is a well-written, original and absolutely incredible book. One that will definitely be at the top of my reads for 2015!A huge 5++++ stars for a job extremely well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PP2Z2T5CBWKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M67OF0#wasThisHelpful","R3PP2Z2T5CBWKZ","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a debut, this book was quite good. Not rifled with editing mistakes, I found myself drawn to this simple love story of two souls defined by loss.Auden and Aleksandr, both having lost their parents at a young age, are trying to live their lives not completely caught up in grief. Auden, with the help of her grandfather, becomes a translator for the Russian hockey star that is Aleksandr and so begins a delicate dance between the two. Not sure if they should try to be together, and cross that line, they start a friendly relationship that is both witty and playful. Feelings start to change and with it comes jealousy and the constant fear of abandonment that has plagued Auden her whole life.Although these two certainly could have a chance, the chemistry just felt a bit too bland at times. I was convinced they belonged together but I just wanted a bit more angst, a bit more passion and to ignite the flame that each held deep beneath their pain. They had time apart and we didn't get enough of what they were going through while separated. I felt the author could've given us a bit more into the longing and the desire that both Aleksandr and Auden had for each other instead of just relaying that yes they called and skyped but we never were witness to any of it.The storyline needs a bit more substance but overall it was an enjoyable read. It just didn't blow me away or anything. I would read more from this author and hopefully some of the more colorful secondary characters will get their stories told as well.A solid 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJZDKGZHWYPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RK7O6#wasThisHelpful","R1DJZDKGZHWYPJ","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for ""One Night with Harrison"" by Heidi McLaughlinYou know, I've always wanted the beginning, the 'backstory' if you will, of how Harrison ended up with a baby he didn't even know about. Well my questions have been answered in this very sexy short.What I loved most was getting inside Harrison's head again and remembering just how wonderful a character he is. The author gave him heart. He knows what he wants, but as a newer band on the LA scene, he and the other members of 4225 West have to go along for the ride at their manager's discretion. But it was really sweet hearing the kind of woman Harrison wanted and from the start of this short, I truly thought that Alicia could have been more for him. He liked the more natural type. Not the typical made-up plastic looking groupies. But with an unfortunate small series of misunderstandings, Harrison certainly got more than he bargained for, he just didn't know it yet.This certainly has me wanting to reread My Unexpected Forever and for those who might be new to the author's work, this is a great place to start! Harrison James is a warm and very loving character who is well worth your time.Now off to read more of this wonderful collection. There are some great authors all together in one place. Such a treat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I6OSCTRUSBPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141KWDK4#wasThisHelpful","R1I6OSCTRUSBPA","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whoa...what a roller-coaster ride full of emotion. Thick Love is one incredible journey through the lives of two broken souls, who manage to find the good again. The right to feel and the desire to love. Yet also find that just wanting to heal is sometimes the hardest part of all.My very first Eden Butler book. And what a beginning this is. I was completely enthralled by not only this difficult love story but by the extended use of all things New Orleans. Aly King and her frequent use of Haitian Creole made me fall hard for this heroine. Her tenacity to survive on her own, her ability to be a bad arse and the determination to create a life for herself was such a joy to read. I was rooting for her from the very first pages and knew that just needed a man just as headstrong. When a'chance encounter' with the man she has been longing for, in the form of one Ransom Riley-Hale, creates such chemistry between the two, I knew then and there this would be a pairing of epic proportions. But it's a connection that is both frightening and fierce and never, ever easy. One that not only had Aly and Ransom tied up in knots but had me just as angst-ridden.The beautiful family that has been given a second chance, that was first introduced in Thin Love (a book I now NEED to read) is ever-present. It's Ransom's parents that provide the family and the intimacy Aly has been craving in her life. I loved that both Kona and Keira and their energetic son Koa were both encouraging and honest about a possible relationship between their troubled son and Aly. With Ransom dealing with an emotional pain that he couldn't shake, they were always there to offer loving kick in the pants he often needed to forge ahead in his life. And with Aly, they seemed to know that perhaps, she could be the one to finally get through to him, when nothing and no one could.I tell you, this very intricate tale had my heart in my throat more than once. Just when I thought things were finally going smoothly, foolish words would again be spoken and our couple would have to start all over again, gaining the respect and trust they didn't hand out so readily once more. Neither Aly nor Ransom made it easy on themselves. And we are right there as they muddle through the difficult waters they can't seem to conquer.Then I was left at a standstill as the epilogue once again threw me for a loop and I'm here sitting and wondering how on earth these two could possibly mess it all up yet again?!! AND I have to wait until 2016 to find out if Aly and Ransom can actually get their acts together.A well-written, very detailed read that I thoroughly enjoyed. I never found it too wordy or too descriptive. This is an author who wants to spread her love of New Orleans and takes the time to allow the reader to absorb all the little nuances and details that make this story stand out. I feel as if I learned a ton about a region that is still very foreign to me.Well done and I can't wait to read the conclusion!Worth your time. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RZ01PQHD0WQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147IA3RK#wasThisHelpful","R1RZ01PQHD0WQX","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am at a loss for words at just how magnificent a book Restless Waters is. I never thought anything could come close to Left Drowning, a book that tore me apart and then somehow miraculously put me back together. We all wanted Sabin's story, the man who both broke and stole our hearts in LD. The man who we all wanted to save, to hug and to treasure. And I'll be damned. Jessica Park gave all of us the journey we craved and did it brilliantly.Written in Blythe's POV, we catch up with the McGuire/Shephard crew and soak up all the happiness this extended family has finally come to embrace. There are the boisterous arguments, the loud commentary and the wild meals that only this bunch can experience. A wonderful summer in Maine before everyone scatters and goes back to school and to their 'real' lives. Sabin, much to Blythe's joy, is staying on with she and Chris, having seemingly trumped his demons and gotten in the best shape of his life. Although the house will be empty, knowing her best friend will be there, makes everything perfect in Blythe's eyes. However, nothing is forever and when Sabin moves to San Diego, the calm that Blythe and Chris try to so hard to cherish, is most certainly the warning of the storm to come.To be witness to the whirlwind, the deep-seeded pain that Sabin continues to endure almost broke me. The bond that Blythe has, her sixth sense that something is amiss with her friend, kept me glued to my e-reader. Even though I didn't want to watch as past pain continued to hold Sabin down, I couldn't help but forge on and swallow the intensity of this story. I knew more secrets would be revealed. More guilt. More hurt feelings. But it is so well-written and so masterfully presented, you just can't help but be enamored by these characters. They become a part of you and for the time that this book sits in your hands, you are grateful you are lucky enough to read it.Never did I imagine a story could stay with me as long as Left Drowning did. And now with Restless Waters, I know the same will happen. Despite all the sadness, there is so much hope. And not just a silly dismissive hope that everything will turn out ok. These Shephard siblings have gone through hell and back and are still standing. The hope for them is a real one. One that they found in the form of Blythe. And even James. Two damaged siblings in their own way that were sent to rescue a family that at times didn't feel worthy of saving. The meant to be factor was never more present than in this book and I found myself smiling and literally gasping at the sweet memories shared.What I loved was the this story could be both raw and tender at the same time. The bond between Blythe and Chris was never stronger and their passion was evident through two very sexy scenes that were gorgeously written. The devastating misunderstandings between Blythe and Sabin were almost hard to read but the deep love these two have for each other never faltered, when it could've so easily. You can't help but be envious of what these two have and the utter glee Chris so selflessly has for them left me teary-eyed at times. Even though this was Sabin's story, Chris was a standout in his ever-present position of protector. I fell hard again for that man, right along with Blythe. He is an outstanding character that they are all lucky to have.I know I rambled on a bit too long but I will just leave you all with this: if you want a book that will make you feel, that will fill you with hope and a whole lot of love, then take the time and read Restless Waters. Savor every word, just like I did, and embrace the joy of reading such perfection. I encourage to start with Left Drowning, if you haven't already and get the whole story. I'm telling you, you'll never forget it.A huge 5+++ stars for a job well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4WNZD0OWC95V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014J9OJ2C#wasThisHelpful","R4WNZD0OWC95V","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sharla Lovelace knows how to write a great second chance romance and with Loving the Chase, she does not fail to deliver.The story about Zach and Maddi, separated for 7 years because of a devastating event that made her leave and never wanted to look back. Now they are face to face again and the love never died. The passion is still in both their eyes and the chemistry literally burned up my ereader in each and every scene. You can feel the desperation from both of them whenever they are in the same room together. OMG the longing is so evident, it's enough to want to dive into the pages of this story and make them see reason. Thankfully Zach's close-knit family did the job for me.Zach and his family are storm-chasers and if you happen to be lucky enough to love one of them, constant worry is a part of your life forever. What drove Maddi away the first time has come back to rear it's ugly head once again but this time she is determined not to fall back into Zach's arms. She is in the small town of Cody to do a job: be a part of the crew that want to make a reality show about the Chase family and their many exciting adventures. But with the love of her life present at every turn, it's a wonder if Maddi and her heart will once again survive.This book is beautifully written and I was thoroughly riveted from the very first words. Second chance romance is my favorite and watching Zach and Maddi pine for each other, tiptoeing around their actions, their words, made my own stomach do flips. The very passionate scene in the rain was both heartbreaking and joyful. Their journey is never an easy one but with the help of a wonderful group of secondary characters, mostly family members from both sides, there is hope these two will find their way back to each other. I am thrilled there will be more in the series since there are many loose ends and blossoming relationships that I need more of.A wonderful way to end the summer. Highly recommended.5 solid stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZTH544GR8CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKQD1EC#wasThisHelpful","R2NZTH544GR8CV","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scott Hildreth continues to up the ante with each new book in the Selected Sinners series. Each one a story unlike the last and a chance to get to know every member of the MC up close and personal. With Ex-Con, he has really gone the distance and written much more than I ever expected. He has put his heart and soul into every word and it shows.What is so special about this book is that it truly is Jackson Shephard's story. The first 60% or so is set in 2006 and we get to watch the blossoming romance between Jackson and Emily. His dominant side becoming evident and her decision to happily submit. They truly are perfect for each other and seem to live the idyllic life for as long as possible.  However, an unfortunate and underhanded event occurs that threatens to separate them and it's from that moment on to the end of the book that we get into the very core of Jackson's soul. His courage, his strength, his determination to save the ones he loves all the while existing in a world that most could never handle made me fall for the man completely. As much as the other members have taken a piece of my heart along the way, Jackson epitomizes the very nature of what it means to have integrity and a love so deep that his selflessness is at times both joyful and painful to witness.It is a beautifully written book that I wish were double in length! That is how much I adored it. A truly tough journey for a man who never broke his promise to the woman he loves and for the author who gave his all and more. A rare combination indeed. And might I add the intimate scenes between Jackson and Em were unbelievably passionate. One in particular was wildly erotic that I completely forgot my surroundings while reading and literally needed a cold drink afterwards. Talk about powerful!!Ex-Con is a deeply moving story that I will treasure for a long time to come. Scott Hildreth has certainly become a go-to author for me. I'm hopeful he will for you as well.Well worth your time.5++++ stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKZQSE8SU0OGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ZVSA16#wasThisHelpful","RKZQSE8SU0OGF","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've only read Sketchy Love by Lila Felix so far and I absolutely loved it! Such a wonderful story about two soulmates who find each other over and over again, only the heroine doesn't seem to remember.Fasta and Saint. Living their 'lives' through the past thousand years, trying to finally make it right and set their destiny to be together forever. Fasta has an extraordinary talent for drawing. And the boy with the green eyes who mysteriously turns up in most of her work, haunts her. Her need to constantly sketch him in hundreds of scenes to the point of exhaustion at times, is the only thing that seems to soothe her. And when Saint is suddenly the new student at her school, everything starts to fall into place.Oh my goodness. I am not usually a fan of other world kind of stories but this one had me from the very start. Lila Felix continues to surprise me with her touching and well-written tales that I might not pick up if given the choice. But I've been such a fan of many of her books that I knew I had to read this one as soon as it went live.As the story comes to a close, there is so much more I'd love to know about this star-crossed couple and I'm hopeful the author will extend their journey and give us a full-length book. Saint touched upon many different time-frames that he and Fasta were a part of and even shed a tear or two for those times when they couldn't be together. I'd love a bit more of both their past and their promised future.Well done and now I'm thrilled to read the rest of this wonderful boxed set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2118NQJ3P9DFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZDIPSI#wasThisHelpful","R2118NQJ3P9DFQ","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I should have known Cassia Leo wouldn't let me down. The Way We Rise, book 3 and the conclusion to Houston and Rory's story, was the absolute perfect way to finish this series. I have to admit I was put through the wringer with these two more than once throughout their difficult journey. Houston and Rory have faced so many bumps, so many detours, could they truly find their way back to each other? I had to put my complete faith in the author and let's just say at times that didn't seem to be enough.What I loved most about this book was the continuing deep development of the characters. We get to watch as Houston, Rory, Kenny, Ava, Patricia, James and even Skippy(!) move ahead with their lives, despite all the tragedy and disappointment that has befallen them. With the thread of Hallie both holding them together and still sometimes keeping them apart, it was almost as if they all experienced a rebirth of sorts. Demons start to be exorcised and truths start the healing process for all of them. The horrific scene that ended The Way We Break is the starting point for this book, and it is almost a miracle that Houston and Rory even have a chance anymore. But the author masterfully lets her characters take their time and thoughtfully figure out exactly what they want. Gone somewhat is the rush to judgement that had befallen them before which was a true joy to see.The love that started with an 11 year-old having a crush on her best friend's brother, has seen more ups and downs then was ever thought possible. But the deep-seeded affection between Houston and Rory never wavers. I found myself smiling more than I thought and oh my goodness, laughing out loud at one of the best epilogues I've ever read. These characters seem to find the right direction this time around yet only time will tell if it will all pay off in the end. Being kept guessing is never a bad thing in my opinion. It just makes you want to keep going until the very last words are read.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the entire series. It is a love story that will break your heart more than once, give you some heartwarming moments and keep you riveted from beginning to end.Highly recommended and a solid 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RMWH3Z85A4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514849712#wasThisHelpful","R28RMWH3Z85A4P","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This well-written book is a good old-fashioned slow burn of a love story. Two people, meeting by accident on the island of Oahu, and not wanting to ignore the feeling that makes both want to spend more time together.Sienna, a very driven young woman, who can't seem to look beyond the fact that she is making a ton of money at a job that most would covet. It's her 'dream' position yet she has time for nothing else. Luke, who is a free-spirited adrenaline junkie, who gave up a very lucrative future for one more laid-back and free. On paper, these two couldn't be more opposite yet deep down in their hearts, they seem to fit together perfectly. Two souls who both battle some inner demons yet together learn the art of letting go.I always enjoy JA Redmerski's writing. It is fluid and deliberate and full of emotion. With The Moment of Letting Go, I was thrust into the storyline immediately and was witness to the budding romance between Sienna and Luke within the first chapter. There isn't much filler, which I enjoy, yet there was still something missing for me. Perhaps I needed a bit  more angst. A bit more of what was going on in Luke's head since his past held the key to whether or not they would make it as a couple. The book is told in alternating POV's , which I enjoy but maybe a little more detail would have made it a 5 star book for me. There just wasn't that 'pop' I expect when reading this authors books.It's a good beach read since you'll want to be on one as the descriptions of Oahu and Kauai fill your senses. Overall it's a beautiful little love story with likable characters and a bit of steam.3.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QCKKN9TVKAHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU3RNBW#wasThisHelpful","R2QCKKN9TVKAHQ","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Chasing River. A book that not only transported me to the beautiful country of Ireland, but convinced me I'd never want to leave. K.A. Tucker absolutely captivated my heart and soul with this book. We get the stunning descriptions of a land I am anxious to discover and a love story that I couldn't get enough of.Amber Welles and River Delaney are two people so very different yet somehow are the perfect match. River saving Amber's life was certainly the most unusual start to her European trip, yet that wasn't the most shocking part of her journey through the Emerald Isle. As much as these two belong together, since their chemistry is downright intoxicating, and the pure joy in their eyes whenever each is nearby is simply blissful, secrets held by River threaten to destroy the very happiness each has finally found.The story-line is simply exquisite. We have a gorgeous love story with Amber only in Ireland for a week, falling for a pub owner who she suddenly can't be without. And underneath is a tale about the Delaney family history, some noble, some criminal. The way the author combines the two is genius. With each new book in this Burying Water series, I can't help but praise K.A. Tucker's writing and watch as it again reaches yet another level.Some great surprises in the form of Ivy, the tough tattoo artist, who shared some painful years in High School with Amber and a visit by daddy Gabe,the retired sheriff, gave this book some great highlights. In addition, Rowen Delaney provided some much needed comic relief when moments felt too heavy.I am truly and unequivocally in love with this book. Talk about the feels. I've got them tenfold and still don't want to let go.I can't recommend this book highly enough. I have loved all the author's work but this one now has a special place in my heart.

"Blown away. Again. At a loss for words at just how magnificent this latest gem from Aly Martinez truly is. It is such an extreme pleasure to witness how her writing continues to raise the bar every single time.This latest in the On the Ropes series is about Flint. Middle Page brother, the one who was destined for not only greatness in the ring but in the classroom as well. But then, fate intervened and using his body as a shield for his brother Till's wife, who also happened to be the woman of his dreams, everything came crashing down. The hopes, the life Flint saw for himself was now nothing more than just a memory. His life would now proceed from the confines of a wheelchair.We now watch as Flint tries to not only make a new path for himself but figure out how to deal with the feelings he has for Eliza Page. The woman who not only stole Till's heart but managed to crawl inside of his own, when she found her way into their lonely lives. But an unexpected force in the form of one Ash Mabie, a newly-found comrade for youngest brother Quarry, manages to turn Flint's world upside-down. He fights any sort of feelings for this whirlwind of a woman but somehow she seeps into his soul and captures his heart. The heart he had thought was promised to another but with time realizes that he was simply waiting for the right woman to claim it.To say this is a beautiful read is an understatement. As with every one of Aly Martinez’s books, her words are equally touching as they are funny; as heartbreaking as they are heartwarming. There are so many layers to this story. This isn’t just Flint’s journey. Through alternating POV’s we also get inside Ash’s head and see firsthand the deplorable life she has had to endure at the hands of her slimy father Ray; the man who is also ‘married’ to Flint’s mother. The mother that abandoned her sons for her next fix and anyway she could get it. Although Ash is one incredible heroine and her wicked humor kept me smiling, together she and Flint are two broken people. And yet through Ash and her hopeful and caring ways, both she and Flint forge a bond that is as unexpected as it is fated.There are many twists and turns to this story and just when you think it’s nearing its end, there is surprisingly more and you realize just how happy you are at that notion. The secondary characters from previous books are all there in support of our man Flint. It is the character of Eliza, however, who almost steals the spotlight. The way she cares for Flint and serves as the glue that keeps the Page family together was simply incredible. Her selflessness and true love for her Page men and the women they adore was admirable. She embraces Ash even when there are hostile feelings at the surface and is the one to help smooth things even after a painful separation.Overall this is a book about second chances. About the will to change and the faith that love can truly conquer all. It is a love story that isn’t an easy one yet with some much needed humor and honesty; we are treated to one that won’t soon leave our thoughts.A huge 5+++ stars with huge anticipation for Quarry’s story next. I simply can’t get enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3MLPOJNE48Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGSIJ5O#wasThisHelpful","RJ3MLPOJNE48Z","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Follow Me Back, the sequel to the journey started in Lead Me Not, brought me to my knees. This well-written conclusion to Aubrey and Maxx's story had my stomach in knots throughout most of it. The way the author masterfully describes the seemingly never-ending struggles for Maxx to stay clean and off drugs and Aubrey's indecision in whether her man is worth more pain broke me. I was completely mesmerized by the hurt, the torment each of them had to endure to try and salvage not only their relationship but their sanity as well. Although it was Maxx who had the clear voice of reason more often than Aubrey, both needed to find that point where trust would be a given instead of a question.I felt as if every step backward, every doubt, although hard to digest at times, was perfectly relayed with respect to our couple. This was not the easy conclusion where boy and girl see each other and everything turns out ok. On the contrary. Both Maxx and Aubrey had to keep going through parts of hell to even start to find the heaven they both craved.My heart was in my throat more often than not, yet I couldn't wait to keep turning the pages to see how this tumultuous ride would end. The author did not disappoint and I've come to relish her way of giving us touching yet often difficult reads. These are not sugar-coated tales. These are as real as they come and well worth every bit of angst.Highly recommended and a huge 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HA2M4P27LPFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42X2UO#wasThisHelpful","R1HA2M4P27LPFN","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Powerful is the word that comes to mind after reading Lead Me Not. The author takes a truly difficult subject matter in drug abuse and gives it a story. One that is not only heartbreaking but is full of hope as well.This compelling and almost tragic love story between Aubrey and Maxx held me captive. As much as I struggled through Maxx's bouts with being high and the horrific aftermath, I couldn't help but want more. Watching as Aubrey tries her hardest to get through to the talented, yet tortured Maxx was at times brutal. I wanted so much for them to make it. The deep love each has for each other proves once again that sometimes forces not welcome can overcome even the purest of emotions. Maxx's need for his little white pills gave him a freedom he couldn't get elsewhere. Yet Aubrey didn't want to give up on him. She battled her own demons and guilty memories trying to save Maxx from the dark path he traveled.I applaud the author for again tackling something as horrible as drug abuse with the dignity and compassion others often toss aside. Those who suffer deserve a second chance in my opinion, even those who continue to hurt others, like Maxx. I felt so deeply for his character and wanted Aubrey to be his light. But we are left wondering if the damage has been done and if it is too late for these two. As I venture into Follow Me Back, I'm hopeful I get a satisfying conclusion.A wonderfully written book that I highly recommend. It's not all hearts and flowers but you will find yourself compelled to devour every word.

"This is a delightful book!! Elle Riley, a successful woman, torn between two men, one from her past and one she currently works with. Both men love her. Both men want her. But does Elle know what she wants?Our heroine has worked hard to be where she is today: the creator of a wildly popular TV series based on her books. The story-line of her books is a loose translation of her turbulent love affair with one Troy Saladino. After a heartbreaking separation 10 years prior, Elle unexpectedly sees him again. Some of the old feelings are still there but that trepidation in being able to commit fully to this man, her college best friend, still haunt her.And to complicate matters of her heart even more, Elle has recently started seeing Luke Kingston, a new actor on her show. With Luke, she isn't caught up in old memories or hurt egos. It's a fresh start for her and he simply makes her feel wonderful. He sees Elle for who she is and allows her to just be herself.With two men vying for her affection, it's all Elle can do to be able to do her job! With the addition of a great bestie in Whitney and other members of the TV show, this is one complicated ride. And although I understood why she ultimately chose who she chose, I wasn't 100 percent sure that was the right choice for my tastes. Both Troy and Luke were swoonworthy in their own ways and Elle couldn't have gone wrong either way in my opinion. Each man cared for her enough that I don't think she would have made a wrong decision with either of them. However, the back and forth between them left me a bit frustrated at times, and yet I realize that perhaps it had to be that way to get the story across in the way the author intended.Overall, though, it was a joyful read that I enjoyed.4 solid stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDRS1EG11VJO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1LFGI6#wasThisHelpful","RDRS1EG11VJO2","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just when I thought I had Lauren Blakely and her books figured out, she goes and ups her writing to yet another level. With Sweet Sinful Nights, yes we get the naughty hero. Yes we get the out-of-control, off-the-charts, hot sex. And yes we get the touching reunion of two lovers who find themselves face-to-face after 10 years, and the heartbreaking journey to find their way back to one another. But what I didn't expect was the mystery story-line beneath the love story. And that is what made this book so flipping exquisite.Brent and Shannon. Oh my, what a couple. The way they see each other for the first time after so much time apart was perfectly written. From the look on Brent’s face to the satisfaction on Shannon’s, I was as mesmerized as they were. Their love had never really died for either of them and now that they will find themselves working together, it’s anyone’s guess whether those not-quite extinguished sparks can fan that flame once again.The pure electricity, the fiery need that both Brent and Shannon emit, literally had my e-reader smoking. Again. But this is Lauren Blakely we’re talking about. She takes no prisoners and almost has me blushing at least once while reading her books. She doesn’t hold back and the sex never disappoints. Brent and Shannon have some of THE most panty-melting scenes ever written and yet it leaves me wanting more. That my friends is the gift of a truly talented writer.But what I always enjoy most and I’ve used it as my tag-line for these books I adore, is that Lauren Blakely writes sex with heart. That although I know that these two will get down and dirty and often, underneath it all is the pure love and affection her characters feel for one another. Brent has always wanted to protect his girl and now that she is a grown-up woman, he continues to want to not only be by her side, but is willing to risk it all to stay hers. Permanently.A long ago crime that is still as mysterious as it was when it occurred manages to stay in the picture just as our couple is finding their way back to each other. With past hurts now out in the open, both Brent and Shannon fight hard to move forward even with this horrific event still hanging over Shannon’s head.Watching Brent offer not only his love but his full-fledged support no matter what the end result had me swooning yet again over a Nichols man. Oh and a guest-appearance by brother Clay had my ovaries obliterated once more. Having both side by side is one heady combination!What I leave you all is with this: if you want a sexy, passionate yet extremely touching read, then Sweet Sinful Nights is for you. I can’t recommend this book highly enough. The author’s books are like crack for me: addicting yet completely heartwarming at the same time. This is a standalone but the next book in the series will continue an aspect of Shannon’s story with her brother Ryan taking the lead this time.A huge 5+ stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFJSC62NXZXM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTTHBQ2#wasThisHelpful","RFJSC62NXZXM7","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally got to reading this book, known as a complete and utter mindf**k by everyone I know! And it was and so much more.I'm honestly sitting here wondering if I should like this book or simply hate it. It evokes such strong emotion to the point where I felt completely dirty upon completion. Throughout actually. Yet the writing is so good, you can't help but want to continue.This very intriguing look into the relationship between captor and captive was executed brilliantly. Both Caleb and Lizzie are well-written characters. I didn't want to embrace Caleb but right along with Lizzie, I started to fall for the man behind the criminal. Their relationship is not one to covet yet I couldn't help but enjoy how Caleb did in fact care for Lizzie when he shouldn't. And actually felt happy when they connected.The brutality depicted in this book is not for the faint of heart. Not only the conditions Lizzie is forced to live with but the acts of violence and torture of a particular biker gang was not pleasant to experience.I will definitely continue on with book 2 and the epilogue since this story has gotten under my skin much in the same way Lizzie got beneath Caleb's.I'm glad I finally took the plunge. Well worth my time and yours.

"I was very intrigued by the premise of this book but sadly it did not meet my expectations.I completely understand the need to experiment in one's marriage. I have no issue with that. What bothered me was that Gabe and Mirella have a very happy and satisfying marriage, yet jumped into this 'arrangement' with Weston and Bridget way too quickly. Clearly there should have been more angst about what they were embarking upon. We don't get Gabe's side of the story, his times with Bridget and I think that was needed. To have each relationship juxtaposed against one another would have been enlightening.There was blatant disregard for Mirella's family for the most part and I felt that some parts were rushed. Times at home for Gabe and Mirella were few and far between and I thought this book would be more about them as a couple exploring new things, not one woman falling for her secret lover.I guess I wanted more explanation as to how each of the main characters were all feeling about this arrangement. It is truly Mirella's story in the end and I'm not sure how much more can be written with 2 more books in the pipeline. I mean she either stays with her husband or she doesn't. They all continue or they don't.I can't say I hated this book but I surely didn't love it either. It truly was just ok for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLKBNKZBVHFDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGZNEQQ#wasThisHelpful","RLKBNKZBVHFDC","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Piqued is one great steamy read. But even better is that this well-written novella also features two main characters that have heart.When Claire has the opportunity to redesign a room in a private club, little did she know what kind of club she would be encountering. Even more surprising is that Hall, the man who has yet to pay her for redoing his office space, is a member!Through some not-so-coincidental meetings, Hall convinces Claire to not only join him at The Club so she can see first-hand what needs to be done, but to be his special guest.Oh wow. I have to say that watching as Claire transform from the quiet designer into a woman who wants to be controlled was amazing. The author lets her heroine break free of what she thinks she should be and transforms her into the woman who now firmly knows who she can be.With Hall by her side, this sexual awakening is off the charts hot! The chemistry between the two is explosive and wildly erotic. In addition, there is a real sense of budding commitment between the two and both Claire and Hall truly care about one another.This is a wonderful read that I thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend highly!A very solid and sexy 4.5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WCP4IK9PMZV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106E46A4#wasThisHelpful","R1WCP4IK9PMZV4","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michelle Valentine certainly has a flair for writing extremely sexy rockers who have heart. And I am happy to report that Wicked White is no exception.This simple yet really lovely story about Ace White and Iris Easton warmed my heart. Ace is on the run, leaving behind a rock and roll life now out of control. When he finds a sleepy town in Ohio and a beautiful trailer park owner in Iris, sparks ignite and any plans to lay low and stay a loner are now obliterated. One look at the feisty Iris and Ace is hooked.Their romance is not any easy one and the author effortlessly provides just the right amount of heat combined with angst to make Ace and Iris's time together worth reading.Both characters are extremely likable and Ace is truly as swoonworthy as they come. His sexy as hell pillow talk in the form of Shakespeare quotes had me melting right along with Iris. They each have past issues that could have kept them apart but in fact it might just be what brought them together.There are some secondary characters that add that perfect touch and the overall music theme is one that I wholeheartedly enjoy.Overall this is a joyful read that I liked immensely. I look forward to more in this series.A solid 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OYUZE1KR491Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STR28PQ#wasThisHelpful","R2OYUZE1KR491Q","A1K8IDNOJ69AE1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K8IDNOJ69AE1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading dozens of apocalyptic stories over the past few years, I’ve come to see that the end of the world is the perfect landscape to really and truly see our humanity. When all that we typically identify with is gone and stripped away, who are we and what does that make us? It is powerful and the best stories take those questions and pose them right up front, I believe.That’s what many of the stories in the new anthology “Tails of the Apocalypse,” do and do well. We get a glimpse at a future that is often dire and dystopian, but the collected authors add a twist -- animals. Often pets, but not always, these animals show humanity in a different light as the end of the world takes its shape.Each of the stories has a genuine love and care for the animal featured -- from dogs to cats and even birds. I found myself on more than one occasion rooting for the four-legged and winged friends even above some of the humans who inhabited the pages of the book.The collection stemmed from the success of Chris Pourteau’s Walking Dead-meets-Lassie story “Unconditional” earlier this year. I’d read that story loved it then and found it to be a perfect ending to this collection. I feel I can’t complete this review without saying I’m not a dog person. I do have a dog -- a high-maintenance rat terrier named Louie -- but my heart will always be with my cats, most notably our black cat Ellie who died a few months ago. So when I read “The Poetry of Santiago,” I was truly moved by Jennifer Ellis’ touching story of a man and the cat who loved him.I truly found each story engaging and captivating, but I loved the angles the different authors took from the desert-apocalypse of “The Water Finder’s Shadow” by David Bruns to the wolf pup who tracks down the only person to ever be nice in “Protector” by Stefan Bolz and a return to his Old Man saga in Nick Cole’s “Tomorrow Found.”I look forward to re-reading this collection down the road and to rediscovering the amazing stories Pourteau and crew included in these pages. I received an advanced reader copy, but was under no compulsion to give the book a favorable review. If you enjoy stories of the apocalypse and have a soft spot for the creatures we share this planet with, this anthology is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21OFY09ZIMIDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0996662812#wasThisHelpful","R21OFY09ZIMIDW","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just watch -- Ernie Luis will be a name to remember. After reading a short story of his from The Time Travel Chronicles, curated by Samuel Peralta -- The Time Travel Chronicles (The Future Chronicles) -- I was eager to delve into more scifi from Mr. Luis. Lucky for me, he just published the omnibus edition of his time travel stories, Alternate. The collection blew me away with its attention to detail and its action-packed premise. Luis has a story on his hands that will entertain any reader who is fortunate enough to pick up the book.In the beginning, we meet Grey, who is a top notch time traveling assassin working for The Watchtower. He has regrets, including the premature death of his daughter who's been gone for 10 years, and those regrets push him each day as an agent. Within the first part of the story we find out that Grey's world is not so cut and dry. There are cracks in the Watchtower's armor and Grey finds that he is part of a vast conspiracy that spans time itself. The heart of the story -- Grey and his daughter -- are balanced against the taut action scenes. I found myself on the edge of my seat as I read. In fact, once I started, I had a hard time putting the book down. Ernie Luis' writing is crisp, compelling, and forward-thinking.Well done -- I look forward to seeing what Mr. Luis has up his sleeve for the future (or the past?). I received an ARC in exchange for a review, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book and no favorable review was expected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R280LT9021GRV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178EMWQA#wasThisHelpful","R280LT9021GRV3","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Regrets.We all have them. Ultimately we have to find a way to deal with our regrets and we all have our own particular methods to accept or reject what we could have done differently in our lives. To this day, I still look back on moments in my life and ask, “what if I hadn’t done that?” or “what if I had done the other thing?”When I read time travel stories, I can’t help but think that many of them also have a firm basis in the pool of regrets. The idea that we can somehow go back and alter our past, to change the part of ourselves that we find the most offensive -- the most unlike ourselves.When I read the latest of Samuel Peralta’s Future Chronicles series -- The Time Travel Chronicles -- I found myself reliving parts of my own past. In a way, this book acted as a vehicle to my own regrets and made me reevaluate my own life.Each of the stories was engaging and intriguing, but a few in particular made me really appreciate this collection.First off, the anthology starts off with a bang with the excellent Extent by Anthony Vicino. In Vicino’s creation, the past can be altered -- as long as you don’t go back any farther than 32 seconds. Those who can use time as a tool have different and varied abilities to travel through and use time. Vicino uses those various abilities to enrich his characters and make a strong story through alternating time viewpoints where we can piece together the truth by the time the climax comes.I have been a fan of Stefan Bolz for a long time, so it would be easy for me to rave about his story, but to be honest, I really appreciated his story The Traveler. When we get time travel stories, we don’t often see the work that goes into the journey through time. Our heroine has to work for her payoff and we as the audience see the pain and growth through her eyes by the time she completes (or even begins) her journey.Daniel Arthur Smith’s Diatomic Quantum Flop is a trippy dippy tumble through time. It’s a take on time travel that puts us in the shoes of someone, no one, and everyone all at the same time. In Doctor Who, time is referred to as a big ball of wibbly-wobbly...timey-wimey... stuff. Take that and a healthy dose of psychotropic drugs and you have Smith’s story. Great stuff...I think.But I would say that probably the story that really stuck with me was Eric Wecks’ Eighty-Three. Wow. The idea that time travel exists but that you inhabit your future or past self for a limited amount of time is genius. What he does with that idea is even better. Our hero, Noah, isn’t always a great guy, but by the end of the story, I was rooting for him and cheered at times. Cheered. Out loud. I was truly happy for the great things that happened and for the route the story took. I couldn’t help loving this story and the way he took the simple bits of unknown life and made them known, but unpredictable at the same time.Once again, Peralta has put together a killer collection. I love each and every Future Chronicles anthology and eagerly await the release of the new books each month or so. I was given an advanced reader copy for an honest review, but as you can tell, the review was well-earned. I found all the stories to be well-worth the early purchase price, and definitely will stand the test of time as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8UFGDY3VEZTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016XIY2EC#wasThisHelpful","R8UFGDY3VEZTO","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the second installment of Daniel Arthur Smith's Tales From the Canyons of the Damned, we meet a few city workers below the surface. Those we take for granted in our everyday lives, but who we depend on for light, sewer, water, and the like. What happens in an apocalypse happens to everyone, include those we rarely consider and that's the theme of Sandhogs. We view the horror from the eyes of Jed, who can't believe the carnage transpiring in front of him.This one is a short read and that's my complaint. We would benefit more from more time in Jed's head, more detail of their situation, more story altogether. In the end, I imagine it'll fit in with all the other TFTCOTD stories as a small vignette of the horror taking place in and around New York but for me, the size is just a tad small.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338B0EFB1QW3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0179397WM#wasThisHelpful","R338B0EFB1QW3S","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story is simple, but the telling is spot-on with Hank Garner's short story ""Writer's Block."" We meet Stu Remington, the author of a number of best-selling books. Stu is mired in the middle of a problem many writers can relate to: Writer's Block -- that moment when you want to write, but for some reason or another, can't get past something in your own mind. As a writer, oftentimes, finding something outside my typical writing process helps.For Stu, that help comes in the form of an antique typewriter. He uses it and then watches the next day as the story he tells with it comes true. It must be his imagination right? That's where the fun comes in when Stu tries it a second and a third time. But just like with Aladdin and his magic lamp, the supernatural effects of the typewriter can't last forever. But with that power, what does Stu do with the gift he's been given?Garner weaves a story many writers and creatives can relate to and still manages to surprise us in the end.

"Oh man. Daniel Smith hooked me with his first short story in his Tales from the Canyons of the Damned series. I think there's a long way to go with the series and from what we get in part 1, I imagine Smith isn't saving the best for the last. Some great action, but a lot of questions as well.Nate is a former Army Ranger in his first corporate job at the new One World Trade Center when NYC is crippled by an EMP and a mysterious fog that seems to have enveloped the entire building.

"I'm a big fan of E.E. Giorgi's work. From Akaela to Immunity and all her short stories in between, I've quickly been drawn into her unique brand of fiction, showcasing her expertise in science as well as her ability to bring along strong storytelling elements for the ride.When I saw she had a new story in her Mayake universe -- The Gaijin Girl -- I was immediately on for the ride. This one is a slow burn, with an emotional gut punch you think you see coming, but it still blindsides you in the end anyway. The story starts out with a brilliant hook:""Sometimes I dream of flying. No wings, no engine. Just me in my white uniform, arms spread wide...""

"I read the first part of the Silverleaf Chronicles earlier in the year as part of The Dragon Chronicles (The Dragon Chronicles (The Future Chronicles) and found it to be one of the best selections in the anthology. It was interesting and got me invested in the world Vincent Trigili had created.Then, when he started putting out the next part of the story as a serial, I was in. And what a wonderful story. I appreciated Trigili's telling of the story, seeing Silverleaf's journey as the reluctant hero of our narrative. From what I've seen so far, there is so much to draw from as Trigili hopefully continues to tell tales from his Dragon Masters universe, and that is the one drawback to this story. It's a minor complaint, but I easily could have seen this story retold with hundreds of extra pages of additional story in epic fantasy fashion. But this sure to please other fans as Vincent Trigili has pared down his dragon fantasy to the necessary components. But that complaint is, like I said, minor as Trigili still delivers with his protagonists, Silverleaf and Kaylissa. What their quest is and what is eventually turns into is a great journey that leaves the reader firmly behind Silverleaf on every step of his journey.I was given each part of the serial as an advance reader copy, but no favorable review was expected.

"Over the past year, Samuel Peralta has diligently and deliberately put together a powerhouse science fiction anthology series. He's been able to attract big name authors such as Hugh Howey, Ken Liu, Seanan McGuire, Robert J. Sawyer, Jennifer Foehner Wells, and Matthew Mather among many others. But, what makes the Future Chronicles volumes great is the platform for new and emerging talent from the trenches of indie authors. While the established authors have been the cornerstone for these collections, the indie talent Sam chooses for each book is exciting and raw.Full Disclosure: I've been privileged to be in three FC anthologies so far (Alien, Z & Immortality) and have spots reserved in at least two more scheduled to run in the next six to eight months. Other than reading and loving The Future Chronicles Special Edition anthology, I have no involvement in the collection.So if the different anthologies released in the past year were all-star teams, then The Future Chronicles is a best of the best. Some of my favorite stories from collections like The Robot Chronicles, The Telepath Chronicles, The Alien Chronicles and The A.I. Chronicles appear, inviting you to rediscover them, to read them again for the first time in the context of this new collection, outside of the confines of their genre-specific collection. For some, it seems to imbue them with new meaning. When reading A.K. Meek's The Invariable Man (later expanded to a longer book) with a brand new story on one end and stories about telepaths just pages later, it almost can be read with a new and different point of view.In The Future Chronicles, we get eleven stories previously released in those first four of the Future Chronicles collections. Each of these stories is excellent and represents those anthologies wonderfully. What is an extra treat are five brand new stories from Sam Best, Susan Kaye Quinn, Deirdre Gould, Angela Cavanaugh, and Moira Katson, as well as a Foreword penned by Hugh Howey. Each is a breath of fresh air. With the general theme, you don't quite know what to expect...will these stories be about robots, telepathy, aliens, or something else entirely. I'm thrilled to say each of these could very well serve as a foundational block for an anthology of their own.While I don't want to ruin any discovery a reader will make on their own, Sam Best really rocks the beginning of the entire collection, Quinn again provides her own brand of singularity fiction with her story, Gould presents a mind-bending tale that will leave you shaking your head, Cavanaugh could give you nightmares (or are they...) for her story The Assistant and Katson threatens to leave you with tears after reading her heartbreaking story of defiance in the face of death.What's really amazing is how each of these stories works not only in the confines of their own specific genre, but also all alone and then back in the comfort of other Future Chronicles stories that may or may not be in the same vein. Peralta has crafted a juggernaut and readers are reaping the benefits. If you get the chance, read The Future Chronicles and then explore the other titles available in the Kindle Store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9UJSLHV9QBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0993983251#wasThisHelpful","R3B9UJSLHV9QBW","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Nomad, Matthew Mather tears things apart. Families, countries, economies, planets, galaxies…all get ripped apart between the covers of his latest novel. I read his earlier book from this year — Darknet — and found it frightening in a way that was almost difficult to describe. In Darknet, the threat is real, but invisible. In fact, the antagonist can strike and be gone again without you even knowing it, the only traces are digital breadcrumbs left in its wake.In Nomad, Mather does it again, creating an invisible villain — the titular astronomical anomaly — but the effects this go-around are more immediate, more violent, more physical. Instead of bank accounts and identities being torn asunder, it is the literal earth that undergoes an upheaval in Nomad.The story is fast-paced and energetic from the get-go, placing all of our characters in Rome. Some are there for pleasure, some for work, and others are trying to hide from the authorities. The latter is our young protagonist Jessica. We first meet her while she is on a tour of an Italian castle with her mother, but her story goes much deeper and gives her a rich and detailed backstory. In fact, as the story kept unfolding, we kept seeing new aspects of Jessica’s character that led to numerous “aha” moments. Mather wonderfully wove her story in the fabric of Nomad and gives us a great character we can live through in this book as well as others to come.What was great about Mather’s previous books was the scientific reality he’d grounded things in from the technological terror of Darknet to the scenarios he plays out in CyberStorm. The same is true for Nomad, with actual astronomical possibilities. In fact, the very anomaly he showcases in the book popped up in the news as a discovery in just the last few months. The terror of space really isn’t what we can see — it is what we can’t see, and Mather proves it with this book.Mather takes the reader on a wild ride, and all of it feels genuine and authentic. Our characters are real and we want them to be real and to make it in the face of overwhelming adversity. With all that can possibly go wrong, can humanity go on? What will an event like this bring out? The best, or the worst in us?As for the next books in the planned trilogy, Mather certainly has a plan for the second book with the path for our characters, but planted enough seeds along the way to make sure the reader knows the path will be rocky and difficult. I massively enjoyed this book and am very much looking forward to Sanctuary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2216B2UWQOYL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TOAL3E#wasThisHelpful","R2216B2UWQOYL9","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off…I hate Nick Cole. I hate that he can write like he can. I hate that he makes me care about his deeply flawed characters. I hate him so much I can’t help but love him just a bit.I will admit when I first opened the book, I struggled with the first few pages. Found footage in book form. Ugh. It seemed like an unnecessary plot device, but after a few pages, it settles down. Yes, there is the aspect of these recordings and journals being found and pieced together, but the stories are quite broad and involved.  As a reader I found the two main stories quite distinct and after a while I forgot they were “found footage.”In that case, it does draw comparisons to the modern-day standard in zombie fiction — World War Z. Max Brooks’ classic is well known for being a series of vignettes that are only tied together by the slimmest of threads (NOT the movie, which features Brad Pitt as a very capable thread). In this case, there is a sense of that as well, but instead of it showcasing the tales of survival (or death) at the hands (and teeth) of the zombies, Cole shows us the humanity left behind in its wake. He shows the emotions, the torment, the shame, the bitterness, the economics, the brutality, the…life that is left when the plague wipes out most of the nation. What he does better than Brooks from a narrative point of view is he uses the protagonists of Alex and Jasonn (mostly Jason) to find all of those aspects of humanity in the aftermath. Jason’s journey is one made by countless characters throughout literature, starting with Odysseus. He needs to find the love of his life, but with Alex he only has the vaguest idea of where to look. Along the way we see his faults, his fears, his failures on his trek from New York to Los Angeles.There really is so much to take in along the way, Cole could have easily tripled the size of the book with the rich details he added with developed secondary characters. Shoot, Cole could write a whole other story with just the character of Chris, or The Lady, or…any number of them.But we get Jason and Alex. Star-crossed lovers, separated by thousands of miles of land and millions of infected zombies between them. Who are they? What choices do they make? How does that affect everyone else? What does that do to their very souls?I loved Nick Cole’s book. Described as “The Walking Dead” meets “The Notebook,” I can honestly say as someone who hasn’t watched either (I know, I know!) that this book delivers. If you like a healthy dose of philosophy and romance with your zombie literature, this book is for you. I really could go on and on about what I felt as I flipped each page of this book, but suffice it to say I felt all the things. I felt joy, sadness, anger, shame, courage, and fear. Cole places you at the center of the apocalypse and makes sure that you know that each character has their own apocalypse. Each person gets their own ending and even with similar circumstances, each ending is unique. I did receive an advance copy, but that in no way affected my enjoyment of the book. Read this book. You won’t regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOKEGZXVVJX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014E7QPTO#wasThisHelpful","RCOKEGZXVVJX1","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read Hank Garner's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, I kept loving it, seeing Garner's growth as an author with a fantastically creative novel. The first thing I read of Garner's was Mulligan, and while it was good, there were a few pacing issues that sometimes could keep the reader distant from the action. In Seventh Son, Garner has amped up the action and keeps his characters moving with a clear motive and momentum throughout the book. Even the characters are not always who we think they are and their actions go against the grain at times, adding to the intrigue.I remember first hearing about Garner's book when it was tied to the Apocalypse Weird series, but somewhere along the way, Garner separated it from that universe. It is clear Garner's book can stand on its own, with a full realized backstory going back thousands of years to set up the action that takes place simultaneously in 1865 as well as the present day.Our main protagonist, Oliver, is the title character who is tasked with being the secret keeper for his family's legacy. The main problem is that the life he was destined for arrives when he least expects it and the secrets he protects are even a secret to him. As he tries to figure out what he is meant for, and who is actually is, the reader is taken on a great ride of ancient sacrifices, futuristic travelers, and secret organizations.I loved Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and look forward to the next book from Mr. Garner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UYDI6Q7Z0EE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014AP954M#wasThisHelpful","R5UYDI6Q7Z0EE","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A return to form for Vincent Trigili in Drac'nor. I have really enjoyed the series thus far, but I mentioned in my last review for Part 4 that I felt the series was treading water a bit. Not so in this installment. Trigili takes his characters of Silverleaf and Kaylissa and advances their storylines considerably with their entrance to Drac'nor. We move forward and also learn some of the mysterious backstory for our two protagonists along the way. Now that we are this far along, I'm actually not sure how the story will wrap up in just one more story. Well done...looking forward to Book 6.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T9RRD0O1LK1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VEVXQU#wasThisHelpful","R2T9RRD0O1LK1J","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading Desmond Doane's ""The Dark Man,"" I wasn't sure what to expect from ""The White Night."" I guess at the end of the day, I thought this book would be simply setting the stage for Book 3. I knew there will be an epic showdown between the team of Mike and Ford and Chelsea's demon. It would have been easy for Doane to put the pieces into place for that showdown and mail in the second book of the trilogy.This book was no mail-in effort. Doane outdid himself with a thrilling book that had me wishing I could put a plot together half as well as him.Just like in ""The Dark Man,"" we are thrust into the life of Ford Atticus Ford, the lead investigator from a defunct TV ghost-hunting show. Ford is still questioning things after the events in the first book and is trying to put everything together while stationed in the beach in Oregon. Meanwhile, we see a dual story of Mike at home on the beach in the East Coast. The two former partners are about as far apart as they can be geographically, but their lives are as intertwined as ever as forces from beyond the grave are conspiring to put them together again.I nestled in, secure that Desmond Doane (aka USA Today bestseller Ernie Lindsey) would provide a smooth, comfortable, spooky story. Little did I know he would scare the pants off me, causing me to swear at the author midway through the book. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, you better check behind you and make sure no mirrors are shattering down the hall or have any doors swinging shut.As much as I loved ""The Dark Man,"" I have to be honest: ""The White Night"" is a better book. The alternating perspectives from the two leads perfectly sets up whatever Doane has planned for the next book, but he did so with a punch. In my review for the first book, I noted the similarities to Dean Koontz. The comparisons are well deserved and Doane inched even closer to cementing that legacy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZFPYZE1D89F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XNEU2O#wasThisHelpful","R3MZFPYZE1D89F","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, I looked forward to reading the next installment in Vincent Trigili's Silverleaf series. I've loved every story thus far and this one was no exception. Silverleaf and Kaylissa are quite the team and they show it once again in this outing.If I have a complaint about this one, it does feel about like just moving the pieces from one place to the next as a connection between the first few episodes and whatever Trigili is setting up to close out his story. It was good, but a little plodding at times. I look forward to the next episode to see the pace pick up a bit and what is new for Silverleaf and friends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25T3ZLKDLR88J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UVTQ4Q#wasThisHelpful","R25T3ZLKDLR88J","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past year and a half, I’ve fallen back in love with short stories. It was seeing the anthology From The Indie Side, edited by David Gatewood, that brought it all back. It reminded me of the collections of science fiction short stories and novellas I devoured as a teenager. I didn’t always love all the stories, but each one resonated in some way the more I read them, and I slowly learned that huge ideas can be vacuum-packed into a smaller word count.So I eagerly leapt at a chance to read the latest anthology edited by David Gatewood, Dark Beyond The Stars. Again, I can’t say I fell in love with every story, but the collection featured story after story that reached something deep inside and pulled me along until the page count finally ran out. Dark Beyond The Stars takes readers on an epic journey through space, rewarding them with tales guaranteed to entertain as well as elicit tears.I also don’t think I can address the quality of the book without mentioning a unique fact about the anthology -- each and every writer is a woman. I hope to someday live in a world where this note is unnecessary, but that day is not today. There are some out there who will refuse to read a collection that features only women writers. There are some who may cling to the out-dated belief that science fiction is a men’s game. There are those who wouldn’t even give a each of the writers a chance based on their misogynistic thinking.Those people would be wrong. These women prove that science fiction is a poorer field without them in it. Dark Beyond The Stars is a rich and full universe of stories that, I believe, benefit from a woman’s perspective and voice.Now, as I analyze the volume, I’m not going to go into detail on each and every story -- other reviews have taken care of this and readers can find those details in those reviews -- but I’ll highlight a few of the pinnacles of the book for me.First off, the choice of Susan Kaye Quinn to start the anthology with her story “Containment” is a sure-fire winner. While Quinn sets the story firmly within the universe she’s established in her latest novel “The Legacy Human,” the story stands securely on its own. As with many of the stories in the collection, the point doesn’t become what happens, but really what does it all mean? In this case, we meet an artificial intelligence who works as the manager of mining on Thebe. As the story slowly develops, we peel back layers of the onion to discover our A.I. is more than what he is allowed to be. The themes of A.I., wealth inequality, and slavery are prevalent throughout the story and make it one to remember.Another story I loved was Ann Christy’s “Lulu Ad Infinitum” and consequences of a horrific accident on a colony ship headed into space. One of the passengers, Lulu, is left alive, and is confronted with the fact that the only way to continue is with help, and the only way to get help is by cloning. As the mind wanders over decades and generations, what does the ship look like and who is Lulu after all this time?In the same themes of a colony ship, Theresa Kay’s “Protocol A235,” takes the view of disaster happening in space to the extreme. In contrast to Christy’s Lulu, however, Theresa Kay pulls a slow burn as the first-person protagonist slowly finds out what’s happened, and the life that she has in front of her. The horror of the situation seems a little more apparent to the reader, but watching it play out makes her story one of the gems of this collection.And the heartbreaker of the bunch had to be Jennifer Foehner Wells “Carindi.” Those familiar with Wells’ “Fluency” know the intricacies of the alien ships, operated by octopi-like beings, but commanded by a different species entirely. Ei’Pio is one of the former, resigned to a fate where she cannot move after a plague wiped out the population of her ship. She discovers a lifeform in the aftermath, one confined to a stasis suit who will be her companion for years. The story plays out until a decision must be made and they must leave their area of space or die. Just as I loved “Fluency,” “Carindi” adds a greater depth and history to Wells’ universe.Ultimately, David Gatewood succeeds in editing another premier anthology, but he is merely the pilot ship for an armada of warships made up of supremely talented writers. I loved Dark Beyond the Stars and hope that there is more to come from this group.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W5OWL98RS0F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515308383#wasThisHelpful","R1W5OWL98RS0F8","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I’ve read Hugh Howey’s Beacon 23 series, I’ve enjoyed the small vignettes on our protagonist's life. Small snippets here and there. It wasn’t until the last part that Howey expertly draws all of the threads together. That the pieces he scattered throughout Parts One through Four are coming to a head with epic and emotional consequences.Someone could do a fair amount of psychoanalysis on Hugh Howey and his stories. For instance, with his biggest stories the past few years, the characters are stuck somewhere with death seemingly all around them -- Jules with the earth and poison sky in WOOL; Vic and her family in a dystopian world covered in Sand; Ness and Maya surrounded by the ocean in the Shell COllector. Finally we get a nameless protagonist (only referred to briefly by a nickname - Digger) surrounded by the deadliest environment yet: Deep Space. But those surroundings wouldn’t be worth anything without a top notch narrative to go along with them and Howey’s got that in spades with Beacon 23.In Beacon 23, we get shades of Ender’s Game, and perhaps more notably the sequels where Ender deals with the actions he undertook in the first novel. For Digger, his actions as a Marine are coming full circle in Beacon 23: Part 5 when he and the love of his life, Claire, receive visitors. These visitors offer a solution. A way to end the war that’s been raging across the galaxy for decades, but it will take drastic action on Digger’s part.I don’t want to spoil the ending, but the actions are bold and radical. For our hero, and the author as well, the emotions that play into it are real. In fact, at the beginning of this final segment, Digger reflects back to a time with his father on Earth. This is perhaps the most poignant aspect of the entire series in those pages, and Howey nails it. The misunderstanding of tears and emotion at a young age and the realization of what missed opportunities there were. I was moved by the story and for a moment forgot our protagonist was even in space.What does it mean to be a hero? How does one define it? Throughout our history we’ve had different definitions depending on where you are from, even getting different aspects of heroism from Norse, Greek and Roman mythologies, let alone stories and values from Eastern cultures. In Beacon 23, we ask the question again with the fate of the Universe hanging in the balance. In the end, I felt Howey did the story proud and can say he has another legitimate hit on his hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Q4F7L1OGNAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013MZEM4O#wasThisHelpful","R18Q4F7L1OGNAC","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With Skynoise, Ernie Lindsey shows why he is one of the most compelling and dynamic indie writers out there. Earlier this year, I found ""Super,"" which turned the superhero genre on its ear, and in ""Skynoise,"" Lindsey takes the sci-fi trope of time travel and twists a good yarn through years of mysteries and bread crumbs.One of the greatest mysteries of history is the disappearance of the settlers at the Roanoke Colony, off the coast of modern day North Carolina, back in the 1500's. Historians to this day are uncertain as to the fate of the early colonists -- did they die off? Did they leave with a Native American tribe? Even some even farther-out conspiracy nuts have argued for extra-terrestrials. Lindsey takes the Roanoke mystery and uses it as the central historical narrative to tie the present-day to our time traveling protagonists in a timey-wimey sort of way. As a high school history teacher, I am fascinated by stories like those of Roanoke, and was thrilled when ""Skynoise"" started and ended with the Roanoke mystery in full swing.We quickly meet Helen, a non-fiction author whose latest book tackles the mystery at Roanoke. On her book tour, she repeatedly deals with Chip, who comes across as a conspiracy nut at first. Soon we find out there is a lot more to Chip than we initially see, which is definitely intentional on Mr. Lindsey's part -- this is definitely a story that will make you think in circles. Parts that happen at the beginning or even before the start of our tale are revealed later on; this is a book that would work well in repeated readings.The best I could compare ""Skynoise"" to is ""Timecop"" plus ""Conspiracy Theory"" plus maybe a little ""The Italian Job."" Lindsey keeps the pace up well, pausing at times to take a breath and to get our characters some important information. In the end, Skynoise is a wonderfully-told, and fun book that showcases Lindsey's storytelling skills.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R395ZX8J7OT8PI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RA9L0QC#wasThisHelpful","R395ZX8J7OT8PI","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another Hugh Howey book. Another vision of the future.This time out, however, the future isn’t so bleak and isn’t a terrifying place to be. In fact, in The Shell Collector, the world he’s created has been decimated by rising sea levels, but the story is bright and hopeful, a stark contrast to the previous trips to the future we’ve taken with him.I really enjoyed The Shell Collector as a speculative fiction romance, featuring Maya Walsh as the intrepid reporter, trying to unearth the truth about Ness Wilde, the CEO of Ocean Oil. Wilde and his family are pariahs because of the earth’s condition; sea levels rose in no small part to the ways the Wildes have abused the earth’s resources over the years. But, as she gets to know Ness, she discovers that the story she is planning does not accurately paint him or his family. That there is far more behind the man.Throughout it all is a search for elusive shells, which have become collector’s items and currency in this futuristic society when shells have all become rare due to the ocean conditions.This book is vastly different than anything I’ve seen from Howey before, but there are themes that he has certainly tapped into again. A prominent one is going beneath the surface of the earth. In WOOL, the deeper the characters went, the more the sparks of rebellion grew. In Sand, the deeper the divers went, the more death and despair crept in. In both, claustrophobia was present, but the way out was usually through death.In The Shell Collector, Howey again takes our characters deep—this time to the ocean’s floor to see the creation of new life in the volcanic hearth in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. Claustrophobia is present, but this time, our characters experience hope and healing. The shells that each of them are for different reasons, are given new life in a submarine at the bottom of the world, and they discover each other in the process. Unlike in WOOL or Sand, where the depths of the earth usually lead to death, Howey utilizes the intense pressure to create love and affection between our protagonists.Science fiction plays a role in this book, to be sure, but it is a light one. Howey has created a romance novel and a good one at that. The plot was consistently pushed along by twists and turns, but wasn’t bogged down by unnecessary points where Howey could have devolved the story to erotica levels. Howey once again shows he knows how to write, no matter the genre or convention. Well done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397F32NBKIA8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503368483#wasThisHelpful","R397F32NBKIA8O","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the first part of the Apocalypse Weird Saga, Nick Cole uses his story to affect and confuse the audience -- and probably on purpose.From the title heading, it's clear that Cole's entry is just the first of many into this strange apocalyptic future. Most of the book focuses on a few people who are the survivors of an apparent zombie virus. The audience is lulled into thinking this is all this is going to be -- a simple zombie tale, but then Cole changes the game right before switching narratives. Will we get back to our zombie survivors? Will the next book pick up where this one left off? Will we find answers to what the next apocalyptic event is? Who is Mr. Steele??There are many unanswered questions, but that is exactly what Mr. Cole intended, I imagine. With a bevy of other talented authors on deck, Cole is simply setting the stage for the craziness to come. I enjoyed the book and will gladly read whatever else the Apocalypse Weird crew has up their sleeves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZR0IZ64NJJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3JFQFG#wasThisHelpful","R3TZR0IZ64NJJ5","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, I find myself falling deeper and deeper into the worlds created by each of the authors in a science fiction anthology. As an editor, David Gatewood is putting together world-class collections and the quality of the book is through the roof.I won't go through each and every story, but each one deserves their place in this anthology. In contrast to previous collections, I was actually unfamiliar with most of the authors in the book. With each story, however, I felt drawn and compelled to seek out their previous work.The argument could be made that the best stories served as bookends to this fantastic book -- Peter Cawdron's ""#Don'tTell"" and MeiLin Miranda's ""Word-Bound."" Both had a tale that drew the reader in, captured and held them until an emotional and surprising conclusion.The other stories that caught my attention on the first read-through were Therin Knite's action-packed ""Venus in Red,"" Vincent Trigili's thriller ""The Null,"" and Autumn Kalquist's ""Decode."" Of course, Sam Peralta's ""Trauma Room,"" while short, provided a great mid-point to the collection and Susan Kaye Quinn has spent enough time in her Mindjack series that writing a telepathy story is probably second-nature at this point.I really enjoyed the book and look forward to more from each of these authors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13XUMMJ3ZT3U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVLDQU0#wasThisHelpful","R13XUMMJ3ZT3U2","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Revolution, Cawdron paints a picture of a world similar to our own, but with technology advanced a bit. Alexander Hopkins is getting home on a red-eye flight from Russia when that world slams into him with all the force Homeland Security can muster.The breadth of the story is short, so I’ll keep my review brief as well, but you want to catch each word in this tale as Cawdron once again showcases why he is one of the best indie writers around. The pace of the story is at first lazy and perhaps a bit deliberate – much like the landing of a 747 after a 10-hour trip. Once Alexander is on the ground, however, the action picks up and you find yourself whipped around from one place to the next in a desperate attempt to survive and figure out what is happening.While the beginning of the story starts with lethargy, the ending is sudden and abrupt, stopping too soon for my taste. I wanted more, but isn’t that the mark of a great story?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UUPCCOI0XCQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O39BFBC#wasThisHelpful","R3UUPCCOI0XCQ1","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With a title like that, it was a little difficult for me to want to read this book. Peter Cawdron has made a title that is very provocative, but if the reader can just get past it -- get to the heart of the story -- they will realize that Satan has very little to do with this tale at all.I love Peter Cawdron's work. I just adore it. I have been a huge fan of his previous books and was instantly drawn into the narrative he created in MSS. While I admit the title took me aback, it turns out the title, and the message from the stray moon of Saturn, are both a little deceiving. Deception is a key concept of this book, starting with our protagonist, Jasmine, or Jazz for short.Jazz wakes up out of stasis, but is missing 20+ years of her life. Now an astronaut headed for Saturn, all she remembers is being 19 and living outside of Atlanta. Her crewmates may or may not have secrets of their own, but the biggest secret seemingly is what is Bestla, the moon orbiting Saturn.In the process of a re-self-discovery, we are seeing the world through Jazz's eyes, crisp and clear at times, but vague and confused at others. She is smart, but the years of college and learning to be an astronaut are gaps in her memory. She doesn't know what to do all the time and turns to the only one she believes she can trust -- the ship's AI, Jason.I'll say this about Jason -- he may be the best character I've seen in a long time. I loved what Cawdron did in creating a character that feels totally real, but is not only fictional, but also doesn't have a body to call his own. The evolution of Jason was fantastic and I would love to see more of him in a future book if Mr. Cawdron ever decides to revisit his MSS Universe.Once again, the story is well told, well paced, and one I would recommend highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFYEZERXEAET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBA6Y1A#wasThisHelpful","REFYEZERXEAET","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Doorway to Arkomo, Jacqueline Dooley creates an interesting and wonderful world that instantly draws reminders to Narnia or Middle Earth. Like Narnia, there is a hidden doorway to this world from ours and in the case of Arkomo, the doorway is into a hospital where Grace is being treated for cancer.As a new parent to a chronically ill child, I have already been in the hospital more than I or my son would like.

"What a great concept and story from Logan Thomas Snyder. I picked up Becoming Violet a few weeks ago, but just got around to reading it yesterday. Boy am I sorry I waited.At first, I thought it was a typical ""Bicentennial Man,"" Isaac Asimov robot story with a man dissatisfied with his robot. Snyder, however, took the story in a new direction, giving the reader an introspective, yet action-filled tale of love in the face of trials. What does it mean to love?

"What a fantastic start to Pennsylvania fiction outside of Michael Bunker's brain. Chris Pourteau paints a vivid picture of the ongoing war between TRACE and Transport, showing the lives of a squad of soldiers about to go to battle in Gettysburg in New Pennsylvania.Throughout my life raised in the North, I was trained to root against the Confederacy. In Pourteau's story, he clearly posits TRACE as analogous to the Confederates, but shows the humanity behind the soldiers. History paints in broad strokes, but from the story here, it struck me that the individual lives of the men (and women) fighting in the wars are not black and white.There was one scene in particular (when you read it, you'll know what I'm talking about) that had me in tears as I was trying to digest the action of the book.

"Stefan Bolz has his own brand of positive fiction. You see it seeping through every pore of The Three Feathers. In his book The Fourth Sage, the characters work together to achieve a goal they never could have even dreamed about.In Dark World, I was afraid I wasn't going to get a Bolz-style of story, but the opposite is true. There is a darkness and violence to it, but in the end it just reaffirms the good Stefan Bolz believes in.What happens when the border between the worlds of angels and humans is crossed? What becomes of an angel when her only tether to herself has just been destroyed? That's the basis for Bolz's story here and he pulls it off well. Your heart breaks for Amber as she struggles in the world of men to grapple with the being she has become and her journey to salvation.The path isn't always neat and clean, but Stefan Bolz once again brings us a work worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TD1ZQ39JJDVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZW8VDE#wasThisHelpful","R3TD1ZQ39JJDVL","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful and haunting at the same time, Samuel Peralta paints an emotional story of love and loss within the context of a time-traveler. On first glance, you may think you've heard this story before, but Peralta does his own spin on it, giving the reader snippets of time, fragments of a life lived.They say love forged during war -- during crisis -- is the truest love of all and that's what happens with our protagonist, Cpl. Caitlyn McAdams when she meets and falls in love with an injured man during the throes of war. McAdams is fated (doomed?) to meet this man over and over throughout her life for brief periods of time. Throughout it all, the reader feels the affection...and frustration...of our two lovers who cannot have a life lived in the same timeline.I applaud Peralta's work and look forward to seeing additional stories written by him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WRLFOHVLGULB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYGZ7HO#wasThisHelpful","R2WRLFOHVLGULB","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once my eyes dry out, I may be able to actually read what I'm writing here, but I'll sum it up with this: in Nina Tozzi's debut, she definitely understands the heart and the emotion of the story.Janey X39 is an android, kept in a dark, dingy basement. She is allowed to come upstairs only to clean and take care of Barbara and her family. Her clothes are rags and her food is ""android paste"" -- a bland and colorless food that provides the nutrients she needs to survive. Throughout this story, Tozzi beautifully and tragically paints a picture where Janey begins to understand what -- or perhaps who -- she really is.I can't say I was surprised by the ending, but Tozzi does such a fantastic job of portraying heartbreak and loss that I didn't even mind not being shocked at the reveal. The point is -- Janey is shocked. In spite of everything that had happened to her and her existence as an ""android,"" Janey shows a lot of humanity in the pages of this story.Ms. Tozzi is a welcome addition to the world of self-publishing and I hope we see more of her work in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJIQ26GQ2PZV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXFOFB0#wasThisHelpful","RJIQ26GQ2PZV9","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a name like ""Soda Pop Soldier,"" I half-expected a light-hearted romp through modern video games. What I got was something completely different. Something telling about how many of us live our lives online and the anonymity that we expect. Something visceral and violent, yet clean and sanitized at the same time. Something that fully engaged my head and heart alike.Nick Cole's Wasteland Saga led by The Old Man and the Wasteland was Cole's bleak dystopian debut. He impressed me with the deliberate and purposeful pace of that novel, but in SPS, he treats the reader to something completely different. Is the future portrayed in Cole's new novel a dystopia? I would say it is, but it resembles more of a Ready Player One-type future rather than the post-apocalyptic tone of his previous work.Unlike RPO, however, Cole infuses his world with a much darker tone. RPO always had a certain Reagan-era optimism. That everything would be OK even if Parzifal didn’t succeed. Here though, there is a certain amount of fear behind the scenes. If PerfectQuestion doesn’t get everything just right his existence is definitely in question.The gamer PerfectQuestion is a key piece in ColaCorp's ongoing war for advertising space. The winner in the online arena gets billboard space in Times Square and other key spots around the world. PerfectQuestion is good at what he does, but his squad finds itself outmatched in their latest round of battles, leading to his pay getting cut.In order to make ends meet, he takes to the back alleys and signs up for an illegal game called the Black, where twisted fantasies play out for those who want to indulge in that sort of thing. This game, however, turns into something more for PerfectQuestion and an additional quest to finish alongside his professional life in WarWorld.Throughout it all, we see the real world, but in many ways Cole presents this as almost more fantastic and ridiculous than the online worlds that PerfectQuestion plays in. There are scientific advancements that take humans to other planets and planes that seemingly traverse around the world without stopping, but most of that is unavailable to the average person. The more the book explores those areas – the areas inhabited by the rich and powerful – the more the reader finds themselves in foreign territory.In many ways PerfectQuestion is more at home in the war and fantasy of his online games than in the real world.Hence why we never really get a clear picture of who our protagonist really is. What’s his name? PerfectQuestion is the name of his online avatar, but we are lead to believe that the names he gives others in real life are false ones. His name – his true name – is PerfectQuestion. He is more at home online.I don’t know if he was intending it, but I think Nick Cole is certainly saying something in this book about our online behavior and the idea of anonymity. Are we truly anonymous online? In an age when the NSA could be spying on our every behavior, what protections do we truly have? When PerfectQuestion meets others in real life, they seemingly all know him by online personas. He doesn’t have an identity outside of the computer until the final pages of the book and we as the reader are left to decide if that is a good or a bad thing.PerfectQuestion plays the part of a samurai in the Black game he launches into to supplement his income and that aspect of his life transcends and bleeds through every facet of his life. He is a noble person who truly wants to do what is right. There is an honor code he follows, even when the easy option is staring him in the face.I loved Soda Pop Soldier. It definitely wasn’t light-hearted, showing off a fast-paced action with only brief pauses to catch your breath. Cole upped his game for this novel and I look forward to what he has up his sleeve next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQ6KD487IQVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006221022X#wasThisHelpful","RSQ6KD487IQVT","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Book Two in his Tunnel Trilogy, S. Elliot Brandis pushes the envelope even further with the torture he puts his characters through. It is cringeworthy at times, but in the end, he makes the case that the struggle is worth it.In the first book, Irradiated, older sister Jade is forced to rescue her irradiated sister, Pearl, from the evil Queen in the Tunnels below the earth, sacrificing everything to do so. In this book, Pearl is five years older and definitely a bit jaded by her experiences with the new colony of irradiated people who have gathered around her and her kind. There is a war looming -- one that Pearl wants no part of, but war finds her anyway.We also get a parallel story of Flynn in the Tunnels. Flynn is irradiated as well and his abilities give him an opportunity to help or hurt those closest to him.Once again, Brandis seems to take glee in punishing his characters, pushing the boundaries of what most authors would do to further their characters' suffering. By the end, however, the pain, both physical and emotional ties our characters together and leads the narrative towards a (hopefully) epic third act.

Pearl is what is called ""Irradiated"" and suffers from/is blessed with mutations as a result. There are others who are irradiated and somehow they are drawn to Pearl and her abilities, but there are those who wish to see the Irradiated wiped out for good, ensuring a struggle between the fascist and fanatical forces under the earth and the liberal and free people who live on the planet's surface.I enjoyed the story and really looked forward to reading the second book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TDYYZGAALDHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAWN3ZM#wasThisHelpful","R1TDYYZGAALDHH","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas Robins did something amazing with Part 4 of his first original science fiction novel -- he turned the story on its head and gave the readers a thoughtful, intelligent, and tense final ride in Ineeka's shoes.Through three previous installments, we learned what Ineeka was trying so desperate to escape. We learned about her path from the inner city of Chicago to outer space and beyond. Ineeka is a great character and with Robins' style of storytelling in the D2E series, he does a phenomenal job of ending the story he took nearly a year telling.I loved how Robins told the story and am looking forward to re-reading this story with it in one collection when Robins puts out the complete D2E story.

"We are creators.Regardless of our professions, each of us is inherently a creator. We start early, creating unconquerable cities with building blocks and spinning entire lives centered around dolls and teddy bears. Creation is at the heart of humanity. Even when we think of our meals, we are mentally creating appetizing combinations of cuisines.The art of creating has advanced by leaps and bounds as technology has advanced us as a species. Part of the problem with humanity creating is the fear that we might be too good at it. That we might create something we can’t control. That our creation takes on a life of its own.We’ve seen this in literature for hundreds of years with Frankenstein as the long-lasting example. More recently we can point to 2001, Terminator, Blade Runner, The Matrix and dozens of other books and movies that have shown us what humanity has dared to create has ultimately come back to bite us in the end.And so, we get the latest David Gatewood anthology of short stories, The Robot Chronicles. Gatewood has again assembled a ridiculous amount of literary talent for 13 outstanding stories all involving robots in one form or another. Headlining the collection is Hugh Howey (WOOL) and Matthew Mather (Cyber Storm) and neither one disappoint. Howey’s story, Glitch, was published not long ago on its own and reminded me a lot of the movie Real Steel with fighting robots. What one person perceives as a glitch may be more than that, especially to the robot.I’m not going to go through each of the stories, but each was fantastic and memorable in their own unique ways. I was a huge fan of Isaac Asimov as an adolescent and found each of his Robot stories to be their own moral tales in many ways. These stories are no different, offering viewpoints on what life actually means and how we treat it. Just because we are the creators, does that mean it lessens the life we hold in our hands?A perfect story to go along with this idea is W.J. Davies’ Empathy for Andrew, where we see a situation similar to what Asimov’s Dr. Susan Calvin might have been involved in. Testing new and breakthrough robotics techniques, scientists push the limits of where the line between robots and humans lie. Andrew is the titular robot who is put through a battery of tests to test his empathy chip and Davies does a remarkable job in telling this story.Another story I remember from Asimov’s Robot collection was that of Satisfaction Guaranteed, another Susan Calvin story where she was noticeably absent until the end of the tale. In this story, a woman has a human-like robot live with her and eventually she comes to think of him as more than a robot. You see this theme played out in two separate stories – Ann Christy’s PePr, Inc. and Patrice Fitzgerald’s I Dream of PIA. Both handle this theme in remarkable different (and in Fitzgerald’s case, bawdy and funny) ways.There are also hints at Asimov’s child/buddy stories like A Boy’s Best Friend or Robbie where a child has a robot for a companion and friend. Edward W. Robertson takes the story further. His protagonist, Alex, received Bill as a companion when he is young, but over the years they become more than that – business partners and musicians. Just like a number of famous musicians, things happen and the band doesn’t always survive, but in Baby Your Body’s My Bass, Robertson ends the story on a positive note, in a very Golden-age way.But the stories that really resonate and stick with me tend to be those that have a larger scope in mind – like A.K. Meek’s The Invariable Man where the fate of the world may be at stake or Deirdre Gould’s post-apocalyptic story System Failure.One of the best things about this collection of stories is that it got me to get out my collection of Asimov robot stories and re-read and re-discover them in the light of this remarkable modern anthology. Each of the stories in TRC is fantastic, even if I didn’t specifically name the story and author. I’ll carry these stories with me for a long time.I really enjoyed The Robot Chronicles, just like I did with Synchronic and The Indie Side. David Gatewood is becoming someone to know in the science fiction short story game and his anthologies are now “can’t miss” books for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R349ZOX2VSFSHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3GIBUK#wasThisHelpful","R349ZOX2VSFSHD","A22BGUQ2QJ36JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BGUQ2QJ36JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife loves to wash the carpets several times a year.  We have a Bissell Big Green Machine, which we are very pleased with because it works great.RugDoctor platinum Pure with Oxy has a much more delicate scent than our normal cleaning shampoo, Bissell Deepclean Pro.  This RugDoctor scent, sparkeling breeze, is great for those who do not like strong perfumed scents.  I used to always buy RugDoctor in the red jugs at the grocery store, which were not concentrated.  I would say the new formula works just as good, but because there were a few stains that took more work I am not as trilled as I could be.  Overall, it works very good.RugDoctor platinum doesn’t make suds like our usual Bissell Deepclean Pro.  The proper amount was used and it didn’t seem to pick up stains as well as Bissell.  It took a lot more work to go over the stain spots to get them to lift.  It hardly looked like dirt was coming up at all, but the water was very dirty.

"We decided to upgrade the kitchen light with this chandelier.  We only have two of the links in use so it isn't too long.  My wife actually installed this one herself (first time she ever installed a light) before I got home.  She helped me and watched me install several other lights, so I am gladly she felt good enough to challenge herself and take on the project.  So have confidence, someone who only watched how other lights are done can do this job.60 watt bulbs were much too bright so I bought some 40 watt bulbs and they are just right.  A light with five bulbs really makes a room light up.  I think the chandelier has a mixture of classic and modern.  The center is fairly plain and the edges of the glass pieces give it a modern look, in my opinion.We spent a lot of time looking for a light fixture that had at least four bulbs, would bring the look of the room up a notch,  and wasn't too long so I wouldn't bump my head.  It really is a challenge because we wanted to both really like it too.  This was the shortest hanging light we could find that was a little more fancy.  I really wish they made lights that were more elegant and met the rest of our needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0SIA4CQHVHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJKIZAW#wasThisHelpful","R3M0SIA4CQHVHU","A2ULQOGN59LDNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ULQOGN59LDNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Pastor Theologian: Resurrecting an Ancient Vision is a new book by Gerald Hiestand and Todd Wilson that examines church history and our current environment to show the need for a return of pastors as Ecclesial Theologians and then provides guidance for pastors to step into this ""ancient"" role. As Timothy George states in his Foreword, ""the social bifurcation between church and academy that has marked Western culture since the Enlightenment does not excuse local church pastors from one of their own major responsibilities. ""Pastors are the theological chief executive officers of the church.""  It is this role that Hiestand and Wilson are calling men to embrace.Heistand and Wilson do a wonderful job setting the stage by taking the reader through a quick trip of history (with the addition of a large detailed Appendix) to show the developments within the church and how the rise of the academy as the intellectual hub also led to the loss of Pastor Theologians. In ancient days men could be great theologians of the church as well as faithful pastors serving their local congregation. With the rise of the academy though, these roles became divided and men who felt called to write theology for theologians and pastors left for the academy. This short walk through history is quite beneficial for the reader to see the development over the course of roughly 2000 years.Hiestand and Wilson are straightforward in their diagnosis of our current setting. They state, ""Pastor theologians aren't extinct, but sightings are rare. This is because pastors no longer traffic in ideas. They cast vision, manage programs, offer counsel, and give messages.....None of this in inherently wrong. Indeed, all of these are important pastoral tasks. But we no longer view the pastorate as an intellectual calling....Intellectually speaking, we expect pastors to function, at best, as intellectual middle management, passive conveyors of insights from theologians to laity. A little quote from Augustine here, a brief allusion to Bonhoeffer there. That's all."" This idea of middle management is a very helpful picture. Are pastors only to transfer ideas from the theologian to the pew, or are they also able to write for the theologian and as the theologian?  Hiestand and Wilson are also clear that the Pastor Theologian does first have a heart for the church. ""We do envision and want to advocate for a return of the pastor theologian who has a shepherd's heart and a pastor's primary vocational identity, yet who functions as an intellectual peer of the academic theologian and, as such, produces theological scholarship for the broader ecclesial community. that helps shape and inform academic, cultural, and ecclesial discussions with a view to deepening the faith of the people of God.""The authors provide eight helpful characteristics of a pastor as ecclesial theologian. They are: 1) Inhabits the Ecclesial Social location, 2) Foregrounds Ecclesial Questions 3) Aims for clarity over subtlety 4) theologizes with a preaching voice 5)is a student of the church 6) works across the guilds 7) works in partnership with the academic theologian and 8) traffics in introspection. They also lay out 10 strategies on becoming an ecclesial theologian. They are as follows: 1) Get a PhD 2) Staff to the Vision 3) Get Networked 4) Guard Your Study Time with a blowtorch  5) Read ecclesial theology (and other stuff) 6) Refer to the place where you work as ""your study"" 7) Build study-and-writing leave into your schedule 8) recruit a pastor-theologian intern 9) Earn buy-in from your church leadership 10) let the necessity of love trump your love of truth.  These two list, making up chapters seven and eight of the book provide a helpful starting point for pastors who feel called to write theological works for other theologians and pastors. This book is definitely a book that should be read by all pastors who have a mind and heart towards theology as well as serving in their local church.

"In the introduction to Preaching for Revitalization, Michael F. Ross states clearly the problem facing so many churches today. He states, ""There is a famine in our land for the Word of God, a dying hunger for 'holy manna' (Amos 8:11). And it is the duty of godly preachers to seek to do something about the lack of holy manna, that preaching of the Word that reforms religion, revives the Church and regenerates dead souls."" For a church to experience true and lasting revitalization it must return to the Word of God having a central role in all that it does corporately. ""True church revitalization can never take place and be maintained unless it is the product of a biblical pulpit."" The centrality of the Word of God cannot be bypassed for a church to truly  experience revitalization. Ross defines revitalization as ""the process whereby a church is refocused on its mission of both evangelism and nurturing, and renewed in its efforts to minister to others so that numerical, spiritual and organizational growth occur and are sustained.""Ross proposes the following outline to accomplish church revitalization which also serves to divide the book into four parts:1) Certain priorities of revitalizing preaching that will positively affect the interest shown by others toward a minister's preaching can be deduced from Reformation and Puritan preaching.2) A certain content to revitalizing preaching that will positively affect the growth experienced from one's preaching can be deduced from Reformation and Puritan preaching.3) Certain characteristics of revitalizing preaching that will positively affect the ethos of one's preaching can be deduced from Reformation and Puritan preaching.4) A certain style of revitalizing preaching that will positively affect the impact of one's preaching can be deduced from Reformation and Puritan preaching.In part one the centrality of the Word of God and preaching is the focus.  If the preaching of the Word of God is not central in a church then that church has shown what it thinks about the sufficiency of Scripture to revitalize a church. As Ross rightly states, ""when the Scripture is no longer supreme in authority, the sermon is no longer pre-eminent in liturgy; an soon sacramental priorities replace preaching. These 'sacramental' replacements may not just be penance, the eucharist or liturgies to Mary and the saints, but may also include drama, liturgical dance, overemphasis on music and other innovations in worship revealing a lack of confidence in Scripture and a low view of preaching.""In part two Ross helps the reader to see the proper balance in preaching between five types of preaching he discusses: 1) Christological Preaching, 2) Ecclesiastical Preaching, 3) Missiological Preaching, 4) Doctrinal Preaching, and 5) Ethical Preaching. In each chapter Ross explains what each type of preaching is and why it is necessary and shows the focus on these types of preaching in Reformation and Puritan thought.  Part three examines four characteristics of Puritan and Reformed preaching: 1) Spiritual 2) Romantic 3) Controversial and 4) Camaraderie. Part four focuses on expository preaching as the best type of preaching and then examines its historical roots before examining method and process.  As someone who enjoys reflecting on Reformation and Puritan thought I was greatly encouraged by the connections that Ross made to these eras and church revitalization. This book would be a blessing and helpful read for all pastors, not just those trying to revitalize a dying church.I received a copy of this book from Christian Focus in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZ346XXD3XY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1845501233#wasThisHelpful","R1PZ346XXD3XY7","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Secret Life of a Pastor ""represents pastoral letters that [Milton] composed to [his] students across the years, as [he] had the opportunity to teach in seminaries."" ""The letters vary in length , language, and, at times, in tone. There is no cookie-cutter approach to mentoring, and the variations in the letters reflect this."" From the very first page Milton shares his heart's desire to pass on to future and current pastors wisdom that he has accumulated in his years of pastoral experience.  His love for Christ, the church and his students is clearly seen and wonderfully communicated.Milton's letters to his students cover a wide range of topics. Some of these include: Having a proper understanding of time spent in seminary, study of original languages, a Pastors relationship with his wife and kids, the necessity of expository preaching, the Pastors role in equipping the saints, the centrality of Christ and the gospel, rest, and many more. Milton's love and wise words blend together in these brief letters and will surely be an encouragement to aspiring pastors, new pastors and seasoned pastors alike. As Milton states, ""The common denominator in all of the published letters is the author’s desire to lead future pastors and other church leaders in surrendering their identities, ambitions, and plans to the supreme Mentor, our Lord Jesus Christ."" This desire translates into a book that will definitely be an encouragement to every pastor who reads it.

"A great concern for the American Church, and truly the Christian Church throughout history, is that we take the truth that we are made in the image of God and turn it on its head. We make God in the image of man. Not just any man, but ourselves. We place on God characteristics, or accentuate his attributes, in a way that fits Him into our agenda. The most obvious form of this in our culture today is the prosperity gospel. Men and women twist Scripture to come up with a God that wants to give everyone great prosperity if they would only believe and give enough. These false teachers feed on people's desire for riches and use a ""myth"" to do so. While this is damaging for sure, there are also more subtle ways that we can create a false God/Jesus.  In The Original Jesus: Trading the Myths for the Savior Who Is  Daniel Darling examines 10 myths that we can create that lead us astray from the original Jesus.In the Foreword, Russell Moore, is spot on when he states that ""Many Christians could easily just buy a golden Buddha from a flea market, affix a brown beard on it, and call it 'Jesus.' This little idol would have as much resemblance to the living Son of God as the mental constructions we so often piece together and call 'Jesus' in our lives. Darling's remedy is to expose the myths for what they are and then to show how they fall short of the true Jesus. The ten myths that Darling examines are: 1) Guru Jesus. This myth views Jesus as an inspirational figure and good teacher, but not our victorious King. 2) Red-Letter Jesus. This myth sets the Bible against each other. The person who thinks this way chooses to focus on certain words and teachings in the Bible and reject the rest of it. 3) Braveheart Jesus. This myth views Biblical manhood as rugged manhood and any deviation is not true manhood. Characteristics like ""not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome,"" ""not arrogant or quick tempered."" are minimized in this view. 4) American Jesus. This myth makes Jesus the mascot of every conservative political cause to the point where the concern is more about the political map of the country and less about souls being rescued from darkness. 5) Left-Wing Jesus. This myth focuses on areas like caring for the poor, often with handouts, and uses Jesus as its mascot. 6) Dr. Phil Jesus. This myth turn Jesus into simply a self help guide, wanting to help you be a better you. 7) Prosperity Jesus. Again, this myth makes Jesus a means to and end and the end is our material prosperity. 8) Post-Church Jesus. This myth is becoming more and more popular. People who hold to this mythical Jesus sever Him (the head) from the Church (His body) and claim to love and follow Jesus while having nothing to do with the church. 9) BFF Jesus. This myth does away with much of Christianity and focuses solely on just loving Jesus. 10) Legalist Jesus. This myth adds our own rules/regulations/preferences to Jesus as a means of acceptance. In each chapter Darling does a wonderful job of exposing these myths and showing why we need so much more from Jesus than what they have to offer.

"Friendship among believers is a subject that is practically assumed, yet often not thought through or examined in light of the cross. Friendship Redeemed: How the Gospel Changes Friendships to Something Greater by Adam Holland is a new book that examines Paul's friendships and encourages believers to model their friendships after Paul's example. The fellowship that we find in Christian friendship is to be one of unity, modeled after the unity of our triune God is whose image we are created.  As Holland states, ""Mankind was created in the image of the triune God. We were created to live in harmony or perfect unity with one another. Our relationships with one another are and were to be a reflection of the relationship that the Godhead has had within itself throughout eternity. The Christian is called to bring these heavenly realities down to earth.  When an unbeliever sees a Christian friendship, he gets to see a small glimpse of what the world looks like when it is ruled by Christ. They get to see a glimpse of what it looks like when the Shalom, or peace of God, has been restored in the world."" With this thought in mind friendship should be a topic that we think seriously about so that our friendship is unique to the world and points them to Christ.To have friendships like this we must live with the cross always in view. Holland examines Paul's friendships and brings encouragement for readers to model their friendships after his.  Holland draws from Paul's friendships with Tychicus, Onesimus, John Mark, Epaphras, Luke and Demas.  One thing that really stands out from this survey is the different types of people that Paul had friendships with. He didn't limit his circle of friends to people who were just like him. As Holland rightly says, ""Paul  challenges us to take risks on people even when they are not like us. Paul’s friends were made up of a pretty diverse group of individuals—a  former slave, a doctor, both Jews and Gentiles, etc. If you only have friends who are like you, you will never be challenged to be something more or something different.""When we model our friendships after Paul we will also have to embrace risk.  Again Holland is helpful when he states, ""How can you tell whether one of your friends is going to be a John Mark (a friend that leaves and comes back) or a Demas  (a friend that leaves you and never returns)? You can’t! So, should we shut the door on any friendship in fear that they may abandon us or hurt us? No! Paul models for us how living on the other side of the cross calls for believers to take risks with others. Sometimes you are going to get hurt."" With Hurt also comes the opportunity for forgiveness and restoration. Again drawing from the example of Paul, Holland states, ""Paul models how to love others when they have wronged you. People in general are quick to turn their backs on those who have wronged them. Paul displays a forgiveness that is only possible through the Holy Spirit. It is a forgiveness that was displayed on the cross when the God of the universe gave up his  life when everyone had wronged him."" This is truly how the gospel changes friendship. In light of the cross we are able to love those who are different than us and to forgive those who may hurt us. I was greatly encouraged by this book and highly recommend it to all believers. It is quite easy to hold to a worldly model of friendship, it is far more difficult to hold to a biblical example. Thankfully, Adam Holland has provided the church with a biblical look into friendship.

"Pray for the Flock: Ministering God's Grace Through Intercession is a recent release in the Practical Shepherding Series. This series, as clearly stated in it's name, seeks to provide practical help for pastors as they seek to lead their people. This is now the second volume that I have read in this series and I must say that the authors have definitely provided a series that offers quick, readable and highly beneficial books for pastors.In this volume titled, Pray for the Flock, Croft and Fullerton take on a discipline that is without dispute highly necessary for pastors and one that is also probably highly neglected. If most Christians were to examine their prayer life an honest take-away would be that we do not pray enough. And most of us in practice probably do not treat prayer with the serious focus that it deserves. The same holds true for pastors. The demands on a pastor's life can often take their free time, but also can intrude on time that would have been spent in study or prayer. As the authors note, the sermon has to get done so a pastor must set aside time for sermon preparation, but if busyness encroaches it is easy for prayer to get pushed aside. While this may be a common occurrence, it isn't a habit that a pastor should want to remain. As the authors state well, ""prayerlessness reveals our lack of taith and highlights our misplaced priorities."" Croft and Fullerton aim to encourage and equip pastors to give prayer its proper place and to make it a high priority.In the first chapter titled, A Call to Prayer, Ryan Fullerton lays out six truths to help make prayer a priority. These truths are: 1) Not praying for your people is a sin, 2) Praying for your people glorifies God, 3) We are called to imitate leaders who pray for their people, 4) Praying for your people reflects the priority of the early church, 5) Praying for God's people will lead them to change, and 6) Prayer is how ordinary men do extraordinary things for God.  These truths will challenge pastors to move away from prayerlessness and force them to lean on the Holy Spirit for the strength to change. In the first part of the book the authors walk the reader through the Bible's teaching on prayer. Here the authors show that it is mandatory for a pastor to pray for his people.  As Croft states, ""praying with people and pleading on their behalf before the Father are essential aspects of shepherding God's people. Pastors must pray. Elders must plead before God on behalf of their people. Leaders must lift to the throne of grace the needs of the church, both the church's needs as a whole and the needs of individual believers."" This first section is a wonderful reminder to pastors of their biblical duty to pray for their people.Part Two of the book tackles the practical application side of prayer. The chapter titled, Pray Deliberately, encourages pastors to prayer through their church membership roll so that all members are being prayed for. This section also gives practical advice on praying during public church gatherings, praying with other pastors, praying for God's global work, praying and fasting, and being equipped and ready to pray at special occasions. Each of these chapters is an encouragement and will surely bless any pastor who reads them. As I stated at the beginning, this is now the second book that I have read in the Practical Shepherding Series and I would highly recommend this book, as well as the series, to all pastors.I received a copy of this book from Zondervan in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5JAF7VNFHJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310519373#wasThisHelpful","R1I5JAF7VNFHJM","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently I received a digital copy of 30: Three Decades of Songs for the Church by Sovereign Grace Music to review. This album is a collection of 14 of their more well known songs.Below is the track listing:1) Let Your Kingdom Come2) All I Have is Christ3) Jesus, Thank You4) Behold Our God5) O Great God6) The Glories of Calvary7) Oh the Deep, Deep Love8) Now Why This Fear9) The Glory of the Cross10) I Will Glory in My Redeemer11) Greater Than We Can Imagine12) I Have a Shelter13) I Stand in Awe14) Before the Throne of God AboveEach of these songs is God-exalting, Gospel-rooted and Church-edifying. These songs are sung by guest such as: Kristyn Getty, Matt Papa, Matt Boswell, Sojourn, The Village Church, Enfield and more. Each of these artist offers a different take on classic Sovereign Grace songs. After listening to the album multiple times and listening to many of the original releases on previous albums this album has its own unique feel to it and does not just feel like a quickly thrown together selection of old songs just to make a new album. Many of the arrangements are drastically different than the previous versions and the guest artists provide their own unique singing styles to the songs.  I have been thoroughly blessed by this album as it has led to many days driving down the road and worshiping God through song!

"As a parent I would rather not have to talk to my kids about how to protect their bodies. I would rather live in a world where there was no danger of a sexual predator ever being alone around my children. It would, however, be the height of naiveté for me to ignore the darkness of sin and perversion in our world and to do nothing or say nothing to protect my children. Just because a topic of conversation is difficult does not mean that it is not a conversation worth having. Thankfully, Justin & Lindsey Holcomb with their new book God Made All of Me: A Book to Help Children Protect Their Bodies have provided a wonderful resource for parents or caregivers to talk to their children about how to protect their bodies.Parents have been given the duty and responsibility before God to teach and protect their children. As the authors rightly state ""education is important in preventing inappropriate sexual behavior or contact. By teaching children about their bodies and discussing appropriate and inappropriate touch you are helping them understand their ability to say 'No' to unwanted touch, which will help them if anyone ever tries to hurt them or trick them."" The authors are very helpful in discussing how God made our bodies, how we are in charge of our bodies, how it is ok to say ""no thanks"" even to appropriate touch like hugs, and the difference between appropriate and inappropriate touch. The discussion of the difference between a secret and a surprise is very helpful as well. The authors explain to kids that there is no need to keep secrets from their parents, because we have nothing to hide from each other. We may surprise each other with gifts, but this is a very different matter. As the mom in the book says ""Surprises are fun and make people happy. Secrets are different from surprises. Secrets are not nice, they can make people feel confused or sad.""The artwork in God Made All of Me is by Trish Mahoney and is done very well. Every page has a picture that complements the point the authors are making on that page. These pictures will certainly aid in helping children to understand how to protect their bodies. I do want to mention one area that may concern some parents. The authors chose to use proper names, rather than slang terms (or nicknames) many parents may use with their children, when discussing private parts. These names only appear on one page of the book and the authors explain to parents in a summary in the back of the book why they feel it is helpful to use proper names. They state, ""it might be uncomfortable at first, but use the proper names of body parts. Children need to know the proper name for genitals. This knowledge gives children correct language for understanding their bodies, for asking questions that need to be asked, and for telling about any behavior that could lead to sexual abuse."" While some parents may disagree with the use of proper names (although a disagreement should not drive parents away from this book), the authors intent is clear and commendable. I cannot honestly think of any reason why any parent would not find this book helpful and necessary. Sexual predators present a real danger and we have a God given responsibility to protect our children and should seek out resources to help us in doing that. God Made All of Me is one of those helpful resources and will certainly be a helpful book for any parent who uses it.I received a copy of this book from New Growth Press in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPAUEF72OE68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942572301#wasThisHelpful","R2LPAUEF72OE68","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There certainly aren't a shortage of books that are out today discussing the topic of prophecy. From Left Behind, to Blood Moons, books about prophecy, no matter how sound the thinking may be always gathers lots of attention. Thankfully, there are some solid resource out that deal with prophecy in a helpful way.  Understanding Prophecy: A Biblical-Theological Approach by Alan S. Bandy and Benjamin L. Merkle is one of those resources.In the Preface the authors state the purpose of the book very clearly, so instead of trying to reword their thoughts I will just share them.  They state:The goal of this book is not merely to explain various ""prophetic"" texts but primarily to give the reader a framework of how to interpret any passage in the context of the Bible. The reason for this framework for reading prophecy is simple: We cannot correctly understand the details of the Bible without also having a gras if the bigger picture. Evangelicals often dispute interpretations of various prophetic passages so that a consensus view proves elusive. Differences of opinion do not reflect varying levels of intelligence or diligence so much as different presuppositions, which lead to a different understanding of the whole. Unfortunately, many people are not aware of their presuppositions and consequently do not have a firm grasp of how an individual text fits into the larger picture of salvation history. Thus, we want to provide a biblical-theological perspective for interpreting prophecy.Chapters 1-3 provide the framework for how to approach and interpret prophetic passages from a biblical-theological perspective. Understanding redemptive history and having a Christ-centered view of Scripture are helpful in properly understanding prophecy and the authors are very helpful in this section. From there the authors move on to discussing Old Testament and New Testament prophecy. Even though the authors hold to differing millennial views, Bandy is a historic premillennialist and Merkle an amillennialist they show much agreement on how to interpret prophecy. Two areas of disagreement: What does 'All Israel"" in Romans 11:26 mean and the millennium are discussed in two Appendixes. I found this to be helpful, even though I have actually studied these area to some extent, because it provides a short summary of differing views that some readers may have never thought through.Overall I was very encouraged by this volume and I am thankful to have this as a resource that I will surely use for years to come.

"A few years ago I was introduced to Geerhardus Vos. I was studying some introductory works on Biblical Theology and kept noticing a title being referenced. That book was Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments which I subsequently purchased and which still has a prominent place on my bookshelf today. I have found Vos' writing to be both theologically rich and accessible.  Originally published in 1896 Reformed Dogmatics: Volume One: Theology Proper by Geerhardus Vos was a titled that was previously unavailable to English readers. Thankfully Lexham Press and Richard Gaffin Jr. (Translator and Editor) have now made available this systematic work from the gifted Biblical Theologian Vos.Reformed Dogmatics: Volume One: Theology Proper covers the being, attributes and work of God. This volume is divided into seven chapters. They are: 1) The Knowability of God 2) Names, Being, and Attributes of God 3) The Trinity 4) Of God's Decrees in General 5) The Doctrine of Predestination 6) Creation and 7) Providence. The topics covered in each section are addressed through a series of enumerated questions. The answers to each question are given in a concise statement or paragraph. While the questions do divide the text, I never got the feel that the work was disjointed. The questions flow smoothly from one to the next in a way that does not make for tedious reading. The best way to show both the clarity and depth with which Vos writes is to provide a short excerpt of one of his questions and answers. In his discussion on the Trinity he asks, and answers the following question:12. In which theses can you state the doctrine of the Trinity?a) There is only one divine being. Scripture expresses itself decisively against all polytheism (Deut 6:4; Isa 44:6; Jas 2:19)b) In this one God there are three modes of existence, which we refer to by the word ""person"" and which are, each one, this only true God. In Scripture these three persons are called, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.c) These three persons, although together the one true God, are nevertheless distinguished from each other insofar as they assume objective relations toward each other, address each other, love each other, and can interact with each other.d) Although these three persons possess one and the same divine substance, Scripture nevertheless teaches us that, concerning their personal existence, the Father is the first, the Son the second, and the Holy Spirit the third, that the Son is of the Father, the Spirit of the Father and the Son. Further, their workings outwardly reflect this order of personal existence, since the Father works through the Son, and the Father and Son work through the Spirit. There is, therefore, subordination as to personal manner of existence and manner of working, but no subordination regarding possession of the one divine substance.e) The divine substance is not divided among the three persons as if each possesses one-third. Neither is it a new substance beside the three persons. Finally, neither is it an abstraction of our thinking in a nominalistic sense. But in a manner for which all further analogy is lacking, each of these persons possesses the entire divine substance.I chose this example because the Trinity is possibly the most difficult doctrine in Christianity for our finite minds to comprehend. I think that Vos' comments provide a helpful and clear definition of what is meant when we speak of the Trinity. This is the type of thought and clarity that can be found throughout this work.  The back of the book provides a Question Index, a Subject and Author Index, and a Scripture Index. The Question Index is incredibly helpful. Here each question is listed without the answer, making it an excellent resource to quickly navigate to a desired topic or question.The editing of this book is simply outstanding. The dust jacket is very nicely designed and looks good on a bookshelf. The book itself has a high quality binding on it. The text itself is very crisp and clear. I read a lot and have come to notice that not all paper and ink are alike and the quality of the print in this book makes it very easy on the eyes during extended reading. Overall, I am very pleased with this work and am thankful for the publishers, editors and translation work. This is an excellent resource for the church and I highly recommend it.I received a copy of this book from Lexham Press in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AG4KYAK2F7OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=157799583X#wasThisHelpful","R3AG4KYAK2F7OQ","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the Preface to this set the publisher writes: ""The Old Testament commentaries of Derek Kidner (1913-2008) have been a standard for a generation. His work has been a model of conciseness, clarity and insight.""  It is these three descriptors: conciseness, clarity and insight that I was hoping to find in this two book set. While sold individually (Psalms 1-72 and Psalms 73-150) I have chosen to do the review as a set since the majority of the time I would think they would be purchased together. The perk of being able to buy separately is a lower buy in cost for one book if the reader wants to have a hands on look at the commentary before committing to the set. Either way I want to briefly look at whether this set meets the aforementioned thoughts from the publisher.Volume One from Derek Kidner covers Psalms 1-72 and also provides a 50 page introduction. Sometimes introductions to commentaries can be glossed over but I would highly recommend taking the time to read through this introduction. Here Kidner discusses poetry, the layout of the Psalter trends in the study of the Psalms, the Messianic hope as well as some of the technicalities to Psalm reading.  I found the section on Titles and Technical Terms to be very useful. There are so many different names and terms throughout the Psalter (i.e. David, Solomon, Heman the Ezrahite, Miktam, Maskil) as well as the many according to's (The choirmaster, The Sheminith, The Gittith, to Mahalath, etc.) that it is easy to forget exactly what the term or description means. This section provides a quick reference for a short defining statement to clarify for the reader.From here Volume One also covers Book One and Two of the Psalter with Volume Two covering Books Three, Four and Five. I really appreciated the layout that Kidner uses for his commentary. He begins Each Psalm with a bold heading and name. From there he provides a short paragraph or two summary of what the theme of the Psalm is.  He then begins his commentary notes by taking a few verses at a time. Each of these sections is divided again with bold chapter and verse font with a description. This layout makes it very easy to flip through the commentary and arrive at the section the reader is looking for very quickly. I found Kidner's notes to be clear and helpful in seeing the main theme of each Psalm. His writing style is definitely to the point as there isn't a lot of fluff or over explanation. Overall, I think this would be a valuable commentary set for a Pastor as well as anyone looking for an in depth study into the Psalter.Priced at $18.00 each will certainly make this one of the most affordable commentaries on the book of Psalms. While not as thorough as some of the other larger volumes that are available this set by Kidner is certainly not one to be overlooked and for the price it is a great deal to pick up for anyone preaching through the Psalms or taking up a personal study of the Psalter.I received a copy of this commentary set from IVP Academic in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32BC02KL8L53W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830829385#wasThisHelpful","R32BC02KL8L53W","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the great perks to writing reviews has been being introduced to many commentaries that I would have otherwise not known.  This is certainly true of Galatians from the EP Study Commentary Series by Peter Barnes.  I am always eager when receiving a new commentary to explore the style in which it is written and its range of use. For example, is this written exclusively for Pastors/Teachers or will other church members looking to enhance their study find it profitable as well. Below, I will try to briefly comment on the layout of the commentary and then the content of the commentary.Barnes begins his commentary on Galatians with an introductory section that covers the background, dating and structure of the epistle.  This section is written in chapter form and is presented in a very readable way. I did find the structure of the epistle section to be different than most commentaries. Here one typically finds some sort of outline of the layout of the book. Barnes instead chose to write a concise two paragraphs discussing the layout. While this isn't as profitable as a reference to come back to it does make the outline something that the reader can read in full. The terms Barnes uses here are the same terms that divide the commentary making it a helpful reference as well.  Perhaps the most helpful section in the introduction is Barnes' examination of the New Perspectives view.  Galatians is a polemic for justification by faith and is very strongly worded towards those who would add to this.  Barnes is quite helpful here in seeing how the New Perspectives brings with it confusion that must be handled seriously. As he states, ""the 'New Perspective' is certainly that. It has radical implications for our understanding of salvation. Because Wright misunderstands the nature of faith, he grounds assurance on the wrong basis....The result, in the end, is a kind of Christianized Judaism. If, as Luther maintained, the distinction between law and gospel contains 'the sum of all Christian doctrine', then the effect of the New Perspective is to muddy the waters again."" Barnes is dead on in his examination and the implications of this view.Moving into the commentary Barnes presents a layout that almost feels devotional as far as the way the chapter divisions go, but is loaded with content.  Each section is titled and then offers a brief introductory sentence or two.  From there the passage is written in a different font which makes it stand out somewhat. From here Barnes moves into his commentary on the passage. As he works through the passage each word or phrase from the passage is written in bold. This is helpful as the commentary itself is written in a continuous paragraph style (again, making it read more like a book than a commentary) but the bold font allows the reader to quickly find the section of Scripture that they may be looking for. I found Barnes commentary notes to be quite beneficial. It is clear that he has consulted many resources and pull his thoughts together nicely in what is a very readable commentary. Certainly some of the content may be a little heavy for the average reader, but I am sure that anyone who would pick up this commentary to help their study of Galatians would find it beneficial. Many sections also have a short Application section as well.  While not as extensive as some other commentaries that a geared towards contemporary application I found Barnes' short application notes to be helpful as well. For example, the application note for Galatians 6:1 ""You who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness"" begins with an excellent exhortation. Barnes states, ""dealing with the sin of a fellow believer is one of the most difficult and spiritual tasks that the Christian believer ever has to carry out.

"The Glory of a True Church by Benjamin Keach is the second release in the Baptist Reprints Series from Free Grace Press.  These reprints are making lesser known works from our Baptist forefathers available at a reasonable price.  This most recent release focuses on church discipline.  If I had to chose one subject that is either greatly misunderstood or largely ignored it would probably be church discipline.  Keach's book was originally published so that the masses could have access to a book on church discipline that was small in size. I think that this reprint will serve much in the same capacity.The Glory of a True Church is small in size, 86 pages, and presents a clear and understandable look at church discipline. Keach states his purpose was ""to write a small and plain tract concerning the rules of the discipline of a gospel church; that all men may not only know our faith, but see order in this case also."" This need was great in his day as it is today. As Keach says, ""certainly, ignorance of the rules of discipline causes no small trouble and disorders in our churches."" This book serves as an excellent concise look at the nature and purpose of church discipline.I found Keach's questions that he poses and answers throughout the book to be very helpful. Here he addresses common questions or objections that may arise when talking about church discipline. These are helpful as they supplement the straightforward teaching of each chapter nicely. Overall, I found this book to be a great blessing. Even more than this book, the series promises to continue to be an excellent source for provided quality Baptist Reprints at a reasonable cost.I received a copy of this book from Free Grace Press in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D495WCZAIB1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599255057#wasThisHelpful","R3D495WCZAIB1I","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's no secret that sexual sin has become one of the most devastating sins in the church. Families, Lives and sometimes churches get destroyed when men's lives get out of control and sexual sin becomes their god and brings with it hurt, pain and ruin. So, what should the churches response to this problem be? Programs are good. Rehab is helpful. Putting up fences for protection is also necessary. All of these deal with correcting issues on the surface and while offering a level of protection they do nothing to change the heart.  What is needed is gospel power to change men from the inside out. Love for Christ needs to penetrate men's hearts to the level that it drives out the affection for lust, pornography or whatever other sexual sin may grip men. In Hide or Seek: When Men Get Real With God About Sex John Freeman points men to Christ and the power of the gospel to change our affections as the only real hope for lasting change.Freeman divides those who struggle  with sexual sin up into three categories: God-Haters, Idol-Makers, and Game-Players. A God-Hater is someone who constantly gives in to sexual sin and begins to feel that God is not able to or never will ""do anything redemptive about it all."" This person can begin to reject some of God's attributes like his omniscience, not wanting ""to acknowledge that he sees not only what we do, but also what we think and desire in our hearts - things no one else knows."" If we are not quick to run to Christ and recognize the power of His forgiveness to change us then we will begin to hate this aspect of God.  The next group Freeman discusses are Idol-Makers. Idol-Makers are those who turn to something other than God whenever the stress and anxiety of life are turned up. Where do we run to for comfort or stress release when things are tough. If it is to some sexual sin then we have an idolatry problem.  The last group Freeman discusses are the Game-Players. This group looks like they have it all together and may be on the surface fruitful in their ministry at church and at home. But, they are actually just playing a game.From here Freeman points each group to Christ. We must know the power of the gospel in our lives, we must know what our status is before God and we must know that He doesn't intend to leaves us in the pit of sexual sin. When we sin so often we begin to look at our ""record"" before God and feel as if the gap is too large, the distance to great for us to be able to come to Him and enjoy intimate fellowship. We must recognize the truth of our justification at this point or we will just be driven further from God and further into sexual sin. In Christ, we are forgiven, and that means that God looks at us and sees Christ's righteousness. Help is found here and in the context of community at church. Isolation will not help with sexual sin. We must be joined together with other sinners who may sin differently but nonetheless recognize our status in Christ and His ability to change from the inside-out.I found this book to be a very encouraging look at sexual sin for men. Instead of giving them a hefty to do list that will only add one more burden, Freeman points men to Christ early and often as He is the only one capable of producing lasting change and victory over sexual sin.

"The Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary Series is a new commentary series from Holman Reference edited by David Platt, Daniel Akin and Tony Merida.  The editor's goal is ""to present an easy reading, practical and friendly commentary"" and ""to exalt Jesus from every book of the Bible.""  In the introduction the editors lay out four distinguishing characteristics for the series.They are:1) This series seeks to display exegetical accuracy. The desire is to handle God's Word faithfully, even while every volume may not be verse-by-verse commentary.2) The series has busy pastors in view by presenting its material in a readable, pastoral style rather than academic.3) A desire to be known for the ""inclusion of helpful illustrations and theological driven applications.4) To exalt Christ in every book of the Bible. They carefully state that, ""we are not commending wild allegory or fanciful typology.  We must be constrained to the meaning intended by the divine Author Himself, the Holy Spirit of God.  However, we also believe that the Bible has a Messianic focus, and the authors in this series will exalt Christ from all of their texts.""Some of the authors that will contribute to this series that is projected to be 48 volumes are: David Platt, Daniel Akin, Tony Merida, Al Mohler, Eric Mason, Mark Dever, Russ Moore, Matt Chandler, Francis Chan, Thabiti Anyabwile, J.D. Greear and Paige Patterson.  This is a very respectable list of pastors and authors to contribute to this series.Exalting Jesus in 1 & 2 Thessalonians by Mark Howell will definitely serve as a useful resource for the pastor/teacher or lay-person.  Each section first presents the ""Main Idea"" of the text.  This is what the author see as the main point that the biblical author is trying to convey in the text.  Next a brief outline is provided to give the reader a visual of the flow of the passage at hand.  After this is the main section, the exposition.  Here Howell provides a very nice clear, concise exposition of the text.  This isn't a commentary that is going to dig deep into the languages or sentence structure but rather reads much more like a devotional commentary.  Each section ends with questions to help solidify what was just read into the reader's mind.The greatest benefit to these commentaries is their readability and keeping the main idea as the main focal point of the commentary.  An example of this can be seen in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. While I disagree with the conclusion Howell comes to regarding Christ second coming and his pretrib, premill view, he makes sure that this is not his focal point.  Howell points the reader to the fact that ""Paul teaches them to look back and be grateful for what Jesus has done and to look ahead and be hopeful for what Jesus is going to do.""  His commentary on the Thessalonians being uniformed is helpful as well. Howell states that ""Paul clearly reveals that their grief and hopelessness was the direct result of their failure to understand death from God's perspective."" From here Howell moves into his particular eschatological view, but he makes sure that he addresses it as a secondary issue and is not dogmatic about it.  This makes the commentary beneficial to readers of a different view point as they will be able to still glean overall truths from his commentary.I have now read multiple volumes in this series and each has been a blessing. This is one of the most accessible commentaries that I have come across.  I was blessed by this commentary and found it very helpful and look forward to future volumes in this series.

"Early on in my Christian life I was introduced to Martyn Lloyd-Jones in his book Studies on the Sermon on the Mount.  I was taken in by the way in which he preached and how it translated into written form. He spoke in a way that was doctrinally deep, engaging and understandable. Over the course of the years my fondness for Lloyd-Jones remains as I find him helpful every time I read his work. For this reason I am thankful to Crossway for publishing Experiencing the New Birth: Studies in John 3, 24 previously unreleased sermons on John 3.Lloyd-Jones is very well known for his exposition.  He may be unmatched in this area throughout the entire history of the Church. John 3 is a vital chapter of the Bible. Being born again should be a topic that does not grow old for us and we must also realize the depths that this truth really has.  It is not a thought to be brushed past lightly but rather one to meditate on deeply.  Lloyd-Jones' exposition will provide the resource to do just that. His exposition is always helpful and coming to a better understanding of God's Word.  Anyone who is looking to study John 3 would do well to purchase this book. Crossway has done the church well by publishing these previously unpublished sermons.I received a digital copy of this book from Crossway in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMGNTOE1UZAKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433539608#wasThisHelpful","RMGNTOE1UZAKH","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Preaching With Accuracy by Randy Pelton is a helpful book for pastors to find the main idea of a text and then apply it appropriately.  As Pelton states, "" the first skill is the ability to identify the dominant meaning of a preaching portion....the second skill is the ability to follow the language or concepts in a preaching portion to the gospel. Having arrived at the gospel, the preacher is able to show how God-in-Christ-through-the-Spirit makes the preaching portion mean something for the Church.""  Both of these skills are vitally important. A pastor/teacher must be able to identify the big idea of a text as well as know how and where it fits into the grand theme of Scripture.Preaching With Accuracy begins with one of the more important questions with regard to preaching: Does Exposition Still Work?  Pelton is clear that is we answer 'no' to this question then there is no need to explore how to preach with greater accuracy.  There is plenty of topical preaching in American Christianity and I am thankful that Pelton stated his view of the supremacy of expositional preaching clearly and upfront. Next, Pelton works with the reader in finding the main idea of a text and how to differentiate between the main idea and other smaller ideas that may be present as well.  This is important because if we miss the main idea of a passage then we miss what God was intending to communicate through the author.  We can ""park on"" and communicate a small truth but miss the main point of the passage.Pelton continues throughout the book to guide the reader into a better understanding of how to approach the preaching portion.  I found the book to be very helpful and a nice blend of many other books on preaching that I have read.  Pelton provides many examples for the reader to practice as ideas are presented.  This is helpful in that it gives the reader a guideline for the text and then a practical example to try.  There are even blank spaces for the reader to fill in his thoughts, rather than just reading what Pelton found in the text and then moving on. Overall, I found the book to be quite helpful and will definitely use it as a reference in the future.I received a copy of this book from Kregel Academic & Ministry in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11YZQ5F2MXO38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825443288#wasThisHelpful","R11YZQ5F2MXO38","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marriage is difficult. Placing two sinners in the same living quarters and having them structure their lives around each other can be problematic.  Thankfully, none of this caught God off guard. He planned marriage to be a reflection of the love that His Son has for the Church. A marriage with Christ as the center is what God intends and in the When Sinners Say I Do Video Series with Dave Harvey takes the viewers through 8 sessions to explore what Scripture says in relation to building a healthy marriage.  Drawing from 20 plus years of pastoral experience and 32 years of marriage Harvey is an excellent source for wisdom in how to relate to one another.Each sessions is around 20 minutes long with some topics covering two sessions.  The session topics are: Sin Part 1, Sin Part 2, Design, Contentment, Mercy Part 1, Mercy Part 2, Sex and Stubborn Grace.  These sessions are Word centered with Harvey working from multiple text throughout the sessions.  The text of Scripture as well as other quotes that Harvey uses are shown on screen with him and show up very nicely on the blue background.  The style of this DVD is simple, but it works well. These sessions have been a blessing to my wife and I so far and I am sure they will continue to be in the future. This would be a great resource for Pastors to use in counseling or small group settings.One note: In one of the sessions when talking about the prodigal son Harvey paraphrases by saying he spent his money on hookers.  I felt that this was unnecessary and it reminded me of so many younger pastors who feel the need to be crude or shocking to make their point. It didn't fit well with the overall lesson and was not the norm for Harvey in these sessions.I received a copy of this DVD from Shepherd Press via Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TOVIJ8BASGT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633420922#wasThisHelpful","R3TOVIJ8BASGT9","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sadly, we all have blind spots in our lives.  Areas that we do not see as we ought to, as Christ did.  What is even more sad is often times we see other believers who are gifted different than we are as the enemy.  We seek out the negative instead of the positive and focus on it.  So, instead of being a unified church doing kingdom work we can quickly become divided and hinder our witness to the world.  In Blind Spots: Becoming a Courageous, Compassionate and Commissioned Church, Collin Hansen defines three different types of Christians and examines both the strengths and weaknesses of each group.The classifications that Hansen uses are: Courageous, Compassionate and Commissioned.  In the Foreword Tim Keller provides a helpful overview of these classifications.  He states, ""The 'courage' group stands valiantly for the truth; the 'compassion' people stress service, listening, and engagement; while the 'commissioned' folks are all about building up the church and reaching the lost. Once things are broken down like that, it becomes clear that these should be strands in a single cord. Each group goes bad to the degree it distances itself from the others."" It is along this line of thinking that Hansen explores these three groups, examining the strengths and weaknesses of each.  If a church can become unified around Christ and the gospel and recognize that each member of the body will be gifted differently by God then it can keep from becoming warped and having blind spots where it neglects one' of these areas.  The chart below breaks down these three groupings with positive characteristics listed in yellow and blind spots in greenHansen says that ""we talk a lot about church unity. So where is the evidence that we actually want it?...You lament the divided church, yet you're quick to speak about the problems you see with other believers.""  I know this is so true in my life.  It is so much easier to write-off other believers than to actually take the time and effort to get to know them as a brother or sister in Christ.  We can so often treat our Christian family as if they are the enemy. The solution is to compare ourselves to Christ instead of comparing other believers to ourselves. As Hansen states, ""When you and I compare ourselves to Christ, we get unity because we see our sin and forgive one another as God forgave us....When you and I compare ourselves to Christ, we're more impressed with the grace he lavished on us than with our own contributions to the kingdom.""Ultimately looking at Jesus as our example is the solution to our blind spots. As Hansen says, ""Almost everyone loves something about Jesus. Some of us love his courage to endure the scorn and shame of the cross. Others love his compassion to associate with sinners and liberate the oppressed. Still more love his compassion for the disciples to heal the sick and cast out demonic spirits. It's harder, though, to love the real Jesus who does all this and more, then calls us to follow in his steps. We often seize on one aspect of his character and ministry and brandish it as a weapon against other believers."" The call of this book is to recognize different believer's giftings as from God and to work together to further the advance of the gospel. To do this we must first, examine our lives and our hearts to see what blind spots we have, repent and love our brothers and sisters in Christ.You can check out a free excerpt of Blind Spots here.I received a copy of this book from Crossway in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BTBRC2DJVWDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=143354623X#wasThisHelpful","R1BTBRC2DJVWDQ","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The One O'Clock Miracle: A True Story About Trusting the Words of Jesus is a new children's book written by Alison Mitchell and Illustrated by Catalina Echeverri.  This book tells the account of Jesus healing the officials son found in John 4:46-54.  The retelling of the story is done in a way that is sure to grab and keep the attention of young minds.  It is a sad truth that many ""Christian"" children's books simply cannot be trusted to be faithful to the text. However, The One O'Clock Miracle is biblically faithful and turns young minds to the wonderful story of a man who trusted the words of Christ. That is certainly a truth that we as Christians parents should want to place before our children.The artwork is very well done and compliments the story very well.  The pictures are well done, colorful and full of detail.  They really do add to the story in a way that shows that time and attention to detail was put into the illustration of this book.  In a time when the book market can sometimes seem to be flooded with sub-par books for children, The One O'Clock Miracle will be quite a blessing to families looking for a quality book that will entertain their children and teach them the truths of God's Word.I received a copy of this book from The Good Book Company via Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE5T6PV3QDGX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910307432#wasThisHelpful","RE5T6PV3QDGX4","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Reformation Commentary on Scripture is a wonderful commentary series that lets the reader see first hand how Scripture was interpreted during the Reformation time period.  This volume provides its reader with a vast array of well known, not so well known, and probably unknown commentators on Luke's Gospel.  The work by the project staff that has gone into pulling all of the information together is truly commendable and a great gift to the modern day church.  In the introduction Timothy George, the General Editor, list four goals of this series.  They are:1) The enrichment of contemporary biblical interpretation through exposure to Reformation-era biblical exegesis.2) The renewal of contemporary preaching through exposure to the biblical insights of the Reformation writers.3) A deeper understanding of the Reformation itself and the breadth of perspectives represented within it.4) The recovery of the robust spiritual theology and devotional treasures of the Reformation's engagement with the Bible.This commentary on Luke accomplishes each of these goals.The commentary is presented in a very easy to follow way.  I was very curious about how it would flow, given the vast amount of contributors in it.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised both by the content and the ease of knowing who the original author was and the source that it came out of.  Each section begins with a passage of Scripture with a given title (i.e. Luke 11:14-26 Jesus and His Power Over Demons). The Scripture is from the ESV and is double column and italicized across the top of the page.  Each section of Scripture then has an Overview section, which gives a summary of the thoughts that follow.  Each topic in the passage is identified by a bold font making it easy to scan through the sections.  Each commentary section begins with the author (i.e. John Calvin) in all caps and is followed directly by the commentary on the section and ends with the reference (i.e. Commentary on a Harmony of the Gospels).  The order that is provided by this layout is very beneficial to the reader for a variety of reasons:1) It allows the reader to clearly identify who the Reformation author is and from what writing this excerpt came from.2) If the reader is scanning through the commentary with the intent of finding a particular passage the bold font and headings makes it easy to quickly find the passage you are looking for3) It is easy to compare how different writers of the Reformation chose to comment and expound on the Scripture passage.4) The original reference makes it easy to follow up by consulting the original source, if available.I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled to ""meet"" many new voices from the Reformation period through this commentary.  I was also blessed by the short biographical sketch in the back of the volume that gives the reader a short introduction to those writers he may not be familiar with.  There is also an eleven page timeline of the Reformation in the back of this volume that is an excellent historical resource.I cannot express again how wonderfully smooth this commentary reads while at the same time keeping the original authors voices.  The reader doesn't get what the editor thinks Calvin, Luther etc. said about a text but instead they get the authors own words.  It is truly commendable what the editors have done in bringing together all of these voices.  Instead of having to flip from commentary to commentary, or browse the internet the reader can simply read through the section and have a wonderful flow to their study.  Also, many of the original writings may not be accessible the way some of the more well known writers are.  I am truly blessed by this commentary and feel that it would be a great addition to both pastors and lay-persons libraries.I received a free copy of this commentary from IVP Academic in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LFQA48WKQG7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830829660#wasThisHelpful","R3LFQA48WKQG7X","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live in a restless world.  People constantly shift jobs, houses, churches....you name it and we move from what we hold sacred now to something completely different in just a short time.  We shouldn't be surprised when this happens in the world, but the problem that Michael Horton addresses in Ordinary is when this restlessness creeps into the church.The world is always after the next big thing. What was popular last month, or sometimes even last week quickly gets sidelined by what is popular now.  The sporting world is a prime example.  The new, young, hot athlete makes headlines and everyone begins to follow his every move and quickly forgets about the guy that was new, and young last week.  The problem with this creeping into Christianity is that it leaves believers chasing after the next big ministry opportunity or church movement instead of faithfully chugging along where God has placed them.  We can quickly come to the wrong conclusion that God only uses Christian ""rock stars"" and has no need of the Christian plumber in small town America. And so, the Christian plumber is not content serving God where God has placed him and longs for something new and different. The truth is that God has all types of people in all types of places for His glory and for our good.  Horton continually points the reader to this truth to counteract the restlessness that we can all feel at times.Horton expresses this seeking after the next big thing well by stating,  ""The regular preaching of Christ from all of the Scriptures, baptism, the Supper, the prayers of confession and praise, and all of the other aspects of ordinary Christian fellowship are seen as too ordinary."" Horton is also on point when he describes how so many view church. He says, ""We choose a local church the way we chose a neighborhood, a phone company, or a new car. We might become a member, or we might not. There may not even be membership (since that would be too formal and interfere with a person's relationship with Christ). Instead church leaders will bend over backwards to make sure people (at least the right people) are happy, because they know that you can go to the church down the highway, one that has a wider menu of options."" Sadly, Horton is dead on with one of the major problems in American Christianity and that is consumerism.Horton is engaging and on point with his arguments and reasoning. I have come to love reading Horton and he is on the top of his game in Ordinary.  I highly recommend this to all believers, especially those who may lead what they feel to be rather ordinary lives.  There are shifts in church culture constantly and we would do well to ground our faith in the One who never changes rather than in what is new and current.  Horton points the reader to the One who brings ""sustainable faith in a radical, restless world.""I received a copy of this book from Zondervan in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAD7E22UQTOWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310517370#wasThisHelpful","RAD7E22UQTOWE","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Books on evangelism come in many different shades.  One can quickly find a book that implements a system of questions to present to everyone which can often times result in cold evangelism that lacks a personal side.  On the other end of the spectrum one can find books that tell the reader to just ""share their story"" or ""live the Gospel."" This approach confuses ones testimony with the Gospel and can lean so heavily on relationships that we spend more time just being friends with people and forget to get around to the good news.  The first group can often times offend people, but not with the Gospel, but rather their approach. The second group hardly ever offends anyone, one reason is because the good news is watered-down and disguised so it doesn't offend.  What we need is what Rico Tice presents in Honest Evangelism.From the very beginning Tice reminds the reader that we are sent out as ""sheep among wolves"" and if we accurately and consistently share the Gospel with people we are going to get hurt.  There will be people who don't like us because the message of Christ will offend them.  We can and must expect this and yet still move forward in love to share the Gospel regardless of the cost.  In Chapter Two Tice ask and answers a very important question: Is It Worth It?  The three truths that Tice presents as fuel for evangelism are 1) The glory of Jesus 2) The guarantee of a new creation and 3) The grim reality of death and hell.  These are excellent motivations.  So often we can be motivated by guilt rather than these three points and Tice makes sure that we begin this book on evangelism with the right frame of mind.To combat our fear or the thought that we must save people Tice reminds the reader of three valuable truths: 1) God is Sovereign 2) God is Gracious and 3) God is Powerful.  If these are true (and the are) then God is capable of saving people through the presentation of the Gospel by His grace and power.  This frees us to share the Gospel with others and trust God with the results.  I found Tice's book to be highly encouraging.  It is pointed in the fact that the reader can't escape seeing the need to evangelize and yet it is gracious, not guilt-tripping the reader into evangelizing.  I would highly recommend this book alongside others like Evangelism by Mack Stiles and Tell the Truth by Will Metzger.I received a copy of this book from The Good Book Company via Cross Focused Reviews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV0I8CC4XZSOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=190991939X#wasThisHelpful","RV0I8CC4XZSOO","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who Is Jesus? by Greg Gilbert is a new release with a title that poses a question that is worth everyone's consideration.  Was Jesus God, man, a good teacher, a moral example.....?  Anyone who is honest with themselves and is thoughtful should want to search out what Jesus claimed about Himself and if these claims are valid.  Gilbert writes in a way that is engaging for believer and unbeliever alike.  For the believer this short book will both encourage and provide a resource.  For the unbeliever, ""give Jesus a chance. It may be that as you learn more about him, you’ll realize that there are actually some very good reasons for believing what he said—about himself, about God, and about you.""Gilbert works through some of Jesus' major claims in this book to show that He is indeed God. For instance, ""Jesus said things like, “I and the Father [by which he meant God] are one,” and, “If you have seen me, you have seen the Father.” And, maybe most shocking of all, “No one comes to the Father except through me.” You see what I mean? Ordinary people don’t say those sorts of things! God and I are one? No one comes to God except by me? Those aren’t ethical teachings that you can decide to incorporate into your life or not. They are claims. They are Jesus saying what he thinks is the truth.""  Gilbert continues: Jesus’s reply to that question rocked them. He said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.”There’s that name again, and Jesus’s use of it was deliberate and confrontational. How do we know that? Because otherwise what he said is simply bad grammar. Even if Jesus just wanted to say that he pre-existed Abraham somehow, he would have said, “Before Abraham was, I was.” But by using the present tense—“I AM”—Jesus was clearly taking for himself, again, the unique and exclusive name of God. That’s why they picked up stones in order to stone him. If he wasn’t really God—and they didn’t think he was—then he had committed the worst kind of blasphemy."" Claims like these make the case that Jesus was just an ordinary man, moral example, and never claimed to be God a little hard to hold on to.The ultimate purpose of studying to find out who Jesus is is tied into His death and resurrection. It is here that Gilbert is truly excellent.  He shows man's sinfulness, man's need for a Savior, what Christ came to do and what His death and resurrection secure for the believer.  Gilbert clearly says, ""Jesus didn’t come only to show us authentic, God-intended humanness. No, Jesus became human because we needed him to do so. We needed someone to represent us before God and be our substitute. That’s ultimately why Jesus came—to be a loving Warrior King who would save his beloved people.""  AMEN.  Our desperate need is only met in Christ, a truth that Gilbert clearly delivers to the reader.Gilbert closes his book with a statement that is worth closing this review with: ""I hope that in reading this book, you’ve realized that if nothing else, that isn’t a question that can be nicely ignored. Whatever you wind up thinking about Jesus, the fact remains that he makes strong, even invasive claims about you and your relationship to God. Sure, you can ignore those claims—you can ignore anything if you try hard enough—but when somebody says, “You are a rebel against the God who made you, and his sentence against you is death. But I have come to stand in your place, to take that penalty, and to save you,” that’s something you probably should pay attention to.""  A claim worth investigating, as eternity is at stake.If you are a believer buy this book so that you will have an excellent resource to engage with unbelieving friends.  If you are an unbeliever buy this book and spend a few hours with it, and see if Jesus is worth the attention that Christians seem to give Him.I received a digital copy of this book from Crossway in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27T1X50QSO8TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433543508#wasThisHelpful","R27T1X50QSO8TB","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few months ago I began teaching a Sunday School class through Romans 8.  Over the course of the study we have often times ""parked"" for a week on a key word or phrase and discussed it in the attempt to better understand what Paul is saying.  I think this has been helpful, but one risk is that we can get so focused on individual words that we miss the big picture.  To guard against this I usually try to remember the big themes from chapter eight as well as the entire book.  This helps me set my vision on Paul's overall picture and how the present text relates to it.Around the same time that this teaching started I also received a copy of Grace Has Come: Songs From the Book of Romans by Sovereign Grace Music.  I love the Book of Romans so I was eager to see how they were able to transfer it to song.  After listening through it roughly 15-20 times I must say that the breadth and depth of lyrics are amazing.  The great themes of Romans show up in every song and for anyone who is relatively familiar with Paul's letter will recognize the flow of the album through the book of Romans.  Songs like Grace and Peace provide memorable verses like:Grace and peace, oh how can this beThe matchless King of allPaid the blood price for meSlaughtered lamb, what atonement You bring!The vilest sinner's heartCan be cleansed, can be freeOh, what an amazing mysteryWhat an amazing mysteryThat Your grace has come to meAfter a few listens through I found myself humming these words, and many others like these to myself. One of the great things about music is its ability to become memorable rather quickly.With so many options available for Christians as it relates to music these days, I think it is a blessing to have Sovereign Grace Music and their desire to promote God-honoring, Bible-saturated lyrics.  As I listen through this album over and over again the great themes of Romans start to rattle around in my mind and that is a very good thing!  Modern music styles and theologically rich lyrics are a rare combination, it seems, but Sovereign Grace Music has delivered just that combination in this album. I highly recommend it.I received a digital copy of this album from Sovereign Grace Music in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DR1DVPVDY89L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZ6QC76#wasThisHelpful","R3DR1DVPVDY89L","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the great perks to reviewing books is the opportunity to come across books/resources that otherwise I would have been completely unaware of.  Such is the case with Why Christmas? by Barbara Reaoch. This family devotional is intended to be used for the month of December leading up to Christmas Day.The lay out of the devotion is quite simple and effective.  Each day begins with a Scripture passage or two followed by a short section that explains the passage.  I found these ""Listen"" sections to be written in a clear, concise manner.  The points being made about Scripture are written well for young ears.  The next section ""Truth"" is a short summary sentence that provides a truth about Christ.  The ""Discuss"" section allows for interaction between parent/child.  Here parents are provided short questions to engage their children with.  The ""Memorize"" section works through a passage of Scripture to memorize over the course of the week.  The last section ""Sing"" allows for a time to sing as a family.

"Four Spiritual Laws, Five Steps, Romans Road.....while well intentioned and packed with truth many times these forms of evangelism can come across as cold and robotic. Often times, though not the intent, the person being witnessed to can feel more like a project and less like a person who we are interested in getting to know. The Unbelievable Gospel: Say Something Worth Believing by Jonathan Dodson is a new book that seeks to give a fresh look at evangelism and some of these methods.Dodson states that ""though it is unintentional, 'modern' forms of evangelism have generated gospel witness that is impersonal, preachy, intolerant, and uninformed about the real questions people ask. These encounters can result in not much witness to the gospel at all. such repeated experiences create a distaste for evangelism, not only in the mouths of non-Christians but also among Christians."" From personal experience I would certainly say that this rings true.  Often times formal evangelism is received as a sales pitch, where taking the time to interact with people and engage them with the gospel is received better, even if repentance and faith are not the response of the person being witnessed to. We must never change the gospel message, but we must be aware of how we are presenting the gospel. As Dodson says, ""the pressure we feel to share the gospel doesn't translate into the loving concern we may genuinely have for them. Instead, our compulsion bleeds through, coming across as a pressure sale, and people feel like a means to an end, a project. Even when what we ay is true and we have good intentions, the way we say it can make people wish we weren't talking."" Again, DO NOT CHANGE THE MESSAGE, but are we presenting the gospel as the good news that it is or as a sales pitch or something we feel guilty about not doing, so we etch out some formal time once a week/month to do it in.Dodson spends the first two parts of the book dealing with these types of reasons that make evangelism burdensome for us and the unbeliever and then re-centers our eyes on the gospel. Dodson's understanding of the shortfalls of these methods is to be commended. It is here, though, that I must address my issues with the book.  In seeking to correct these ""methods"" Dodson seems to over-correct and lean almost solely on friendship evangelism.  I think I know what he is trying to say, the landscape of our world has shifted and we as Christians need to recognize this and seek out ways to engage people, I just think he does a poor job of saying it.  I also, did not like the terms Gospel Metaphors as ways to share the gospel.  Those ""metaphors"" being: acceptance, hope, intimacy, tolerance and approval.  A Metaphor is ""a word or phrase for one thing that is used to refer to another thing in order to show or suggest that they are similar."" (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metaphor) The problem is that Dodson speaks of metaphors like acceptance (justification) but these are not metaphors for the gospel they are outcomes of the gospel.  The gospel is what God has done on the Cross through Christ in punishing the sins of His people so that they may be brought back into a right relationship with Him.  The outcome of the gospel story is that we are accepted, have hope, intimacy, tolerance and approval.  These are truths, but they are not the gospel. Failure to communicate the gospel and instead focus on these ""metaphors"" can very easily turn evangelism into a man centered activity rather than a proclamation of what God has done. The danger can be to seek out what our hearer is missing in their life and then fill the gap with God.  God isn't a gap filler though, He is a Sovereign King. It is here that the books falls short for me.  Dodson recognizes the shift in our culture, and for that he is to be commended, but his approach to the shift left something to be desired.For a better picture of biblical evangelism I would recommend Tell the Truth by Will Metzger or Evangelism by Mack Stiles.I received a copy of this book from Zondervan in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YC4ZDASVERB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6Y0SEQ#wasThisHelpful","R24YC4ZDASVERB","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every year as Easter approaches there are new resources that are released to point to the work that Christ did on the cross to secure the salvation of His people. One of the perks of reviewing books is receiving some of these books that I may have otherwise never read.  Heaven, How I Got Here: The Story of the Thief on the Cross by Colin Smith is one of those books.The interaction between the thief on the cross and Christ is well known in Christianity.  It is a picture of grace and mercy that reaches to even the hardened criminal who puts his faith in Christ.  Colin Smith has written a gripping account of the thief looking back from heaven to his time on the cross.  Smith writes in a way that grabs the readers attention and emotions from the start, and even knowing how the story ends I never wanted to put the book down.  Smith tells the story of the day in the life of the thief, beginning with the start of the day, knowing that he was going to die that day, to the unlikely end, with Christ for the rest of eternity.Truths from Scripture are sprinkled throughout the book, as the thief, now in Heaven knows much more about the revelation of God than he did that day on the cross.  Smith tells the story wonderfully and many times throughout I paused to reflect on the fact that the grace and shed blood that was sufficient for the thief's salvation was also sufficient enough for me, and one day I will share in the glory that he is already enjoying.  Buy this book. Read it and share it.  An interesting point of view from a well known story and one that is sure to fill every reader's heart with amazement at the grace of God.Heaven, How I Got Here is an incredibly powerful story that will be a blessing to all who read it.

"Preaching is a job that carries a world of weight with it.  The pastor is to stand before the people and confidently say ""thus says the Lord"" which means that he better know that is really what God says.  Sadly, many preachers in western Christianity do not take this charge seriously, which makes it all the more crucial for those who recognize and understand this responsibility to craft their sermons in such a way that reflects God's intention when He authored it.  Enter Unashamed Workmen: How Expositors Prepare to Preach. A new book edited by Rhett Dodson that opens the doors to 10 pastor's study habits as they prepare to be a faithful expositor of the Bible.Timothy is charged by Paul to ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth"" and as Dodson states, ""Paul's injunction to Timothy sets the agenda for every pastor devoted to proclaiming the whole counsel of God. Preaching presupposes study, and diligent study is nothing if not the exertion of deliberate effort to understand the meaning and purpose of every passage of Scripture in its context.""  Preparation is vital.  One of God's chief means to edify His church is through the preaching of the Word, so those that preach ought to take the role seriously.Ao one who enjoys study and teaching I cannot begin to describe how much of a blessing this book was for me.  The opportunity to peek into the study habits of 10 seasoned pastors was a great blessing to me and will certainly be for all who read it.  I was encouraged to read how these men thought through their preparation. Even when coming to differing views (i.e. how many commentaries to read in preparation) their reasoning was laid out, which made it easy to see which style of study best fit my own and then glean wisdom from them.  After each pastor walks through their preparation a text to a sermon is provided.  I found this helpful in that I could look for how the study habits were applied to a particular sermon instead of guessing how it all would come together.This is not a text book on sermon preparation, and is not trying to be. Rather, it is a window into the study habits of 10 pastors as they study and craft their sermons. I was truly blessed by this book as it helped me to evaluate my study patterns and to recognize that there is no one right way to study. A high esteem for the Word of God and rightly handling it and presenting it to the people is a must, but Pastors can always reflect on how they reach this end and seek to improve their study methods all for the glory of God and the building up of His church.I received a copy of this book from Christian Focus in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VUMWEJHR02P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781913196#wasThisHelpful","R21VUMWEJHR02P","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really appreciate and enjoy the New Studies in Biblical Theology series published by IVP Academic. I find many of the areas of theology covered intriguing, and appreciate the authors attempts to span the scope of Scripture to communicate the biblical teaching on the subject. With that being said, they aren't always the easiest books to read, and therefore are not accessible to the broader church as some more intermediate works may be. For this reason I was pleased to recently receive God Dwells Among Us: Expanding Eden to the Ends of the Earth. ""The substance and basic thesis of the book is distilled from G.K. Beale, The Temple and the Church's Mission: A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God [in the New Studies in Biblical Theology Series]."" Beale and Kim have worked together to provide a more accessible version of the aforementioned book and have really succeeded in doing so.Why should learning about God's presence with his people be such a big deal for us? ""God's presence brings life and light. Since true life and sustenance are found in the presence of God, we must regularly drink deeply from the river of his delights."" Therefore, we ought to desire to know what Scripture teaches about God's work to dwell with man. This is where Beale and Kim trace God's presence from Adam through the patriarchs to Christ and ultimately His eschatological dwelling with his people.I found Beale and Kim's examination of how God met with the patriarchs in small sanctuary settings to be very insightful in the continuing of God's dwelling with Adam and his commission to fill the earth.  They state in summary, ""The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob receive the Adamic commission in direct connection with the building of small sanctuaries. Just as the Genesis 1:28 commission was initially to be carried out by Adam in the sanctuary of Eden, so this commission is passed down to Israel's patriarchs and begins to be fulfilled in a small sanctuary."" Beale and Kim trace this idea through scriptural example of God meeting with man in a way that is quite helpful in seeing the continuity of this idea throughout Scripture.Ultimately, God's presence with his people leads us to the incarnation, crucifixion and resurrection where Christ commissions the church as his temple.  Christ's ""death and resurrection launched the temple of the new creation, which Christ expands through bringing believers into that temple. As more believers become part of this temple, the temple expands, and will continue to do so until Christ's final coming. At that time, the temple will be expanded to cover the entire new and consummated cosmos for eternity."" Beale and Kim continue by focusing on worship and the glory of God, ""The parallels between the creation of the tabernacle and creation of the heavens and the earth remind us of the ultimate purpose of the tabernacle: to fill the entire heavens and earth with the consummate, end time glory of God. The tabernacle not only teaches us worship and how sinners can come into the presence of a holy God; the tabernacle reminds us of the mission of the tabernacle to expand and filled the entire earth with the eschatological glory of God. The goal of worship is mission, to expand the dwelling place of God until it fills the entire earth that God will create for all eternity."" How humbling and exciting to be a part of God's work in bringing his people to himself who will one day fill the entire new creation as we worship him.Beale and Kim really drive home the point of the centrality of Christ by saying, ""The locus of God's presence shifts from the Jerusalem temple to the person of Jesus so that he is the continuation of the true temple....The Spirit creates a link with heaven through trusting Christ, and this trust brings them into the sphere of the true temple consisting of Christ and his Spirit. Worship in the true temple would no longer be geographically located in Jerusalem but in Christ....Jesus inaugurates a new creation as a true latter-day Adam, since he is inaugurating and expanding a new eschatological temple, which the first Adam should have done in the beginning of the first creation. Likewise, Jesus does what old Israel failed to do, which included establishing and widening the temple of God's presence to bring in the nations.""I was tremendously blessed by this book and highly recommend it. I would especially recommend it to those who may have difficulty seeing the continuity of Scripture because their theological system stresses discontinuity. This book is a blessing in that it communicates a weighty idea into a form that is quite accessible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZEE8KQCTUIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830844147#wasThisHelpful","R1EZEE8KQCTUIW","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"God's presence is a crucial aspect of Scripture and critical to the life of the believer. The Presence of God by J. Ryan Lister is a new release that provides the church with a wonderful biblical theology tracing the theme of God's presence throughout Scripture that shows the unity of Scripture and its Christ-centeredness.Lister explains his desire for the book by stating the following: What I hope to help impress upon us all is that the presence of God is not about mere intuitions and platitudes. It is not a mystical feeling or emotional charge. It is first and foremost a theme of Scripture; and even more, it is a theme on which the story of Scripture hinges. To demonstrate this, I want to make one major argument in this book that rests on two very simple but very significant biblical truths. The first truth is this: the presence of God is a central goal in God’s redemptive mission. The second truth follows: the presence of God is the agent by which the Lord accomplishes his redemptive mission. God’s presence, then, is both eschatological (it is the end-of-time aim of the Lord’s mission) and instrumental (it is ultimately what fulfills the Lord’s mission). So to put our argument in its simplest terms, the presence of God is a fundamental objective in our redemption and, simultaneously, the means by which God completes this objective.This short statement provides a perfect summary of what this book unpacks.  Lister is brilliant in his examination of Scripture and the theme of God's presence.  This work by Lister is a true blessing to the church and a work that I will surely reference for years to come.I received a digital copy of this book from Crossway in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCR9P4DGRZPV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7UPE82#wasThisHelpful","RCR9P4DGRZPV6","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Reformed Expository Commentary is a series that aims to provide a fresh exposition of the Biblical text for today's generation.  In the series introduction the series editors (Phil Ryken & Richard Phillips) lay out the four fundamental commitments in this series.  They are:1) To be biblical - that is to pay careful attention to the text and exposit the Scriptures.  There is less  focus on the original language and structure and more focus on the story that the passage is telling.2) Unashamedly Doctrinal - this series approaches the text from a Reformed perspective, as found in the Bible.3) Redemptive-Historical - this means that they believe in the unity and continuity of the Bible, and interpret it in a Christ centered approach for all of Scripture.4) Practical - by applying the truths found in the Scriptures to contemporary challenges in life.Aesthetically this commentary looks great on the shelf.  While this isn't a huge selling point, and certainly not a reason to chose one commentary over another, I must say that this one looks really nice on the bookshelf, especially when you have more than one in the series.Daniel Doriani provides the commentary on 1 Peter in a recently released contribution to the series.  I found Doriani's writing style to be quite readable, almost reading as a devotional commentary on Scripture.  His engagement with the text and flow into practical application were quite beneficial for me.  I was especially blessed by his treatment of 1 Peter 3:1-7.  Here much is said about wives that does not fit well with our current society.  To that Doriani says, ""We can't dismiss Peter's message as a temporary command, a concession, or an adaption to the times that the church would outgrow. The message of Scripture always transcends it's occasion. Furthermore, the text has no hint that it is temporary counsel."" Our understanding of Scripture cannot be dictated by the current times.  Neither can it be dictated by abusing and misuses of Scripture.  To this thought Doriani is helpful as well as he states that ""Sadly, men have a fueled the critics by abusing their God-given authority and physical strength. If husbands loved their wives as they should, this passage would not be controversial. It is controversial, yet we will not read Peter accurately if we let contemporary gender debates become our lens for interpretation. It is better to acknowledge our preferences and let Scripture test them (1 Thess. 5:21), since God's Word is infallible and we are not. The prevailing mindset of our age does influence us. Therefore, if our Bible reading never challenges us, we probably aren't reading well. A faith that never upsets us is a designer faith, with the self as designer.""  These are strong words, but words that we must hear anytime we come to a difficult passage of Scripture.Doriani is also helpful in understanding this passage as it relates to braided hair and gold.  He rightfully concludes, ""For both Greeks and Jews, extravagant dress could signify promiscuity or disregard of a husband's authority.... Modesty is the principal. The problem does not lie with braided hair or gold per se. A gold wedding band is a simple symbol of commitment. But elaborate hair took hours to prepare and so became a conspicuous display of wealth and rank. Inner beauty is what counts.....as a test of Peter's principal, we may ask ourselves how much time we spend on our physical looks and how much time we spend on our mental and spiritual strength each day. If we give more attention to hair and clothes than to mind and heart, something might be wrong."" Ultimately, ""we should long to please God more than to gain applause or admiring glances. We should pursue God's favor more than human favor, since his appraisal is more accurate, generous, and gracious."" Instead of getting distracted by externals, Doriani shows that the heart is key and our desire for approval from God should be foremost in our minds.Overall I was blessed by this new addition to the series. The Reformed Expository Commentary series continues to be a favorite of mine and this is another great volume in the series. Doriani writes in a very clear and understandable way and will surely be a blessing to anyone who works their way through this commentary.I received a free copy of this commentary from P&R Publishing in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PSBCH6Q705ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596384697#wasThisHelpful","R2PSBCH6Q705ZJ","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"God's Battle Plan for the Mind: The Puritan Practice of Biblical Meditation by David W. Saxton is a new release that quickly caught my eye for a couple of reasons. 1) I love the Puritans and have been blessed as others authors have compiled Puritan thoughts on a particular topic and I was hoping for the same from this book and 2) There is not much contemporary writing on the subject. Outside of mention in a few spiritual disciplines books Biblical meditation is a topic that simply isn't filling the book store shelves.  After I received the book I was pleased to see that Saxton compiled thoughts from over 50 Puritan resources (if my count is correct).  This means that he has gathered together, for the reader, important thoughts from the Puritans on meditation that could take hundreds of hours to read through all of the original sources.  This is truly a blessing to the church.So, what does it mean to meditate? Saxton states that, ""It means to think personally, practically, seriously, and earnestly on how the truth of God's Word should look in life. He continues, ""Everyone meditates on something. We either learn to practice and benefit from biblical meditation, or we inevitably allow our minds to wander dangerously through sinful or depressing thoughts....what a person habitually chooses to daily meditate on reveals his true spiritual condition.""  The believer's thought life is vitally important. We ought to be training our minds to think thoughts about the truths of God's Word instead of allowing our minds to drift into thoughts of countless other temporal things. To ensure a proper understanding, as our times have twisted the true meaning, ""Biblical meditation does not seek to empty one's thoughts. Rather, it seeks to fill one's thoughts with Scripture, fastening them to the objective truth of God's Word. Rather than seeking to arrive at a plane of self-actualization, biblical meditation seeks to think God's thoughts after Him.""Saxton helpfully defines what meditation in the OT and NT look like before giving a Puritan definition. Saxtons provides these summaries: ""Meditation in the Old Testament is presented as the spiritual activity of heart and mind that characterizes a God-fearing saint. He loves God's Word and prizes it as gold or honey......Meditation is presented in the New Testament as a key aspect for the godly renewing of the mind. It is also used as a primary means to comfort and encourage Christian perseverance."" These are important as he moves into defining Puritan thought on this subject. Here he states, ""Puritan meditation was the serious use of the mind....Puritan meditation never encouraged a life of actionless contemplation or useless theological speculation....To bring a person to the point of personal application, practice, and resolution, the Puritans taught that the mind must rightly consider the truths of God's Word.""From these definitions Saxton explores Puritan thought on differing types of meditation, occasions for meditation, subjects, reasons, benefits and enemies of meditation.  Sometimes when an author attempts to compile thoughts from so many sources the end result is a bunch of jumbled up thoughts that do not flow together.  This is perhaps where Saxton's work proves most valuable.  He flows from thought to thought in such a way that the book reads completely fluid.  I was tremendously blessed by His work and will surely recommend it to others as well as return to it in the future.

"Biblical leadership is crucial to the local church.  Biblical leadership is a gift from God to build up and equip the saints, and if the leadership is poor, or the model is poor, the result could be damaging to the life of the local church.  As the authors state, ""who leads the church, the type of authority they are given, how they relate to one another, to whom they are accountable, and how they are selected are of utmost importance to the life and health of God's people."" The contributors to Shepherding God's Flock: Biblical Leadership in the New Testament and Beyond recognize this and have provided the church with a book that traces leadership models through the Bible and various church models (Presbyterian, Anglican, Baptist, Roman Catholic (for its influence, not for its Biblical faithfulness) to arrive at a theology of church leadership and practical implications from this study.  The scope of work is truly outstanding.  The book is about 350 pages, which isn't short, but the information packed into those pages seems like so much more.  Being able to have one book that traces leadership through an overview of the Bible and various traditions will surely be a blessing to the church and its leaders as we seek to model Biblical faithfulness in regards to church leadership.In tracing leadership through the Bible many key points are made.  The authors examine the OT, the gospels, Acts and Paul's epistles to the churches, and the Pastoral letters.  Each of these chapters provides a helpful overview and a look at the key points that should drawn out.  For example, in summarizing the key points to take away from the Book of Acts and Paul's Epistles to the Churches Merkle states, ""from the earliest state, the New Testament churches were led, not only by apostles, but also by mature leaders from among the congregations. As was evident in Paul's strategy, he did not seek to permanently lead the churches that he planted but appointed indigenous leaders for each congregation.""  This statement provides a couple of key takeaways 1) churches should examine how they are growing leaders from their own congregations and 2) missions should seek to grow indigenous leaders for the work of the ministry, not just be concerned about converts.  Greg Allison is helpful in his look at the Roman Catholic Church recognizing that ""we as evangelicals often look in vain for biblical support for such a notion of the papacy...we conceive of church leadership in very different terms. We acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the supreme head of the church, which is his body and which manifests itself on local congregations. These assemblies are cared for by pastors or elders.""  While noting these major difference the authors chose to study this part of history because of its great influence and this is understandable.The last two chapters pull all of this information together nicely into a theology for leadership and practical applications in light of the baptistic leadership model that is favored by the authors.  Overall this book is a treasure chest of information and will certainly be helpful to church leaders, Baptist or not.I received a copy of this book from Kregel Academic in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15PF45I9TQF3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825442567#wasThisHelpful","R15PF45I9TQF3K","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mission Accomplished is a new two week family devotional by Scott James that is just in time for Easter.  The cross and the resurrection are at the heart of the Christian Gospel and Easter is a perfect time to bring these truths front and center for our families. It is easy to get distracted and forget to focus on the important things and this helps us to refocus our families on the Cross of Christ and His victory over death.Mission Accomplished is divided into two weeks. Week One: Walking With Jesus to the Cross begins with Palm Sunday and walks with Jesus to the Cross, ending with Jesus in the tomb. Week Two: The Risen King focuses on the resurrection, Jesus on the road to Emmaus with the disciples, the Great Commission, our freedom from sin and our hope in His return.The layout of Mission Accomplished is helpful in leading a family devotional.  ""Each devotion includes a Bible passage to read together, notes to help you discuss the passage with your child (""Think About It""), questions and answers to guide your discussion (""Talk About It""), and suggestions for a short time of prayer. Each devotional time could take anywhere form ten to twenty minutes,""  The days also alternate between a hymn to be sung together and a family activity to do.  These devotionals are excellent and provide a great outline for parents to interact with their kids and Scripture over a two-week period. Great family resources are what I have come to expect from New Growth Press and Mission Accomplished meets those expectations. I am definitely looking forward to using this with my family this year.I received a copy of this book from New Growth Press in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHFHCB2C47WN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939946573#wasThisHelpful","RHFHCB2C47WN0","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From reading many solid, contemporary books over the past few years I have been encouraged by one characteristic that I have seen many times.  Some contemporary authors are writing books that while heavily influenced by sound theology, and containing sound theology, are accessible to a broad range of believers.  I, personally love heavy theology books.  I enjoy sitting and slowly wading through a book that makes me pause and think a lot.  But,  I recognize that this is a gift from God and not everyone is like this, so it is important to have books that can communicate big truths in an accessible way. Covenant Theology: A Reformed Baptist Primer by Douglas Van Dorn is just that book to communicate Baptist Covenant Theology in a way that most Christians will be able to read, and understand.This first question that needs to be addressed is what makes Baptist Covenant Theology distinct from Paedobaptist Covenant Theology?  Van Dorn answers this clearly by stating that ""we view the Covenant of Grace as being that covenant which comes through the person and work of Jesus Christ. All gracious covenants in the OT had this covenant and mind prospectively, meaning, God looked into the future and, knowing that Christ was absolutely certain to accomplish the work he was given to do, gave grace to OT saints on Christ's behalf through means of grace that typified this coming work. These means of grace were always attached to covenants. But because of this, only when we come to the new covenant will we discuss the Covenant of Grace proper, the covenant Christ made with his church."" This distinction is one that must be addressed at the outset as Van Dorn does and then builds from this premise.I found Van Dorn's discussion on the Covenant of Redemption to be very clear and helpful to those who may not fully understand this idea.  Van Dorn addresses its origin by answering the following question: Where does the idea of the Covenant of Redemption come from? By stating that it comes from the ""ideas of a lamb slain prior to creation, names written in a book of life prior to creation, and the work of Jesus to obey his Father in all things and to lose none of those given to him by the Father."" The next important question to answer is :Why is the idea of the Covenant of Redemption important?  Because ""God will save the elect because he has chosen before the foundation of the world to do so in the Covenant of Redemption. Jesus death on the cross procured this ""especially"" for them. He did so because it both pleased him, and because he knew that none would accept his offer of reconciliation given their prior hatred of him in their sinful, depraved, unregenerate condition. People can't find God for the same reason that a robber can't find the police. This means that there is something effectual in the death of Christ and in the Covenant of Redemption. That effectual thing is Jesus his intention to save all those given to him by the Father.""  Van Dorn presents his chapter on the Covenant of Redemption, as well as all subsequent chapters on covenants, with both doctrinal precision and clarity, making this book highly accessible to most of the church.In his chapters on gracious legal covenants Van Dorn gives a helpful look at continuity in Scripture by looking at promises, the seed, typology, law, and grace. It is in the area of continuity where dispensationalism really falls short, everything is set against each other and the unity of Scripture is often deemphasized. On the other hand, there is discontinuity as well and a van Dorn discusses differences in these same areas. It is here that Paedobaptist covenant theology fails as it rarely sees any discontinuityProbably the most helpful distinction (differing from Paedobaptist) and definition in the entire book is that between covenants of grace and the Covenant of Grace. Van Dorn states ""Reformed Baptist, while agreeing that there is grace in covenants of promise - grace that is sent prospectively, in anticipation of the Covenant of Grace- nevertheless define ""The Covenant of Grace"" as the new covenant made with Christ. So we can think of the Covenant of Grace as the gracious plan of salvation that God has given us in Christ. Old covenants are gracious. Old covenant typify Christ. But they are not the Covenant of Grace anymore than Christ is literally a lamb. He is a lamb, but he is not an animal.  So covenants of grace are defined as ""gracious aspects of OT covenants which prefigure the Covenant of Grace"" while the Covenant of Grace is the new covenant.""This understanding is then expounded upon as a Van Dorn works through six gracious legal covenants. It may be in this section that and Van Dorn's work proves most valuable (and suitably titled Primer) as he writes in such a manner that is clear, biblical, and quite readable for a broader audience.There isn't a shortage of very heady theological books, but it is a treasure to find a resource such as this that combines the sound theology with a practical writing style that is accessible to so many. This book is an excellent resource, one that I highly recommend, and will refer to for many years to come.I received a copy of this book from Waters of Creation Publishing in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VOYTE9TD0QM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P72UWWM#wasThisHelpful","R2VOYTE9TD0QM2","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Real Christian: Bearing the Marks of Authentic Faith by Todd Wilson is a new book that aim right at the heart of what is means to be a true Christian.  Wilson draws from Jonathan Edward's Religious Affections to provide the church with a modern day look at the marks of authentic faith.  Wilson states that it is important for the church to be clear about authentic faith because, ""when Christians are confused about what it means to be real, the spiritual decline of the church will follow."" While this is a very broad and general statement I think there is much truth in it.  A quick broad look at American Christianity seems to confirm this statement.Since we have in some ways ignored the distinct marks of authentic faith ""we must clarify for ourselves, and for a watching world, what it means to live a life of authentic faith."" Wilson's state his claim for authentic faith in a short and simple statement: My chief claim, although provocative, is simple. Real is something you can see. There is a visible difference between real and not-real Christians. It's not enough to say you're real; you should be able to see your real. Luther said that Faith that saves alone is never alone.  True saving faith is always accompanied by change, since the one who experiences saving faith has been given a new heart/made a new creature this idea of visible lasting change shouldn't shock us.  We are being made new from the inside, out.Wilson studies six marks of authentic Christianity.  These are: humility, meekness, contrition, wholeness, hunger, and perfected love. ""These six marks provide us with the standard and substance of authentic faith. On the one hand, they provide a biblical standard for whether we are real; on the other hand, they unpack the substance of what mature faith looks like."" Wilson helpfully shows our need for an external (the Bible) measuring stick for our faith. He states ""our depraved heart is a flattery factory, which mass-produces agreeable thoughts about ourselves at a furious pace. We lose sight of who we are and convince ourselves we're someone more attractive or cleverer or kinder than the evidence in our lives supports. Our untrustworthy hearts keep pumping self-aggrandizing complements into our minds leaving us comfortably reassured, yet spectacularly self deceived.""Wilson unpacks how faith produces change in regards to each of these ""marks.""  He is encouraging throughout the book, yet not without urgent warnings. ""If the desires of your heart and the direction of your life have not changed, then you have no reason to assume you're born again. And let me hasten to add, this change must be substantive, not superficial. It must be real change, to the core of who you are -your heart- reshaping the direction of your life, your motivations, and your actions."" Ultimately our perseverance points to God's keeping power, not our own will power. As Wilson says, ""perseverance proves God has given you a new heart, causing you to walk in his ways and keep his statutes.""Overall, I found this book to be a helpful look at the marks of authentic Christianity.  This isn't about some moralistic checklist to follow, but rather real, lasting change that the Holy Spirit will produce.I received a copy of this book from Zondervan Academic in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ZG09IH8QDT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6Y0SDW#wasThisHelpful","R19ZG09IH8QDT2","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spurgeon's Sorrows: Realistic Hope for those who Suffer from Depression is a recent release from Zack Eswine that draws from the life and writings of Charles Spurgeon to bring a word of encouragement to those who suffer from depression.  I've never suffered from any long term depression.  If I get down about something I usually move on within a few hours.  I was hoping that this book would give me an inside view from Spurgeon's battles with depression.One of the first issues to address is the fact that the church can and has handled depression wrongly.  Because of that many who suffer from depression find it difficult to talk about. As Eswine states ""We sense helplessness, yes, and also shame. Like other issues of mental health, we don't talk about depression. If we do, we either whisper as if the subject is scandalous or rebuke it as if it's a sin. No wonder many of us don't seek help; for when we do, those who try to help only add to the shame of it all."" This statement should cause us all to examine how we view those who suffer from depression. ""Depression ought to be taken seriously because it can ""so vandalize our joy and our sense of God that no promise of His care can comfort us in the moment, no matter how true or kindly spoken. At its worst, ""everything in the world looks dark."" Even God's mercies frighten us ""and rise like a hideous portents of evil"" before our minds eye.""Often times people can become depressed from their circumstances.  Rather than just trying to snap out of it (or snap others out of it) this can be a good time for us to learn that ""Christian faith on earth is neither an escape nor heaven...we do not equate spiritual blessing with circumstantial ease...[and]..we who've not suffered depression from circumstances must learn the pastoral care of those who have.  So often, not only with depression, we can be in such a hurry to escape trouble that we miss what God may be trying to teach us though suffering.One of the more helpful truths that I gleaned from this book is that some believers have a natural tendency towards despair, as Spurgeon states, ""we do see every day that amongst the best of God's servants, there are those who are always doubting, always looking to the darkside of every providence, who look at the threatening more than at the promise, who are ready to write bitter things against themselves"" It is so easy to judge others without fully knowing their circumstances or to just say snap out of it that we do not show that love and compassion that they deserve.  Eswine reminds us that, ""it is important to remember the truth when we or someone we know is suffering from depression. The truth is that ""our sense of God's absence does not mean that He is so. Though our bodily gloom allows us no feeling of His tender touch, He holds on to us still. Our feelings of Him do not save us. He does. Our hope therefore, does not reside in our ability to preserve a good mood but in His ability to bear us up. Jesus will never abandon us with our downcast heart.""Where do we turn when hope is lost, ""we plead not ourselves, but the promises of Jesus; not our strengths but His; our weaknesses yes, but His mercies. Our way of fighting is to hide behind Jesus who fights for us. Our hope is not the absence of our regret, or misery or doubt or lament, but the presence of Jesus."" Ultimately we find comfort in suffering from looking to Jesus. ""To feel in our being that the God to whom we cry has Himself suffered as we do enables us to feel that we are not alone and that God us not cruel.""Zack Eswine has provided the church with a book that will definitely be helpful to those who suffer with depression as well as informative for those who do not.

"Romans 8-16 for You is the sixth volume released in the God's Word for You series from The Good Book Company.  The aim for each title, as stated by the series editor is to be: Bible centered, Christ glorifying, Relevantly applied, and Easily readable. This series is promoted to be used to read (cover to cover), to feed (as a devotion day by day) or the lead (study in small group or church setting).  Keller does a wonderful job making this book both readable and providing great insight into Romans 8-16. This book is less like a commentary and more like a guide book, and that's ok!  Keller walks the reader through Romans 8-16 in 12 very manageable chapters that are even subdivided into two parts making it a perfect book for private devotions or group discussion. This is a great commentary for lay-people because it is set up more like a book than a traditional commentary. Each chapter contains 'Questions for Reflection'  that also work well for either personal meditation or group discussion.  Many of the questions are personal application questions like 'How does this text apply to your life in ____ area.'I think most commentaries on Romans would probably scare many Christians away because of the depth of theology that the book presents.  Many of the truths that Paul discusses in this book are hard for one to wrap their mind around. This is where this commentary proves very helpful. It tackles the difficult theology, but in brief easy to read sections, with application mixed in along the way. This would be an excellent book for any Christian to read along with as they read through the book of RomansI would highly recommend this easy to read commentary to any believer to supplement their study of Romans 8-16. It's size and style is neither highly technical or overbearing, but rather easy to read and separated into small manageable portions making it a great devotional read.I received a free copy of this book from The Good Book Company via Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DA9WWL1521SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW2T6LC#wasThisHelpful","R1DA9WWL1521SE","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quick trip down the devotional isle at your local Christian book store will reveal an abundance of devotional style books.  These books with short 2-3 page chapters for each day prove to be popular, but sadly, many are not filled with much substance.  Thankfully, there are also devotional books that dig deep and leave the reader with truth to meditate on throughout the day. Discovering Delight by Glenda Mathes is one of those devotionals.Discovering Delight takes the reader through 22 devotions on Psalm 119 as well as meditations on Psalm 1, 19, 37, 40 and 112, Isaiah 58, Jeremiah 15, Romans 7 and Revelation 19.  These devotions are truly rich in content.  Each devotion is about 4-5 pages and ends with questions for reflection.  These questions help the reader to recall what they just read as well as apply the truths learned.  They serve this devotional well, as they can/do spur on thoughts to meditate on throughout the day.  I was impressed by the depth that these devotions have.  Again, so many devotionals just provide a quick read that may be good, but lacks any real depth.  Discovering Delight is the perfect book for anyone looking for a short 10 minute devotional read for their day that will leave thoughts lingering through the rest of the day.I received a copy of this book from Reformation Heritage Books via Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C52LHR2FQ7D2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q77NU9S#wasThisHelpful","R2C52LHR2FQ7D2","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quick scan of the internet will confirm that contemporary Christianity is dealing with many ""hot button"" issues today.  While I do not want to downplay any of these issues I think the difficulty the church has in some of these areas is directly related to biblical illiteracy and improper/lack of application.  Banner of Truth and Sinclair Ferguson have teamed up to provide the church with a most useful resource that is desperately needed today.From the Mouth of God seeks to (as the subtitle states) help the reader trust, read and apply the Bible. The order here is key.  One of those ""hot button"" issues today where we see the mis-use of Scripture is so-called same sex ""marriage.""  Some in the church will say that we just need to ""love"" people the way they are and not try to change them because that is what Jesus did and commands us to do.  While it is true that we are supposed to love people, what they mean by love is accept a certain lifestyle as valid before God and man.  The problem with that is if we trust that the Bible is God's word (1st step) and read it in it's proper context (2nd step) we will come away with a very different application (3rd step).  God is clear in His Word that we are to love people and the greatest form of love would be to show them the Bible is truly God's Word and that unless we repent of our sins and trust in Jesus we will perish (no matter what the sin). We must be diligent on our understanding and use of the Bible and From the Mouth of God is an excellent resource to guide us in His Word.First, we cannot approach the Bible as just another book.  As Ferguson states, ""The Bible...is God's personal communication to us. It has a life-restoring goal in view: to bring light to our darkened minds and faith to our dead hearts.""  The aim of the Bible is so much higher than just some textbook or history book. It seeks to alter lives. But, how is this God's Book if man wrote it?  Sinclair answers this quite succinctly by stating that ""there were..two elements involved in the inspiration of the Scriptures. God (i) over-ruled the lives of those who wrote the bible in ways that would prepare them to write it, and in addition he (ii) superintended their lives as they wrote.""  So we have a Bible that is God breathed and also reflects the authors hand in it's writing.I have read quite a few books (some quite lengthy) on how we arrived at the Canon and how do we know that we actually have God's Word.  I think Ferguson's treatment of these two topics is exceptional.  His writing throughout this book is probably the most accessible and readable that I've come across.  Perhaps my favorite chapter was the one titled Keys.  Here Ferguson works through 5 keys for understanding Scripture. They are: Context, Jesus, The Unfolding Drama, Biblical Logic and Each Part of Scripture should be read according to its literary character.  This chapter alone would make a great small pamphlet to hand out to train/encourage the church on reading Scripture properly. I was also encouraged by Ferguson's discussion on Poetry/Wisdom writing. I've recently read a couple volumes on how to read the Psalms and I felt that his work here was a great introduction/primer on how to read and better understand these often misunderstood books.Overall, I was greatly blessed and highly encouraged by this book.  Ferguson has provided the church with a very readable volume that comes at a much needed time.I received a copy of this book from Banner of Truth in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOLAUD4JPH0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848712421#wasThisHelpful","R2NOLAUD4JPH0I","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most people probably are, I am familiar with Matt Papa from his music.  I have been blessed by many of his songs for the rich theological content which they possess, so when I saw this new release from him I was curious to see if that theological framework that is in his music would translate well into his writing.  Look and Live is a book about beholding the Glory of God in such a way that it transforms all aspects of our lives.  From worship to missions to suffering Papa skillfully writes to show the reader how beholding the glory of God is the light that lets us se all of life more clearly and fuels us in obedience.Beholding the glory of God is what changes us.  Papa states, ""The glory of God is the reason why every person in the Bible who encounters God nearly falls dead. It changes you. When we see God, we get small. We lose a sense of our self. We must. His is true excellence. His is true glory. All would-be identities vanish like a shadow in the presence of I AM. Pride cannot exist in His presence.""  We are in great need of a bigger view of God in today's American Christianity. When we see the glory of God we also stop comparing ourselves with others and recognize how far we fall short.  Again Papa is dead on when he says, ""What makes sin so evil, so damnable, is not the ugliness of the act itself but Who the act is against. We have defied God. Some might say, ""Sure, I confess I've done some bad things, but I haven't been nearly as bad as some people. I mean, come on, what about Hitler?"" My reply? Judging holiness by the standard of other men is useless. Two men standing at the foot of Mt. Everest don't argue about who is taller. They look up and tremble.""  AMEN!!!In the chapter Glory and Mission I appreciated the distinction that he made between missions and mission.  He was careful not to discredit staying where we are, but shows the difference between that and missions.  He states that being on missions is ""leveraging your time, talents, and resources for the joy of others and the advancement of the gospel, wherever you are."" While missions is ""crossing a culture to reach a people who have little or no access to the gospel, with the proclamation of truth and the planting of churches as paramount. In other words, sharing the gospel with your neighbor and southern suburban America is being ""on mission"" but it is not ""missions.""  It's evangelism...Missions need to be distinct because the need is distinct. If everything were missions, then we would (or I should say, ""will"") quickly forget about those who are dying without any way to know Jesus. We will just keep saying, ""Do missions! Do missions!"" while we stay where we are, or do nice things, and people in the 10/40 window (or least-reached places) go to hell. (I am not against staying where we are or doing nice things. I am just fighting for clarity.)  A lot of good things in the church today get passed off as missions, when they simply are not.  What is needed is both, people serving, working, caring for their local community as well as people going to the ends of the earth for the proclamation of the Gospel.  Again, I appreciated his clarity on this point.I was tremendously blessed by this book and highly recommend it.

One of the negative outcomes of that is that there is always something new and exciting for us to grab a hold of, and we have a little time for those things which may cause us to have to think deeply or dwell on seriously. I think sometimes that mindset can trickle into our Bible reading, where we are drawn to text that have clear meaning for our lives today, but shy away from some harder texts that may cause more serious Bible study to properly understand.In Christ and the Desert Tabernacle, J.V. Fesko attempts to take the reader through the various parts of the tabernacle to show how they relate to Christ and their significance for Christians today. Fesko states, ""I hope to be able to show readers, young and old alike, that far from being boring or uninteresting, the Old Testament tabernacle, and later the temple in Solomon's day, is a shadowy picture of Christ and the church. True, people are perhaps easily able to draw the connections between Jesus and the sacrificial animals, as Jesus is identified as the one and only true sacrifice who takes away our sins; but beyond these obvious connections, the Old Testament tabernacle is literally an entire world of references, allusions and foreshadows of Christ and the church. When not need to go very far to uncover the connections between Jesus and the Old Testament tabernacle - the New Testament reveals them to us. If you read about the Old Testament tabernacle in the light of the New Testament, you will never think the descriptions of the tabernacle and its furnishings are boring. Instead, you will be filled with hope and assurance, knowing that Jesus Christ, the true tabernacle, has come to redeem his people, living stones, and unite us to him, the one true foundation, so that we would become the eternal temple of the living God.""In the short book, Fesko takes the reader through the building materials, the Ark of the covenant, the table and bread, the lampstand and oil, the tabernacle, the altar and courtyard, the priest's garments, the consecration of the priest, the altar of incense, the census tax, the bronze basin, the work of Oholiab and Bezalel, and the Sabbath. All of this is done in short, manageable chapters. Each chapter gives a quick introduction to the part of the tabernacle being studied, showing its purpose and it's immediate context, then Fesko turns to the New Testament to show how these are but types and shadows. The writing is accessible, and brief, making it a wonderful devotional read for practically anyone. One does not have to agree or fully track with every point to Fesko makes to be truly blessed by this book.I received a copy of this book from EP Books in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QBQB8GJ6Y4GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0852347812#wasThisHelpful","R3QBQB8GJ6Y4GF","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Reformed Expository Commentary is a series that aims to provide a fresh exposition of the Biblical text for today's generation.  In the series introduction the series editors (Phil Ryken & Richard Phillips) lay out the four fundamental commitments in this series.  They are:1) To be biblical - that is to pay careful attention to the text and exposit the Scriptures.  There is less  focus on the original language and structure and more focus on the story that the passage is telling.2) Unashamedly Doctrinal - this series approaches the text from a Reformed perspective, as found in the Bible.3) Redemptive-Historical - this means that they believe in the unity and continuity of the Bible, and interpret it in a Christ centered approach for all of Scripture.4) Practical - by applying the truths found in the Scriptures to contemporary challenges in life.Aesthetically this commentary looks great on the shelf.  While this isn't a huge selling point, and certainly not a reason to chose one commentary over another, I must say that this one looks really nice on the bookshelf, especially when you have more than one in the series.Ecclesiastes by Douglas Sean O'Donnell is a new release to the series.  Ecclesiastes isn't exactly the easiest book to understand or preach through, but ""all Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.""  So, even the book of Ecclesiastes has gems for the Christian to mine, though they may take more effort to find.  Thankfully O'Donnell has provided a helpful commentary to meet this need.O'Donnell suggest that the most helpful way to read the book of Ecclesiastes is ""as (1) God's wisdom literature (2) with a unified message (3) that makes better sense in light of the crucified, risen, and returning Christ. Recognizing and working within the confines of the literary genre is key to understanding the text.  By unified message O'Donnell means that throughout the book ""there is a persistent literary intention and a consistent theological argument to Ecclesiastes."" While the message is sometimes dark: ""in all our endeavors we cannot find much meaning or sustainable joy in this world or present age. It's vanity"" the conclusion is to fear God and keep his commandments.As important as understanding the genre and reading the book as a whole are, understanding the book in light of Christ is where we find the books fuller meaning.  ""Jesus Christ redeemed us from the vanity that Pastor Solomon so wrestled with and suffered under by subjecting himself to our temporary, meaningless, futile incomprehensible, incongruous, absurd, smoke-curling-up-into-the-air, mere-breath, vain life. He was born under the sun. He dies under the sun. But in his subjection to the curse of death by his own death on the cross, this Son of God ""redeemed us from the curse."" By his resurrection he restored meaning to our toil. And by his return, he will exact every injustice and elucidate every absurdity as he ushers those who fear the Lord into the glorious presence of our all-wise, never-completely-comprehensible God."" Amen to that!The Reformed Expository Commentary series continues to be a favorite of mine and this is another great volume in the series. O'Donnell provides helpful commentary to guide the reader though the book of Ecclesiastes.I received a free copy of this commentary from P&R Publishing in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5EZ339D0LCF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596383984#wasThisHelpful","R5EZ339D0LCF0","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the Christmas season just passing many Christians have spent some time dwelling on Emmanuel, God with us, in the form of Christ.  While this is truly astonishing, that the God who created everything would take on flesh and come in the form of a servant to die for His people, it is not the only time in the Bible in which God condescends to interact with creation.  There is no doubt that the incarnation of Christ is what the Old Testament was pointing forward to and what the New Testament reveals to us,In God With Us Glenn Kreider traces out God's interactions with His people throughout the Bible.  The overarching theme of the book is that God chooses to humble Himself and condescends to interact with His people.  We are completely unable to ""go up"" to Him, He must condescends.  As Kreider states, ""Creation is dependent upon God. Only if God condescends to make himself known, only if he takes the initiative to provide redemption, only if he accommodate himself to his fallen and rebellious creation - only then is there any hope for his creatures. And that is exactly what the Scriptures teach that God has done. Because God is revealed to be what he is by what he has done, the Scriptures teach that condescension to his creation is an attribute of deity.""  Kreider begins with the Old Testament and traces out God's interactions with His people.Kreider notes that ""the behavior of the incarnate Son is consistent with the behavior of the God who is revealed prior to the incarnation. We see continuity between the two Testaments in the character and practice of God. If the incarnation of the Son of God is a demonstration of humility and condescension, and if he did only what he saw his Father do, then reading the Old Testament should provide numerous examples of God's condescension.""  This continuity is truly a blessing to see and understand.  Especially with the charge that the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament are vastly different, we see clearly that Jesus interacts with people in ways that He saw the Father do.What are the practical implications of a God who humbles himself and condescends to his people? ""If God is humble, then his people ought to be humble. If God submit himself, by giving up the rights and the prerogatives of his transcendence, then his people ought to submit to one another. If God condescends to look out for the interest of his creatures, then his people ought to care for one another. If God is merciful and compassionate, then his people ought to treat one another with mercy and compassion. In short, if God is most clearly revealed in his Son, and if this revelation is humble and sacrificial, and if God wants his followers to be like him, then surely understanding God in this way compels his followers to give up their rights, privileges, and prerogatives for the sake of others."" God's condescension to interact with us should motivate us to praise him for pursuing a relationship with us, and drive us to go to others in like manner.  God With Us is a helpful book to moves us to those responses.I received a copy of this book from P&R Publishing in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9RPP8NLPVIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKKNKTS#wasThisHelpful","R3O9RPP8NLPVIW","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gospel Formed by J.A. Medders is a recent release from Kregel Publications that seeks to bring the reader's focus on the gospel, over and over again through 27 devotional-style chapters.  Medders recommends to read one chapter a day and this would seem to be a good fit as each chapter ranges from around 3-6 pages.  So why keep coming back to the gospel over and over again?  Medders answers this question well by saying, ""Gospel-centered Christians are God-enjoying, God-centered, Jesus-exalting, Spirit-loving, Bible-devouring Christians. We don't worship the gospel; we worship the God of the gospel. The gospel is God's act of turning scoundrels into saints, turning sin-seekers into people who now find their utmost satisfaction in God."" This is wonderfully good news and we should seek to ponder on it regularly. Gospel Formed is a book that will help the reader do just that.The book is divided into five parts: The Gospel Starting Block, What is Gospel Worship?, What is Gospel Identity?, What is Gospel Community?, What is Gospel Mission? Each section contains chapters that focus on various aspects of the gospel's impact on these areas.  All of these sections a Christ-exalting and bring great encouragement to the reader.  I was especially blessed by some of the devotions focusing on community. In one chapter Medders states, ""I love the church because Jesus does. How much do you care about the church? Are you connected to the church? Are you faithful to a local church? Jesus shed his blood for the church and never takes her lightly - nor should you. So how involved are you? How connected are you? Fringe? Once-a-monther? C'mon...The early church braved the sword to gather with God's people, and Christians in our day will hardly brave the rain. That's a problem - one that's bigger than church attendance. This is a love-for-Jesus problem. How we treat his bride equals how we treat him."" Strong indictment about how many modern day Christians think little of the great privilege that we have been given.Overall, I found this book to be a wonderful encouragement and a great addition to the large number of ""gospel"" books out there.  I did find the book to be a bit repetitive at times. The whole point of the book is to bring a gospel focus into various aspects of life so the gospel will be repetitive and that is a good thing. However, some of the chapters felt as if they were a stretch to be a stand-alone chapter and would have fit better if combined with another one.  Not a huge knock on the book but worth noting.  Also, there are quite a few attempts at humor throughout the book that didn't really fit my style.  They weren't off-putting, just were a distraction at times from the main point of the chapter. Again, this is a minor issues that speaks more to a personal preference, but since some will probably share it, it was worth a mention.  If you are looking for a devotion that will point you over and over again to the wonderful grace of God in the gospel and how it impacts all of life the pick up this book, you will be blessed.I received a copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YVX1XIENRWFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG27IDE#wasThisHelpful","R2YVX1XIENRWFR","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reformation Heritage Books recently released The Reformation Heritage KJV Study Bible and I was blessed to receive a copy.  I am grateful for the doctrinal quality of books published by Reformation Heritage, which made me eager to dig in to this study bible and explore what it has to offer.  Below, I will attempt to highlight some of the features that stood out to me and make this bible worth the purchase.1) The Notes: Anyone looking for a doctrinally sound, reformed study Bible will definitely be pleased with this offering, and this feature alone makes it worth the purchase.2) Aesthetics: The picture above is of the hard cover edition that I received.  It comes with a dust jacket and both the jacket and cover are identical in look.  This Bible has a nice binding on it that lays flat which is a huge benefit when studying. The Bible text is 9.8 point font which I find to be quite readable. The notes are 8 point and a different font from the Bible text.  This is a benefit as the reader can quickly scan and notice the difference between Scripture and notes.  All Scripture references in the notes are in a bold font which leads to easy searching for the note that corresponds to the text above.  Each chapter has an introductory note as well, which give a succinct 1-3 sentence summary of content of the chapter.3) Thoughts for Personal/Family Worship: Though technically this is in the notes section it deserves a mention of its own.  Each chapter.....yes, EVERY chapter of the Bible...comes with notes/questions to use for personal/family worship.  These thoughts/questions could easily be compiled and sold as an additional resource and yet they come with this Bible.  These are perfect to spur on meditation after daily Bible reading.  If used in a family worship setting they provide a conversation starter and points to reflect upon as a family.  I was blown away by this feature and I can't recall seeing anything like this before in a study bible.  I will definitely be putting these notes to use in the near future.4) Study Helps: These are short one page helps covering a variety of topics like: Coming to Christ, Experiencing Justification and Adoption, Growing in Sanctification, Reading the Scriptures, How and Why We Pray. Spiritual Desertion, Defending Our Faith, etc.  These serve as a great reminder to grounded believers, or new food for thought for young and growing Christians. Either way this is a nice addition.5) Twenty Centuries of Church History: As someone who enjoys church history I really appreciate this section. 20 centuries are covered at a rate of 1 century per page.  Obviously this is a quick fly-over but to someone who doesn't study church history much this could be a great reference for history that they may not otherwise read.6) Creeds and Confessions: These Creeds and Confessions are included as well: Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed, Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort, Westminster Confession, Westminster Shorter Catechism and Westminster Larger Catechism.7) Free Online Access: So you can take your study bible anywhere you have internet access!While not every feature, this covers the majority of what this study Bible has to offer.  If you are looking for a KJV Study Bible I see no reason to purchase any other one than The Reformation Heritage KJV Study Bible.  I personally do not use the KJV for much regular reading, but with all of the tools and features that this Bible has to offer it will most definitely get plenty of use in my home for years to come.  Excellent Study Bible, I highly recommend it!I received a copy of this Bible from Reformation Heritage Books in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2THJYXNP1V6DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RU8BTDC#wasThisHelpful","R2THJYXNP1V6DB","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"God's Word is inexhaustible.  We simply can't, in our finite minds and sinful flesh, fully comprehend all that He has written, much less obey Him perfectly, even with the help of the Spirit.  So, there will no doubt be commands that God gives that we simply miss the mark on.  There are, on the other hand, some commands that we try to avoid, or at least gloss over quickly and move along.  I Wish Jesus Hadn't Said That by Steve Timmis is a short book that examines 10 of these commands.  These commands vary from deny yourself and take up your cross, and loving your enemies to blessed are the persecuted and don't be angry.Timmis reveals the reason for such a book, and it is a heart problem.  He states, ""we are driven by a desire to secure our own happiness. We pursue the things we want in order to have status, to look and feel good. We pursue the relationships we want in order to have a fulfilling and satisfying life. We pursue health, wealth, and general prosperity.....We buy into a way of seeing the world that is basically aligned to the world's ideas of what is necessary, reasonable, and worth having. This overarching view about things is our plausibility structure: we decide what is plausible and what makes sense, and what isn't or doesn't. But each of the sayings of Jesus that we will consider together in this book turns our possibility structure on its head. Each one shakes us up and reveals the ways in which, most of the time, we don't take Jesus seriously.""  We can tend to shape reality into what we want it to be, which often times isn't in line with God's reality.Timmis provides helpful insight into these 10 sayings of Jesus, never stretching the texts past its intent, yet challenging the reader to their core.  Many of Jesus's words are hard.  I think of His words to love our neighbor are especially hard.  I would much rather try to reason away this command by asking ""who is my neighbor?"" but Jesus has already answered that for me.  Timmis states, ""Jesus is saying that we cannot eliminate anyone from the category of 'neighbor.' He is challenging every preconception that would assume someone is, or is not, likely to be a bona fide neighbor. Like a master swordsman, he cuts through all cultural and personal defenses, so his rapier goes right to the heart of his listeners' self-righteous pride.""  It is easy for me to love those like me and call them my neighbor. It is much harder to love those so different than me or those who offer me nothing in return as my neighbor.  Thankfully Jesus doesn't give us the option, and also equips us with His Spirit to enable us.Despite the title of the book Timmis says that he is ""really glad Jesus did say all those things that invade my ""private"" world, break into my choices, and turned me and my lifestyle upside down. Because it is in that process of dislocation and disturbance that I discover Jesus to be everything I could ever need and my greatest delight in life. The joy of resting in his promises and walking with the Savior is far more significant and precious than any plan, dream, or ambition I would choose to pursue."" I found this book to be challenging and encouraging.  It challenges us to examine our blind spots, but it is encouraging because following Jesus, even His hard sayings, is always the best place for us.  I highly recommend this book.I received a copy of this book from Zondervan in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R256ETB3V7AUZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL18GA6#wasThisHelpful","R256ETB3V7AUZH","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary Series is a new commentary series from Holman Reference edited by David Platt, Daniel Akin and Tony Merida.  The editor's goal is ""to present an easy reading, practical and friendly commentary"" and ""to exalt Jesus from every book of the Bible.""  In the introduction the editors lay out four distinguishing characteristics for the series.They are:1) This series seeks to display exegetical accuracy. The desire is to handle God's Word faithfully, even while every volume may not be verse-by-verse commentary.2) The series has busy pastors in view by presenting its material in a readable, pastoral style rather than academic.3) A desire to be known for the ""inclusion of helpful illustrations and theological driven applications.4) To exalt Christ in every book of the Bible. They carefully state that, ""we are not commending wild allegory or fanciful typology.  We must be constrained to the meaning intended by the divine Author Himself, the Holy Spirit of God.  However, we also believe that the Bible has a Messianic focus, and the authors in this series will exalt Christ from all of their texts.""Some of the authors that will contribute to this series that is projected to be 48 volumes are: David Platt, Daniel Akin, Tony Merida, Al Mohler, Eric Mason, Mark Dever, Russ Moore, Matt Chandler, Francis Chan, Thabiti Anyabwile, J.D. Greear and Paige Patterson.  This is a very respectable list of pastors and authors to contribute to this series.Exalting Jesus in Galatians by David Platt and Tony Merida will definitely serve as a useful resource for the pastor/teacher or lay-person.  Each section first presents the ""Main Idea"" of the text.  This is what the author see as the main point that the biblical author is trying to convey in the text.  Next a brief outline is provided to give the reader a visual of the flow of the passage at hand.  After this is the main section, the exposition.  This isn't a commentary that is going to dig deep into the languages or sentence structure but rather reads much more like a devotional commentary.  Each section ends with questions to help solidify what was just read into the reader's mind.I was extremely blessed by the doctrinally sound commentary found in this edition.  Many times I found the move from exposition to application to be very helpful.  An example of this can be seen in the section on Galatians 1:6-10 and Paul's concern for the Galatians.  Merida states: ""The Galatians transfer hurt to Paul because he saw them as his spiritual children...He was in agony, desiring to see them grow into Christlikeness and knowing that their turning was anything but an insignificant event. His passion reminds us that truth should matter to us! When someone is turning away from Christ, it should grieve us. And when someone is walking in the gospel of grace it should thrill us."" Merida's comparison of Paul's anguish over the Galatians turning to our own anguish is timely, as many in our day are turning away from Christ to a ""prosperity gospel"" or some other false gospel.I was also blessed by the points Merida drew out of the text in what turning from the gospel actually means.  They are: 1) When you turn from the gospel, you turn from God Himself. 2) When you turn from the gospel, you turn from the grace of Christ. and 3) When you turn from the gospel, you have nowhere else to go.  Ultimately we should be passionate about the purity of the gospel because ""Christ glory is at stake,"" ""people's souls are at stake,"" and ""the health of the church is at stake.""  Merida's clear exposition and application made this section a blessing to read.Overall, I continue to be impressed with this series. I have now read multiple volumes in this series and each has been a blessing. This is one of the most accessible commentaries that I have come across.  I was blessed by this commentary and found it very helpful and look forward to future volumes in this series.  Overall, excellent work!

"Ordinary: How to Turn the World Upside Down by Tony Merida is a fresh look at how believers can do ""ordinary"" things with a Kingdom focus for the glory of God and the good of others. The first thing that I look for in any book on meeting social needs is balance.  So often, in our present day good deeds towards others gets pushed to the forefront and the gospel gets forgotten.  Another negative outcome can be that people trust in their good works towards others as a means of salvation and forget that their righteousness is based on Christ's work and not their own. Even with these negative possibilities the church still needs to be aware of physical needs around them and help where they can.  The purpose of Ordinary is to make the church aware of opportunities to show neighborly love, hospitality, care for the vulnerable and advocacy for the voiceless in the course of our ""ordinary"" Christian lives.Recognizing the extremes mentioned above Merida states clearly that ""the order of good deeds and the good news is a matter of life and death. Good deeds follow the good news, but good deeds cannot merit eternal life."" This is foundational to any of our good deeds towards others, but with the proper perspective the good news should fuel good deeds.  Loving others also means that reconciliation with God should always be in our thoughts.  Merida states that ""we don't love the world the way Jesus loved the world if we don't call others to repentance. And we should do so in a spirit of brokenness and repentance ourselves. Love doesn't equal tolerance.""  Ultimately, love for others recognizes their spiritual poverty and won't stop at just alleviating their physical poverty.Merida clearly charges both extremes by saying, ""the places of greatest poverty and social need are often the places with the greatest need for the gospel proclamation also. We don't need to argue over whether we should do word ministry or deed ministry; we simply need to go. When we get there, we should serve them and love and speak to them and love.""  He continues, ""Sadly, many today want to do mercy and justice ministry without talking about the atonement. But that shouldn't be the case. Mercy ministry is about alleviating suffering. Those who want to alleviate suffering should want to alleviate more than temporary suffering. They should want to alleviate eternal suffering, which can only come through faith in Christ."" He doesn't leave the other extreme without a charge, but says to them: ""The ""anti-social ministry"" people need to also remember that some can't hear our proclamation until they've been delivered physically from injustice and other forms of suffering. Until we pick them up from the road, they won't hear the good news. Today, millions are being drugged, sold, and raped multiple times a day in sex-trafficking. Do you think they will hear your proclamation? I don't.""We need to love in word and deed.  Ultimately, we need to recognize that only the Word will truly save and we cannot neglect that.  Yet, deed is important because it shows the love of Christ to others and many times will pull them out of the pit to a position to hear the Gospel message. Humility is a necessary characteristic for all of God's people and caring for the 'least of these' will require great humility.  Merida's closing chapter is especially helpful in pointing this out.  He says, ""We must kill pride, and replace it with a heart of humility. We do this by working the gospel deeply into our hearts. When you realize that you were poor, bringing nothing to the table when Jesus invited you, then it changes your view of the poor. When you realize that you were crippled, unable to come to God when he brought you in, then it changes the way you think about the week. Pharisees don't understand Grace. They're often mad, self-righteous, and elitist. Grace-driven people are happy, humble, and hospitable to the poor and weak.""  Grace goes to people, with the gospel and with physical help.  We should always recognize that gospel proclamation is our main task, as sometimes the gospel and social work can be given equal footing. But this doesn't mean that we neglect social needs when they are clear and present around us.  The gospel proclamation however must be our end goal because temporary comfort isn't a worthwhile exchange for eternal wrath.I found at times that Merida's language of ""need,"" ""should,"" and ""must"" to come across a bit strong.  Even though he states that guilt isn't a good motivator, when such language is used it can leave the reader with a sense of guilt if they don't run out and start doing all of the things mentioned in this book.  It should also be noted that a Christian simply cannot be involved in every type of ministry.  The burden that God places on one part of the body isn't necessarily the same one that he places on other parts (Praise the Lord for our many members with many functions).  This doesn't mean that we shouldn't ask ""What can be done to help people in need?"" but it does mean that not everyone will fall into the types of care mentioned in this book.  Balance is always needed and it seemed that although Merida presents balance in the quotes mentioned above, the stress on these social needs can leave the reader feeling less ""spiritual"" if they aren't involved in these areas.  The Christian who runs the orphanage in Africa isn't more spiritual than the Christian plumber who works for the Glory of God.  They simply have different callings and that's ok.I received a copy of this book from B&H Books via Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26WJ5WINKM0ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYV3QPM#wasThisHelpful","R26WJ5WINKM0ZP","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is There Anybody Out There? by Mez McConnell is a highly encouraging (though tough to read at times) journey of one man's life who truly is a trophy of grace. Full disclosure: I don't really enjoy reading biographies all that much.  I'm not sure if maybe I got a hold of some dry, dull ones at some point and that turned me off to them or what, but I tend to shy away from reading too many biographies. Part of this reason may be that receiving so many books for review purposes I find it hard to review biographies.  I mean, what do you say? Your life story is kind of lame, terrible book?!?  This shying away from biographies is certainly evident in my 2014 reading.  In fact, looking over my reading list from last year this was the only biography that I did read.  So why read this one?About a year or so ago I became aware of a church planting movement in Scotland called 20Schemes.  Mez McConnell is the founder of 20 Schemes and senior pastor of Niddrie Community Church (the church that 20 Schemes is based out of).  After watching his video testimony online I wanted to hear the whole story, and so I received this book a short while later.Once I opened the cover I found it nearly impossible, aside from the need for sleep, to put this book down.  The amount of difficulty, pain and abuse that McConnell endured as a child was difficult to read. In fact, one of the only things that makes it readable for me is knowing that I know how the story ends.  McConnell's abusive childhood gives way to a reckless lifestyle as he gets older.  Substance abuse and crime became a normal lifestyle which ultimately lead to jail time.  Reading the journey from that lifestyle to one that leads to mission work in Brazil and church planting among Scotland's poor points to what a mighty Savior we have.  No darkness is too deep, no pain to much for Him to not be able to rescue and redeem His children.  For this reason I highly recommend reading this book.  You will no doubt exalt the grace of God in Christ as you journey through the book.I received a copy of this book from Christian Focus in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEX5TEDH57J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1845507738#wasThisHelpful","R2UEX5TEDH57J5","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jesus Continued...Why the Spirit Inside You is Better Than Jesus Beside You is an eye-catching new title that seeks to bring clarity to how the Spirit works in the Christian's life.  Often Christians fall into one of two lines of thinking on how the Spirit works: 1) If the Spirit is at work there will be outward signs and wonders, lots of flash and show and production that accompanies His work.  This hyper-charismatic thinking has highjacked many churches in the sense that the written Word of God can take a backseat to outward experiences of the individual.  2) Out of fear of falling over the edge into the first group, sometimes Christians can flat out ignore the Holy Spirit, as if He isn't even a living, active member of the Trinity.  As believers, we should desire to be Biblically faithful in our thinking about the Spirit and not a product of one of the above environments.If the reader gets nothing else out of this book Greear certainly will help them to see that the Spirit can't be separated from the Bible or Christ. Greear clearly states, ""we cannot know the Spirit apart from the revealed Word. That Word, Jesus, said, was all about him (John 5:39). The Spirit points to Jesus' words and works, not his own (John 16:14). In fact, there is a certain irony in how the Spirit operates; whenever he is really present, you are not thinking about him, you're thinking about Jesus. The Spirit's work is to direct you to notice something else......This means that when someone claims to be filled with the Spirit and yet spends most of his time talking about his own experiences with the Spirit, you have reason to doubt whether he really is filled with the Spirit. When the Holy Spirit speaks through someone, you tend to forget about the person speaking. You don't even really think about the Holy Spirit. You find yourself thinking about Jesus.""  The Bible is the filter for all activity and thought we may claim is to be coming from the Spirit.  Greear continues, ""we know that the Spirit leads and guides and acts in line with the Scriptures that God has already inspired. In his written Word, the Spirit of God is always speaking and never silent. Yet he also sometimes 'breaks in' to our experience in unexpected ways to give us specific guidance, strength, or insight at particular times. The precise nature of the 'breaking in' we can never script, demand, predict, or even anticipate. It is like the wind. The most that we can say is that it will never contradict, violate, or diminish the Word he already has given to us. This is the joyful, mysterious journey of the Christian life."" With the proper understanding that the Spirit focuses on Christ and never contradicts Scripture we will be better equipped to understand these ""break ins.""  So, if walking down the street I get the urge to do something ""spirit led"" that draws much attention to myself and makes little of Christ I can be sure that that is not from the Spirit. However, if walking down the street I get the urging to talk to someone I just passed about Christ, I can weigh this ""urging"" against Scripture and recognize that it is in line with the Word and could very well be an urging from the Spirit.  The key is that Scripture sets the boundaries for us, not our emotions and experiences. So, ""when is comes to the voice of God, the Scriptures are in a class all by themselves. God is always speaking clearly and reliably there. Want to hear the Spirit? Open you Bible.""  This seems simple and straightforward, but many will move past the Bible in search for an experience.In the second part of the book Greear examines how Christians can experience the Holy Spirit: In the Gospel, In the Word of God, In Our Giftings, In the Church, In Our Spirit, and In Our Circumstances.  Each of these sections is helpful and practical.  Greear takes a non-cessationist perspective in regards to gifts, but I think that he does it in a very conservative way if I can say it like that.  He admits he is always cautious and questioning to make sure whatever the experience is does indeed line up with Scripture, but he doesn't dismiss God breaking in in extraordinary ways.Overall I found this book to be a helpful read.  It would be highly beneficial to many today who are confused about how the Holy Spirit works in the life of a believer.I received a copy of this book from Zondervan in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IV3CQXOPSLLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1UEAC4#wasThisHelpful","R1IV3CQXOPSLLC","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The relationship between evangelism and social action is a relationship that has caused much conversation and thought in the recent years.  A heightened awareness of social needs has prompted many Christians to sacrifice much for the physical needs of people. Sadly, sometimes this awareness has overshadowed the proclamation of the gospel as the main thing the church should be doing.  Some react to this line of thinking by only proclaiming the gospel and not focusing the time and energy of the church on social needs. Thankfully in Salt, Light and Cities on Hills Melvin Tinker examines these extremes and shows a ""middle way"" that cares for the physical needs of people without forgetting that the proclamation of the gospel is our great call.Tinker begins by looking back over history to trace these thoughts out.  He does a nice job succinctly presenting how differing views have been shaped and molded over time by various people.  He really makes a point to show that the thought of social transformation as having equal footing with evangelism is really a novel idea.  On the reformers he states, ""One would be hard-pressed to find any evidence that they would have shared the view that it was one of its 'principal aims.' Where in the New Testament is this ever put forward as being the case if evangelism is taken as proclaiming the evangel? The evangel as presented by the apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans displays no indication of social transformation being integral to the message; rather, it is a spiritual transformation which is its focus. As people's relationship with God is changed, social change also takes place, which is primarily, although not exclusively, within the realm of the redeemed community - the church"" This is a key quote.  With spiritual change comes social change.  A redeemed community (the Church) should desire to meet the physical needs of needy people they come in contact with, but this can't be seen as the main goal. Rather, social action is the natural outflow of a spiritual transformation.Tinker's examination of Tim Keller placing evangelism and social concern has equal task for the church is also well done. He shows the flaw in Keller's line of thinking by stating that, ""the most obvious argument for the primacy of evangelism is not considered, which is in terms of what is ultimately at stake, namely, peoples eternal destiny. When this is placed into the equation, evangelism's primacy becomes self-evident. The test which can be applied is a simple theoretical one: given no alternative but a straightforward choice between sharing the Gospel with someone who is dying and alleviating their physical condition which should we do? The answer must be to share the Gospel if we take eternal reality seriously."" Evangelism should be the churches primary task because it seeks to alleviate eternal suffering, not just temporal.This does not mean that the church ignores the physical needs of people.  This is where Tinker helpfully shows balance.  He states, ""no doubt many ministries of mercy will be carried out on an individual level by members of a congregation. But this should not make the church leadership complacent and leaving matters there. The Evangelical churches which emphasize evangelism in line with it's biblical priority would not be content to leave witness to ad hoc day-to-day witness of its members but tend to invest vast amounts of time, money, energy and personnel in organized corporate evangelism, so why should social action be treated any differently?"" The church should corporately and actively pursue ways to meet physical needs in their community. The key is understanding the relationship between evangelism and social action, and this is where Melvin Tinker has provided a most useful tool for the church.I received a copy of this book from Evangelical Press in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDOQSZLRDNBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178397043X#wasThisHelpful","RDOQSZLRDNBV","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About a month ago I received a new family devotional and Sunday School curriculum by Marty Machowski titled Prepare Him Room: Celebrating the Birth of Jesus (my review can be found here).  I found this to be an excellent tool and my wife used it in her 1-3 grade class for Advent. Sovereign Grace Music also released an album titled Prepare Him Room: Celebrating the Birth of Jesus in Song which is referenced for the singing times in each devotion.  Because of time constraints the album didn't make it to the Sunday School class, but that doesn't mean that it didn't bless our home.  For the past couple of weeks this album has been playing non-stop as I drive around for work all day.  About a week ago, after much urging from me and my non-stop talk about it, my wife finally gave it a listen, and now whenever there is music playing in our home it is this album.  I am not speaking in exaggerated language at all, we simply cannot get enough of this album.So why such love for the album?  For me it is the blend of classical Christmas songs like: Come All Ye Faithful, What Child Is This, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing performed really well in combination with many new favorites like: He Who Is Mighty, Prepare Him Room, God Made Low and more.  Most of these new songs get replayed multiple times as I make my way through the album.  The lyrical content is so rich and provides a wonderful opportunity to praise God in song.  A new form of O Holy Night titled O Holy Night (Hear the Gospel Story) provides new words that incorporate Christ's sacrifice and our need to receive Him with the traditional first verse.  Overall, this album has been and will continue to be an incredible blessing for my family and I cannot recommend it highly enough.  Go buy this...You WILL NOT be disappointed.I received a digital copy of this album from Sovereign Grace Music in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N6A2NZOZKWC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLNRXV2#wasThisHelpful","R2N6A2NZOZKWC9","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a child adopted at birth I was graciously placed in a loving family and never experienced life as an orphan.  As a child (although 26 years old when it happened) adopted into God's family I will never be a spiritual orphan, but rather a loved son.  These two truths alone stir my heart for adoption and have influenced my wife's heart and my heart to seriously consider adoption for any future children.  For these reasons A Passion for the Fatherless by Daniel Bennett was a title that caught my attention.A Passion for the Fatherless accomplishes the task that it sets out by its subtitle  Developing a God-Centered Ministry to Orphans in 3 parts: 1) God and the Orphan 2) God's People and the Orphan 3) Starting an Orphan Care Ministry in Your Church.  Part One: God and the Orphan lays the theological framework for care for orphans.  Many believers will be familiar with James 1:27: Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.  In this one simple verse James places a high calling on care for orphans and widows, a calling that simply cannot be glossed over without thought.  Bennett does a great job of pointing out that Christian orphan care is a unique ministry in that it brings glory to God.  The secular world can, and does, care for many people in our society who are overlooked BUT if they do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord then they are not glorifying God in their ministry.  This is the unique opportunity that only Christian orphan care brings.  God's love for the orphan (us) is clear by the language that he chooses to use (adoption, Abba Father, etc) in regards to our relationship with Him and Christian orphan ministry allows us to mirror that love to those who have a great need for love and care.  Part Two: God's People and the Orphan is where Bennett ties these two thoughts together and shows how God's people should respond to orphans.Part Three: Starting an Orphan Care Ministry in Your Church is the practical application portion where Bennett guides the reader into how to ""flesh"" orphan care out in the local church.  This section is a great reference tool for church leaders to see a working model for ministry.  In the end orphan care is difficult and costly, but reaches out to those in need with the love of Christ and brings glory to God.  Overall this is a helpful look at the theological and practical side of orphan care and the church.  Definitely a worthwhile book for church leaders to spend some time in.I received a free copy of this book from Kregel Academic in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDM61OUX2F21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=082544375X#wasThisHelpful","R1HDM61OUX2F21","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Worry.  One of those words that certainly carries with it negative feelings.  Sadly, many believers really struggle with worry. We worry about health, we worry about our job, we worry about bills, we worry about our kids and on...and on.. and on.  Many times our thought life in regards to worry doesn't look much different from the world. Even though Philippians 4:8 provides us with a nice list of things to think about instead of worrying, we would rather worry.  The problem with worry is that it reveals doubts in our hearts and minds about the sovereignty of God.  If I truly believe that God is sovereign then my mind should focus on Him instead of worry.Mindscape: What to Think About Instead of Worrying is a new release from Timothy Witmer that provides a practical help to those who struggle with worry.  Mindscape ""is not designed to be an academic tome on cognitive or behavioral theory; rather, it is a practical guide for real people with real problems. It is written for everyone who has ever worried about anything!""  This approach makes the book a useful tool for practically anyone as well as for one-to-one or group studies.To stop worrying we must redirect our attention to something or Someone more worthy of our time. ""The answer to a transformed mindscape [the landscape of our minds] doesn't come from the outside in but through transformation from the inside out. This transformation occurs as we daily go to Jesus and faith and ask for his power to change, to listen, and to think differently."" Ultimately the work to overcome worry is the Spirit's and we must learn to seek Him while we seek to put of worry.Witmer walks through Philippians 4:8 with the reader focusing on what we should think on as opposed to worry.  Each chapter examines a small portion of this text and provides the reader with good thoughts to reorient their thinking to Christ and away from worry. This isn't theologically deep or heavy exposition, but rather, as Witmer states, it is very practical. Each chapter also includes, Food for Thought questions as well as memory verses.  This is a helpful addition to anyone using this in a group setting.

"The Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary Series is a new commentary series from Holman Reference edited by David Platt, Daniel Akin and Tony Merida.  The editor's goal is ""to present an easy reading, practical and friendly commentary"" and ""to exalt Jesus from every book of the Bible.""  In the introduction the editors lay out four distinguishing characteristics for the series.They are:1) This series seeks to display exegetical accuracy. The desire is to handle God's Word faithfully, even while every volume may not be verse-by-verse commentary.2) The series has busy pastors in view by presenting its material in a readable, pastoral style rather than academic.3) A desire to be known for the ""inclusion of helpful illustrations and theological driven applications.4) To exalt Christ in every book of the Bible. They carefully state that, ""we are not commending wild allegory or fanciful typology.  We must be constrained to the meaning intended by the divine Author Himself, the Holy Spirit of God.  However, we also believe that the Bible has a Messianic focus, and the authors in this series will exalt Christ from all of their texts.""Some of the authors that will contribute to this series that is projected to be 48 volumes are: David Platt, Daniel Akin, Tony Merida, Al Mohler, Eric Mason, Mark Dever, Russ Moore, Matt Chandler, Francis Chan, Thabiti Anyabwile, J.D. Greear and Paige Patterson.  This is a very respectable list of pastors and authors to contribute to this series.Exalting Jesus in James by David Platt will definitely serve as a useful resource for the pastor/teacher or lay-person.  Each section first presents the ""Main Idea"" of the text.  This is what the author see as the main point that the biblical author is trying to convey in the text.  Next a brief outline is provided to give the reader a visual of the flow of the passage at hand.  After this is the main section, the exposition.  Here Platt provides a very nice clear, concise exposition of the text.  James certainly contains some difficult text, especially when read in isolation and Platt does a good job of keeping the main idea of the passage in mind as he goes.  This isn't a commentary that is going to dig deep into the languages or sentence structure but rather reads much more like a devotional commentary.  Each section ends with questions to help solidify what was just read into the reader's mind.I found Platt's exposition on James 2:14-24 to be quite helpful.  This section is definitely a difficult section of Scripture when it comes to the relationship between faith and works.  Platt quickly points out that ""we need to consider how these verses fit with the entirety of Scripture's teaching on faith and works and how these verses radically challenge and change our lives."" This is a key point.  Scripture must interpret Scripture and we must look for how this section fits with the Bible as a whole.  Platt is clear as to what direction he is going to take with this section when he says, ""The point of the passage is that this person doesn't really have faith. He claims to have it, but he doesn't. His so-called faith is dead and worthless. It does not save; quite literally, it does not work. Understanding this is important because James is not contrasting someone who has immature faith with someone who has mature faith, or someone who has a nominal faith with someone who has authentic faith. He's telling us that you either have faith that saves or you don't there's no in-between.....How do you know if someone has faith that saves? James tells us to look for fruit. Now, he's not saying we need to add deeds to faith in order to be saved. He is saying that deeds are the fruit of faith, and that real, true, genuine faith produces fruit."" This is an important point to see.  True faith will work and true believers will bear fruit.Platt's main point in this entire section is that genuine faith results in work.  He gets very pointed at a major issue in American Christianity is a summary statement: Demons believe a lot of things that we believe - they believe in the existence of God, the deity of Christ, and the presence of heaven and hell. They know Christ as the eternal Judge, and they know that Christ alone is able to save. I fear that countless men and women have bought into the soul-damning idea that mere intellectual assent to the truth of God in Christ is enough to save, and the reality is that these people are no better off than the demons themselves.... The demons believe and they ""shudder."" They are affected by the truth of God; they tremble at it. I wonder how many people define their faith today merely by the emotions they feel at any given time.  These are words that the Church needs to hear, and James focus on works is simply that true faith will result in works.I have now read multiple volumes in this series and each has been a blessing. This is one of the most accessible commentaries that I have come across.  I was blessed by this commentary and found it very helpful and look forward to future volumes in this series.

"Tracing Christian theology over the course of the last 2000 years is no easy task.  However, this is the task that Gerald Bray decided to take on in his new book God Has Spoken: A History of Christian Theology.  At 1264 pages it is quite clear that Bray has really poured a lot of work into this volume.  The breadth of sources is simply outstanding.  One could spend hours trying track down all the information that is presented in just a single chapter. This really would serve the pastor, teacher or student as a great reference work to have.  This is the type of book that will be helpful anytime the reader wants to have a better grasp on how certain theological topics developed.The book is divided into 8 parts: The Israelite Legacy, The Person of the Father, The Work of the Father, The Person of the Son, The Work of the Son, The Person of the Holy Spirit, The Work of the Holy Spirit, One God in Three Persons. The Trinitarian framework in which Bray presents the material is different than any other historical theology that I've read and was a welcome surprise.Bray draws from so many sources it would simply be impossible to list in this review.  Needless to say, he has done his homework and the end result is a helpful look at the development of theology throughout the history of the church. I would definitely recommend this volume to any serious student of church history.I received a digital copy of this book from Crossway in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24LMSZ6YZ7FOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7UPECI#wasThisHelpful","R24LMSZ6YZ7FOJ","AAJSA96WL6U6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAJSA96WL6U6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It has a sky high stiletto heel and a two inch platform which makes it a shoe that is easy to walk in and comfortable to wear for long periods.  The sizing fits me like I would expect, my true size is a half size when I can find the shoe in a wide size, otherwise I just order the next half size up which I have to do with Onlymaker because they don't have a half-size unless you have your shoe custom made.  I have been very happy with ordering the half size since I am very impatient and don't want to wait the extra time for a custom made shoe.  The shoe is very well made and looks fabulous.

"I have been using this for several months now and couldn't be happier with it.  It comes with the cables I need to charge all of my devices.  I have an IPhone 4 for work, an IPhone 5S for personal use, and an Android Tablet.  This came with all of the cables I needed to charge all of my devices which fit very nicely in the carrying case that came with my Juice Box which means I don't have to worry about having the right cable to charge a device.  I have even used a USB hub to charge all of my devices at one time and it was able to do that.I am an avid cyclist and that also provided my biggest test of the Juice Box.  In July I rode my bike on RAGBRAI which is a week long bike ride across the State of Iowa.  Many rural areas of Iowa are lacking in cell towers and with 15,000 bike riders all with cell phones even when there is a cell tower it is hard to get a connection because of all of the phones trying to connect.  So it ends up being a huge drain on cell phone batteries with your phone always searching for a signal.  Power to charge your phone when you reach your overnight towns is also hard to find since you are competing with 15,000 people also trying to find power.  My Juice Box helped me keep my phone charged up and not having to compete with everyone else for power.  And as an added bonus the built in flashlight helped me to find my way around the campgrounds at night plus giving me the light I needed in my tent.I am very pleased with my Juice Box and would recommend it to everyone looking for a portable power source for your mobile device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DQX2URNQAYYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E2TT8W6#wasThisHelpful","R3DQX2URNQAYYM","A2KBV88FL48CFS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBV88FL48CFS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to edit my HDR photos.  I purchased a $30 Photomatix plugin for Lightroom and now have the perfect HDR editing tool.  This makes the perfect HDR photos in just minutes.  With the help of a youtube video I was up and running in no time at all.  Lightroom comes with many presets for photo editing and you can find thousands more free presets online that allow you to do amazing things with your photos and it only takes seconds to do this.  I now love to shoot photos on a cloudy day because of the dramatic effects you can get using Lightroom.  Lightroom allows you to do many things that you used to require Photoshop to edit and it makes it so easy to accomplish what used to be a cumbersome task in Photoshop.Easy to learn, easy to use, and excellent results what more do you need out of a photo editing software.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHQP5FS9K5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CY1O8DS#wasThisHelpful","RAHQP5FS9K5J","A2KBV88FL48CFS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBV88FL48CFS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sleeping bag was exactly what I needed.  The only time I camp is my annual RAGBRAI ride and space is a concern.  For one week we ride our bikes across Iowa and have to get all of our gear for 20 people in our support vehicle each day so smaller is better.  This sleeping bag compressed down to about the size of a quart jar so it was much smaller than a regular sleeping bag so it was perfect for me.  We had a couple of nights that got down in the 50's so it was more than enough to keep me warm.  It is well made and will last me for many rides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQEAUI36FN0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Z0H5CY#wasThisHelpful","RWQEAUI36FN0H","A2KBV88FL48CFS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBV88FL48CFS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this sandal and it's high stiletto heel. If you are not used to walking in shoes with heel heights over 5 inches this is not the shoe for you. If you are comfortable with heels over 5 inches this may be the sandal for you. This is not the first pair of shoes I purchased with such a heel height, and not even the first pair of sandals with over 5 inch heels I have purchased. That being said I found these shoes easy for me to walk in, this is not a shoe you will try to run in but if you are used to walking in sky high heels you will like these shoes. They are well made and fit me the way I expected them to fit. I love the look of this shoe with the multi color they will go with many things in my closet.

"When the bag clips first arrived I was really happy with them, they look just like I expected in size, shape and color. They all have a nice wide, secure grip as well. These are much more tight than the clips I have been using so that was another plus for me. Although they have good tension, they are still easy to open, they do not open extremely wide but it’s wide enough to get them on the bags. If I have really thins bags I can even clip two together. These are the strongest bag clips I have ever used, I normally use some form of plastic bag clips but these have been much stronger and I do think they are much more effective at keeping the air out.  I put some to use right away and a set the extras aside. I am going to try something different with the extras. I bought some plain magnets and  I plan to glue them to the backs of my extra clips. My hope is that when they are not in use as bag clips I can use them on the refrigerator. I will update this review once I try that out.

"I ordered this mask at a discount in exchange for my honest review and it has been great. We live in the Midwest and it can get pretty icy cold at times during the winter. My husband and I live on over 4  acres and have a very long driveway. Any time we do trash, get the mail, plow, or walk around the house at all it’s a bit of a distance so we need to bundle up. The mask fits both my husband and I just fine and is very comfortable. Here are my thoughts:ProsSuper thin and light weight, it’s not bulky and in the way so it can fit under a buttoned up coat, you can put a scarf over it and still it’s not too bulkyYou can easily wear a hat along with itIt’s very breathable, I wear glasses so if something is over my nose and mouth they will fog up, this drastically reduces that problem. Most of the time they don’t fog, there may be a breath or too if I am bending over where they fog but it’s not an issue. The vent near the mouth really helps reduce it overall.Super soft and comfortable, I could wear it all day if I had to, it’s not scratchy nor does it cause me any irritationVery easy to put on and offStays in place very well, not a lot of shifting aroundProtects well from wind and coldConsSo far I have not discovered any cons to this, it’s warm, comfortable, and protects me. If I encounter any quality issues I will update this review.Overall this is well constructed, really comfortable and I love how lightweight it is so if I want to layer I can do so without being uncomfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IV12T2THCOBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WSTK4Q#wasThisHelpful","R3IV12T2THCOBJ","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently pulled out my paints to work on a craft project and more than half of them were dried out so it was time for some new! I first checked the craft store but wasn’t really finding what I wanted size and color wise. This set is really perfect for what I wanted. The tubes of paint are a very generous size 75ml and the lids snap closed securely so I don’t think I will have an issue with them drying out as quickly as my others did. It is a nice thick paint that goes on very easily and has great coverage.  I am not a painter but I use paints for general crafting. These paints I used to paint leaves and they provided a nice thick coverage. They also mix well together. I used the white go get other shades of the blues, yellows, and reds and the brown. I have also painted on cardstock paper with these and that works great too. I don’t notice an overwhelming scent to the paint either which is nice.

"I have long, straight, very fine hair and this mask works great. My hair tends to tangle easily and the ends can become damaged. I have been using and argan oil shampoo recently and have tried masks in the past. I have been really happy with the results so I wanted to try this mask. It compares just as well with the others. It leaves my hair so soft and easy to comb and the effects last for a few days. The mask is white in color and has a bit of a floral scent to it. There's something I like about the scent but also something I'm not liking, I like the floral scent but not sure what the other smell is I'm picking up on. Aside from that I love the mask. It's really easy to apply I just scoop out some on my fingers and work it into my hair, I let it sit and then rinse it very well. It rinses easily but because my hair is so fine I rinse well or it can weigh my hair down a tad. The day of using it my hair combs out so easily.

It tends to damage easily and tangles a lot so I need a conditioner that helps with that. This conditioner has been perfect for me. The conditioner is white in color and I can't pick much of a scent to it so it is truly unscented which is nice for sensitive scalps. The consistency is thick and not runny. It goes on my hair very easily and I let it sit for a few mins before I rinse it out. I was worried that it might be difficult to rinse out but it rinses very easily, I was impressed. My hair is smooth and much easier to brush out after the shower. My hair is very long so it can be a challenge to do both those things, rinse well and then comb out while it is wet. Since my hair is so fine another challenge is finding a conditioner that doesn't weigh it down or leave it looking greasy and this one does not. My only complaint would be the bottle it comes in, I just wish it was a bit more pliable so it can be easily squeezed. This isn't too much of an issue but it would make the whole package. Overall I am very happy with this and will continue to use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WSEC9RWHJHZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015I0UABU#wasThisHelpful","R2WSEC9RWHJHZ7","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently ran out of my facial serum so wanted to try this. I have combination skin and I also tend to have clogged pores. My facial skin is not overly sensitive like some people but it can be sensitive. This serum does have some bite, when I first put it on there is a bit of a sting, it’s not enough to bother me and it goes away pretty quickly but there is a bit of a bite to it. It comes in a pump and I need about a half of a pump to cover my face and neck, a little goes a long way. It has a white color and the consistency is thick like a facial lotion, not watery like some serums. I am neutral on the scent of this, there is something in it that smells really good and there is something in it that I don’t care for, a strong chemical type smell. I tried shaking it up a bit to see if that would help. I wonder if it is a fluke because other reviewers seem to like the scent. It’s not enough to make me dislike the serum altogether but it’s not my favorite scent. I can't find an expiration date anywhere on the bottle or packaging either. So far my skin has an overall brighter look to it (just not so dull) so I am happy with that. I will continue to use this and update the review with any other results I have from using it. Overall I like what I am seeing so far I’m just not a huge fan of the scent.I ordered this serum for free in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QWR8DJFG5RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGUB23E#wasThisHelpful","R20QWR8DJFG5RW","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this set of lights at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really love them. They are a very bright purple (they are even very bright during the day!) The battery pack makes it very easy to decorate where I want to. I am mixing the purple, pink, and blue colors for what I want to decorate and it looks really pretty. The battery pack is clear plastic so you can see the batteries in it, which isn't a big deal because I hide the pack behind something. The lights are easy to work with and don't tangle up on me while I'm setting them up. They also don't get hot which is better than my usual Christmas lights. I also plan to use these for my daughter's birthday party because they are so bright during the day they will still look great for her party. Overall I am really happy with these and haven't had any quality issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQV1LET2BSFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013J8XNGC#wasThisHelpful","R2HQV1LET2BSFM","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this set of lights at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really love them. I wanted some battery sets like this so I could be more flexible with how I decorate and these are perfect. I can hide the battery pack behind some other decor and spread my lights out how I like. The battery pack is a clear plastic and you can see the batteries inside of it so I like to hide it. These light are extremely bright. Even during the day they are very bright. They are easy to work with as well they don't tangle up like my traditional lights do.

"I ordered this slope bag at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really love it. I ordered the “Feather” pattern and it’s really vibrant and unique. The bag is very well made and a great quality. I use this as a stand in for my diaper bag if I am going some place like the zoo for the day. I also use it when taking my little on to her swim lessons so I can carry just what I need for the short lesson. It has plenty of room for a few diapers, her snack cup, large toddler sippy cup, diaper wipes, a change of clothes, and my camera. That is what I typically carry it in but there is room for more if need be. There is also a small zipper pocket in the front that’s really convenient for a cell phone, money, and keys. There is a second, larger, front pocket that I use to keep the zoo map in but it could hold much more than that (that pocket also has a keychain clip but we use it for a small anitbac bottle).The interior of the bag is waterproof (mine is a hot pink color too!) which is great because my little one’s cup leaked out the other day but it didn’t soak the whole bag I was able to just wipe it out and it was dry. The interior also has two main zipper pockets that are about the same size, one onside I keep diaper items and the other I put food items. One of them has a small interior zippered pocket that you could also use for keys and cell phone but we keep a small sunscreen and chap stick in this pocket. The second large main pocket has a Velcro pocket that is designed to hold a 7 inch tablet.Overall I really love how much this holds and how versatile it is. The bag itself is lightweight which is really important for me because I have back problems. Just holding her empty diaper bag it is much heavier than the empty slope bag and that really makes a difference when you are carrying this for hours at the zoo or park. The strap is very tick and sturdy and it’s very easy to adjust. The buckle that’s on the adjustable strap is also very sturdy and an excellent quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZLL7AH7BEEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GAOPLG#wasThisHelpful","R2LZLL7AH7BEEU","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this selfie stick at a discount in exchange for my honest review and it has been great! This is the best style selfie stick for me because all you do is plug it into your phone rather than hook up with blue tooth.It works perfect with my iphone 5s and 4s. When I first got this it took me less than one minute to get it out of the box, put my phone on and take a picture. Directions are included if you haven't used one before but it's so simple to use. The telescopic arm is nice and sturdy and it doesn't swivel around like some I have used. This holds my phone tightly and keeps it steady. You can get a lot more people in a selfie groups shot with this! Plus you get more of your scenic background. I haven't had any issues with this one and I really like it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ETNTPKD2SODF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K5ANRK#wasThisHelpful","R1ETNTPKD2SODF","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this set of earphones at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I have to say I didn't expect to care for them because they look just like what came with my iphone. I wanted to give it a try to see if they would be any more comfortable and they are! The set that came with my iphone for some reason starts to hurt after about a half an hour. This set looks almost just like them but the comfort lasts! I use them to listen to movies after my little one goes to bed. My husband and I watch on our lap top and use earphones so we don't wake her. I can get through an entire movie and these are still comfortable. They also have a great sound. So far I have had no quality issues with them and I'm really happy with the sound and comfort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GI1PPCASGYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154ARF94#wasThisHelpful","R3GI1PPCASGYL","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this pedometer at a discount in exchange for my honest review and it has been great. Here are my thoughts:ProsSmall and light weightVery accurate in counting my steps – I used this right out of the box and my steps were accurate I didn’t  have to calibrate my stride or anything so that was very nice!It’s simple, there is not much to it – the display shows you the total steps taken, distance walked, and an estimate of calories burned based on those two things the display shows only one of those at a time so to see the other info you just press the mode button and it will show you the nextMotivates me to be more active during the day – this really shows you how sedentary you can be in the course of the day an reminds me to get movingIt has a rounded shape unlike my last unit, so it’s not snagging on clothingHas an auto shut off mode so if you are inactive for 4 mins it will go to sleep so it’s a nice battery saver, once you move it wakes up and starts counting againConsIn order to see the three different modes you have to press the “mode” button, which is fine but it’s located on the back of the unit so you have to take it off or if you are wearing loose pants you can kinda twist it to the side but you will need to remember which one is the mode button because it’s right next to the “set:” buttonSame thing with the “reset” button it’s on the back so you either have to take it off or try and twist it to the side to press it.The display has a concaved look to it so it can be a bit difficult to read and it’s not back lit so you can’t read it in the darkThe clip is not they type you pinch to open, it just slides down onto the waist band but it’s not much room so if you have on a thick waist band this will be really tightThe pedometer is very accurate in counting my steps but it can pick up extra movements to so it may show a slightly higher number of steps than what you actual too over the course of a full day. To me this isn’t that big of a deal but maybe to some people if they are tracking distance.Overall I love how simple this unit is, if you want something to simply keep track of your steps than this works great. It has a few downsides but in spite of them I still use this just fine and I find it to be very motivating which to me is more important.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JG3VTJGR8QI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9X3S40#wasThisHelpful","R25JG3VTJGR8QI","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this set of solar lights at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really love them! They are an excellent quality and they have been working great for me. They are very easy to set up and I didn't have any issues with them tangling. The color of the lights leans more towards yellow than white, it's a very warm white color that's more yellow vs the blueish type of white. It has rained a lot since they have been out and that hasn't been an issue. The one down side is they may not last the entire night. Some days they do and other days they don't. Even if they get sun all day long they sometimes aren't on til dusk like my other sets are. Other than that I am really happy with these, They give off a warm color and they look great.

"I ordered this tea at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I love it. Earl Grey is probably my favorite tea and this one is fantastic. The tea is very fresh and smells wonderful. It has a perfect Earl Grey flavor. The bag it comes in is resealable which is convenient. It also indicates the month and year the tea was picked. When I make mine I follow the instructions and use one teaspoon of the tea. I let mine steep for about 5 mins. It's perfect without a sweetener but I sometimes add honey.

"The 9X13 baking dish is one of my most use baking dishes so I decided I needed a second one. At times I have more than one dish I’d like to make in this size but have to split it up so having a second has been very handy (plus I feel better knowing that this one is shatterproof!). The dish is very sturdy and thick but it’s not extremely heavy.I generally make veggie dishes or breakfast bake dishes in this and it works great. This baking dish is a little more shallow than my other (but not by much) so if I have a large meal like lots of chicken and pasta I use the deeper dish. It’s easy to clean up, I either hand wash or it also fits in my dishwasher.I love that the care instructions are etched on the bottom. I can never remember which of my items are oven safe or stove top safe or so on. I have a few that are versatile but I forget which ones because they don’t indicate it any place. I also love that I can put this in the freezer for my make ahead meals. After it arrived I noticed that it is made in the USA so that was another bonus for me.

"I needed this size pan to replace an old one of mine and I am really happy with this one. My old one was similar but I have lost track of it after a few moves. This pan is very sturdy and feels thick to me. It’s not overly heavy but it does have some weight to it. I am no expert pie maker but this bakes just fine for me. I use it more for pot pies than I do for dessert pies.The dish is nice and deep (a bit deeper than my old one) so you can really stuff it full if you want to!

"I received this book as a Christmas gift several years ago and I keep trying to work with it but I just can't get it. The book has nice photographs but they don't show enough for a beginner like myself. The written directions are just not enough on most of these instructions, whether it be casting on or the actual stitch. I was able to make one project (the fish pillow) and it turned out really cute. I have not been able to make a simple scarf though. I have made a scarf using the instructions that came with my loom set. Maybe this book just isn't for me and others will get the hang of it. I am a clueless beginner and I need more than what's in here in order to complete anything else. I was also a bit let down by the include projects. There are only a handful that I would use, but that is more of a personal preference. If you are already pretty familiar with the loom and the terms used this may be good for you. I am a crocheter and I can't knit with knitting needles. I know that after crocheting for 30 years I can figure our a poorly written pattern by using my experience.

The back has slots for nails/screws to hang this and I love that they are already level/even for me. Right now I have mine propped on a book shelf because I like how it looks there but if I do decide to hang it that feature will be helpful. Overall I am really happy with this and if I wasn’t keeping it for myself it would make a great gift!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YG9CQGZ1AHNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZA4ZN2#wasThisHelpful","R1YG9CQGZ1AHNX","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this fish oil at a discount in exchange for my honest review and it has been great. I was directed by my doctor to take fish oil on a daily basis, the directions say to take one or two per day and I usually take two (one in the morning and one with dinner). I have acid reflux so some fish oils can have a horrible aftertaste but this one has been really good. Every so often I might notice a slight aftertaste but it's nothing horrible. When I first tried fish oil I was worried I wouldn't be able to deal with the aftertaste but this fish oil has made it possible for me to take it. My husband doesn't have reflux and he takes it as well, he has never noticed any aftertaste (he takes it twice per day). My husband started taking this only because I did but he has noticed an improvement in his ability to recall details better. If he has a busy day at work he says he can still recall notes from meetings he's been in, where before he would have to go back and look it up. So he's very happy. I was directed to take them for my triglycerides so I won't know until my next physical if the oil has helped. I will update the review once I do. Overall we are happy with this, they don't have much odor, they are large but easy to swallow, and there's almost no aftertaste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6JLRHUNAE08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ7OKYI#wasThisHelpful","R3V6JLRHUNAE08","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this bag at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really like it so far. Our trip is not planned until this winter but I have been using the bag to store my infant car seat, it is a Chicco Key Fit 30 and it works great for that. It protects it for dirt and dust, I store it so the drawstring closure is on the side because I don't want dust to fall into that opening. Here are my other thoughts:ProsThe pattern makes it really easy to spot in baggage areaThe material seems durable but I will need to update this after it has been taken on our trip I think if you are going to carry the seat on this would be perfect, it's making it thru baggage check that I would like to testit's easy to use, it has a wide opening to easily put the seat insidefolds up really small when not in use and is almost weightlessConsI'm not a big fan of the drawstring closure, although the material is waterproof liquid could enter through the draw string top, I'd also be worried about it being torn open during travelThe carrying strap is a great feature but I would cinch it down as small as you can to lessen the chances of it being caught on anythingOverall I am happy with this and it works perfect as a storage bag if you aren't traveling, once I take my trip I will update my review on how this fairs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190LKPBBOBG27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ZGYAIU#wasThisHelpful","R190LKPBBOBG27","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was very easy to apply we had it on in just a few minutes and the fit is perfect.

"I have always wanted a mason jar soap dispenser so I was really excited to try this one. Here are my thoughts:ProsEasy to fill – twist the lid off and fill it up – the mouth of the jar is very wide so I can fill it without spilling anything.

"I ordered this probiotic at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really like them. I started taking probiotics when I developed thrush while nursing and I have continued to take them for general health. I didn't have any luck in clearing up the thrush with them (I had a severe case that was probably too far gone) but they have seemed to play a part in boosting my immune system. I was exposed to  some sniffles recently and normally I would get a long drawn out head cold but I really just have a very slight runny nose. I have also increased some of my vitamins so it can be hard to say but I feel like the probiotics have given me an extra boost. I have a hard time remembering to take them before I eat so half the time I take them during my meal. If I were to take the as directed I bet I would have even better results.

"I ordered this turmeric at a discount in exchange for my honest review and so far I like it. I am taking this to see if it will help with my joint pain and for overall health. I'm still looking into what is causing my joint pain (most likely an autoimmune disorder) so I don't know the root cause for sure. This turmeric is a little larger in size but I am used to taking a very large fish oil so I don't have any trouble with this. It does smell and taste like turmeric but this doesn't bother me either, the taste doesn't linger and in spite of my reflux I do not have any aftertaste with it. As far as how well it works I am still not certain. The directions say to take this twice a day but right now I am only taking it once a day. I don't have swelling of my joints so I can't say if it helps with that but the pain/;discomfort has seemed to improve somewhat.I want to ask my doctor first before I take it twice a day.

"I ordered this fish oil at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I love it. My doctor directed me to take fish oil the last time I was in for a physical but the problem for me is the aftertaste. Several years ago I tried taking fish oil but just couldn’t deal with the aftertaste. I have reflux so it tends to be an issue. With this fish oil I often have no aftertaste and on the days my reflux is bad it’s very little aftertaste not even much worth mentioning. So I am very happy. I take two per day, one in the morning and one at dinner. The pills are large but easy to swallow, they don’t have much odor or taste while swallowing them.Shortly after I started taking them my husband did too, he was only taking one per day and he asked me if I thought it could be  helping his memory and I told him I believe that is a benefit. He says he can remember details from meetings at work that before taking the fish oil he would have to go back and look at his notes. He said he has noticed that and similar things since he has started taking it. He said it is subtle but he can definitely tell something has changed when it comes to remembering details from conversations and meetings at work. So we increased his to twice per day as well.My bottle came with a free gift which was a travel pill box and I actually use it all the time now that I have it. It holds both fish oil, my daily vitamin, a vitamin d, a probiotic, a Zyrtec, and a turmeric all just on one side (it has two sections). It’s just another thing to help keep me organized and remembering to take all my pills. Overall I am really happy with this and will keep taking it as long as my doctor is ok with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317CW47A0085X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XF95A08#wasThisHelpful","R317CW47A0085X","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really like it! So far I have mostly used this to gather up leaves from the yard and it works really well for that. It's also a lot faster than what I was doing last year which was putting them in bags. I have lots of trees and 4.5 acres so it's a lot to do. I just lay the tarp down next to a pile and rake it onto the tarp, I have the 6X8 so it's a decent size and fits a lot of leaves in one trip, it does take two people to carry/lift it. I dump my leaves in a compost area of the land and come back for more. I have also used this to cover a window a/c unit that is not in use just to keep any dirt/dust out of it and it works great for that too. I like that the edges are reinforced a well. Overall this compares really well to any other tarp I have used. It actually has more grommets than my others an none of mine have the reinforced edges so I have been really happy with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYH69ZZROG9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W3JA1G#wasThisHelpful","R1FYH69ZZROG9L","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this LED bulb at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really like it! The bulb is in my table lamp and it gives off just about the same amount of light as my CFL energy saving bulb did. One reason I like the LED better is that it doesn’t take time to get brighter like the energy saving one does. Another feature I like on this bulb is that it is switchable. If you flip your light switch quickly on and off it will dim the light, if you flip your switch again quickly it will dim it even more (down to the brightness of a nightlight I would say). To have 3 different lighting options on the same lamp has come in handy. So far the bulb has worked great and we haven’t had any issues with it. I also like the color this gives off, I know my lamp shade can effect this but overall it gives off more of the white color vs the blueish color that I don't like. I have used some LEDs that have a blue tint to them, and kind of look like a haunted house. I like the white color best.

The bulb is larger than normal so if you are going to leave it bare it doesn't look like a tiny little light bulb.

I tried to take a photo of the bare bulb but it's difficult to get a good picture to show how the bulb looks when it is bare.

"I ordered this seed heating mat at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really like it! Last year I began starting flower seeds indoors and had some partial luck. I had read that perhaps a seed mat would help me out so I decide to try this one. I have various sizes of plastic seed starting cells so I choose one that would fit the mat best.  At first I was going to find a good place to put the mat near a window with an outlet but then decided I would try using my grow light because that was a more convenient location. My plan is to get the seeds sprouted with my heat mat and grow light then move them to the window area. I am no expert so just giving this a try! So far the mat works well and I haven’t had any issues with it, if I could change something about it it would be to make the mat just a little more pliable, it's on the stiff side but this isn't a huge deal.

"I ordered this set of leaf bags at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I have found them to be more useful to use while pulling weeds rather than cleaning up leaves. Be sure to note the size of these in order to make the best decision on your purchase. They are more like a large bucket than leaf bags. I have over 4 acres of land with mature trees so this does not work well for leaf gathering but I have discovered it’s perfect for pulling all the weeds we have! Any time I bring out a garden bucket it gets full before I am done with all the weeding but with these I have plenty of room and they fold up flat in my garden shed so I have some much needed space. You push them down and then lock them flat by putting a toggle thru a loop, this feature works well and holds them securely.  They are plenty durable for weeds and leaves but I would not put too many twigs or sticks in them, I would worry that could tear it eventually. The set also includes a pair of work gloves which are handy to have when cleaning up the yard, they are just like the type you would find a hardware stores. Overall I am glad that I found an alternative use for these and I will continue to use them!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YYCOUCGUMPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MRQI66#wasThisHelpful","R39YYCOUCGUMPO","A2DJ4Z50VR3K39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DJ4Z50VR3K39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this solar light at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really like it! It's very easy to set up you just spike the solar panel in the ground and place the light where you would like, The cord is plenty long enough that you can get the panel in the ideal place to catch the most sun. I have this light in my garden shining on my birdbath and it looks great. The light is not extremely bright so this would be more for decoration than it would be for lighting a walk area (unless you plan to get several). The only downside for me is the color that it gives off is more of a blue tint rather than a warm white color. Other than that it works great and looks good. It comes on at dusk and it does seem to stay on all night. The place I have it isn't very visible at dawn so I don't get to check to see if it's still on very often.

"I ordered this bug spray at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really like it! The scent reminds me of essential oils and I mostly pick up on the citronella.

Because the scent is so strong I do not use this on my toddler, you may want to try this on yourself first before any children just to be safe (it's a strong scent!).I think it works really well when I spray it all over my shoes and then do the weeding in the garden.

"Opolar4 starsWorks great; some minor drawbacksThe Opolar Laptop Cooler does what it claims to do: cools your laptop computer.  It enshrouds the laptop's cooling vent, then by means of its own USB-powered fan, it pulls the warm air out.  When I use this on my Toshiba Satellite, the area around the vent where the laptop usually feels hot is very noticeably cooler.  I can also feel that the air coming out of the Opolar is warm (it's cool, as you'd expect from a fan, when not attached to the laptop).The design of the Opolar assumes a left-sided vent on your laptop.  Mine has a right-sided vent.  This creates a couple of minor but irritating issues.  I am right-handed and often use a mouse with my laptop.  The Opolar measures about 2 x 3 inches; not big, but big enough to be in my way on the right side of the computer when I'm using the mouse.  The mouse is usable but has limited real estate to run around on (see picture, which also shows the Opolar's cable).  Also, using the Opolar on the right-hand side means its plug and switch are facing away from me.  Once I had used it for awhile, I could easily find the switch by touch, but it would be easier to be able to see it.The Opolar does not actually attach to the computer; it attaches to a small pad on which the laptop sits to keep the cooler in place.  This means that every time I move the computer, I have to reposition the cooler.  It also means the cooler cannot be used unless you have the computer on a flat surface where it can sit on the pad; it won't stay in place if you are using the computer on your lap or a shifting surface, such as on top of your bed covers (unless you sit very still).  If you use your computer like this, you'll probably want to look into the Opolar model that attaches to the computer.When on the highest fan speed, the Opolar is somewhat noisy.  It sounds like just what it is, a loud little fan blowing out of the side of your laptop.  However, even though my laptop runs hot, I found I did not need the Opolar on its highest setting to cool it, and on lower settings it's very quiet.The Opolar cooler has two really strong features:  It's very effective, and it's very portable.  I have a cooling fan that sits under my laptop, and it works well, but it's inconvenient to take along when traveling.  The Opolar cooler tucks away into my gear and needs only an extra few inches to use it (room enough to extend off the side of your computer).I would not hesitate to recommend the Opolar laptop cooler, keeping in mind that it does have some drawbacks.  It would make a great stocking stuffer or small Christmas gift.Please note, I was given the Opolar cooler at no charge for purposes of writing a review about it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5PR88UOIWX2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WH4QPQ#wasThisHelpful","R5PR88UOIWX2Y","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These clippers are very stiff to use compared to my old pair.  However, they are sturdy and reasonably sharp, and the nail guard works very well.  My old pair has a nail guard, but it swivels loosely so often isn't in place when I need it to be.  The guard on this pair stays put.  The little file that comes with them is a bit hard to extract from the handle, but it's just the finishing touch my dog's nails need once they're clipped and it is very handy that it travels ""on board"" to keep it from being mislaid.

"I like the size, texture, and color of this rug very well.  However, I have to agree with others who have remarked that it's rather sloppily made.  Only the short ends are hemmed; the long sides are selvage.  It doesn't look as if they will let go or fray, but it makes for an uneven finish that, because it is on the long sides, is particularly noticeable.  The ""popcorns"" are made by pulling yarn through the weave, a nice effect but in a few places the yarn was cut too short, so it pulls all the way through and the popcorn flattens out.  There aren't a lot of spots where this occurred, but it's easy to see where it did.  I haven't washed the rug yet, but the pulled-through spots and that selvage edge worry me, and I'll probably wash it on the comforter cycle, which uses a very slow spin, and hang it to dry, which is more babying than I really expect to give a bath rug.  Although I do like the rug overall, I really don't think it merits the ""luxury spa"" description.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V4YDN8B68HXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3FFGDI#wasThisHelpful","R2V4YDN8B68HXU","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like many people, I take a cranberry supplement in hopes of warding off bladder issues such as urinary tract infections.  As with many herbal and vitamin supplements, it's hard to be sure it's working.  If I haven't had a UTI, is it because I've been taking the supplement, because I've been eating/drinking right, or just luck?  Even so, I do seem to have fewer problems when I take a supplement.However, I like to be “in charge” of what I'm taking by choosing single-ingredient supplements when possible, and that's my first issue with UberCran.  Not only does it contain cranberry but multiple other herbals, as well as added vitamin C and vitamin E.  If I choose to add these to my diet (and as it happens, I don't), I would rather add them individually.  That way, it doesn't become a math problem to determine how much I'm taking, adding up a little from this supplement plus a little from that one plus....  I don't know whether this particular combination of cranberry plus herbals plus vitamins is more effective for bladder health than a cranberry supplement alone; I was unable to find any definite information aside from the manufacturer's assurance that it is.And that leads to my second issue:  There is no real assurance that the UberCran really does contain what it claims.  We all know that this is a big issue, with many supplements containing less than the claimed amount of an ingredient, or even none at all.  I always look for vitamins and supplements with a USP label or other evidence of independent testing that confirms the ingredients.  UberCran lacks this.  However, Ubervita products are made in a GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) certified lab, which does speak well of quality control over the process of making UberCran, if not confirming the ingredients.Finally, UberCran seems to be rather deliberately vague about the dosage.  Pictures of the bottle clearly show that it contains 250 capsules.  A look at the nutrition information panel says that a serving size is 1 capsule, so one might assume the bottle contains 250 servings.  However, the suggested use says this 1 capsule should be taken 3 times a day, so a bottle is really only about 83 days' worth.  I'd note, though, that this is a better way to take many supplements, especially ones with ingredients the body will excrete if a large dose is taken at one time (vitamin C, for example).I have not had any issues with the UberCran supplement.  I find it easy (if not terribly convenient) to take, and I have not had any bladder issues in the three weeks while I've been taking it.  I just wish I were able to get more concrete information about it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NN2RLTLTTEV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RN5OKA#wasThisHelpful","R1NN2RLTLTTEV8","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this glove and there are many cooking situations where it’s a handy solution.  For example, I often cook with cast iron pans with handles that get quite hot, even on the stovetop.  It’s convenient to be wearing the glove so I can keep cooking and stirring without remembering to grab the potholder or risk burning myself.  In the oven, as well, the extra coverage for fingers and wrists is good to have.However, it is a little problematic in the oven.  If the pan you are lifting is heavy or requires some maneuvering to get it out of the oven, the glove by itself may not be enough heat protection.  When I’m cooking I always have potholders at the ready, but still, it’s not as convenient as it would be if I could use the glove alone.The glove is also a bit bulky to wear.  I usually wear a size medium in gloves, and if you have a larger hand, you may find it fits better.  It has something of a “mitten feel” in terms of dexterity when I’m using it.  However, the dexterity is much better than the usual oven mitts.Please note that I received this glove at no charge for purposes of reviewing it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YMWZWASDJXB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SCGMIO#wasThisHelpful","R1YMWZWASDJXB0","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is billed as a “beginner” drone, and that is a very apt description.  It is very easy to set up the drone and begin using it.  At the same time, using it is challenging enough to keep the pilot entertained for a long time to come.I would like to have had somewhat better documentation, and also some sort of quick-start guide at the beginning of the small user manual.  However, getting it together and charging it were fairly easy and intuitive, giving me a few minutes to squint at the manual to make sure I didn’t miss any of the finer points.  I was able to complete setup with my iPhone easily, including downloading the app from the App Store.If you plan to fly the drone inside, I suggest a very high ceiling, like gymnasium height.  Outside, a kite-flying type of area (i.e., no overhead obstructions) with room for soft landings would be ideal.  There is a definite learning curve for steering it, not just laterally but for the height, as well.  I expected it to handle much like those remote control helicopters, but it really doesn’t -- it’s full bore or nothing.  Once you get the knack, it’s easy and fun to make it do flips and barrel rolls.  I’ll note that it’s also easy, although not as much fun, to get the grass stains off after rough landings.Having said that, it’s surprisingly tough—another beginner plus.  It got away from me and flew too high, then crash landed in my neighbor’s asphalt driveway, without a scratch.  I expected to be scrounging the pieces up from the asphalt, but it was intact and ready to go again.  All I had to scrounge up was an excuse for my neighbor to explain why I was flying a drone over his house.The drone is about the size of a square Kleenex box, for the most part big enough to work with easily.  The exception to this is the charging port.  It brought to mind the battery connections on older model cordless phones; it was fussy to get it out to charge and to get it plugged back in just right.  It comes complete with everything you need for setup, even including a tiny screwdriver to replace the blades (replacement blades are included) if you manage to find a place to crash it that’s harder than my neighbor’s driveway.  Its small size and light weight allow the wind to buffet it around, too, regardless of how skilled you’ve become at piloting it.All in all, we have had a lot of fun with this drone, and we’re looking forward to lots more.  I wish we’d gotten it earlier in the summer when we would have had better weather for being outside playing with it, but I look forward to some nice winter scenery pictures.EDIT:  I forgot to mention that I had excellent followup from the seller on this.  I got an email to confirm that I had received it, and another offering tips and tricks for working with the drone.  They seemed very committed to making sure we were happy with it.Please note that I received this at no charge for purposes of reviewing it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A4FZMNWLBFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JNEPP0#wasThisHelpful","R1A4FZMNWLBFL","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I work at a keyboard all day, and I'm getting to that age where good light and high contrast are important.  I am really surprised at how much easier it is to see my keyboard clearly, even though my office is well-lighted.  The gooseneck makes it easy to adjust the lighting just where I need it and can cover a sizeable area for such a small lamp.  It's powered by a USB port, but it also has an on/off switch.  The base can hang or sit on the desktop; I've found when sitting on the desk, the base is a little too light and makes the lamp a bit tippy, so I prop whatever's handy on the base and will be installing a little hook for it.

"Lamb and lamb meal are the first two ingredients in Solid Gold Sunday Sunrise; both are really good sources of protein.  Other protein sources include eggs, peas, pollock meal, and lentils (the lentils are pretty far down the list, so perhaps not a significant source of protein).  As far as the nutrition, this is a food you can feel good about providing to your dog.Some ingredients I consider iffy because of their nutritional value (or lack of) include lettuce, celery, spearmint, and thyme.  These are far enough down the list that I doubt they contribute much, but I do question their inclusion.  Salt is also listed, but I don't have enough chemistry available to know whether this is to meet a dog's requirement for sodium (valuable) or meant to be a flavor enhancer (useless).  As far as the flavor goes, my dog eats it eagerly.  She is, though, possibly the world's least fussy dog, and I've never tried a dog food she doesn't like.One thing to note is that Solid Gold has had a recall, about 2 years ago, due to salmonella.  I always wonder whether that means the food is less likely to have problems now, since the company has been made aware of possible problems, or whether that puts a company on the suspect list for all time.

Within moments, she had figured out how to take some pictures and how to access the various features.  The camera has remained one of her favorite features.  One of the games she really likes is a running game that encourages physical activity, so it's not all screen time with this fun watch.I don't care for the watch's actual time-telling functions.  The analog clock faces are inappropriate for someone learning to tell time, as many have only the 12-3-6-9 configuration and none of the initially available ones shows the minutes.  The faces are cute but mostly very cluttered, to the degree that it's often difficult to even discern the numbers from the background decorations. There are several digital options, as well, but I question whether learning to read time from a digital display actually helps a child learn the concept of telling time.  There are several with audio:  press the lips and a not-bad robotic voice will say ""It's six forty seven pm.""  My granddaughter really likes those options.  There is also a game that features an owl that supposedly helps to teach time, but it's a pretty dull game—set the clock, then ask the owl what time it is.Charging the watch is very simple via a micro USB port, and a child who is already adept at using charging devices (for a tablet, for example) will probably be able to do it unassisted.  Smaller or inexperienced children will need help.  If you're giving the watch as a gift, you may want to charge it first, since it takes a couple hours to charge, a disappointing wait for a child eager to try it out.  The charge does not last as long as claimed by the manufacturer; after fulling charging it on Monday, then putting it back in the case and doing nothing with it until Friday, I found that the charge was about halfway depleted.  I'm not sure what VTech defines as “low usage” when claiming the charge will last two weeks, but I really don't think it will go two weeks under any level of usage.  Setting up a daily charging routine is probably the best bet.Bottom line, though, despite some of the drawbacks I see as a grown-up, my granddaughter really likes the watch and has continued to be enthusiastic about it after more than a week of using it.  She says it is very comfortable to wear.  She particularly likes having it in the car, a time when some screen time is appropriate to avoid the boredom of a long drive but her tablet's demand for a wi-fi connection limits its usefulness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEENKEO3M231/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCZV0I4#wasThisHelpful","RAEENKEO3M231","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seemed to be an unusually “sticky” canned food and it was a little difficult to get all of it out of the can; I suspect this may be due to its being a fish-based food, with no other meat.  My dog liked this food (and so did my cats, who had to be repeatedly nudged out of the way while I got the dog's meal ready), but it really disagreed with her, despite its claim to be a “sensitive skin and stomach” formulation.  Although I tried to introduce it gradually, each time I served it she developed diarrhea and room-clearing, wake-you-from-sleep gas.  She is an old dog but usually has no problem with a variety of foods, including doing very well with the Nutro brand, but this is one I won't continue to offer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7SLGTNGLSO9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZSEFC2#wasThisHelpful","R7SLGTNGLSO9C","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cat kibble has both wholesome, recognizable ingredients and the most important asset:  Cat appeal (at least for mine—cats being cats, your mileage may vary).  They will actually pick around what they consider less-desirable kibbles to pick out the Nutro pieces.  I have an old cat who is ill with a gastric problem, and it's important to me to offer him especially good nutrition since his system doesn't absorb nutrients efficiently.  Nutro is one of the brands, and this turkey and brown rice one of the flavors, that both he and I like.  Also, I have to say, I am impressed by the “add-on” price of this food at Amazon.com.  I don't often buy pet food online because of the cost of shipping such a heavy item, but Amazon's add-on price is less expensive than what I can buy it for locally, making it an easy to buy option as well as a healthy one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K5YT289XWMQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZI3YYM#wasThisHelpful","R1K5YT289XWMQH","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dog ate this food really eagerly.  I suppose it's considered “large breed” because it is canned in good-sized chunks, but they are as soft as most any canned food and my medium-size dog had no problem eating them.  In addition, it includes glucosamine/chondroitin to help support joint health, but strong joints are important for all sizes of dogs, not just large breeds.  She experienced no digestive issues at all.Meat products (not specified as human grade) are the first ingredients in an overall healthy and recognizable list, including (in order), chicken broth, chicken, chicken liver, turkey, and beef liver.  It does also contain potato starch, wheat gluten, and rice, so you'll want to avoid it if those ingredients are issues for your dog.I would warn you, though, that if you actually have a large-breed dog, the feeding instructions on this food specify 1/3 to 1/2 can per 10 pounds of body weight (344 calories per can).

"I was a little hesitant to try this tissue, as I think I have one of the world's most easily clogged toilets.  I was concerned that an ""ultra strong"" toilet paper would be a really bad idea, but I'm happy to report this has not been the case.  The tissue is strong and absorbent, but it flushes away easily and has caused no problem with the fussy plumbing.  I was also surprised to find that I like this better than my usual choice, Charmin Ultra Soft.  While it is not quite as soft, it is definitely soft enough, and I found I could use slightly less as it was more absorbent.  The one-star deduction is for the ""mega roll"" claim.  I actually weighed this roll along with a ""double roll"" size, and this one weighed 1/8 ounce LESS than the supposedly smaller one.

"I have a job that requires wearing headphones about 75% of the time, so I’ve had a lot of opportunity to try a lot of different kinds of headphones.  These rank right in the middle of the pack.What I like:* They are very lightweight, yet stay in place very well; better than earbuds for me.  I often wonder if I have oddly shaped ear canals, as I can never get earbuds to stay in unless they have some sort of extra fastening device, such as around-the-ear loops.  These stay put on my ears.* The ear pads are cushy enough to make them comfortable for a long time.  I don’t find myself yanking them off frequently to relieve my aching pinnae.* The clip keeps the battery pack from being a drag on the headphones (which also contributes to their secure and cushy fit).* The ability to turn noise cancellation on or off, or pause it briefly.  The noise cancellation feature does work to help mute traffic noise, neighbors’ mowers, and so forth, which is important to me in the summer when I’m working with the windows open.  It doesn’t wipe out all background noise; I can still hear the dog bark, someone knocking at the door, or someone speaking to me.* An adapter is included to make them usable in differently configured plugs.  This isn’t an issue at home but is one I’ve run into on airplanes.Not so much:* Part of what makes them comfortable is that the ear pads move in every direction; up, down, around, even flipping so the padded part faces out.  This becomes an irritation when trying to get the phones settled on my ears without having them flipped up or out in the wrong direction.* The cord is very thin and lightweight.  While this contributes to the headphones being lightweight overall, it also means the cord tangles very readily.  Combine that with the rotating ear pads and it can be a real brain teaser to get everything sorted out to use the headphones.* Although the clip is handy for the weighty battery pack, handier still would be a battery pack located on, say, the headband.  The weight that is such a drag on a lightweight cord would be barely noticeable on the headband or earpiece.* The cord is a little short for my purposes as I have to attach it to a computer near the floor while working at my desk.  I’m not sure I’d want it any longer when traveling, though.As far as sound quality, it’s pretty reasonable for the price.  I wouldn’t choose them first when listening to music except in a situation where I really needed a very portable sound-canceling option, but they’re quite good for listening to speech.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIM85YKSLCS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028E4SF4#wasThisHelpful","R2SIM85YKSLCS5","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Attempting to stick to a tight budget when unexpectedly finding I needed to replace my home theater receiver, one of the features I sacrificed was Bluetooth.  Therefore, I was really delighted to get a chance to try out the TP-Link Bluetooth Music Receiver.Setting up the TP-Link could hardly be easier.  Both USB and RCA cables came with it; I opted to use the RCA cables.  The hardest part about hooking it up was my decision to re-route all of my electrical cords while I was doing it so I could reposition my power filter (you know how it is when you start messing with your home theater or stereo system; there’s always some little tweak you could do “while you’re at it”).  Anyway, I plugged the cables into my receiver and the TP-Link, plugged the TP-Link into my newly positioned surge protector, and that was it.I first paired my laptop; it found the TP-Link and connected unhesitatingly.  My HTC One M8 phone took a few minutes to decide it could “see” the link, but then paired just fine.  Now, I’m streaming Pandora to my stereo system while I write this review – no dropouts or skips, no lost signal at any time.  The receiver is small and unobtrusive and blends right in with my black components.If you’d like to add a Bluetooth to your stereo system quickly and easily, I highly recommend the TP-Link HA 100.  It is billed as also working for other devices, e.g., a computer, but I don’t need it there so haven’t tried it.  I’m completely happy with the way it works with my stereo receiver, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R122ROKY9DN2QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPATOEE#wasThisHelpful","R122ROKY9DN2QV","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cool little notebook, and there’s no doubt that the fabric and plastic cover would hold up well in a backpack, desk, or locker over the course of a school year.  However, I was a little surprised to find that the cover isn’t refillable.  When the paper is used up, you’re left with a pretty substantial cover, divider, and ring binder to throw away or recycle.  It really seems wasteful to me.Leaving that aside, this is a handy notebook.  As I mentioned, it’s sturdy.  It’s college ruled, which I prefer, and includes a divider that will hold loose notes and a pen loop.  I often use pocket notebooks to take notes and keep lists while birding, and this will be perfect for that, particularly since it solves the issue of where to stash the pen to keep it handy and the fabric spine keeps the spiral binding from snagging in a pocket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3W1G94LHDLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NT1QQ#wasThisHelpful","R3E3W1G94LHDLF","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It’s a little hard to say how well the APC Home Theater Power Filter works, since for comparison I’d need something like, say, an electrical storm that damaged electronics on another surge protector but not on this one, and even then there are so many variables that a side-by-side comparison wouldn’t be all that meaningful.  The unit certainly makes me feel confident, though.For starters, it’s heavy.  Okay, “heavy” isn’t a feature, but it’s likely indicative of sturdy, heavy-duty construction.  The equipment protection guarantee is valued at $350,000, and while even very low-end surge protectors that are really little more than extension cords often claim cash-value equipment protection, $350,000 is pretty substantial.This unit is designed and arranged very thoughtfully.  The glossy black exterior works well with all of the other components in my home theater system, and the plugs can be rotated to the most convenient orientation.  I will admit I laughed a little at the box’s suggestion that it could be placed on top of other components, like it was so good looking that one wouldn’t even notice the spaghetti farm growing out of it, but still, it is attractive as these things go.  It also uses master outlets that can stop the power flow when an outlet senses that a device is not in use, and claims to save up to $40 on your electricity bill with this feature; not sure how they arrive at that figure, but it is an eco-friendly option nevertheless.I work at home and depend on my company’s tech support to keep my equipment working well, and the APC brand is suggested every time power protection is discussed.  I’m not paid if I’m not working, so I sometimes push my luck a little during thunderstorms.  I own two other APC surge protectors and an APC uninterruptable power supply, and they have worked flawlessly.  I expect to be just as satisfied with the Home Theater Power Filter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301EGEUJPFWBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTJ2QRY#wasThisHelpful","R301EGEUJPFWBC","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Toshiba laptop, and so far, I am very happy with it.  Windows 10 is new to me (very new – I have Windows 7 on my desktop computer due to work software that won’t play nicely with 8 or 10), but so far I’ve found everything I need either intuitively or with a quick search.Both Toshiba and Microsoft did load up the unit with plenty of bloatware, such as McAfee, AOL On, preinstalled shortcuts for eBay, Groupon, Insteon, and more.  Most irritating of all is the Xbox app that Microsoft is so sure you want that it cannot be uninstalled.  For all of this, though, it didn’t include a user manual.  The quick start guide refers the user to the Toshiba website – good luck with that.  I still haven’t found it.Startup:  It took about 20 minutes for the computer to complete initial startup, first lingering on the Toshiba startup screen, then loading updates for Windows 10 (I will never cease to be disappointed at how a brand-new Windows operating system can need patches within days of its release).  Wireless and Bluetooth connected quickly and easily.Mechanics:  The computer is so thin that when I was unpacking it, I thought the description that said it included a DVD drive was an error, but no, there it was on the left-hand side, a handy location for me since that won’t interfere with my right-handed mouse usage.  I’m still dependent on my mouse for anything I can’t do with key commands, as the touchpad, while better than my old Dell laptop, still doesn’t perform as smoothly and reliably as I’d like.  The fan was relatively noisy initially, but it did quiet down after a couple days, as if it needed to settle into its groove.  I really like the keyboard; the backlighting is handy and, for me, the key response is just right, enough “hesitation” and a slight, nearly inaudible click, although the perfectly flat keys did take some getting used to.The Harmon Kardon music system is great; best I’ve heard as standard issue on a laptop.  The display is very impressive.  It looks good from every angle and I tweak the position only for my own comfort.  Oddly, though, the driver appears not to support Microsoft’s solitaire games, a much ballyhooed return in Windows 10.  The games always display in a pixilated fashion that makes them impossible to play.Multitasking has caused no appreciable slowdown in performance or other issues.  I’ve used it with multiple browser tabs open (in fact, multiple browsers as I experiment with Edge while using my old standby, Chrome) while also playing music and moving back and forth to work with Word, Excel, and Outlook.  I’ve also had multiple browser tabs open while playing music and watching Amazon Prime video simultaneously, again without a glitch.  In fact, the video streamed more smoothly than when using my Amazon Fire Stick on my TV and looked about as good as my TV, as well.Battery life:  Okay, but not a knockout.  I unplugged at 10:46 a.m. and used multiple programs (web, email, Word, music) nonstop until 2:10 p.m., at which time the screen dimmed slightly as the battery saver came on and the icon indicated that 80% of the power had been used; so, just a bit over 3 hours brand new and fully charged.The biggest hitch I’ve run into was when I reset the computer to its vaunted Eco mode.  All seemed to work well until the next time I signed on and found it had dropped my internet connection.  No amount of troubleshooting could fix it (reboot, reconnect with the modem, reset the modem, etc.).  Finally, a Google search suggested turning off the Eco mode and sure enough, the wireless worked again and has worked reliably since.Overall, I really like this laptop, and I would recommend it without hesitation to shoppers in this price bracket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R369OPJYO1QWVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQO6EAQ#wasThisHelpful","R369OPJYO1QWVY","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There’s nothing like a gel mat if you spend a lot of time standing in front of your stove or kitchen sink.  The difference it makes for your back, hips, knees, and feet is really remarkable, particularly if your kitchen floor is very hard, as my tile floor is.Of course, GelPro is “the” name in kitchen gel mats, and with this new GelPro Plush model, they’ve finally addressed the one complaint I had about them.  GelPro mats instruct that if they get wet or soiled, all you need to do is wipe them off with a damp cloth.  Well, I have a semi-incontinent elderly dog, and bless her heart for choosing the tile floor if she can’t quite wait to go out, but if she hit my old GelPro mat, believe me, it took a lot more than a simple wipedown to get it clean.  The mat’s sponge bottom absorbs the odor; the mat is bulky, heavy, and hard to wrangle; and it takes God’s own time drying once it’s really wet.This new Plush model, though, is completely enclosed in vinyl – no spongy bottom to soak up accidents!  Although I haven’t had to find out yet (fingers crossed…), it definitely looks as if it really will easily wipe clean.  Meanwhile, they haven’t sacrificed a thing in terms of comfort.  I love to cook and, frankly, my physique shows it.  It’s hard to believe how much more comfortable it is to work on the GelPro mat, not only while I’m working but afterward.  No more hobbling from the kitchen with pain in my back and hips.I don’t know if GelPro mats ever really wear out.  I’ve had one for several years, and it still feels nearly as comfy as this brand-new one.  Incidentally, though, if you allow your old dog in the kitchen while you’re cooking, there’s nothing like a GelPro mat for her to curl up on, either.

"This book was a very pleasant surprise for me.  Although Michigan may not be as well known for producing maple syrup as some of the eastern states, we do have a thriving syrup season and I always have maple syrup on hand.  When I ordered this book, I hoped it would give me a new idea or two for cooking with maple syrup.  I really underestimated it; rather than giving me  a couple new ideas, I want to try every recipe in the book!Another thing that surprised me was author Katie Webster’s emphasis on whole grains, low fat, and low sodium in her recipes.  Whenever practical, she specifies whole wheat flour, low-fat ingredients, and minimal added salt.  There are gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options, as well.The book itself is very attractive.  It uses a 1-recipe-per-page format, and nearly every recipe is illustrated with a full color photo; Webster’s background as a food stylist serves her well here.  She includes information about how maple syrup is made and resources for obtaining ingredients (although none of the recipes calls for anything particularly exotic).But what about the recipes themselves?  I’ve had the chance to try just a couple of them so far, and they succeeded very well.  Although the recipes go much further than simply breakfast, the first thing I tried was the Lemon Poppyseed Whole Grain Pancakes with Blueberry Maple Sauce.  Both the pancakes and the blueberry sauce came together quickly and easily, and the results were just as scrumptious as they sound.  I also tried the maple glazed carrots, all the while wondering why I hadn’t done this before – it just never occurred to me.  Next up was the Smoky and Sweet Turkey Chili.  I definitely never thought of adding maple syrup to my chili, but it definitely works!  None of the recipes seems overly difficult, and all of the ingredients can be found readily.  I’m really looking forward to cooking my way through this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJVE8EMX677L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594748047#wasThisHelpful","RTJVE8EMX677L","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first got my FoodSaver, I didn't think I'd find the rolls convenient, but I soon found being able to cut them to size oftentimes makes them more convenient than the pre-made bags.  I think these rolls would be especially handy for storing game, as freezing odd-sized cuts of meat is one of the times custom sizes work best.I'm not sure why the folks at FoodSaver think game needs stronger bags than any other meat, but the material in these rolls is a little more substantial than the standard rolls.  Perhaps the idea is that while game is being transported, the bags may get battered and be more prone to tearing and leaking; however, I do bash mine around pretty good in the freezer sometimes, and I've never had a problem with one of the bags breaking open.  I have this model Foodsaver, not a GameSaver, and the GameSaver rolls fit it with no problem.Something folks may not realize is that sealing meat in FoodSaver bags not only protects it better in the freezer, it keeps it fresh longer in the refrigerator, too.  For example, when I thaw poultry, typically I figure I've got to use it within a day or two after thawing before it starts to spoil.  However, poultry that was frozen in a FoodSaver bag, kept in the bag protected from air while it thaws, stays good at least a couple days longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AT3JRWEMQ2P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002D7S3H0#wasThisHelpful","R2AT3JRWEMQ2P7","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The top was misshapen so not an attractive loaf.  What really disappointed me, though, was the rather bland flavor.  Definitely not the depth of flavor I expected in a 10-grain bread.  If you're trying to convert a white-bread family to something with a little more nutritional value, this might be a good place to start, but if you're accustomed to eating multigrain and whole grain breads, it's a letdown.

"I like these Mengo Bumps pretty well.  They certainly aren't the most hi-fi earbuds I've ever used, but they are adequate, even for music, and they definitely excel at staying put.The slight tension from their behind-the-head cord is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  The earbuds stay in place partly from the pressure exerted by the cord, which sort of pulls them into my ears when I turn my head.  On the other hand, this constant slight pressure in my ear canals makes them uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, despite the soft silicone earbuds.  It feels as if this may improve with time as the cord stretches out a bit; it needs about an eighth of an inch.I mostly use them with my phone, HTC One M8.  They charged up and paired effortlessly.  I often listen to audiobooks when driving, and my phone isn't quite loud enough to do this without headphones.  I really like being wireless instead of being awkwardly tied to the phone.  The microphone is somewhat inadequate, though; if I interrupt the book to take a phone call, the callers always complain that they cannot hear me well.  It seems the microphone needs to be somewhat more sensitive to capture my speaking.  So, for listening, I think these are pretty good.  For speaking, not so much.I received these headphones at a significant discount, nearly free, in exchange for my review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIV98UDR7VYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ1ASUW#wasThisHelpful","R2PIV98UDR7VYZ","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered the opportunity to try this at no charge in exchange for my honest review.  In all cases, it's hard to be sure glucosamine/chondroitin/MSM works for someone.  It's one of those supplements that seems to work for some and not for others, and it's hard to say if there is a placebo effect or a measurable improvement.  I have osteoarthritis, so I take it on a ""couldn't hurt, might help"" basis.  I can't honestly say I notice a big difference with or without it, from any manufacturer.However, if it is a supplement you find you benefit from, or one that you're interested in trying, the Viva Labs brand is a very good strength at a very reasonable price.  The capsules are large-ish, but they always are for this supplement, and I find the Viva Labs capsules easier to swallow than the large tablet form some companies use.Unfortunately, Viva Labs does not display USP or NSF certification on the label, so there's no way to be sure the product has been tested and found to contain what it says it does in the claimed strength.  There is no country of origin, either, which is always suspect, since most that source their ingredients only from the U.S. feature that information prominently.  This is the reason for my 1-star deduction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HOF7C9Q6NAGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STSUPCS#wasThisHelpful","R1HOF7C9Q6NAGD","A1BTG38XSGYLW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BTG38XSGYLW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was initially drawn to the designs on these cute Swedish dishcloths.  Our son's in the Navy, so pretty much anything with a nautical design is going to appeal to me.  I have used similar products in the past, and admittedly I am always skeptical at how well these will hold up.But they do!  I used these to clean up my kitchen counter after my three younger boys decides to do some 'cooking.'  (Who knew making some Ramen and Jello would be so messy?!)  My counters were a sticky mess, and I had jello powder on the floor.  After getting these damp, I used my regular all purpose cleanser and wiped everything up.  They did a great job-didn't rip, and allowed me to easily clean up the mess.  These do take quite a while to completely dry-I'd say about ten hours or so, and when they dry they are no longer flat, so storing them isn't as easy as say throwing  away a paper towel.But I like the cute design, and these are great to small messes.  I did wash them on the delicate cycle in my washing machine, and once again, NO rips!  If you use these consistently, I think they will be great in terms of saving money on paper products, if you put them away and forget you have them, that's 13 dollars not so well spent.I will continue to use these until they give out on me, but I'm not sure if they are going to replace my paper towels completely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZ7UNDEAGL7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6PI7O4#wasThisHelpful","R1YZ7UNDEAGL7T","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually prefer more modern romances, especially ones with a hint of adventure to them, but I picked this up and though I'd give it a try.I'm so happy I did!  This is a lovely book-and yes, I mean lovely.Mary Dare is pregnant-alone, scared and running.  Jesse Morgan finds her body on the shore near his light house, and though every instinct he has tells him to run, he finds he can not.  Jesse is mourning for the wife he lost years ago, but Mary brings something to his life-hope and beauty.  The both have secrets, but their tender and passionate love will triumph!Yes, my review sounds oddly poetic, but that's how I felt reading this book.  There's redemption here, a story about moving on with your life and learning to find a place where your soul is at peace.  Author, Susan Wiggs, did a wonderful job creating these two broken characters, and yet the solace and love they find in one another was beautifully crafted.  More than once I wiped a tear away.I loved these characters, absolutely loved them!

"SO much better than earlier cookbooks for children.  When our oldest was younger (he's 21 now, and I'm talking about when he was 7-9 here) the books were very juvenile. Drawings, almost cartoon like, instead of pictures, and for the most part the 'recipes' were things like fruit skewers-literally just putting fruit on skewers, how easy is that?But this book by DK (Dorling Kindersley) is a whopping 300+ pages, and has colored pictures of every recipe.  And to be clear, there are some actual recipes here-no more fruit skewers, and peanut butter dip (which was yes, just peanut butter)Our 11 and 7 year old helped me with numerous recipes here:+Classic Coleslaw-with summer rigth around the corner, we love cooking out on our trusty Weber grill. And who doesn't love coleslaw with a good burger?  The kids and I made this, and while we prefer a vinegar based slaw, this one was ok.  It lightens things up a bit using some yogurt, instead of just mayo. On the other hand, we found the dressing a bit heavy.+Bell Pepper Hummus-the kids are willing to try just about anything you can dip a chip or carrot into, so why not some hummus?  My 11 year old enjoyed cutting up the peppers-with some help and supervision from me!-and they thought this was pretty tasty.  I love hummus, and I thought it was pretty tasty as well.  Easy to make too+Beef Pasta-my 11 year old made this pretty much on his own.  I chopped the veggies and laid things out and then he put everything together.  I liked that they put some vegetables in here, but overall the sauce was pretty blah.  The addition of green pesto added some flavor, but where is the parsley, the cilantro, the cayenne pepper?  Something!  I wasn't the only one disappointed in this very pedestrian pasta.+ Apple Crumble-during the same meal we made our coleslaw for, we prepared with Apple Crumble for dessert.  YUM! Of course, pretty much any apple pie is going to be a hit in my house, but the boys liked this, and enjoyed preparing it, though I think that's because they stole more than a few slices of apple.+Chocolate Fudge Brownies-Nope!  This recipe calls for 18...yes, you read that right 18 tablespoons of butter.  Ok, we went with it, but there is just too much butter and not enough chocolate.  We mixed everything up, and the recipe said too cook for 20-25 minutes.  I didn't think that sounded right, but again, we're going with it....when we took the cake out, it was still raw brownie batter.  We were able to salvage it, but only after I cooked it for another 20 minutes!  And yes, my oven is working properly.  I'm thinking that cooking time was a misprint.  In the end, these brownies were not tasty.  Just way too much butter.One thing I do like is that each recipe spells out the equipment you will need.  My kids can assemble all the ingredients and utensils they need for any given recipe.Aside from a few mishaps, this book is a wonderful introduction to cooking for kids.  There are step by step instructions and picture, and since my kids are more visual learners I appreciated this.We are pretty adventurous eaters, and nothing in here scared my boys off.  On the other hand, the lack of spices immediately tells me that many of these recipes are, simply put, going to be rather blah.  This is one of the better kids cookbooks I've come across, and it's a good buy for the price, if you want to stick to the basics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MDUE4Z1X47GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465435468#wasThisHelpful","R2MDUE4Z1X47GS","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read all the books in author, Lori Foster's, ""Love Undercover"" series, and I love them!When summer in Virginia rolls around, I look for a certain type of book-romance with a twist.  I enjoy my romance novels with an undercurrent of danger and surprise and I've realized that Foster almost always delivers.  One thing I appreciate is that Foster brings back the other characters from her series, and not in a peripheral way-she weaves them into the story in a way that makes sense, but also gives loyal readers an update into their lives-something I love!.Lieutenant Margarent Peterson is a tough as nails cop-beautiful, but deadly.  Not many men can get past her prickly exterior, but for Dashiel Riske that isn't a problem. He sees her for the complex, kind and caring woman she is, and appreciates all of that in her.  Of course, Margo (Margaret's nickname) has a tough time with that. A hard childhood has left her unable to easily recognize love-though both characters quickly fall for the other.  Foster's books, though she often writes about extreme circumstances, don't' usually have the characters follow the typical romance plotline (two characters meet, dislike each other but lust after one another, fall in love, something drives them apart, but they find their way back to one another) rather she weaves in a more believable (for me anyways) courtship between the two main characters-yes, they face hardship, and that brings tension and uncertainty, but it doesn't necessarily drive them away from one another.Trying to take down a vicious abduction ring, puts Margo and Dash right in the crosshairs of the sleazy ring leader.  It's hard for Margo to ask for help, let alone accept protection, unfortunately that's exactly what Dash wants to give her.  In between abductions, shootouts, and attempted murder the two find their way to one another, and though the book is set in a relatively short time frame (from my best guess three to five weeks maybe) Foster crafts a believable romance, rather than one that seems to happen overnight.We get our happy ending, but not before we are treated to some adventure.  The one thing I found a bit tedious is the overly long seduction scenes.  I'm not prude by any means, but two or three long chapters is a bit silly in my book, though they are well written, so I can get over that.Perfect book for a warm summer night!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LZIOZ6O7WG6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778570#wasThisHelpful","R3LZIOZ6O7WG6H","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a fan-what more can I say? Maybe I'm used to an applicator so that I don't actually have to play with my deodorant, or maybe I just prefer an antiperspirant/deodorant all in one, but whatever it was, this didn't do it for me.I'm a woman and I sweat! There I said it, and while I don't think I smell horrible, I want to keep it that way.  I don't want to smell when I'm outside in the Virginia heat and humidity with my little boys, nor do I want to have wet spots on my clothing.  Sure, if I decide to go for a run in 95 degree heat, I resign myself to the fact that I'm going to sweat and have wet marks, I might even smell, BUT why would I use a deodorant that only controls one aspect of the protection I'm seeking?After reading some of the other reviews, I used this on a day I did not shave-I still found it irritating.  It went on a bit sticky, and I ended up walking around with my arms held out for a good five minutes.  Ok, whatever. But I also felt a slight burning sensation/itchiness, and I'm sorry, I don't want sweaty, itchy pits during the summer.At this price point, I want something easy to use, that is going to WORK.  And while I didn't notice any unpleasant odor, it didn't control the sweat the way my current product does.  For this price, I'm not switching, nor would I recommend this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AEG5J80Z7V2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYT2WYM#wasThisHelpful","R1AEG5J80Z7V2N","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are very pleased with this (sort of) portable air conditioner unit.Packaging: We received a pretty large beat up box, and were immediately worried what sort of damage was hiding inside. We were very surprised to see that everything was in fine shape - which is attributed to the amazing packaging. This unit may be the best packaged item I've ever seen. It's wrapped nicely and tucked in with foam. It could have survived much more than the box damage implied.Setup: Putting the unit together is pretty simple. The instructions are pretty clear with regard to what pieces go where. There really isn't much needed. Connect the adapters to the the exhaust hose, shape the exhaust hose, position the unit, and put the exhaust into a window or through a wall. Side note: The exhaust hose reminds me of the arms of the robot in Lost in Space (TV series), so the kids got a kick out of me walking around with a weird looking arm. After a bit of fun, we snapped it all together, put the unit in place, and let it sit a while, as the directions recommend (Important safeguards section). A couple things I'd say with regard to setup is (1) the unit is pretty heavy, so be careful and have a capable helper, and (2) the window vent does not include any sort of flashing or weatherstripping (It would be nice if it included a draft guard to cover up any gap left between the window and the vent. Even with the adjustable slide that fills the window space, there is still a gap, which of course creates a draft.).Ease of use: The options and buttons are very simple to use. It's a breeze! (Get it?!)Does it work: I see a lot of the reviews make note of the device not cooling or working. Mine is new, so it is working as expected at this time. It cools are room quickly and easily - even on a lower fan setting. I haven't noted any leaking, although a drip pan may be a good idea anyway. I'm very pleased with the cooling function. It's acceptably quiet, and gives plenty of cool air.All in all, I am very happy with the product. Cleaning the filter is easy. Draining the reservoir is easy. I just wish it included something to block draft from the window - rather than us having to buy something to do that or slapping tape across the seam.Update: Soon after my review, we moved this unit to a new location. A few days later, it stopped working. It started beeping randomly, and wouldn't power up. Now it has stopped beeping entirely, and still no power. We reached out to the vendor, knowing we had the unit less than a month, and they require us to mail the entire unit to their service center which is halfway across the country. And they expect us to pay for it. We went back and forth with support, but that's their policy. Steer clear, as shipping this unit won't be cheap.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZ1O5PLUN0HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HG2LCA#wasThisHelpful","R1XZ1O5PLUN0HM","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was perfect timing for us to receive this. We are redoing flooring in our house, and trying to get accurate measurements. We measured a few long runs with your typical tape measure, but then it would be too short, so we'd have to measure, shift, measure. Accuracy falls short when you have to measure a few sections at a time.This handy device is simple to use, and can handle great lengths with great accuracy. All of the short runs we could confirm with a tape measure were spot on. So we trusted it with our long runs - in the 40 foot range. We bumped it up against a wall, set the device to measure from the bottom of the device (you can measure from the top or bottom), and shot the laser across the room. We held the device steady and pushed the button to log the distance. Bingo.This makes measuring long distances so much easier and more efficient. It can even calculate volume and area on the fly as you measure different angles. It can also store a few of your previous distances, so you don't have to jot them down or remember them.The only issues we noted were the interface being a bit clunky and outdated (but it works), and that the device is easy to shift/bump when pushing the buttons (so be sure to hold it in place tight, or your measurement could be skewed).You may also run into an issue if you need to measure something that doesn't have a piece to aim the laser at. In those cases, just have someone hold a piece of paper or a board at the other end of the object/space you are measuring.It uses two AAA batteries (included), includes a case and wrist lanyard (in case you can't find it, it is stuffed inside the case), and has a 2 year warranty (which is great).No more fumbling with a disorderly tape measure.

"This isn't a book that is going to teach you something new. It isn't going to change your world views, BUT it will entertain you.Author, Lori Foster, has created a group of fun and interesting characters-one's that you will enjoy reading about, if not genuinely care about.Rowdy Yates is handsome, fun and a charmer. He's never set down any roots-and that includes a relationship with a woman that goes beyond a one night stand.Beautiful Avery Mullins has secrets, and lives her life one day at a time praying they don't catch up to her. Rowdy hasn't tried to hide his attraction to her, nor his desire to take her to bed, but Avery refuses to just be another notch on his bedpost.And like any other love story, we know how this is going to end, but the ride to the finish line is fun and full of twists.

"I have a Contigo water bottle that I use when I exercise and it's great!  I've had it for about two years and haven't had any issues with leaking when it's in use.  I wish it was insulated a bit more, but I'll take melted ice over a leaking bottle any day.So, when I saw this smaller bottle I had to grab it for my 1st grader to use when he's playing outside or when he takes his lunch to school. He has used it for a few days while playing outside and I can say without a doubt it's holding up! He's an active little boy, and he drops it in the grass, sits it on the porch, and not a scratch on it!  The ice melted after a few hours, but the bottle kept the water cool for 4+ hours-perfect for a warm Virginia day!He used it in school yesterday and came home pleased to report that it did NOT leak in his book bag. He also got a kick out of his friend's reaction-though I wouldn't necessarily say there's anything special looking about the bottle, the kids got a kick out of the flip top, and the little blue ring you can pull up-apparently this is for holding it with one finger.As a mom I appreciate that this is BPA free, and dishwasher safe (top rack only). Contigo also offers a lifetime guarantee, and though we've had no use for it as of now, it's nice to know a company stands by their products.Great product for the price-less than $15!.

"This book is tricky for me. I liked the set up-a lot! Interesting twists, some suspenseful moments, but the opening scene and the stock characters made the book very predictable.I do enjoy playing the, ""whodunit?"" game. When I read a mystery I like trying to figure out who the bad guy is, and then of course I finish because I want to know if I'm right.  My problem with author, Michael Hiebert's book is that halfway through I saw where this was going and by the end of the book I was asking myself if I truly cared?The characters, though rather cliched are enjoyable. Detective Leah Teal is a tough mom. Good at her job, and loved by her kids, unfortunately that's about all we got.  I actually enjoyed the story more when it was told through the eyes of Leah's son, Abe, because the dialogue seemed to track better from a 12 year old.And I think that's my biggest issue-the dialogue felt elementary coming from the characters that are supposed to be speaking.  Some of the slang Leah used, I just didn't buy coming from a tough detective, a 12 year old yes! An Adult? Nope.The psychic bent in the story was interesting, but then the ending basically takes away the mystery of it.  As far as the ""deep root of evil"" the back of the book promised-it wasn't here.  Perhaps what the killer was doing was gruesome, but the reasoning was so stock, I almost shook my head at it.You can do better if you want a summer mystery.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SN5V3QZW1ZBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617737372#wasThisHelpful","R3SN5V3QZW1ZBG","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far this chair has been very well received by my behind and back. And when it comes to a chair I need to work out of for much of the day, that's what matters.The box came a little beat up. In fact, the top of the base was actually sticking out of the box. Seeing that, I was a bit worried that the chair would be damaged, but all of the pieces were accounted for and everything was in fine shape.Assembly is pretty simple. The wheels snap in, you screw in a few parts and then slip them together. The only pain point I had with regard to assembly was lining up one of the armrests. I couldn't get one of the bolts to bite. After a little arm wrestling, I was finally able to get it screwed in. Because of the padding between the back and bottom of the chair, you have to give it a little force to get the bolts in place. Just be careful not to damage any of the materials.Once everything is put together, the chair looks great. In fact, without looking up close and feeling/tapping, you can't tell that the materials are not ""real"" - not leather and some of the metal-looking pieces are actually plastic. For the most part, that's fine. But I do wish the armrests were metal rather than plastic. The plastic appears to be sturdy, but only time will tell. The padding is nice and cozy. It's not over-stuffed. And the leatherette seems to be pretty good quality - it has a nice thickness to it. It is certainly easy to clean, without concern of ruining ""leather."" The rolling wheels work great. It glides smoothly, and doesn't bind, which is a great relief. And the height adjustment, swivel, and recline functions all work smoothly.It does have a strange smell right out of the box. It almost has a petroleum smell to it. I have yet to rid it of the smell, but haven't really put a lot of effort into it yet. I was hoping it would fade on its own.Also, one of the pads on the armrest has a gap in the front where it meets the plastic - almost as if it has pulled up a bit. I don't think it is faulty. I just think it came out molded that way. But it is noticeable when you put your hand at the ends of the pads.The chair is comfortable, works great, and looks great. I'm very pleased with the product. At the time of this review, the price seems a bit high based on the materials used in this chair. There are competing products out there with more substantial materials, and more features (such as adjustable armrests) for a lower price. With that said, the quality of this chair's components are great and seem to make up for it.A quality office chair that I'll get tons of use out of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MG3OX4YDFSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVFKB8Q#wasThisHelpful","R3MG3OX4YDFSI","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GORGEOUS!  That's the name of my review as well, because I can't say it enough!  This color is beautiful!I will say it's brighter in person than it appears to be on here, but the color is just that much better.  In the past, i found myself reaching for lighter pastels or neutrals in the spring and summer, no more!  After wearing this shade, I love looking down and my bright pink nails!  Honestly, they just make me smile.All Essie polishes are DBP, toluene and formaldehyde free, which I like.  Two coats of this gave me a nice even color, with a touch of shine.I'm a stay at home mom and don't wear much makeup, but I love doing my nails, essie is a bit on the pricier side when it comes to drugstore brands, but for me I think the extra dollar or two is worth it.  The formula seems to last much longer-think I went almost a week with no chips!This shade is easily my new favorite!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6IQ9I8TB7ECW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STG583Q#wasThisHelpful","R6IQ9I8TB7ECW","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book two in the TombQuest series was just as good as the first!I got these to read with my 11 year old, and we both love them!  Filled with details of ancient Egypt-curses, myths, and gods-this book is education as well as fun.  My son reads this and then wants to know more about Isis, Mummies and the pyramids. Any series that can get him interested in history is a win for me, but the stories author, Michael Northrop, tells are rich, complex and full of little hidden morals.But the short answer is: The books are just really cool!Book two takes us to London where strange things are happening: Red rain is falling from the sky, and people are disappearing.Alex and Ren know what's going on. They defeated a Death Walker in book one, but they believe another one has taken up residence in London.  Armed only with their hunches and Alex's amulet they travel across the ocean, in the hopes that they will be able to defeat another Death Walker-if that's what this is.  Alex's cousin Luke joins them as they search for clues in one of the cities haunted cemeteries.  Will Alex find his mom?  And will they defeat a second Death Walker?Sure, some of the things are a bit out there.  I'm a mother, NO WAY would I let my 12 year old go to London for an 'internship.'  But Northrop comes up with plausible explanations for that, and i can overlook that because the book is well written.  It doesn't dumb anything down to cater to children, and yet the story is easy to follow and filled with twists and turns.Like my son, I'm eagerly awaiting book three, and we can't wait to read more adventures from the TombQuest crew!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4NOY2JZVO90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545723396#wasThisHelpful","R1X4NOY2JZVO90","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is only one thing stopping me from giving this five stars: The first 50 pages.Author, Nancy Thayer, is an accomplished writer and I've read and enjoyed a number of her books before I picked up ""The Guest Cottage,"" But the first 50 pages of this almost reads as a list of bullet points to get to where the real action takes place.-First we do this.-Then we'll do that.-and then we can move on to this.And FINALLY, we get to the heart of the story.Sophie Anderson is a beautiful mother of two, and her husband wants a divorce.. Trevor Black is learning how to handle the loss of his wife andhow it effects their young son. Thayer was able to write Sophie's soon to be ex husband and Trevor's deceased wife as people we could understand them moving on from, and yet still mourning the loss of.  This book is about learning to move forward and understanding that when one door closes, another does indeed open.I enjoyed reading about Sophie and Trevor's friendship and how it slowly morphs into something more.  This book wasn't about passion, though there was that, this was about learning to listen to your heart and accepting that you deserve to be loved.Keep on reading! Don't let the first few chapters deter you from a very uplifting and heart warming book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O7LCX2O4X7VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545516#wasThisHelpful","R1O7LCX2O4X7VA","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love a good romance, and I always say it isn't the end that surprises me, it's the journey.  After all, it's a romance novel, we know how it's going to end, right?But the twists and turns leading up to that happy ending are what can make or break a book.I've never read anything by author, Linda Goodnight, before and I have to say after reading ""The Memory House,"" I'm certainly going to read more from here now!Julia Presley suffered the worse loss a mother can-her son disappeared, without a trace.  No closure and no answers leaves her in limbo-unable to bury her son and try to move forward, but unable to give up hope.Eli Donavan has a past-one he isn't proud of, but one he has left behind.  When he comes to Julia's B&B seeking employment the connection between the two wounded souls is almost immediate.But Julia's inn-The Peach orchard Inn-has a past, one filled with tears, anger, and love. Can Eli and Julia learn from the past?  Can Julia open her heart to Eli's motherless child, and understand that she isn't betraying her own lost son?  And can Eli learn that his past doesn't mean he isn't worthy of a future?I loved how Goodnight weaved the past into the present and reminded us that some mistakes are timeless.  She also let it be none that a once in a lifetime love is as well.Beautifully written and the tragedies within the story were deftly handled.

"I'm a little slow to join the Frozen craze. With five boys in the house, I didn't really have anyone clamoring to see it, but my seven year old does like Olaf, so one cold, rainy Sunday we finally sat down to watch it. I enjoyed it immensely!  It won't replace my favorites (The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast) but I can see why it's as popular as it is.I got this apron for fun.  I can always use a new apron, and I enjoy wearing them while preparing big family meals.Sadly, I'm disappointed in this one. My primary issue is there are NO pockets!  None, nada, nothing.  I love my aprons that have large pockets running across the front and will put my spatula in it, a pen, or even slip the recipe I'm using in there for safe keeping.  And while this one is certainly cute and well made, no pockets means I know I won't get much use out of it.For the price I would expect some of these little frills, instead I got a thick, black cotton apron with a print of Elsa's torso on it.I was expecting more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW33SGAVT45E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2TT62G#wasThisHelpful","RW33SGAVT45E4","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't bought into a single brand of headphones. I'm willing to give them all a try. And my requirements are rather simple - comfortable fit and clear, enjoyable sound.Over the past few years, Bose SIE2 headphones have been my tool of choice for working out and commuting. They don't include a mic or remote control (the SIE2i pair do, now renamed to the Bose SoundSport). So, when I saw the Sennheiser MX 686G pair available with a mic and remote, I decided to give them a try - and see if they could be my new go-to pair of headphones. I can already say that will not be the case.Note: I know there is a pretty decent price difference between the Bose and Sennheiser, but they are the closest match I have.That's not to say these are bad headphones, but go back to my requirements for a good pair of headphones - comfortable fit and clear sound.Comfort - This Sennheiser set hurts my ears. No matter how I adjust them, they hurt. After only about 20 minutes of use, my ears ached after removing the headphones. And Sennheiser does not include different size adapters. On a happier note, the hybrid fit mechanism is adjustable a bit, and it is well designed to keep the headphones in place. They didn't bounce around or fall out once they were in.Sound - The bass is nice, but the mids and highs are muddy at best. The Bose sound is so much more clear. Bass, Mids, Highs are all crisp and clean with the Bose set. Some of the muddy sounds from the Sennheiser may be due to the fit of the ear adapters, but no matter how I adjust them, the sound does not improve.Remote/mic - While this headset is geared more toward the Samsung Galaxy line of devices, the remote and mic do work with my iPhone 6 plus - sort of! The volume toggles do not work. However, the mic works for calls and speaking to Siri. The track advance, pause, play, and call answer/hangup actions all function. You can even call up Siri without issue.Quality - The build quality is great. I love the flat cable design which helps alleviate tangles. All attachment points seem to be sturdy. They even made the elbow-style 3.5 mm jack plug skinny enough to fit thicker device cases.While I appreciate the effort Sennheiser put into making a quality set of headphones at a decent price, I just can't find myself using this set very much. They are uncomfortable for me to wear for even a short while. The pouch is great, the cable is sturdy, you can wash the headset gently when needed, but if I just can't wear them, I probably won't benefit from any of the positive features. If you are comfortable with the ear bud style headphones, then these may work for you, but I guess I need the buds with a more flexible ear adapter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TGJMWU244UGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRHXBIQ#wasThisHelpful","R3TGJMWU244UGO","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jonathan Maberry is one of my favorite authors (his Pine Deep trilogy and Joe Ledger series are must reads as far as I am concerned!). In fact, my oldest son (21) is a fan of his, as is my 16 year old (he also writes Young Adult novels-Rot and Ruin Series), so when I saw this new series aimed at the Middle school set I jumped at the chance to introduce my 11 year old to such a fun and engaging writer.I will admit when the book came my 11 year old was a bit concerned at the size of the book-it clocks in at almost 400 pages-a daunting task for an active 11 year old, but he was game after he read the description of the book:Milo Silk has a hard time separating his dreams from reality, and this is why he keeps them locked away in his dream journal. He prays that his dreams never come true, but sadly they often do-like his father disappearing years ago. Recently, the Witch of the World has invaded his dreams and keeps telling him he is going to be a hero and save the world.  Milo is scared until he discovers the Nightsiders-magical shadow creatures waging their own war on the Bugs that have invaded earth.My Son's take on this fantastical new book:""It was awesome! I love adventure books and it was just like you're in a game because of the big bugs and the other monsters.  It was cool that it was  dreams and reality with the witch of the world.So, good job and cant wait for part 2!""That's immensely high praise from an active young boy who'd rather be out playing basketball.  The biggest clue that this was a winner for him was the fact that he didn't fight me when I told him it was time to do his daily reading. (He is supposed to read for at least 20 minutes a day, per his school requirement)I think Mr. Maberry has another fan in our house!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZXFEF5EC8AXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481415751#wasThisHelpful","R2ZXFEF5EC8AXY","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I've ever used a product like this, and I have to say-I love it!With five boys in the house, five boys that have passed that baby smell phase, I won't lie- I miss it. I miss that sweet scent that all babies have.  So I jumped at the chance to try this.And it works!  I shake in just a small handful, and it gives our clothes, towels and sheets a sweet baby scent.

I could be wrong, I searched, and didn't' see that the order includes multiple jars?

"I've read a few of author, Debbie Macomber's, books and though they are predictable, they are also well written and...what can I say?...nice.There is something to be said for reading a book where there aren't murders, kidnappings, etc, etc.  Yes, there is drama, and yes there is pain and longing, but this is a story that I think most people can relate to on some level.Cassie Carter ran from an abusive marriage, and had to scrap herself off the floor to provide a life for herself and her young daughter.  When we meet her, she is struggling, but she has made a life for herself as a hairdresser.  Unfortunately her bad decision to marry her abusive husband estranged her from her family.And this is where I have my problem with ""Last one Home."" For the storyline to progress, some of the characters almost have to be written as ignorant or oblivious, and yet that's not how Macomber wants us to see these women.  Cassie's sisters, simply think that Cassie abandoned them and yet they have all these wonderful memories of her?I would rather of read them as having some sort of clue as to what Cassie might be going through, and feeling powerless to help as opposed to the idea of abuse or control never crossed their minds.Despite, that plot hole (for me anyways) I enjoyed seeing the sisters reconnect.  I liked watching Cassie learn to trust herself again, and allow herself to fall in love with a good man.Yes, the cluelessness of Cassie's sister bugged me, but this won't be the last book from Macomber that I'll read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G7NMXGWQJHXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391887#wasThisHelpful","R2G7NMXGWQJHXI","A3QD59N3M7O7KB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QD59N3M7O7KB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those toys that I like. I recycle a lot of plastic bottles. One of my dogs loves chewing on the bottles before I put them in the bin. I usually don't give her much time with them due to not wanting her to get pieces off etc. The nice thing about this is you don't have to worry (as much) about them getting pieces off.Yes, you still have to monitor them, but you really should with any toy.The one thing I'm not sure I like about this one is the little ""noise making"" piece that goes into the top of the bottle.

"This is a very nice hedge trimmer, it's light weight and battery powered which are both added bonuses. It is replacing an ancient model that I got from my dad, that he very well could have gotten from his dad. That thing is a beast, but did it's job. After using this however, I have to wonder how dull the bits were on that older one, or if it was just lack of power for it. because while using this, it tore through things that typically took some effort with my old one.This is not going to cut through thick branches but it will handle bush trimming, over growth, or just general hedge maintenance. It is battery powered and has a run time of 30 minutes. Truth be told my effective run time was right around 25 minutes. After that as the battery depletes you lose some of it's cutting power. So someone with a real big yard/project you may want to invest in another battery for this so you can switch out on the fly.For most people though this will be more than adequate.

Grab one, or two on the go and you're good.I'm not sure if it's a production thing, where they were shipped from or what - but several of my normal Hershey bars went bent/broken and maybe somewhat melted. Reading other comments here is seems like this is a common issue. I didn't have any issues with the peanut butter cups. But many broken Hershey bars and KitKats were like flipping a coin.Regardless, I don't much care what it looks like when I eat it. They still taste good.

"Dog toys are one of those fickle things in my house. The ones that you expect to last don't and the ones you get on the cheap sometimes last much longer than expected. With two Elkhounds I go through a lot of toys and chews during the year to say the least.When I first saw this toy I had hopes it would last awhile. Only the main body has stuffing and a squeaker. This toy lasted about an hour before the first limp was gnawed off. No worries there, the dogs hadn't officially killed it yet. So it stayed in the bin. Two days later I found another wayward limb.Fast forward one week and yet another limb and some beard fur were promptly removed, but ironically enough it still squeaked so it stayed in the bin. Now two weeks after receiving it, all limbs have been removed, it has no beard fur and only one antler and looks like it has been through a major battle. But... and here's the big but... it still squeaks. The dogs still like it.So, at the end of the day this is a toy that you need to supervise fairly closely so they don't eat the limbs or other parts, but so far even with 2 50 lb dogs it has stood up pretty well.I would have liked to see the limbs more than just knotted fabric and it's a little on the spendy size in my opinion in comparison to other dog toys of similar veins.

"With the amount of devices we all have in our lives now, and the on the go style many of us live having the ability to charge a device anytime, anywhere is invaluable.I have used a variety of these portable chargers over the past couple years, the two things that seems to hold true to them is either A they never really get a decent charge to my device or B) they charge the device but after a month or two of use they lose the ability to really do much good.This portable charger from UnU packs a good punch being 5000 mAh. To get a full charge into the battery pack is between 3 to 3 1/2 hours. I have put this little charger though it's paces and have had fantastic results.I have been able to fully charge my Galaxy S5 phone twice on one charge. I was able to charge my Galaxy Tab 10.1 (2014 edition) fully. I was also able to get a 90% charge onto my PlayStation Vita. That is the highest I have ever been able to charge the Vita with a portable charger. This is a powerful little guy for sure.I really like the 4 small LED lights that indicate how much of a charge this still has in it. With others it's really rolling the dice not knowing what you have.Size wise it's a nice compact design and I'd be remiss if I didn't say how nice the charge cord is. No matter your device (micro usb or lightning cable) this one cord covers them all with a nice little adapter allowing you to only need one cord.At the end of the day, with all the different portable batteries I have tried this one is hands down the best one. Quick charge both ways, light weight, and really compact. There is nothing not to like about it.

My younger dog will eat pretty much everything, my older one is a little more picky, but she also has a little bit of a funny tummy when eating new things.When I first got these, both dogs heard the bag open and were quickly underfoot waiting for a sample. I took two out of the bag, let each dog smell them then was amazed that I no longer had two treats in my hand. Both dogs loved them.

"The review below is based on my sister's experience with this handbag.When it comes to her purse... sorry ""Tote handbag"" my sister is super organized. Watching her put stuff into it and take it out she seems like a magician with how much she can fit, but she usually complains that her bag isn't big enough. When she saw the size of this bag, it was akin to the look you see from a little kid on Christmas morning. She immediately, and strategically removed everything from her bag and set about putting it into this bag. Watching it was like watching a back and forth boxing match.When all was said and done she fit everything from the first bag into this one and had ample room for more. I'm pretty sure she would love to fit a small car, kitchen and pantry into a bag if she could. the way she packs her bag oddly enough I wouldn't be surprised if she some day accomplishes that.She did remark a couple times how spacious the bag was, and really appreciated the couple compartments inside the bag to put things that she needs more often for easier access.Construction of the bag she was also very happy with. She is very meticulous about her bags and this one was no different. She grabbed it, checked the zippers, and ever checked the stitching on the inside. No idea what she was looking for, as I usually sew stuff with fishing line because it lasts longer. She said they were good seams, and strong stitch work.  That probably means more to you than it does me. :-)Weight of the bag was also good. It's certainly not made of lightweight cheap material. It's nice and sturdy. I'm not sure how many bags my sister has, but I do know she has used this one exclusively since she saw it. Even a couple of her friends have called me and asked me where I got it. So that says something right there. Overall she is very happy with it.***Full disclosure I received a sample for review purposes***","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9S7W41QFOIX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFX4M0C#wasThisHelpful","R9S7W41QFOIX3","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This light may be billed as a BBQ Grill light, but based on my experience with it there are more uses than that. But, before I get ahead of myself lets talk about the light itself.The neck of the light is an impressive 24 inches and it 100% adjustable to get an angle. The clamp at the base of the light is big enough that it will fit virtually anywhere. Easy to use clamp and with the addition of the rubber pad you don't have to worry about it slipping if it's at an odd angle. The light itself is 12 individual LED bulbs which provide an impressive amount of light. All in all this is very solid construction, and seems like it's built to last.So, solid construction, but how does it work? Really well actually. One benefit of LED lights versus normal bulbs is they give you a more ""true"" color. Especially important when cooking at night. In the past when I have grilled at dusk, or in the dark, I always had to wrestle with a flashlight - usually under an armpit or in my mouth- while flipping the meat or grabbing the lid. I will admit that I have lost food doing that. With this light, it's as simple as clipping it onto something and being completely hands free for other more important tasks. It works flawlessly for that.Other uses.I had to do some plumbing work under my sink and was able to clip the light onto the cupboard, bend it under the sink and had more than enough light. Same thing for working on a car. I know growing up I would have loved a light like this when I was putting models together as well.All in all this is a very nice multi-purpose LED light. High quality, easy to use, and priced right for what you get. This is certainly something I will be getting a lot of use out of. If you're looking for a light of this type I would certainly recommend it.*** Full disclosure I received a sample for review purposes***","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TTX1FWJR9741/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UO1JNSK#wasThisHelpful","R2TTX1FWJR9741","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had dogs my whole life, lots of dogs so obviously lots of toenails to clip. The thing is I made a mistake one time years ago when clipping a nail and hit the quick... that was one of the worst things I have ever done to my dog. The amount of blood was scary and to think I hurt the dog was even worse. Needless to say, since that day I have never been comfortable clipping a dogs nails. I will gladly pay $10 per dog to have their nails done. The reality is it takes about a minute and it's done. Having two dogs it adds up after awhile.Enter the DogBee clippers. Any nail clipper I consider the first thing I look at is if it has a guard. This one does, a nice little guard so that you don't clip too much of the nail and repeat the mistake I made years ago. The grip is a nice sturdy rubber. It has a small lock on it to keep it closed for easier storage as well. Also included is a small file to file down any rough edges.All in all this is a nice nail clipper, it's affordable easy to use and no gimmick to make it more than what it is. Will I continue to use it on my dogs... that's a tough one because of me, nothing to do with the clipper. I did use it on both of my current dogs without issue, but I was a nervous wreck when I was done. I'll keep working at it and maybe get more comfortable with it to where I trust myself. I know that little guard will certainly help with that.*** Full disclosure I received a sample for review purposes***","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XCRZGXZXITZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010I24S16#wasThisHelpful","R2XCRZGXZXITZV","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those products that a lot of people don't think they need, but after a quick search on the internet for identity theft, and other credit card related fraud reports... it's quite evident that this type of product is needed more than some thing. Me included to be honest. I have to admit I never really gave much thought of what was in my wallet or how I kept my cards. But, reading about some of the ways thieves can get your credit card data.There are a couple different ways to protect cards, from individual RFID sleeves to a full wallet like this one. Each has their advantages, and disadvantages. It boils down to what you need really.For this wallet, if you have a handful of cards that you regularly carry and don't want to invest in multiple individual sleeves this is a perfect solution. You can hold 6 cards in this, I was hoping to get multiple cards in each slot but I'm fairly certain rips and tears would occur. The small size makes it easy to carry in a front or back pocket.The only thing I would have liked to see different with this is a slot for a small amount of cash. Other than that there is nothing to not like about this that I don't like.Doing those identity theft searches those, really shed a lot of light on how bad this has become that we need things like this.

"I have 2 Norwegian Elkhounds, not overly big dogs (50 lbs a piece) but not small dogs either. It's a challenge to find toys that they like, and are the right size for them. The toys designed for small dogs they tear apart in no time, while the toys designed for big dogs usually don't appeal to them.This Nerf ball is just on the edge of almost being too big, but my youngest Elkhound still goes after it. Which leads me to the WARNING OF ALL WARNINGS.Do not, and I really mean DO NOT think of this toy as an inside toy. Either you will lose your hearing, you will wish you lost your hearing, or you will break a window trying to get this thing out of your house so you can check to see if your hearing will return to normal.

"I have waited a little bit to review this grill. I wanted to be pretty thorough in what I cooked on it in order to really have a good grasp of what it does well, and what it doesn't do very well.Before I get into the cooking portion of the grill lets talk about it's construction. It's easy to put together, but once assembled and placed on the stand it's pretty evident that the base could be much more steady. A thicker middle pole, longer feet on the base and a little heavier material probably would fix it.I have two minor complaints about the lid of the grill. The actual dome is pretty thin and I have to wonder how much heat loss is present due to how thin that material is. Secondly, very curiously there is no clip, hook, or other way to hand the lid on the side when you take it off. You have to rest a rather hot lid somewhere where it won't harm your patio furniture or any kids/pets that are around.Lastly, construction wise there is no removable grill plate. The base cooking section of the unit is one piece. This is especially problematic when trying to clean it. With the size of it, there should be an easy to clean feature. My biggest issue with the grill though is the temperature control nob. First, there are only 5 settings numbered 1-5, that's all fine and good but there is no real indication of how hot each one of those settings are. Logically, 1 would be low, 3 would be medium, and 5 would be super hot but that doesn't seem to be the case as the instruction book and the recipes and cooking guide have everything cooking at 4 or above. Even fruits and veggies. So I'm not sure what the purpose of settings 1-3 are. On top of that there is no actual thermometer incorporated into the lid to know exactly how hot it is.With all that said I was able to cook a wide assortment of things on this grill. Here are the results of how things went.Burgers - Setting between 4 and 5 for heat. Easy to do, good amount of grease in the drip tray. Tasted fine, tasted like the typical George Foreman grill burger. More like a pan fried burger than open flame which is to be expected.Bratwursts - Setting for heat right at 4. Didn't seem to cook at fast as a normal flame grill, could be because of my wanting to make sure they were done because you don't get the same ""look"" on these grills as you do on open flame grills. Tasted fine.Porkchops - Heat setting close to 5, no one wants to eat raw pork. These were fairly thick pork chops so took about 20-25 minutes to cook. Had ok grill marks on them, but overall color seems muted. Overall flavor was ok, but I'm not sure I'll make pork chops on this again.Boneless chicken breasts - again heat set about 4.5 because of raw chicken no-no. Took approximately 12 minutes to cook. Good cook all the way through but, like the pork, had a pale look to it once it was pulled off the grill. Tasted fine and was juicy but the look of it seemed off.Pizza - now here is a quick disclaimer - it was left over pizza and instead of microwaving it I tried warming it up on the grill. Again, heat at 4 (because 1-3 heat setting is worthless). It took right about 8 minutes to get the cheese melted. Crust stayed crispy, cheese was nice and melted. Honestly this was probably my favorite thing that I made on the grill, but lets be honest if you're spending this amount of money to reheat pizza something isn't right.Overall, this grill is ok. It serves its purpose. is easy to use but there are so many design short cuts that they end up taking away from the overall performance of the grill and decrease the options of use for it. I'll probably continue to use it sparingly when I don't want to start up the big grill but I just don't see thing becoming a big addition to my grilling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14W0ZLRPMXH5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHRH3HA#wasThisHelpful","R14W0ZLRPMXH5U","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those products that once you use it for a couple of days you wonder why you would ever use something else.There's a lot to like about this 2 in 1 Salt and Pepper Grinder, I'll try to cover everything below.1 - I like that it's a grinder not a shaker. Fresh ground pepper will always, always be better than the mass produced powdered pepper found in many pepper shakers. More bite, fresher tasting.2 - I am someone who likes my salt really fine, but my pepper more ""flaky"" this grinder lets me have the best of both worlds as you can independently adjust the size of each one.3 - Have a 2 in 1 saves valuable counter space, and saves you from reaching over multiple times.4 - It looks really nice. It's a nice sleek acrylic and stainless steel combination that I'd imagine would fit almost an kitchen/or dining room table.5 It's sturdy but not to the point of being heavy.6 - Easy to use, easy to adjust the size of the grind, and easy to fill.The only thing I would have liked to have seen is a small indent on each of the cap to make it a little easier to pop the tops off. People with fingernails won't have an issue but I chew mine (I know bad habit) so things like this take a smidge of work to get into.Overall, this is a really nice product and one that I have already gotten a handful of comments on.

"Here's the thing about earbuds and working out... they rarely stay secure for very long. Obviously it depends on the workout but most earbuds fallout even doing low impact workouts unless you jam them into your ear, then they aren't comfortable. Also, you have the cord connected to your device that can be tricky to manage as well.Enter the Mengo Bumps Sport. Initially I was a little skeptical as to how well they'd stay, but after using them a couple times those concerns vanished. It's just not an issue due to the design which is perfect and lightweight.Being that they are wireless the issue with the cord is non-existent. However, there are two new concerns when you go wireless. Sound quality and ease of pairing. For starters they are extremely simple to pair. It paired on my first try, which is rare for me and wireless technology. Second, sound quality is very, very good. Maybe not as good as a super premium set, but I am no audiophile so I really didn't notice a difference. During my activities all I know is the sound was impressive.The information says up to a 33 ft range from device to earphones so I tested the limits of that and actually held a solid signal at 44 feet in an open area. Pretty impressive if you ask me.Change time I am averaging right about 4.5 - 5 hours which is more than enough for any type of activity I would do with these. Overall I am just really impressed by the sound quality, ease of use, and overall quality of the earphones.If you're looking for a pair of earphones to use while working out and you don't want to break the bank these are at the top of my list for recommendations.*** Full disclosure I received these at a sample for review purposes***","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQH0Q59JVDAF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ1ASUW#wasThisHelpful","RQH0Q59JVDAF6","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, lets be honest here GoPro cameras are all the rage and not only does everyone seem to have one, it seems like every company is making their own accessories for them. Sure, you can find a deal or two out there on one or two accessories but you run into quality issues.I'll be honest I had never heard of the Zookki brand before, but they reached out to me offering me a sample to review so I figured what the heck. I figured I'd roll the dice on the accessories hoping that I'd like one or two and see what the overall quality was. When I received these my hopes went a little lower to see that there was no real carrying case to protect these. Instead there was a simple bag with a drawstring.Once I got past that initial disappointment I was greeted with an assortment of goodies. I'll save you the time of reading everything that's in this bag  (the above Amazon description is spot on). What I will say is I was really impressed by the quality of the accessories.

"This vacuum sucks, no really it sucks because that's what vacuums are supposed to do. :-)Out of the box, pretty simple and straight forward to put together. You can be vacuuming in under 15 minutes. This particular vacuum is a good middle of the road vacuum and is perfect for most users. There are a few things I'd like to have seen different.1 - A larger canister. It seems small, and since I have two Norwegian Elkhounds who shed like crazy, I find myself having to empty it fairly often.2 - No adjustable brush height. So, if you have a shorter carpet or a longer carpet there's no adjusting. It is what it is.3 - no ability to adjust suction levels either. Again, it is what it is. So if you have something more delicate (think blinds) then probably better off not using this one for that.Price wise, it's a good price. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of other (higher priced vacuums) but it has better features than the real cheap entry level ones too.Over all I like it, it does a good job as long as you don't need it for others things aside from the floor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI052CYJSDR07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8IUDRI#wasThisHelpful","RI052CYJSDR07","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first true cast iron cooking item and I have to say, I'm impressed.I've often heard the stories about cooking with cast iron, the benefits, and all that jazz.

Sure, it could be some placebo effect taking root, but the steak tasted more juicy, and had a more fresh/full flavor to it. No more sitting in the grease and other crap that sits at the bottom.There is a definite weight to the pan, and I really like the color. It's darker than I thought it would be.

"Most people's toolboxes are the same. Jam packed full of things and in order to find anything you have to take a bunch of stuff out and hope that what you need is close to the top. So, I like tool that have cases, but the case for these wrenches is needlessly too big and bulky. It doesn't save any space, in fact takes up more space than needed. I would have really liked to see more of a space saving design.The wrenches themselves are decent. They are by no means top of the line, heavy duty. But they will most likely suffice for up to moderate use. They are on more of the light weight side, but that's fine for what I need them for. Design is nice with a ratchet design that makes it extremely easy to use and quick as well. No more crank, lift, set, crank... repeat. Just crank, crank, crank. (That's probably not the technical definition but hey it makes sense in my head)Overall it's a nice wrench set, the case could be vastly improved. Design of the wrenches is nice and useful.

If you're looking for Special K cereal you know exactly what your going to get.Serving size I really like the portions and the individual cups. they are much bigger and better designed than the ones I had as a kid. They are big enough to pour the milk in and be able to hold the cup. They probably don't have as much cereal in them as I usually have when I have cereal, but portion control is nice too.Easy to store, and sturdy enough to throw in a bag and grab a small bottle of milk from the store to eat at your destination.All in all I like it.

"This is one of those things that I'm not really sure how to review. It's a serviceable product and for the most part does as it's intended to do. It adds storage to a shower via a tension pole. You can add the 4 shelves and provided hooks to add decent shelf space.The tension bar is just ok. Both of the foot pads could have been bigger and pole sections feel very cheaply made. On top of the the plastic loops to hang the shelves are rather cheap as well. I am wondering over time if they will loosen and become less effective. Due to the small size of the foot pads, if you have any type of slope or non-flat surface this has a high chance of falling/slipping.My biggest complaint with this though is the price. At the time of writing this review it is being sold for $100. For what it is, what it's made out of, and how cheap it feels - it does not feel, or look like, a $100 purchase. I can't in good conscience recommend it for that price. If it was closer to the $20-$30 range than I would give it more leeway. But for a premium price point it's just not there.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JC2WMQMNW7GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SN3FBZA#wasThisHelpful","R3JC2WMQMNW7GG","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the thing about ear buds. There are hundreds of different ones out there. Pick your price point, pick the features that are most important and you can find a dozen or so that claim to meet those needs. The thing is, trusting the claims and how they really measure can be a completely different story.First off the packaging is nice, and it comes with 4 sets of different sized pieces to put in your ear. However, if like me, none of those 4 are comfortable or fit right then you have your first issue.Sound quality wise, these in my opinion, just don't measure up to other brands that are out there for the same or similar price point. For instance BrainWavz makes some fantastic ear buds, better sound quality they handle highs and lows better than these, bass and what have you.These feel like a quality ear bud, but sound output, no matter on what devise I used them on they always seemed to sound flat and have no real volume behind it.If you're looking for a high quality ear bud, I'd suggest something other than these. For the price point it just doesn't measure up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QZQ9WJ5KRPLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH0YDY8#wasThisHelpful","R2QZQ9WJ5KRPLQ","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really nice quality rug. The thing I like most about it is there's not a lot of fluff to it. It has a nice rubber backing so it doesn't slide at all.The thin pile on it means cleaning is easy, vacuum and spot clean if necessary.It's thin enough that this can be used in a kitchen if needed. In fact that's where I currently have it because one of my dogs has a bad hip and is struggling a little walking on the tile floor. So far it's working well, the chairs roll over it just fine.

"If you have ever looked at the prices for car seats, you probably made the same faces I have. Many car seat manufacturers seem to think that the quality of seat is a direct correlation of how much they charge for it. So, if they charge and arm and a leg the seat has to be good right... not so much.Enter the Evenflo Titan Convertible Car Seat. For a third of the price as some of the bigger names out there you get just as many features (if not more) for a more cost effective product. It does everything you need it to do. It can be adjusted to fit an infant, to a toddler (weight limit of 50 lbs front facing, and 40 lbs rear facing).There is ample amounts of padding and support. Installation is quick and easy. It is airline approved if you are traveling as well. Adjustments are easy to do and intuitive, there's no need to fight with 10 straps, snaps and contort yourself into position to see everything.I just really like this car seat. It's sturdy, offers the needed support and the manufacturer doesn't try to make you go bankrupt because you need a car seat. Definitely one I will be recommending to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V18410JBVE0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8RQTW4#wasThisHelpful","R3V18410JBVE0V","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those products that seems to fit a need, until you realize the number of faults that the overall design of the unit itself has.Anyone who had an Xbox 360 knows about overheating issues. They happened fairly often and at times the results were bad, very bad.The Xbox One is designed to have better cooling, air flow, etc - but Antec is playing off of past generation concerns here. That's not entirely bad, a cooler console is never really a bad thing.Set up is easy, it comes with a 4"" USB cable, rests on top of the Xbox One and plugs into the back USB port for power. Easy peezie to set up. There are even little rubber soles to prevent the unit from scratching the actual console.Now the not so good stuff.First off if you can not look down at your console, you will have a difficult time reading the temp as it is displayed ontop of the actual unit.Second, it blows the hot air out the back of the unit. Depending on where you have your console set up, and what type of entertainment center you have, this could cause your console to suck back in that warm air and have very little positive effect.Third, the unit itself is not secure. It is merely resting on the console so any type of brushing against it has the chance to move it and push it off.Forth, there is no way to manually turn it on/off. It turns on when the core temp of the Xbox One is 86 degrees F. Then turns off. Why not have a button for when you know you are going to be playing longer? On top of that, even when it's not on, it still makes noise - which is odd.When my 360 had over heating issues, I looked at all the options out there and ultimately settled on a standard laptop fan that I rested the Xbox on and blew air straight up. If I ever feel the need to look for a cooling solution for the Xbox One that is probably what I would try first. While this Antec unit looks nice, I never got the 30% cooler results. I'm guessing that is in part to the design flaws I talked about above.Bang for your buck, there are probably better options out there for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVOWDFMA1SLIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P45U43O#wasThisHelpful","RVOWDFMA1SLIA","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's something to be said about a complicated program being made so that even an entry level user can get good to decent results. That's the thing with video editing software, it's complicated, there are a plethora of options and it's very easy to be overwhelmed quickly. When I first started tinkering with video editing there were three choices. Adobe Premiere, Pinnacle, and Corel Video Studio. I tried out all three, I quickly threw Pinnacle to the side and was left with the other two. For an end user like me both did the same thing but one was more accessible feature wise, and less overly complicated. So I cut my teeth on Corel and have found a familiar flow to the intuitive layout and design.With this latest edition of Video Studio, Corel packs a lot under the hood. Bonus features not found in the regular version, and some tweaks to some of my favorite features of editions past. The basic overlay hasn't changed, so those who are familiar with Video Studio will feel right at home. Cut and splice videos, make a photo slide show, combine the two, add effects, music, etc. It's all here.Yes, there are a lot of options the first time you load it up - but the beauty of it is, it's ok to make mistakes and learn. I prefer Video Studio over Premiere because it's not as daunting. If there's something I'm unfamiliar with I seem to have a better chance of figuring it out on this versus Premiere. For what I do, and what I need this is the perfect program for me. Add to that it's one fifth the price of Premiere.This isn't a technical review, because there are others that can do that much better than I ever could. With this package you get access to everything in the Video Studio stable, access to online training videos, free add-ons. It can be a little intimidating, and to be honest the Corel training videos aren't always the best. If you are looking for great videos I'd highly recommend searching Youtube for Gripps2211 videos. That's where I've learned the most about this software.You can do everything you will want to do with this program, but not have to pay the ridiculous price of the Adobe software. Once you get the hang of things you can kick out some pretty cool videos. Some of it is trial and error, but for those who aren't too worried about making a mistake and trying it it's a great piece of software.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IUOHCNZYI2R7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0I6J4O#wasThisHelpful","R3IUOHCNZYI2R7","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never really been a fan of listening to music, well anything really, well in the shower. That is until I received a similar shower bluetooth speaker. This one is a little bit of an upgrade compared to my other one, I honestly wasn't expecting much of a sound or performance issue but I was dead wrong.The speaker on this is nice and large, and also front facing so there is no distortion due to bouncing the sound off a surface to get to you. Control buttons are spaced around the edge to give the speaker even more space. The skip forward a song and volume up are one button (hold down for volume) and the same with the back/volume down button.Battery life is very, very good. No issues there at all. The suction cup on the back is large and has not moved since I placed it in my shower over a week ago.I really can't get over the sound quality in my shower though. No distortions, no interference, everything is as I would expect it from a more expensive speaker.There is a small downside about this speaker, and it's the same one I had with the other speaker. That being this is intended to be portable, from suction cut to bag clip (clip is even included). However, the suction cup piece that slides onto the back of the speaker is just super tight to the point of it being a hassle to take it off and put it back on. So, I merely leave it in my shower. Honestly, I'm not sure how much use I'd get out of this being a portable speaker, but if that's what you are intending for this be prepared for a battle. (It may loosen over time as well).For me, for what I use it for it's a great little speaker and one I'd recommend to anyone without any hesitation.*** Full disclaimer a sample was provided for review purposes***","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IVEX0TYF2PBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJNZ3C0#wasThisHelpful","R2IVEX0TYF2PBE","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit, I have never really paid that much attention to my vacuum. I really thought they all did the same thing and aside from options and cosmetic stuff there wasn't much of a difference. Boy, how wrong I was.Out of the box it's light weight and very portable. I'm not used to this type of design and thought it would be cumbersome and annoying, but I like it. It offers more versatility and ease of use over conventional style vacuums.Settings wise there are a great deal of power options depending on what you are cleaning. Select the power level, then turn on the brush power and it's actually fun to vacuum. Somewhat self propelled, easy rotating for around corners and under things. Need to clean something up high? Push of a button and it detaches from the base and boom on the go. No more removing a hose, fighting an attachment and then doing what you need.I know this isn't a technical review. I'm honestly not sure how to really convey how much I like this vacuum. i never thought I'd say that but it's true. Easy to use, and very quiet as well.I'm curious how easy it will be (and cost wise) to replace filters and bags when needed but I'll cross that street when I come to it. I have two Norwegian Elkhounds and it handles their fur better than any other vacuum I have had.Yes, it's a spendy vacuum compared to others out there.

They can be printed on both sides as well, either additional information or more of a ""next apt"" type setting.8 cards per page, and nice looking rounded corners. They are the size of a normal business card.The one thing I don't like is separating them from the individual sheets can be tricky. At times they can leave the little serrated bumps, where as other times there will be a nice clean edge.

"Do you have a closet, pantry, or other area that light just doesn't really get to? The iHomeSet Motion sensor closet light may be the answer.When I say may be the answer it's because it really depends on the size of area you need light for, and how much light you need. I've tried this is two different areas and had ok results in one, and good results in the second.The one I had ok results was a large closet. Due to the size of the closet and the compact nature of the light, it didn't really do all that much aside from a halo type effect. On the flip side I tried it in a smaller hallway closet and it offered a decent amount of light and allowed me to see everything  that I needed to. So, depending on the size of the area this may be a nice addition.Size wise, it's a little guy small and compact which is nice. It measures 7 1/4 inches by 1 inch. It attaches to a magnetic strip that can be applied pretty much anywhere. It takes 4 AAA batteries (which are not included).As the description says it is motion activated and will shut off after 15-20 seconds of no movement.While it didn't do what I needed it to do with the bigger closet if iHome made a larger model I'd certainly get one for that area. It's a nice soft light and does exactly what it's intended to do.

"Ok, I have to be honest here. The thought of a Mop/Broom/Tool wall mount seemed like overkill to me. I mean, why not just lean them up against the wall like I always have and sort through to find the one I need when I need it right?Well, that's the beauty of this little guy. It's one of those things you don't really think you need, but once you have it you can't believe you didn't get it sooner.For starters this organizer isn't very big. It's about 16 1/5 inches wide and 2 3/4 inches deep. Perfect size to fit behind a door or in a shed.There are 5 ""main"" slots to hold brooms, mops, rakes, basically anything with a handle. The instructions say up to 7 and a half pounds per slot. I didn't test it with anything that heavy, but the things I did put in there held firm and didn't move or slide. There are also an additional 6 outer hooks for things with straps and loops. In total if you used every available hook and joint you could hold 11 different items.Set up and installation is as simple and easy as one would expect. Find the location you want to put it in, mark a couple holes, drill them, insert the anchors, and walla all done. Simple sometimes is really all it takes, and this is one of those times.Once installed it's really just a matter of figuring out what you use most often and putting it on the holder. Since it's winter here right now I have a couple shovels, an ice scraper and an umbrella hanging up. During the summer I see it holding a shovel, a rake, a broom and some other lawn and garden implements.Overall another sound product from the folks at iHomeSet.*** Full disclosure: I received a sample of this product for review purposes***","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N3PM5ATNNRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZG3D7E#wasThisHelpful","R1N3PM5ATNNRV","A28CCN6VYHRUKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28CCN6VYHRUKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jean Plaidy tells the story of England's great Tudor dynasty! Although technically fiction, her retellings are historically accurate and well-researched, using surviving documents and rare access to the royal library.  Two great dynasties - Plantagenet and Tudor - merged when Elizabeth of York married Henry Tudor. Their marriage overcame suspicion - was it in fact Henry who murdered the two famous ""princes in the Tower""?, threats from pretenders to the throne such as Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel and challenges from other Lancastrian kinfolks to found the royal line that produced Henry VIII and perhaps Britain's greatest monarch, Elizabeth I.The books are well-paced and put the reader inside the heads of some of history's greatest political figures. Elizabeth of York, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his many wives and their children come to life and become real human beings instead of pages in a dry history book. If you love historical fiction, Tudor fiction and medieval fiction you will love Plaidy's series of books.The intrigue, romance and grandeur of the royal court come alive in this brilliant set of novels.  The great Tudor dynasty begins when Henry VI marries Elizabeth of York, but had to continue to fight for his throne against Plantagenet relatives who had legitimate claims and imposter pretenders such as Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simniel. He married his children into some of Europe's most powerful monarchies, including Scotland and France.Prince Arthur, son of Queen Elizabeth of York and King Henry VI, is kind and highly intelligent and the first heir, but his sickly health causes concern that he won't live to take the throne.  His younger brother Henry believes himself the better candidate for king, and bides his time, learning the arts of government and war to be ready should his turn arise.King Henry VIII seems to have everything - power, money, the throne of England and beautiful wives....everything except a son and heir. His quest for a wife who can give him love AND a healthy infant boy lead him into a string of affairs and marriages.  This series covers his romances with Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, Catherine Howard and Catherine Parr.  Live the romance and intrigue of the Tudor court and the triumphs - and tragedy - of these beautiful women.Although fictional, these novels were carefully researched using diaries, the royal archives and actual quotes from these people.  Jean Plaidy wrote almost a hundred novels based on the European courts of the Middle Ages.  If you love history but want the feel of the period instead of a dry history book, you will enjoy this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDL50OHK7A06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTJ5XM0#wasThisHelpful","RPDL50OHK7A06","A3GA09FYFKL4EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GA09FYFKL4EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jean Plaidy tells the story of England's great Tudor dynasty! Although technically fiction, her retelling is historically accurate as always.  Two great dynasties - Plantagenet and Tudor - merged when Elizabeth of York married Henry Tudor. Their marriage overcame suspicion - was it in fact Henry who murdered the two famous ""princes in the Tower""?, threats from pretenders to the throne such as Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel and challenges from other Lancastrian kinfolks to found the royal line that produced Henry VIII and perhaps Britain's greatest monarch, Elizabeth I.The novel is well-paced and puts the reader inside the heads of these great historical readers using archives of the period and often  the characters' own quotes. Elizabeth of York, Henry VI and their children come to life and become real human beings instead of pages in a dry history book. If you love historical fiction, Tudor fiction and medieval fiction you will love Plaidy's series of books.The intrigue, romance and grandeur of the royal court come to life in ""To Hold the Crown.""  This novel's realism and history's legendary kings and queens make it one not to miss. Five Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6K0KG301WTLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ANUOM0#wasThisHelpful","R6K0KG301WTLL","A3GA09FYFKL4EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GA09FYFKL4EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This longtime Holt fan was horrified and sickened as well as bitterly disappointed in this novel because (a) it's not a ""romance"" at all and (b) this is one of the finest authors alive.The ""hero"" tricks and rapes the heroine, but she falls in love with him? NO! NO! NO! Rape is a violent act committed by men who despise women. No man who does that can EVER be a hero, and Holt's attempt to have him reason out his actions and redeem himself are an utter failure. Equally disappointing is having his helpless, violated victim decide he's worthy of her affection, and worse, fit to be a father to the child he conceived through force.This is a sad attempt at entertainment from a wonderful writer, a slap in the face to real victims of rape, a perpetuation of the myth that it's possible for some rape victims to secretly enjoy their brutalization, and that men who rape really aren't so bad. In wasn't uncommon for romance novels to feature rape-as-seduction in the 1970s (thanks to the dreadful ""Sweet, Savage Love"" phenom), but Ms. Holt's readers expect her not to use such a sordid - and false - plot deviceRead ""The Pride of the Peacock"" or ""Mistress of Mellyn"" instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37EL5WX8PDFB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EVOJV0#wasThisHelpful","R37EL5WX8PDFB2","A3GA09FYFKL4EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GA09FYFKL4EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jean Plaidy thrills the reader with another of her fine historicals. Katherine of Valois, daughter of French King Charles VI, grew up with the title of princess, but none of its advantages.  She grows up in poverty with her brothers, a pawn of her selfish and perhaps-downright evil mother.  After her forced to make a state marriage to England's Henry V, she dared to defy medieval convention and entered a love match with Owen Tudor, a common knight.  Together they spawned a destiny and a dynasty that would be anything but common.This book is more interesting than some of Plaidy's other novels, especially the rather dull ""William's Wife."" (The story of King William and Queen Mary.) Although Queen Katherine, like most medieval women, had little control over her own destiny, she was quick-witted and a forceful personality.  The story reads as if you are part of it, and the characters step out from the centuries and come to life in this excellent piece.

I also have allergies but didn't have a reaction to this at all.

"I absolutely love this perfume - and so does my husband! It has a soft, powdery smell that's sexy enough for evening but not too overpowering for the office.

Its rich fragrance lasted for several hours without needing a touch-up and floats around its wearer without being overwhelming. Everyone I ran into that day asked what I was wearing.

"I'm what one might call a purse and tote bag addict. I have a bunch of them in many colors and sizes. This shoulder bag is one of my latest additions that I really like a lot. I use it as a bag to hold all of the stuff I use when I go to meetings. It's professional looking and holds all of my files perfectly. I like that the bag has a zippered closure so I can also carry things in it like pens and other small things in the inside pockets and not worry they will fall out. Inside there is a zippered pocket as well as two open pockets.I really like the riveted cross on the front side of the bag. It gives it a unique look and is very classy. It has a carrying handle as well as an adjustable shoulder strap so I can even carry it hands free. I will note when I first opened the bag this came in it had an odd chemical smell.

"This is a very pretty cross pendant that has different colors of crystals in it giving it lots of sparkle. It's very different and unique from any I've owned. Usually they are solid colored or have just clear stones. The pendant isn't super heavy for the size which is nice. You do have to be careful though because when mine arrived it was bent a little.The silver link chain is nice quality and looks good paired with the pendant. It features a lobster clasp closure which makes it easy to put the necklace on by yourself. The chain is a good overall length but can also be adjusted using the extension piece. This is nice because depending on what shirt I am wearing sometimes I like it longer than others.As always with Embolden Jewelry it came in the traditional black velvet drawstring bag.

"I like to use markers on some of my adult coloring books but with the smaller spaces it's hard to use them sometimes. So when I saw these extra-fine tip markers I was very excited to try them out.I really like that the markers come in a reusable plastic container that I can store them in and take them places with me so easily. And the lid even fits on tight so when you grab it from the top it doesn't pop off on you! After you remove the lid you can easily see all of the pen colors without having to take them out because both the cap and the ends of the pens show the ink color. I like this because sometimes pens get put back upside down.The pens themselves are very nice. I like that they have such a fine tip so I can use them in my coloring books where the areas are so small. You can color with them, but it of course takes a bit longer with the small tip. I just use them for the small areas my other markers are too big for. I also like them for writing on small stickers when I am scrapbooking. They write really nice and don't bleed.

"If you are looking for a book that provides a good introduction into using essential oils without the bias of one brand over another this is a good one to start with. That was actually one thing that I was impressed with right off, the author didn't try to sway you to one particular brand.The book covers the basics of how essential oils are produced, how they work, oil safety, storage of oils, as well as many other basics you would want to know starting out. I already knew most of this stuff, but there were many things that were new to me and I wish I had known when I first started out.My favorite part of this book is that it has a list of 35 oils to know and use that goes into detail for each oil as to what the properties of them are, precautions, as well as uses. My other favorite part is all of the oil blend recipes. I've had other books with recipes, but this one actually has many I would make and use myself. Plus they are all very basic and easy to follow. For example there's recipes for anti-itch cream, cuticle lotion, and morning sickness to name a few. The recipe sections are: Health & healing, cosmetic care, home and perfumes.

"This is a cute little tea light holder that will make a nice table centerpiece when having an evening BBQ outdoors. Just pop in an LED tea light and you're all set. It's not really big enough to provide light for seeing, but gives off enough light to look pretty through the butterfly cutouts.To insert a light you just lift the top of the holder up on the handle and you can then drop it down inside. I thought this was a bit of a pain because you have to hold the lid up with one hand and drop in the candle with the other hoping it hits the center area where it sits. You can't take the lid off all the way because the handle is attached on the inside of the holder at the top. Other than that it's a pretty neat little tea light holder. My daughter likes to use it in her bedroom to shine butterflies on her walls when she plays. The metal is good quality and there aren't any rough or sharp edges to it so it's safe around kids with an LED tea light.I ordered this product through a special promotion and this is my honest and unbiased review.

"I like to buy my spices in bulk because it's more cost effective that way. But I don't like that having the larger bottles take up so much room in my kitchen cabinet. So when I saw this spice rack I was very interested in checking it out as a solution to my problem.I like that this is a nice way to have a smaller amount of various spices within reach in your kitchen. Each container has a clear lid so you can see what's inside. There's two openings on the base one to sprinkle and one to pour the spices out. And they all have a magnetic bottom so they stick very well to the included easel rack.I was prepared to move my spices into the containers...that was until I started taking the lids off of all the containers. The first one was great, the second however was not so great. The lid just slipped right off without any hesitation or effort. It didn't fit tight on the bottom part of the container, and if I had put spices in it they would be all over the floor. Most of them seemed to have tight fitting lids but it's just not a chance I'm willing to take. I don't know if it was a fluke or if it had gotten bent somehow so it didn't fit as tight as it was supposed to. So instead I am planning to use them at my desk for things like paper clips, rubber bands, push pins, and other small things I use a lot. At least this way if a lid comes off it won't be a huge mess.I ordered this product through a special promotion and this is my honest and unbiased review.

" 0:56 MinsI have two kittens in my house. One is 7 mo and the other is 8 mo. So they are still in that playful stage of life and have many toys they play with. I put this one on the floor and neither of them even took notice of it at first. They just walked on by. It wasn't until I went down to it and gave the mouse inside a push that one of them came running over. I don't think they realized it was for them.Once I finally got them to take notice of the toy then they both wanted to play with the mouse inside. One of them kept trying to pull it out once he got ahold of it with his paw. It was very entertaining. Neither of them has attempted to use the ""scratch pad"" on the top of the toy. They just lay on it when they are taking a break watching the mouse to see if it will magically try to run away.I like that the toy keeps my kitties active and gives them something to play with that doesn't require battery power or man power all the time. They can play with it whenever they want on their own day or night. I also like that it's not a noisy toy so I don't mind if they play with it at night. I's a nice smaller size so it doesn't take up a lot of room on my living room floor either.I ordered this product through a special promotion and this is my honest and unbiased review.

"Part of living out in the country means you have no street lights so it's super dark at night. That also means you are responsible for providing your own lights if you want to see at night. Thankfully LED solar lighting has come such a long way because having to try and hold a flashlight at night to see to close up the animal shed when someone forgot to do it is no fun. That's why I was so excited about getting this light. My husband was able to hang it above our shed door in a matter of minutes and then we were all set with a light to help see the door lock in the dark. As we approach the shed the light automatically comes on so we don't even have to carry a flashlight.Out of the box the light will need to be prepped before it's hung. You have to take the plastic covering off the light and activate it with the included pin, then it's ready to go. From there my husband hung it up with the included hardware and now it is hanging with no problems. We've had wind and rain the last few days and it's still going strong! I really like that it automatically charges up through out the day with the suns light instead of having to plug it in to charge it, or having it plugged in all the time wasting electricity. The solar panel on the top is angled so it will pick up the suns rays well. The light is also angled down to provide you with a good amount of lighted area.I ordered this product through a special promotion and this is my honest and unbiased review.

"Ever since I got my FitBit Flex my son had been bugging me to get him one or let him use mine. I didn't want to make that big of an investment in a teenager so I had been looking for a less expensive option. This activity tracker seems to be that option.I like that you have the option of using this as a wristband or a clip on version. That makes it nice because you don't always want something on your wrist. It's easy to switch the tracker from one to the other too so it's not a big hassle.My teenage son was easily able to set this up with the app using his iPhone and has already been monitoring his steps and other activities through it. He likes to see how many steps he takes in a typical day at school vs. a weekend day. Another nice part for him is the sleep monitor. I like this barbecue he has been having trouble sleeping and with this we can see how doing different things (like no electronics an hour before bed) affect his sleep quality.The tracker has a built-in rechargeable battery that will last him through out the week. It includes the micro USB cable for charging it and he just plugs it into that when he's taking a shower and can't wear it. Overall he is pretty happy and is no longer bugging for my more expensive tracker, so in turn that makes me happy too. This is a nice tracker for anyone wanting to know more about their lifestyle activities.I ordered this product through a special promotion and this is my honest and unbiased review.

"I really like how these cables are flat because they don't get tangled up like the original rounded cables seem to when they are laying with other cables. The coating on the cable is nice and thick rubber so I don't think they will get damaged easily either. I got these for my husband and I because we both got new iPhones and needed extra cables for work. So far they have been working well and neither of us has had any error messages saying they aren't compatible.Another part about these cables that I like is that the plug ends seem to be very well made. They don't bend and stay bent when you plug them into your phone and sit it down they stay flat. I have another brand of cord that kinks right where it plugs in at and it's starting to get loose from it.

"My daughter fell in love with this umbrella the moment I opened it up outside and showed it to her. She loves flowers and the color purple so it was perfect.I really like the push button open/close design because i don't have to worry about my daughter pinching her finger trying to open it. The umbrella is nice and light weight so it's not heavy for her carry and hold while waiting on the bus. It collapses down to 12 inches so she can even put it in her backpack just in case she needs it when she gets off the bus and has to walk home. It has a carrying sleeve so if it gets wet in the morning it won't get stuff in her backpack wet when storing it for the day.This is a very nice quality umbrella and i'm very happy with it from the look to the functionality of it.I ordered this product through a special promotion and this is my honest and unbiased review.

"I like the classy look of this LED night light and don't mind hanging it in my kitchen. It comes on when it senses motion which is nice because sometimes the kids get up in the middle of the night for a drink of water. The light isn't super bright like many LED's are so it doesn't hurt your eyes when it pops on. It gives you just the right amount of light to see where you are going though.It takes 3 AAA batteries which you will need upon arrival. Since it's motion activated it won't use a lot of power though and they should last a long time since it goes off after 10 seconds of it no longer sensing your motion.

"I'm planning to have family over for Christmas this year and thought this would be a really cute set to dress up my bathroom. It seems that's the one room that there's not a lot out there for so I was happy to see this set.The set gives you all the parts to make your toilet and floor into a snowman. I thought it was really cute when I took it out of the package. It is more of a felt like material so it's not something you'd put out long term, but is nice for having guests over for the holiday. I tried it on my toilet to make sure it would fit and all pieces went on very easily. I have a wooden seat and it fit that just fine.

"These little lights are so small and compact you can really put them pretty much anywhere with the peel off sticky backs. Just make sure it's exactly where you want it because once they are stuck to a surface they are pretty much permanent and won't move. I put them on our semi-textured painted walls and they are sticking just fine.To change the batteries in them (you will need 3 AAA for each light) you just twist off the front cover. This can be done before you stick them to a wall, and even after with no problems. I like that these can be put anywhere with no need for electricity. They are nice for emergency power outages, or even at night to light up our hallway between the bedrooms and bathroom so the kids can see where they are going. I put one outside each bedroom door and that gives enough light to see down to the bathroom doorway, then I put another on the wall just outside of the bathroom.

"When I ordered these rainbow springs I didn't expect them to be quite as big as they were. I guess I didn't pay attention to the size listed, but that's okay because i was in for a nice surprise when the box of them came.You could tell these were all new because they coils were all stuck together and you had to slowly pull them apart before you could use them. They aren't anything super fancy, but that's okay because I had gotten them for a craft project I am doing with my daughter's Girl Scouts troop. I don't think these would work well on steps like a metal slinky so don't expect that from them. They are nice for playing with between your hands back and forth though.

"My husband decided that he wanted to try and save one of his hot pepper plants when we cleaned out the garden. So he put it in a big bucket of dirt and brought it into our garage. We have a tri-level house so the garage doesn't get cold, but I knew it needed more than heat to live. That's what attracted me to this LED grow light. I had heard good things about them and thought it was worth a try.This light puts out no heat so you don't have to worry about baking the plant, or causing a fire from it overheating being on all the time. It's LED so it is low on energy consumption too. The mixture of blue and red lights gives your plant everything it would normally get from the sun to help it grow healthy leaves and fruit.We have had my husband's plant inside for about a week now sitting under the light and honestly I think it looks healthier now than when he dug it up to bring inside. The leaves are all full and the fruit is blossoming well. I can't wait to see how it does through the winter.

"Not too long ago our doorbell stopped working and my husband after many hours of trying gave up trying to figure out what to do to fix it. So we were left with a button outside of the house that did nothing and no way to hear people at the front door if we were downstairs. But now thanks to this doorbell kit we can hear the doorbell both upstairs and downstairs.I am very pleased with how easy this unit was to install. My husband just screwed the back-plate over the spot where the old button was outside and the popped on the new button. You can't even tell it's not hard wired into the house from outside. Then we plugged one of the doorbell receivers inside the front door and the other downstairs. I had my daughter go out and push the button while one of us was in the kitchen and the other downstairs to make sure it could be heard through out the house. Boy am I glad to have a doorbell again! And we didn't have to do any major rewiring to get it. This is nice because we can even move one of the receivers if we need to when we are outback in the pool.

"I used this to make I.D. badges for when we take my daughter's Girl Scout troop on outings. This way each of the girls has a form of identification on them with their name, troop number, and leaders information on it. It makes it easy to know which girls are from our group, and helps if one of them gets separated for others to direct them back to the right person.These lanyards have a buckle part way down so you can take the badge off the end without taking off the lanyard if you need to. They also come with a little clip on them that you can use to attach keys or other small things like a USB flash drive. This is completely removable so you don't have to have it attached if you don't need it. Or you can even hook it to something else.

"My son has a bad habit of not emptying his bathroom trash can often enough so our kitten gets the tissues out of it and plays with them. So I was proud to present him with this trash can to replace his open top trash can.

The stainless steel finish is nice and shiny and doesn't show when you touch it. The black accents are nice looking too. My son likes that he doesn't have to touch the trash can to open it he can just step on the foot pedal and it opens. The hinge works very well and opens the trash can with little effort then automatically closes when you take your foot off the pedal.Inside the trashcan is a removable plastic container that you can take out and clean if you need to.

"I got this for my laptop because it seemed like the fan was turning on alot. I have an older model laptop that's the larger 16"" size with a big ole battery so I imagine that it does take a bit more to keep it going as much as I use it.With this cooling pad I can switch on two extra fans under my laptop when I notice it's starting to get hot, or the built-in fan is running a lot. I have noticed that when I use this my computer does cool off very quickly. Sometimes if it's warm where I'm using it I will just go ahead and turn it on low so that it doesn't even get the chance to warm up. To power it up you just plug the included USB cable into your laptop USB port.Another feature of the cooling pad is it's also an adjustable stand. I like this too because i like to have my laptop angled when I am typing on it. It's just more natural and comfortable to me. This makes it more like a regular keyboard that has the built-in feet to stand it up.

"The pendant with the infinity symbol and heart together makes a really nice combination. It's unique and not something you see a lot. I also like that it has the black and clear stones both again making a nice combination. Truly a beautiful pendant and very classy looking.Paired with the silver wave chain this is very nice looking necklace. It features a lobster clasp closure which makes it easy to put the necklace on by yourself. The chain is a good overall length but can also be adjusted using the extension piece.As always with Embolden Jewelry it came in the traditional black velvet drawstring bag.

"When I ordered this set of wooden boxes I didn't really pay a lot of attention to the sizes so when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised at just how big they were. I was also happy to find that they were very nice quality boxes made from nice and sturdy wood. They aren't made from cheap or flimsy wood they are nice heavy duty.I really like the fabric liners as they really finish off the look of the storage boxes. The liners make it nice if you are storing something small in them or something you don't want rubbing up against wood. All of the boxes have built in handles so they are easy to pick up and move even when filled. I got these to organize smaller things in my daughters closet like extra socks and seasonal things that she doesn't use very often that I can stow away up in her closet on a shelf until she needs them.I ordered this product through a special promotion and this is my honest and unbiased review.

"I sell some crafting things online so I package up several boxes through out the week at home and therefore need lots of packing tape. Over the years I've learned there is good and there is bad tape brands. Yes there is a difference, some does not stick as well. Thankfully this tape is one of those that sticks to boxes very well. I taped up a package and then tossed it around and dropped it a few times (to simulate shipment through a delivery company) and was pleased to see all of my tape was good and smooth still.As an added bonus this pack of tape even came with a dispenser.

"I got this lantern to give my son to take on camping trips with his buddies. He kept going through batteries like crazy before because someone would inevitably forget to shut off the light. With this light I don't have to worry about that anymore because it's rechargeable. It can be charged via the solar panel on the top of the light or through the included USB plug. It can also use batteries if you so choose to power it that way also. Lots of options which is nice.I like that when not in use it's actually pretty compact so it doesn't take up much space for storage. When you are ready to use it you just pull up on the handles and when it's extended the light comes on automatically. This is nice so you don't have to search for an on/off switch. I actually gave my son a carabineer hook to use on the handles so they could hang it from a branch or inside the tent.

"These are very nice fitting thigh high stockings.

I put one away for later and am just using one pair for now until they wear out. They have a good amount of stretch to them so they were easy to put on and look nice under a dress. I haven't had any issues with snagging while wearing them. I found them to be comfortable to wear and they didn't make my legs itch like I've had others do before.

"Being a person that enjoys coloring this set of colored pencils made my eyes light up when I opened it. I am so excited at having so many different shades of each color. Before I had a set of 24 colors and thought that was pretty good. Now I know what I was missing.The pencils come in a folding case that displays all of the different colors nicely so you can compare them before picking the color you want. You can actually keep them in it if you want for storage and it is good for taking with you on the go. I however moved mine into a plastic pencil box because I got tired of unfolding and opening each section to pull out a pencil. Either way works though. Plus the case makes it a nice set for a gift. So far I've used these to color a few pages in one of my adult coloring books and am happy with the quality of the pencils also. You can get a lighter or darker color just by how firmly you press down as you color. They don't break off easily during use or when sharpening them either.I ordered this product through a special promotion and this is my honest and unbiased review.

"I was excited to try this Beep Egg from Brainstream.  I was very curious how this worked and it was rather easy.  The main key was to keep the timer in the fridge with your eggs so they are at the same temperature, that way the Beep Egg would start singing at the right time.  I love how it actually plays American songs and they are fun to hear and sing to.  At the soft egg stage the egg starts singing 'Oh Susanna', at the medium stage the egg sings 'Take me out to the ballgame'. then at the hard stage the egg sings 'Hail Hail the Gangs All Here' .  The timing was right on.  Our eggs were done perfect and the egg was easy to use.  It is plain looking but effective, especially if you get sidetracked while cooking like I do.  This is a sturdy product designed in Germany and it is a really good quality.  If you like to make cooking fun this is an accessory to add to your kitchen.I received this product in lieu of hosting a #Tryazon Party featuring BeepEgg from Brainstream.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R132QXCUFWJBD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDE24G4#wasThisHelpful","R132QXCUFWJBD2","A3JHS46QPMG3HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JHS46QPMG3HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:39 MinsThis is a fun drone to play with and learn on.  The boys and I have had fun trying to learn how to fly this.  It has some advanced features that we are still learning.  this quadcopter is easy to finish with assembly and the battery is easy charging.  The remote has quite a few features and the instructions are quite in depth.  The plastic drone has some cool lights on the bottom.  We did find that upon trying to lift off the one side likes to start out before the other so you do need to put some speed on lift off.  We also fount that the rotors hit into the guards so you do need to bend the guards out a little. Instructions state that one hour of charging battery gives only 8 minutes of flight.  We do have problems also getting this to go the direction we want, it seems to just go one direction.  Funny thing is we are on a back main road and the kids were flying it one day when it landed in front of an oncoming police officer.  Thank goodness he stopped so they could retrieve it.  We are still trying to learn the features better but not sure if they work completely to where it will fly perfect.

"This is a really nice shower head.  I love that it is rectangle, a very unique aspect.  The rectangle shower head gives you a rain shower all over you body and this provides a wider range for that.  The rectangle head is also great for broader bodied people.  There is a handheld shower head that is a smaller rectangle that sits in the cradle at the opposite angle of the bigger one.  The shower heads are plastic chrome on the underside and white colored on the top. There is a little tab on the side of the cradle that you can turn to switch the water flow from shower head or to handheld or both.

"No matter who you are or how you take care of your self a cleanse is beneficial.  The parasite cleanse is one of the best.  Why do a parasite cleanse?  We go to a lot of places like the store or schools, etc.  A lot of germs get spread there and we do not know what else those germs may hold.  I love in an area that there are a lot of migrant workers and farms.  Lots of dirt and animals.  The dirt and animals can carry a lot of parasites that can be easily transferred. Also if you have animals that go from indoor to outdoor there can be eggs and such transferred.  Our foods can also transfer a lot of parasites.  I was told about the cleanses that contained wormwood, garlic, clove, and black walnut from a lady who actually did it, she actually took it in a powder form and tea.  She lost weight and her bloating went away, she had more energy and felt so much better.  So this is something I wanted to try.  Everybody will have a different reaction at first and mine was a little hard for the first couple days but I now feel so much better.

"This chin strap is really quite comfortable.  It is made of a material that makes me think of foam.  It has holes cut out for the ears and velcro strips to adjust the strap.  It has a mesh added where you place your chin.  The strap is long and should fit those with bigger heads.  For me, I had to adjust it almost ti the end of the velcro.  The problem I do have with this is the fact that you do have to have it on tight and just right for it to stay on.  I move a lot at night and even though the fabric feels soft it chaffs my skin.

"Tamanu oil is a thicker green colored carrier oil that has many benefits.  To me it smells like a woodsy musty odor.  This oil is great for skin softening and wrinkles.  It also works really great for scars, used with the microdermal needle method it helps improve scars and stretch marks.  It helps regenerate skin cells so it helps heal wounds, toenail fungus, rashes, and more.  It also has some pain relieving and anti-inflammatory qualities that help with shingles, gout, and athlete's feet.  It is pet safe so you can use it on pet injuries.  This also helps with hair loss.  This is such a versatile oil and truly helps in many areas.  It is also beneficial in cleaning faces and healing acne.

"Sweet almond oil is a light clear oil that carries a very light scent.  This oil is rich in vitamin E and Vitamin A.  It makes the best massage carrier oil because it is really good for skin and the scent will not take away from the essential oils scents.  I love mixing this with lavender and using it as a soothing oil after showers. It mixes well with all essential oils for the benefits you want.  Great for under the eyes and rashes. Almond oil also has zinc and magnesium which is beneficial for hair growth and healthy hair.  Add almond oil to your shampoos, conditioners, or lotions for extra skin and hair help.

It makes a great addition for those cooler nights when a jacket is too much. The fabric is also soft and gentle against your skin.  I love how it has an more a-line cut to it and it is not just straight across.  I also like how it is one size fits all and that is truly fit someone like myself, a plus size.

"These Palazzo pants are so comfortable.  They are a satiny fabric that is soft against your skin. The high fold over waistband is so comfortable, especially if you have stomach or abdominal issues.  The loose fit of these pants make them great for wearing for yoga, sleep, or anywhere you want.  I got the 2xl and it fit really well.  The color was pink with an almost damask black print.  I wasn't sure if I would like the color ans expected to wear them at home only, but it really wasn't that bad and I have wore them in public!  The comfort issue is a big one for me.

"This oil is great for many uses.  It has a minty woodsy scent and it is a light wax that actually seems like an oil. It has a light amber coloring.  I use this on my scalp and it is great as a moisturizer for your face.  The wax actually resembles your skins sebum and therefore tricks you face into believing it has enough oil.  It helps with acne and absorbs quickly. You can also mix a few drops with your regular creams and hair care items.  This is a nice sized bottle that will last for a quite a while.  It comes packaged in a proper sized box and also comes with a glass dropper for easy use.  Do not use this internally, it is for use externally to help condition your skin and hair.

The lace is wide and long so you can tie it into a bow or get creative if you want. The seam work is really well done.  The ribbed fabric gives a nice fit and doesn't stretch too much so it will not go out of shape.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352L9UV6O0F64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CBBE4Q#wasThisHelpful","R352L9UV6O0F64","A3JHS46QPMG3HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JHS46QPMG3HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These knitted boot cuffs really add style to any boot.  They consist of two colors knitted into a sleeve that you pull up onto your leg and tuck into your boot so one color or multi show.  You can choose one color or pull it up the opposite way and have another color show.  You can also do one color on each leg if you want to be different.  These are knitted really well and come in many colors.  I chose the brown and cream to go with all my brown boots.  I think these are really cute and they help keep my legs warmer, especially with my ankle boots.  I love the style.

"This activated charcoal is pretty cool.  You do have to be careful when opening it as it is really fine powder and gets in the air, you breathe it and you will get it up your nose LOL.

This is activated by coconut so it is lighter than other charcoal and it has white/shiny flecks in it.

"Like many people, I use stock / broth a lot. I usually buy the quart-size cartons for a variety of reasons. My Prime Pantry box was nearly full, and this item popped up when I knew I needed to replenish - so I figured I'd give it a shot. I've used it once so far, and this is a first impression...It's a little less convenient than the cartons. It's more like bullion cubes / powder - you have to boil water if you want it to dissolve. Hot tap water doesn't cut it. Because what I was making (green bean & mushroom casserole) wouldn't be affected, I actually didn't boil the water, or use a the full 3.5 cups the directions say. Decently hot and about 1.75 cups was good enough for what I needed. Before adding to the dish, I took a quick taste. It's at least as good as the ""normal"" packaged stock.But WOW, it's way saltier than I'm used to. Of course that's partly because I buy low sodium versions of everything I can. Also, I only used half the water I was supposed to. But there's still a LOT of salt in this product. Comparing what I have in my pantry right now:Kitchen Basics Unsalted Chicken Stock = 5% daily value for NaKitchen Basics Original Chicken Stock = 18% daily value for NaKnorr Homestyle Concentrated Stock = 31% daily value for Na(looks like even the reduced sodium Knorr still has 21% daily value)So, the Knorr stock has fully 6 times more salt what I've typically been using. Maybe that's why it tastes so good? (the casserole was fabulous) I am not overly concerned about salt, but I prefer to add salt IF NECESSARY rather than have the decision made for me by a manufacturer. Next time I but I will probably give the reduced sodium version a try if its price goes down to something more reasonable. But in the meantime I will take the saltiness into account and continue to use this stuff.Speaking of price, it's a relative bargain compared to what I paid recently for 1q cartons. On sale the cheapest cartons locally were about double the price per quart. Add to that the reduced space required in my (very tiny) pantry, and I'm willing to compromise a little on other factors. It's a bit hard to measure meaningfully, but I can probably fit at least 8 quarts worth (probably more like 10 or 12) of the Knorr in the same space as a 1 quart carton.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXZX6EC9SWON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8GNJGU#wasThisHelpful","R2WXZX6EC9SWON","AYJEDESPQDFWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYJEDESPQDFWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Classic symptom, easily diagnosed with the help of YouTube.Laundry was piling up already (towels and sheets mainly) so I paid extra for fast shipping.

"About me : I've been residing in New Orleans for a while, and explored (by car, bike, and foot) quite a lot, so I've gotten to know the streets covered by this map pretty well. Over the past decade plus I've used Streetwise maps in most of the cities I've lived and visited because of their clear, concise, usable format. I like them better than paper maps by far, and they have advantages over electronics in many situations. Anyway...The map is accurate. New Orleans can be very confusing, but every problem area I've checked matches reality. Don't count on street signs at every intersection. Don't even count on all one-way signs being there. I recommend getting to know the ""important"" streets, and wandering within a set area rather than trying to precisely move from point to point.The map is NOT comprehensive. I'd guess less than half the hotels, restaurants / bars, and attractions in the Quarter (labeled Vieux Carré here) are marked. If they were all there, you wouldn't be able to read anything. The coverage for other areas on the map is even spottier. Some of the omissions are, frankly, dumbfounding. Don't use this as your sole trip planner.Unlike some other laminated maps I have, this one is ""short"" - so if you shove it in your pocket (or I guess purse) it doesn't stick out an unreasonable amount.

"My life doesn't often put me in situations where I'll care about detecting lightning. But I got interested in the technology after seeing a lightning warning horn installed at a park near my house made me remember some close calls with lightning during my youth. This unit is priced reasonably enough for me to experiment with. After ordering, I had to wait a couple months before a real storm came through … and I missed turning it on! It's Summer in the South now, so it's going to get more use. In the past few weeks I've gotten a good initial feel for it including during a handful of storms.The build quality is more than adequate for an electronic device. I do not feel at all worried about, for instance, leaving it clipped to a jacket pocket and chucking said clothing into the back of my car. But don't expect it to survive ""everything.""Battery life is awesome so far. Two cheapie AAA alkalines have lasted me many many hours - including leaving it on for about 72 hours straight. I think as long as you don't constantly use the backlight it'll last ""a good while.""Accuracy … that's hard to judge.I know there are ""false positives"" - it alerts me when the fan and/or compressor of nearby HVAC units turn on. I haven't quite figured out any rhyme or reason to it. At least for me, it's not super frequent.There are plenty of times indoors when it complains that it ""can't detect"" - and asks to be moved somewhere else. Sometimes this happens 10 seconds after alerting me to legit lightning. It also happens when I start or shut down my car while the detector is inside. Again, no rhyme or reason I can detect.During storms, I have verified it detects a lot of if not all visible lightning - alerting within a second of when I see the flash, with the distance decreasing as storms approach. It *does* work in my car, except as noted above when I'm starting or stopping the engine. I consider this kind of detection neat, but ultimately not very useful : most people can already detect that kind of lightning just fine with their eyes.I've gotten alerts several times for lightning I didn't see, and based on the conditions … I believe the alerts to be accurate in those cases.The ones you don't see are just as deadly! I think in certain situations (hiking in open fields, biking in very flat terrain, canoeing on a lake, etc.) it's easy to justify a little extra protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI664FZ4SB21M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO1H3X8#wasThisHelpful","RI664FZ4SB21M","AYJEDESPQDFWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYJEDESPQDFWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The flask does seem to be actual stainless steel - it's non-magnetic, which is more than I can say for a lot of the Chinese made fasteners I've seen at the local hardware store. It looks and smells clean. I washed it with water, and Everclear. Everything seemed fine with the seal. It compares well with others I've used. Should do just fine for what I'm using it for (Halloween costume) and beyond.The book is 4-1/16"" x 6-1/16"" x 1-1/16"" (that's 4x6x1 with an extra 1/16"" in each dimension) and consists of a shiny black cover, with an elastic band on the back that can be stretched to keep the book closed. (and thus the flask from falling out) It will not really pass close scrutiny, at least for anyone who knows what real books look like. (I can envision the comment at a church being ""that sure looks like a cheap Bible."") The interior consists of separate white pages, glued on one side. (""perfect binding"") My first page was crumpled and ripped - big deal, I ripped it out and now my book is 1 page thinner. They are ALL cut - there are no ""cover"" pages.

"Unsurprisingly, this costume isn't at all authentic to a nun's actual attire. :)It doesn't even look exactly like any of the pictures, or match the description. That's bad, but overall I think it's an acceptable costume. Here's what I received…1) The dress / gown. It's *one* piece, with a string tie I think is supposed to go in the back but I don't think it really matters. The ""plus size"" fits me a bit loosely. (I'm male, 5' 10"" ~200 pounds … mostly slender, but a bit of a gut)2) The ""collar"" is actually more of a ""hood"" - it's clearly supposed to fit over your entire head. A piece extends down to cover the chest. It's pretty tight on me, but the fabric is stretchy. There's a velcro fastener on the back, which I doubt I'll use for comfort reasons.3) The head covering (perhaps considered the second piece of the habit in the description) fits tightly too, but that's probably a good thing to keep it from falling off - and it's stretchy. It consists of a sort of white headband, with an attached black veil.The cloth used for everything is very thin and flimsy, but it should suffice for a costume. It's a little see-through, which may be a pro or con depending upon your situation. I trust the claims of stain resistance. I wouldn't be surprised if the fabric tears or a seam rips.What is *not* included, despite the pictures and description, is … gloves. That suits me just fine.

"I bought this to keep in my car because it's a small bottle and claims ""no rinsing."" (I know from experience that roadside repairs can get messy, and it really sucks when you finally get back into the comfortable car but have to be careful about what you touch) I think it will work great for that.The product itself is a white liquid, with a unique texture - it's sort of ""sticky"" but that's not exactly right. It's unusual, but not unpleasant. The smell reminds me of sunblock or body lotion. It's mild and pleasant, not overpowering at all.My quick tests on hands dirty from bicycle chain grease were successful. The best way to clean is (unsurprisingly, as per the directions) to apply it directly, rub hands together, and rinse with water. But skipping the rinse is possible if you wipe on paper towels, etc. If you don't have a way to get the dirt off your skin, you can't really do much more than move it around.I've used GoJo and the like for many years, and this compares well with them in cleaning ability.

"To be clear: rounding up, the cat I received is 11"" tall - exactly as described. It's a sparkly gold. Quite nice.The body & head are one piece, made of a terra-cotta type clay. The arm is made from a thin plastic.Packaging was a thin paperboard box (think crackers or cereal) containing a shrink-wrapped cat. It was shipped in the normal A-->Z logo box along with a couple other items, separated by the normal air bags, but with no additional padding or protection. Clearly that is inadequate protection.When I opened the paperboard box, at first things seemed pretty intact. But upon removing the shrink wrap, a large crack was revealed. The ""waving"" side of the cat was cracked all the way from the shoulder to the bottom and basically fell apart. The arm was broken. The mechanism was ""off kilter"" and wouldn't wave, but could be forced back into position.My 100% non-expert guess: Amazon sells a bazillion kinds of similar cats, most made of more durable plastic that can survive rough handling. Somewhere in the workflow, as early as the ""slow boat from China"" and as late as the friendly UPS driver, there's a failure to communicate that this cat is fragile. Given enough returns, they'll learn what's up and figure out a solution.I'm returning mine (extremely painless process) and will wait a while before ordering another.

"After reading a lot of reviews, I bought one of these from another retailer back in 2010. (it was more expensive, but also included an external antenna) After setting it up to my liking, it's never alerted except when I've wanted it to. In fact, it did alert me to a tornado that luckily ended up damaging a bunch of houses about 5 miles away.I'm semi-permanently relocated, and left the radio where it was for family members to use - but I'm still in an area with frequent storms, so I bought a replacement to supplement my smart phone's alerts. (towers can be down, batteries can run out) I'll also use it to listen to local FM radio occasionally.This is a nice plastic unit - solid, and pleasant to touch. Unlike cheap radios, the button presses always ""take."" The setup interface isn't particularly great, but with a few minutes I think almost everyone will understand it enough to do what they need to.The screen is bright and easy to read - and it will stay on (not shut off) if running on AC power. The angle of the screen is great if you keep it ""low"" - mine's on the back of a roll-top desk, so when I walk by the angle prevents me from reading anything unless I get in very close or tilt the unit.For a relatively small unit, it sounds great.

"This movie is hilarious and should be popular with adult fans of Doctor Who, particularly those that also enjoy the IT Crowd or Back to the Future.Chris O'Dowd plays an amusement park employee who dreams of being a real-life Time Lord, like Doctor Who. He has two friends who also work at the park: one is a less-than-insipired aspiring science-fiction script writer; the other doesn't like science fiction and thinks that both his friends are ridiculous. The two friends take the main character to a pub to try to console him after he is fired for taking his job way too seriously and scaring the heck out of a bunch of little kids. The main character heads to a room  in the pub to get beer and crisps, and there he encounters a time traveller, played by Anna Faris, who is his biggest future fan. And that's where the convoluted time-travel adventure begins.There's bad language, so it's not for little kids, but the level of violence and other PG stuff is about the same as one of the more violent Doctor Who episodes. It's laugh-out-loud hilarious. I highly recommend it for any adult fans of Doctor Who.

"I took this shaver to review, but after reading all the negative comments about it giving an uncomfortable shave, I was hesitant to let my son use it on his face.Instead, I decided to test it on my legs. I didn't find it uncomfortable. However, I did find that even running it over an area of my legs half a dozen times, it still failed to shave off all the hair. I know that electric shavers aren't as good at the razors I normally use, but this is ridiculous. The first time, nothing. The second time, nothing. The third time, nothing. The fifth time, a bit. The sixth time, a bit more. Seriously, does anyone really have the time to go over the same area at least seven times to get an almost clean shave? It's probably better with short stubble, but it can't handle anything longer than that.I wish I could at least give this shaver a three-star rating. It's cheap. It does seem to hold a charge. It's cordless. And I didn't find it uncomfortable on my legs. That's about all I can say that's good about it. The box claims that it's quiet, but I don't think it is.

"Teen Boat is a graphic novel for kids about a teenage boy named Teen Boat, who can turn into a small yacht. He doesn't know that his best friend--a girl named Joey Steinberg--has a crush on him. T.B. has a crush on another girl in school, and Joey is heart-broken and angry when, instead of asking her to the prom, T.B. tries to get Joey to help him ask the other girl out for him. Joey befriends the new boy in school, a rich kid with robotic parts, nicknamed Teen Bot. A boat race is announced, and Teen Boat discovers that the winner of the race will get to go to the secret city of Boatlantis, where sentient boats live. Who will win the race? Who will end up together? And what's the story behind Boatlantis?The first half of this graphic novel isn't that interesting, feeling something like an Archie comic, if Archie were some kind of Transformer that turned into a small yacht. The story makes little sense and is inconsistent. For example, in beginning of the story, T.B. can't help turning into a boat when he gets wet and can't turn back into a human until he completely dries. Later when he is on a ramp at sea, though, he turns into a boat and back into a human instantly at will. The second half of the graphic novel is much better, but it feels rushed. T.B. is a rather self-absorbed main character, and not very likable, though he does become more likable as the story progresses. There are lots of jokes, although none of them are laugh-out-loud funny.  I don't want to give anything away, but there are some things that happen in the story more because they're common cliches rather than because they make sense for the story. And they don't make sense. Neither does the idea of people being married to and having kids with objects, even if they are sentient.The story is weak and uneven, but it does end well. The drawings, on the other hand, are very good. The artist does a brilliant job of drawing a boy turning into a boat, not an easy task. The artist also manages to draw each character differently, which I like. Some cartoonists will give every character essentially the same face and body, but here each character has a different face shape, features, and stance. I like that. There's one panel with a goof in that Teen Bot's hand is drawn backward, but aside from that small mistake, the drawings are first rate.This isn't a great children's book, but it is fun enough. I imagine that boys between nine and twelve who like graphic novels and boats will love this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347X3BED8PRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547865635#wasThisHelpful","R347X3BED8PRF","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nory lives in a world where everyone has a magical power that can be fit into a neat box: there are Fuzzies, who can control animals; Flickers, who can turn invisible; Flyers, who can levitate and fly; Flares, who can create heat and fire; and Fluxers, who can turn into specific animals. But Nory's magic is a bit different. She's a Fluxer who has a hard time turning into a specific animal and staying that animal. When she wants to be a kitten, she turns into a ""bitten,"" an animal that's part beaver and part kitten, or a ""dritten,"" an animal that's part dragon and part kitten. Nory wants to be like the other Fluxers her age, but her upside-down magic means she can't go to the Fluxer class at the school her father runs. Instead he sends her away to live with her aunt so that Nori can go to a school with a special UDM (Upside-Down Magic) class.  There she meets a group of kids with upside-down magic like hers, but Nori still wants to prove to her father that she can be like other Fluxers, so she can go home.The story is very well written and the voices of the various characters feel very true to this age group. The pace is fast, and I think many young readers will be sucked into the story and want to read it to the very end. There's a lot of exciting and funny stuff. I liked Nori and several of her new friends. And I think the ending was pretty good.I have two issues with the book, however, that prevent me from giving it five stars.First off, the political correctness here is extremely heavy handed. Nori has a habit of classifying everyone according to skin color first. This is, well, odd. I don't think any kid does this. For example, if your aunt flies in through your open kitchen window, I don't think the first thing that will occur to you is here's ""a sturdy-looking white woman."" Nori is biracial, and describes her own skin as ""brown,"" while she describes her father as darker. Her friend, Elliot, asks her why she's black when her aunt is white, which gives Nori a chance to explain that her father is black and her late mother was white. Seriously, what kid today asks a question like that? I asked my teenage daughter who read the book, and she also found that part strange. Nori's UDM class is so politically correct that it's a bit ridiculous. Out of eight students, there's one Hispanic kid, one biracial kid, one black kid, one Asian kid, one Jewish kid, and one kid with a disability. Nori's aunt is a taxi driver, and the school nurse is a man. The only things that might be less than politically correct are that the school principals are male while the teachers are female, and the one politically incorrect thing I didn't like at all, which was how the school nurse called Nori ""doll."" That's kind of sexist. If all these clearly heavy-handed attempts at political correctness aren't enough, the principal of the school Nori gets sent to spells it out for you. ""I will not tolerate bigotry,"" he says. ""I will not tolerate unkindness about race, gender, orientation, family background, religion, weight, magical abilities, favorite candy, or anything else that distinguishes one person from another."" It's a bit much.The other issue I have with the book is minor, but still...The characters are very good, but this book felt more like an introduction to the characters and their world than an actual story. I can definitely see this turning into a series, and I know most readers would like that. So my issue here is that there's no real depth to the magic of this world. If a world has existed for a long time with everyone having magic, magic would have to be a part of everything in that world. Harry Potter is a great example of that. Transportation in Harry's world is magical. Food is magical. Sports are magical. Even the paintings on the walls and the bathroom no one uses are magical. But there's no depth of magic to Nori's world, which is a lost opportunity and very strange.In Nori's world, when kids reach the fifth grade, they're tested to see what kind of magic they have. After that, they're separated into different classes according to the magic they possess. Fluxers are in one class, and Flickers are in another. And yet for most them, whatever talent they have is irrelevant to their adult lives. Most go on to have jobs that have nothing to do with their abilities. (Nory's Aunt Margo is an exception, since she's a rare kind of Flyer who can give other people rides, which makes her a taxi driver.) So what's the point of using their type of magic to inform their entire middle-school and high-school educations if this has virtually nothing to do with their lives once they leave school? Why don't they just separate for their magic classes, like kids do for electives, and then learn math/science/history/English according to their abilities in each of those areas? It makes about as much sense to group classes together by their naturally born magical talents as it does to group them together by, well, one of the characteristics the principal of Nori's school says he won't tolerate bigotry over, which is to say not at all. ""Our entire school system separates Flares from Fluxers, but I will not tolerate any Flare treating a Fluxer differently."" Really? Hypocritical much? Still, I think it's a shame that magic doesn't inform Nory's entire world, since that would give the writers and the readers so much more to explore. Here, we've just barely been introduced to it, and yet it feels like we've already seen it all. A more interesting world would have given Nory's world room to grow.My teenage daughter, by the way, had different issues with the book. First, she didn't like Nori because she felt what Nori wanted was stupid. She also felt that way about Nori's new best friend, Elliot. She also hated Nori's dad, which I completely understand. He seems to have no redeemable qualities, but he is necessary to give Nori a reason to leave home. I do think it's necessary for Nori to be wrong about her own magic at first so that she can grow and change over the book. The same goes for Elliot, although I do understand my daughter's frustration with how long it takes them to realize their mistakes. She also had a big issue with the principal's decision at the end of the book, and she's right: that should have been Nory and Elliot's decision to make, not the principal's.All in all, though, this book is a fun, exciting, well-written, and funny read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERDJTGEQ7N40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545800455#wasThisHelpful","R3ERDJTGEQ7N40","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:14 Mins While this isn't a perfect action camera by far, this is the perfect action camera for kids. It's easy to use. You can take it pretty much anywhere: in the air, underwater, you name it. It floats, and it's just about indestructible.'My family took it to a hotel with a swimming pool and a water park to test it out. My husband and I used it to make sure we put it through its paces, and it came through no matter what we did to it. The video included here was shot with this camera. As you can see, we took into a swimming pool and into the water. We threw it up in the air. When it landed in the water, it floated, making it easy to retrieve. We took it down a water slide. We even filmed a hot tub--underwater. We also gave it to our daughter, and her footage came out great. (The only reason why we haven't included it is that she recorded kids she met, including one kid who did a great job hamming it up under water, but we didn't want to post photos of any kids without their parents' permission.) Every time my daughter filmed, kids came up to her and asked her what she doing. When she told them she was filming them, they all said, ""Cool!"" Some kids asked for and were given a go. You know a toy is a good toy when every kid wants to play with it.The video quality, as you can see, is about as low as it gets, but that doesn't really matter. What does matter is that this is a great toy and that it gives little kids a chance to use a cheap action camera without any fear that it might break.

"Annedroids is terribly cute and the main characters are good role models for kids in science. It's educational in a fun way, although it might be a bit boring for older kids and parents.Nick, the new kid in town, learns from funny Shania that no one ventures into the strange fenced off area that appears to be a junkyard. But Nick does, Shania soon follows, and they make a new and wonderful friend. Anne is the strange girl beyond the fence who loves to build androids! Each episode is a new adventure as Anne works on improving her androids while the three kids have to make sure they keep Anne's secret safe.This is exactly the kind of show I loved when I was little, although now I'd prefer something with more tension, even if it's Cyberchase, the great PBS cartoon series that teaches kids advanced mathematical concepts in a way that makes them easy to absorb.

"Bought this at Big Lots (for less than half of what Amazon is currently selling it) and was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box to discover it's American made. I also bought three of the ""cloth drawers"" that go with it (again at half the price of what they go for here). With the three cloth boxes filling the shelves that have no backing, it looks great, like a fancy piece of modern furniture.I bought this to go against a wall in my bedroom so I could tidy up my bedside table and the floor near my bed. It's great for organizing stuff in an attractive way. If you need to organize some things you don't really want other people to see, I'd recommend getting enough of the cloth drawers to fit them. I'm using the shelves without cloth drawers for pretty things, like books and jewelry boxes. I also have some games on top of this storage unit. You can really organize a lot of stuff with this.I'm very glad I bought this, so it's five stars for the product minus one star for the price here.I can't say how hard it was to assemble, only that my teenage daughter put it together for me in about half an hour.

"As others have stated here repeatedly, this ""pole"" is great, but the name is a bit of a misnomer. At a little more than six inches, I'd call it a ""stick"" or a ""grip,"" not a ""pole."" And it needs an adapter if you want to use it with a GoPro, so maybe it should be called a ""waterproof action-camera grip,"" instead. That would be more accurate.PROS:* The screw connector at the top works with most cameras. I've used this on a kid's sport camera and on a Nikon stills camera that also shoots video.* It lets you more easily hold the camera steady while you shoot because it lets you control the camera's movement with one hand, rather than two.* This was tested in a swimming pool and sea, and it does indeed float very well.* It's a bright orange, which makes it easy to find.*It has a good grip AND a strap that make it easy to hold and keep hold of.* It's reasonably priced.CONS:* Only the misnomer that I mentioned above. You ned to buy the goPro adapter for a screw head that is not in the standard goPro kit.The Photo shows two GoPros doing a TV interviewing the sea. One has the pole and a firm grip on the camera.

"Who doesn't like shaved ice on a hot summer day? This Margaritaville Frozen Concoction Maker--the most affordable model of shaved ice maker this company sells--gives you exactly that.You'll start with margaritas (using the included recipe and the ""No-Brainer"" mixer cup to help  you measure out the ingredients), then you'll move over to orange juice (poured over red wine for a little kick), Snapple, cold coffee, or anything else you'd like to turn into a shaved-ice treat. Kids love the things it can make as much as adults, if not more.This thing is huge and takes up a lot of counter space. It has a footprint of 14 by 8 inches at its base (the top is about half an inch wider). It's also about 17.5 inches tall, so take that into account. And it weighs approximately 17 pounds. The power cord is two-feet long, and there's a storage compartment for it in the back.Except for the blades and possibly the base, the appliance's construction is all plastic. The ice reservoir and the lid to it are NOT dishwasher safe, but I see no reason why you should have to wash either of those since the ice reservoir should hold nothing but ice, which means it should never get dirty. Any water or bits of ice that remain in the reservoir after you've made your frozen treat drips as water into a cup in the back so that it can be easily removed. The blender cup, on the other hand, is where everything BUT the ice should go. It's designed for liquids, but I imagine it should be able to handle soft things, like fresh (not frozen) strawberries or chunks of fruit. We haven't yet, but we do plan to try it with chunks of seedless watermelon. Since it's all plastic, I wouldn't try to stick anything hard in the blender cup itself for fear that it might crack.There are instructions for how to take apart and clean the blender cup itself, but be very careful when you do. The blades are very sharp, but there's also the possibility you might do what my husband did, which is somehow manage to get the bottom part of the blender cup stuck sideways on the cup. That makes the cup leak and impossible to stick under the shaved-ice spout, which makes the entire machine useless. You can call the company (it's a subsidiary of Jarden Corporation under Sunbeam) or visit their website to order another blender cup, which when I called sold for a little under $40, so this is a problem that has a solution. It's just better if you're very careful about how you handle the blender cup, so you don't have to go there.The whole thing is very easy to assemble, and if you read all the clear and brief instructions, you should be on your way to making frozen concoctions within minutes. Put the ice in the reservoir at the top. Close it. Put about two and a half cups of some flavored room-temperature or cold liquid in the blender cup. Slide the green shaved-ice dispenser up so you can slip the blender cup into place under it and lock both parts into position. Press the power button on the left so that it lights up. And press the start button in the middle. The machine shaves the ice and sends it into the blender. Once there, the blender mixes it with the liquid into a delicious frozen concoction. It's that easy.To make a thicker drink, hold the ""Blend/Shave"" toggle switch up so it's in the shave position. And for a thinner drink, hold the Blend/Shave toggle switch down until the desired consistency is achieved.  The No-Brainer mixing cup makes it easy to put together the parts for margaritas, daiquiris, and pina coladas, but you don't have to stick to just these drinks. If you have an idea for a liquid you'd like to try with shaved ice, go for it! I do wish this frozen concoction maker came with more recipes--particularly for non-alcoholic drinks--but you really can get creative and have fun. As long as it's a liquid that tastes good when it's really cold, it should work.While this machine is a bit of a splurge in terms of cost and the amount of space it takes up in the kitchen, I'm planning to use it at a family get together later this summer, where I'm sure it will be a hit, probably even a bigger hit than the burgers and hotdogs. That, I think, is the best use for it. Just like people splurge on expensive outdoor grills that are only used in the summer maybe four or five times a year, I'm sure many of those same people would be willing to splurge on a frozen concoction maker to make those barbecues extra special and a whole lot cooler.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3STL1BV8KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ5CV10#wasThisHelpful","R3S3STL1BV8KU","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This game is a lot of fun! Wait, no, not fun. Fun for the OTHER players. Not so much fun for me. Am I going to lose points for saying that it was fun? No? Phew!This game is a lot like an Addams Family version of Fluxx. Like the Addams Family, it's mysterious and spooky and all together ooky (whatever that means) and hilariously full of dark humor. Like Fluxx, it's a card game where the cards change the rules as you go.Each player gets a family (we've already decided the mad scientist's one is our favorite), and you need to kill your Gloom family off one by one while that family member's points are in the negative. Meanwhile, you have to try to cheer up your opponents' Gloom family members to give them positive points so that they can't be killed off (not without adversely affecting the player's score). When one player has killed off his or her family, the points are added up, and the player with the lowest score wins.Okay, now here's the fun… I mean the dreary part.The cards for each family member are funny on their own, and so are the things that happen to them. The card for Professor Helena Slogar, for example, reads ""ECCENTRIC INVENTOR: Helena enjoys gardening, long walks in the moonlight, and reanimating the dead."" One effect card (with negative 20 points) reads ""GREW OLD WITH GRACE: The player to your right may randomly select and discard 2 cards from your hand. Death becomes you. Hurry it up."" If you play the two together, you can tell a story like this: ""After reanimating her favorite dog, Grace, the professor discovered she had accidentally left her aging ray on. She aged twenty years, though showed no sign of it except a lovely lock of white hair that had suddenly appeared on her head. Grace aged, too, and died twenty seconds later at the ripe old age of fifteen, which is a hundred and twenty in reanimated dog years."" (Of course, you deduct twenty points for the professor, but you also lose two cards.)You don't have to play with storytelling, but the storytelling part is at least 70% of the fun. My teenage daughter held onto her death cards and deliberately lost because she didn't want the stories to end.Wait, did I saw fun back there? I meant Gloom.*giggle*Death and despair have never been so entertaining.One more thing, the cards in this game are made from a sturdy clear plastic that hides the points and whether they're negative or positive. This is important because it lets you see the positive and negative points of the cards that have been played before on that family member--or use other points or blanks to cover them up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A9HHVOOXWOQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589781449#wasThisHelpful","R1A9HHVOOXWOQB","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one big ugly super-powerful stapler.I had tried manual bulk paper staplers before, but could never get enough pressure for the staples to go through all the sheets of paper. This electric stapler has all the power and doesn't hurt your hand. The spring action was louder than I expected the first time I used it, but by the second sheet I was ready for the staple.Insert staples by pushing down on the button at the top, making the little drawer at the front pop out. Insert the staples, and slide the drawer closed. Plug it into a power outlet. It's now ready to use.The stapler staples with a loud bang automatically when you insert paper into it. It really can take a lot of sheets. It comes with two sizes of staples, standard 1/4"" for up to 25 sheets and high capacity for 25-45 sheets of paper.Both load into the same draw, and it had suction cups at the bottom to keep it in place. I found the high capacity staples great for closing a years worth of bank or credit card statements in to neat booklet ready for storage.Since it staples when you insert paper into it, it doesn't let you decide exactly where you want the staple to go. (It staples a little less than half an inch in.) I would prefer it to be adjustable. Sometimes I want a staple closer or farther from the edge but that is a standard margin on documents.If you need a stapler that can easily and quickly handle lots of pages at once, this is it, and because its plugged in to power, no one will walk off with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R344ZRMQUCZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIM5L6O#wasThisHelpful","R344ZRMQUCZP","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Jacobs documents his year of attempting to live according to his own literal interpretation of the Old Testament first, and then of the New Testament.I read this book in spurts at first and then read the last part straight through, unable to put it down. What makes this a fun and interesting read is that the writer, although a liberal nonreligious Jew, approaches the subject matter with an open mind and an open heart. He surrounds himself with all kinds of experts on the Bible, and he doesn't judge them. He finds humor in Amish country, comfort in an ultra-orthodox Jewish man's rituals, and acceptance where he least expects it. There are surprises and lessons to be learned everywhere. He also writes about the affect of his experiment in his own life with his son, his wife, and his neighbors. These are some of the most touching parts, particularly in the end, which made me cry.

Fray is cool, and the world she's in is dark and amazing.My main problems with this graphic novel is that Fray isn't given strong supporting characters, the way Buffy is, and the book feels more like an introduction to a series, rather than the series itself. I certainly hope that's what it is, because I would very much like to see more of Fray and her world. It's a very promising start, and I can't wait to see that promise delivered on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25D5KM8KSV0P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569717516#wasThisHelpful","R25D5KM8KSV0P8","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is definitely Spike, in all his glory. He says mean things out of love, and he swears he'll kill you when what he really means is he'll give everything to save you. If you love that about Spike, you'll love this graphic novel. It's funny without being a joke. It's heartfelt without being sappy. Yes, it's violent. Of course, it's violent.

"My family loves jigsaw puzzles, particularly my autistic son.These puzzles with the special shapes are our favorites, because every time you put down one of the special pieces, well, it's like solving a puzzle within a puzzle!

The image itself of the wolf howling at the full moon is beautiful.If you prefer puzzles that are more challenging, the same company has puzzles with 500 pieces.

"The Turtle Beach Ear Force Elite 800X is excellent in every way. Noise canceling? Check! Surround sound? Check! Full rich sound with a good range? Check! Cordless? Check! Easy to pair, decent battery life, elegantly packaged, easy to charge, and pretty much the perfect headset for the XBox one in every way? Check, check, check, check, and check!You can also pair it with your Bluetooth devices and walk around listening to music, away from your phone or whatever device you're using. That means you can charge your phone and still walk around listening to music. And the noise-canceling, oh, my gosh, the noise canceling is amazing! Not only does it shut out external noises but you can set it so that you can hear just conversation. How freaking amazing is that?Look, I wanted to find one thing wrong with this headset, because I didn't want this review to come off sounding like an advertisement. Maybe it could be a bit lighter, but then maybe this is the right weight for what is clearly excellent construction. The worst thing I can say is that it is now my teenage daughter's favorite of the many headsets we have and she keeps ""borrowing"" it.Seriously awesome headset.

"I love gemstone jewelry, and I've long wanted to have something with my own birthstone: peridot. I also love sterling silver. It's something I've been wearing since I was a teenager. I don't have that much sterling silver nowadays (I've been buying mostly costume jewelry lately), but I do have a few pieces I probably wear more than anything else in my collection. I also love butterflies and butterfly jewelry. This bracelet is almost a perfect combination of all three.Anyone with experience with sterling silver jewelry knows it's meant to be light-weight. The butterflies to the sides of the center peridot seem to have a pave-style imprint and isn't real pave, which I suppose is to be expected. The band is smooth and comfortable and seems unlikely to pinch. The clasp locks in two different ways, so it should remain secure. I've lost watches so many times when they fell off, so it's good to know that won't happen with this bracelet.The highlight, of course, is the peridot butterfly. The gems are a very pale green, so they aren't the fanciest (the deeper the green, the more valuable a peridot is) but they are very shiny and sparkly. It's beautiful, and a wonderful way to to wear my birthstone.The bracelet is made in China. My one issue with it is that it's not weighted at the clasp, which means the bracelet has the tendency to turn around so that the heavier butterfly ends up under my wrist instead of on top.All in all, this a lovely bracelet for any girl born in August who would like a piece of jewelry with her birthstone and who likes sterling silver and bracelets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JLO2CDFCNV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4HBF00#wasThisHelpful","R3JLO2CDFCNV5","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next series, particularly when the story takes place inside the Book World. My favorites so far have been One of Our Thursdays Is Missing (Thursday Next #6) and The Well of Lost Plots. This particular book, though, doesn't take place in the Book World and hardly references it at all. Thursday here isn't a Jurisfiction agent, or even a Literary Detective. Bowden and Spike are mentioned, but they have no scenes. But there is still a focus on books, and there's a lot of great Jasper Fforde humor. It's a fun novel, just not on the same level as the rest of the Thursday Next series.Okay, so what exactly is this book about? Thursday was badly injured at the end of One of Our Thursdays Is Missing. In this book, she's attempting to recover and has developed an addiction to pain-relief patches. These make her muddled, unable to focus enough to book jump, and slow to react in dangerous situations. SpecOps is rebuilding all the divisions it closed down, and Thursday has been assigned the position of Swindon's head librarian, a position that involves lots of money, military-style security, and regular assassination attempts. Jack Schitt is back, and worse than ever. Someone is making synthetic Thursdays with the ability to download and upload information to and from Thursday. Aornis has gone missing. And Friday has received a Letter of Destiny telling him he's going to murder another teenager who was meant to become a member of the now erased Chrono Guard. Meanwhile, Tuesday is trying to figure out the formula for her Anti-Smite Shield in time for the anticipated smiting in Swindon on Friday. Of course, in usual Jasper Fforde form, these different elements end up tying neatly together for a mostly happy resolution in the end.My favorite part of the book is the Aornis storyline, which reminds me a lot of the Silence storyline in Doctor Who. (This probably isn't just a coincidence, since Doctor Who does get mentioned in the book.) It's very funny seeing the characters encountering Aornis and then immediately forgetting what happened. Thursday even has a tattoo on her hand to remind her of the mindworm, a lot light the marks the Doctor Who characters are meant to make on themselves every time they encounter one of the Silence. I suspect Fforde might want to write an episode of Doctor Who, and if he does, I very much look forward to seeing it. I also like the time twists in Friday's story, which again remind me of Doctor Who. (Actually, even the synthetic Thursdays have a bit of Doctor Who in them, if you consider the episode with the Doctor Who look alike.) And I think anyone who loves libraries might enjoy how kick-ass the librarians in this story are. Oh, and two of the major baddies in the series meet their ends, so that's great, too.This is my least favorite Thursday Next novel, but I do love the series, so it's still great fun. I look forward to reading the next book in the series--Dark Reading Matter--when it finally comes out. I hope I won't have to wait too long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCZPUVEN9ETU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067002502X#wasThisHelpful","RLCZPUVEN9ETU","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These solar fairy string lights are adorable and can be easily used to decorate a porch, a tree, or a garden fence. They're not very bright, but they're certainly bright enough to shine pretty colors at night. We put them along the fence of our little garden on the flashing setting. The tricky part was finding a place in our overgrown garden that gets enough sunlight for the solar panel. The lights go on at sundown or when it gets very cloudy, and they stay on for several hours or until the sun peeks out from behind the clouds.I don't know how long they'll last, but I bought these from Amazon for a little under $13, so I won't mind if they only last a year or two.

"While it sounds like a great idea to harness the power of the sun to charge your smartphone when you're camping or far from civilization for whatever reason, the NOCO XGrid portable solar panel has major two issues that can't be overlooked: first, it takes two days in bright sunlight to charge it enough to fully charge a smartphone once; and second, the instructions are confusing.Plugging it into a wall will let you charge it enough to power a cell phone twice, so that should help you at the start of your camping trip. This portable solar panel can deliver on the promise of five volts, but its charging power is not as strong as regular house or car power. Still, when you know you will be in the middle of nature without electricity for recharging phones or cameras, this kit will be able to help, a little. A power hungry device, like an iPhone 5, can use up two days of solar power in as little as eight hours.I have always wanted to harness the sun heating up my car, to charge batteries when it's parked. So I placed the solar panel on my car dashboard. This way it was in direct sunlight and no one could walk off with it while I was working.There are three parts to the kit: the foldable solar panel, USB cables, and a waterproof rechargeable battery pack with a built-in LED flash light. (The flashlight has several settings: high, low, and flashing, the last of which could be helpful to call for help.) The only instructions are on the packaging, and they aren't clear.  Plugging the three parts together will not start the charging automatically. The battery pack/flashlight needs to be turned on by pressing the power button at the front of it.The battery when fully charged from house power was good for about two recharges of an iPhone 5, which is pretty good. But the dream of using solar energy to power my phone wasn't quite fulfilled. Two days is a long time to have to wait to get a full charge. I'm not sure, but I think the kit might be discharging the battery at night. It's possible there's a way to stop this, but because of the unclear instructions, I wasn't able to figure out how. The company does sell extra panels that velcro together for charging a car battery, so maybe using several panels at once can help charge the batter faster.On the plus side, the solar panel is lightweight, strong and rugged and could sit on top of a backpack. I can definitely see this as being useful during a long hiking trip or even in an emergency when you might have no power for days.For a lower price, this solar-power kit might have a higher rating, but a price this high means higher expectations that this kit doesn't as yet live up to. The company needs to work on both increasing the speed of the solar charge and on creating clear and easy to follow instructions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RM6MDM0Y05QQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XXE4#wasThisHelpful","R1RM6MDM0Y05QQ","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this game after a Facebook friend recommended it, but the anti-semitic undertones--intentional or not--creep me out too much. There's an angelic hero who's Catholic and speaks of ""heavenly visions and a divine mission"" while ""taking up the sword to launch her holy crusade to purge the world of evil."" What evil? How about Dawn Cohen, a villain, who is the ONLY charter with a Jewish last name? Yes, let's go on a holy crusade to purge the world of Cohen!Do you see the problem here?The game isn't designed for storytelling like most good role-playing games. The characters come fully formed, and it's not like you can turn a villain into a good guy or vice versa. You just play the mostly white good guys to defeat the bad guys, including the only character with a Jewish last name.I seriously wish I hadn't spent so much money on a game I find offensive and am embarrassed to have in my collection.ADDED LATER: Some people in the comments below accused me of ""trolling."" The above is a serious review, and everything I wrote is 100% accurate. The quotes are taken directly from the game. I didn't say the anti-semitism was intentional; I said I can't play this game because I'm Jewish and I find the whole idea of playing a Christian character on a ""holy crusade"" that involves battling a Jewish bad guy--who is the only Jewish character in the game--offensive. I wonder if people would accuse me of trolling if I were African American who was offended because the only African-American character in the game was a bad guy. (He isn't.) I doubt it, because I think we all know that would be racist. So I have to wonder why some people think it's okay for one minority to be offended and not another. I'm not a troll. Trolls delight in trolling, and I take no joy in discovering a rather expensive game I bought has content I find offensive. I've only posted this review to warn others who might feel the same way.

"Having read the series all the way up to and including One of Our Thursdays is Missing, I must say this one is my favorite!Yes, Thursday is missing, and it's up to the Book World's version of her to find out what happened.

"We’ve owned quite a few Black and Decker toaster ovens over the years. They’re cheap, and they seem to be designed with planned obsolescence in mind. From experience, I never expect them to last more than five years, seven tops. But we still stick with Black and Decker because they’re cheap, reliable for at least those five years, and they get the job done.Over the years, we've found a few features we've liked a few we didn’t. For example, we prefer the ones that are designed to fit under a kitchen cabinet, and this one isn’t. We also prefer the ones that have a crumb tray that can be easily removed from the outside, and this one has that. Yay! We've also been looking for a toaster oven that browns evenly, and it looks like we’ll have to keep looking. Hmm . . . But this toaster oven is also bigger and it’s a convection toaster oven, which makes it a step up from the ones we've owned before.  It’s not perfect, but for the price, it’s pretty good.PROS• Price is reasonable for a convection toaster oven of this size.• Actual interior size is big enough for a 12” pizza, six slices of bread, or a baking pan up to 11-inches square. It’s also taller than the average toaster oven. It looks big enough for a small or even medium size whole chicken.• It can toast, bake, and broil.• It does indeed seem to cook faster than the other Black and Decker we own, but that’s mostly because the other one doesn't work as well as it should. For example, fries that say on the package that they need to be baked for 15 minutes need 25 minutes in that other toaster. With this one, though, 15 minutes does it.• The handle is far enough away from the toaster for it to remain cool to the touch, a big plus if you've ever burned yourself trying to open a toaster oven.• The instructions on the dials are clearly written out in English and couldn't be easier to understand.• You can remove the crumb tray from the outside, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. Previously we've had crumb trays that drop down or have to be removed from the inside, and cleaning both is difficult and messy. Being able to just pull the crumb tray out from the front is so much easier.• There are three sets of slots for the rack, so you can choose how close or how far from the heat element at the top or the two heat elements at the bottom you’d like it.CONS• The sides and back of the toaster do get rather hot, which means it takes up even more space on the counter than just its already large footprint. If you’re not careful, you’ll very likely melt that plastic drying rack or whatever plastic item you mistakenly place too close to it. You also have to be careful you don’t touch the sides while the toaster is hot.• This toaster doesn't bake evenly. The back corners get more heat and food there is likely to burn before whatever is in the center is done. I found this particularly true with the back left corner.• The hum and clicking of the timer as it counts down the seconds are louder than I’d like.And there you have it. It’s not ideal, but for the price, it’s pretty good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8TK15O4V8IST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HVDQ#wasThisHelpful","R8TK15O4V8IST","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed to upgrade an old (how the heck is three years OLD?!) Acer Aspire laptop with a paltry 250 GB hard drive. This was the perfect replacement hard drive.Writing, illustrating, and indie publishing gobbled up my old hard drive's space until there was barely any room at all left. My research showed that the largest my laptop could take was a 1.5 TB drive, but I'd have to compromise on speed for that. This Western Digital 1 TB drive offers the best speed, which made it the best choice. I had a local computer dealer clone my old hard drive and install the new one. It works great!

My husband installed it on his even older Compaq laptop, upgrading it from an even paltrier 80 GB to 250, so it worked out great for him, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XB43BNHFYXMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D901NX6#wasThisHelpful","R2XB43BNHFYXMA","ATMQEI1LKR6VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATMQEI1LKR6VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I make pendants and hang a charm from each one that has to do with the subject of the pendant....make sense?  Well, it does to me.  This selection of charms is wonderful, I can come up with a charm to fit just about every theme.  There are hearts and birds, teacups and wings, shells and pinecones and teddy bears....and many many more.  They are nicely made with some heft too, not cheap ones where you can see the joinings.  I highly recommend them if you need a wide assortment, and I'll definitely be buying more from them.

"I have end stage cancer.  I know, I don't like it either. Because I do weekly chemo, my activities have gone from working ten hour days to sitting at my kitchen table staring out my window while buying things from Amazon.  Oh, I'm not sad, I'm doing quite well, thank you.  Just tired.  Early this summer, my son's girlfriend put a flower on the outside windowsill which attracted a hummingbird.  I became fascinated watching that little bird drink from the flower.  Life gets smaller when you are sick, but no less interesting. The flower died, and I realized I missed the birds, so I bought this window feeder and stuck it to where the flower had been.  It took about a week, maybe even two, before the hummingbird realized what it was for but now I have at least two (species?) of hummingbirds that sip from this feeder several times a day.  I enjoy having it right on my window so I can get up close and personal with the birds. The birds, however, are not so sure.  They cock their heads and look inside, and unless I'm very still, they fly away.So I'm very still.The feeder does attract hummingbirds and does not seem to attract bugs.  I picked this one because it's cute, and looks nice on the window.  It holds enough to keep my little birds happy for a few days and then it's time to change it anyway. They have shown no interest in the little perch part of it and so flutter in front of it.  It's very easy to clean, just wash it out and roll a paper towel down it.  The brass or copper is discoloring but I haven't really tried to clean it and don't mind.  It has never fallen off.  I'm quite happy with this purchase and may get a couple more to see if I can recreate the scene from the movie The Birds, only with hummingbirds.  Seeing dozens of hummingbirds flapping at my window would be a real treat and I think I should put that on my bucket list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KCT5PUVERG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RQJ9NE#wasThisHelpful","R35KCT5PUVERG1","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21TPY9BVC9IKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When my physical therapist told me to get a pulley system for home use to help me recover from a post-mastectomy Frozen Shoulder, I browsed online for the cheapest one.  As soon as I saw the Duro-Med set though, I became completely captivated by the 1970s photo on the box. Why would they use a clearly outdated photo like that?  Is that somebody's mom?  Sister?  Did they dig it out of the family photo album and put it on the pulley box?  Has the company been in business for 40 years and they never changed their packaging?  And, check out her arms - they are Michelle Obama arms. Toned, fit, in direct contrast to the dated dress and hairstyle.Of course I had to buy it, who wouldn't?  It arrived a couple of days later. It was very easy to install and I put it over the bathroom door and began my home-based physical therapy.  I guess I don't know what to say except that it works as designed.  It was easy for a one-armed woman to use and that's what it needs to be, and hopefully, someday I'll have the use of two arms again thanks to this device.  I'll never mimic that hairstyle though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2FQG7I1PBV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001X22Z2#wasThisHelpful","R1A2FQG7I1PBV4","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21TPY9BVC9IKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, it didn't take long. Less than six months after I bought the iPad, it's obsolete, with the iPad 2 about to hit the stores.  I can't afford another $500.00 for just a smaller form factor, cameras and GPS (especially since I have an iPhone) so I'm keeping it until Gen 3 comes out. To keep people from seeing that I'm stuck in the dark ages - I'm vain that way -  I decided to find a folio-type cover.I purchased the Acase Premium for $10.00, not expecting much.  But, it's very, very nice for the pricepoint.  It is quite secure, with tight elastic for the left side of the device and a slide-in pocket for the right.  It closes over the screen and latches tightly, but you can also fold it to the back and latch it so you can use the screen.  I don't know if it's really leather or not, but it feels like leather.  It doesn't have any kind of chemical smell or anything like that.  The inside seems to be suede.  It definitely provides excellent protection for the tablet, and now it's easy to slip into my purse, which I never did when it was just in a skin.  I find I'm taking it a lot more places thanks to this case.I haven't had it very long so I can't speak to how long it will last but for the price, you can't beat it.  It's a great way to both hide, and protect, your outdated iPad.  With this case, it might last until Gen10.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4FE3V7QE520/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003P7VU40#wasThisHelpful","R1H4FE3V7QE520","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21TPY9BVC9IKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old:  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.  This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it won't happen to you?It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.)  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macramé.Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZUKK59OKPCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014CN8Y8#wasThisHelpful","RPZUKK59OKPCG","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21TPY9BVC9IKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love clothes.  But, I live in an older house and I have to share a closet with my husband.  We have done the best we can with a closet system but it's still not enough for a fashionista like me, and I was about to make him put his clothes in the backyard shed.  Hey, it's California, it doesn't get that cold.  I have more than 25 pairs of work/dress pants, and only a 1 1/2 foot space to put them in.  I've been going crazy jamming stuff into that tiny space - putting two or three pants on the same hanger.  Everything wrinkles and I can't see what's in there.I bought five of these skirt/pant hangers and am amazed at how much room I saved.  I have 20 pants hanging up and there is room for a couple more of these.  I think I can get everything hung up now, without having to worry about wrinkles or not finding anything.  I really love them.I would love to add more for my blouses and skirts but the area I have for those is shorter, and I think I could only get two things on. I don't want to spend 10 bucks and only use half the hanger.  It would be nice if these came in different tiers for different spaces.If you are looking to save space in your closet and keep your husband from having to get dressed in the back yard - this is definitely the product for you.Tip:  You can alternate putting pants on one side, and then the other, by twisting the clip.  This makes them even out in the closet, and then you can easily grab them.  Another thing I did was hang some by the bottom and some by the waistband. Another way of maximizing space.  It's helpful to put them together by color and style so you can grab what you want when you need it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYEZPQ8N4VBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015GKKZI#wasThisHelpful","R1GYEZPQ8N4VBE","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21TPY9BVC9IKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been unfortunate enough to need several surgeries the past year, thank you cancer. (I'm fine, thanks for asking.)  The hardest part of any surgery is getting to sleep afterwards.  When your body is cut up and muscles not functioning, getting in and out of bed can be painful, difficult or plain impossible. Afer using bed pillows to try and prop myself into the positions I need to be, I finally bought this pillow.  It's perfect.  It's soft enough to cradle your hurting body, but firm enough to put you in a position where you can get up and out of bed. The bend in it is very gentle, not the strong curve as in the picture.  But, the small curve does seem to help keep you in position.  I also love that it can be used after you recover for sitting on the couch reading or watching TV.  It won't gather dust under the bed.  Just turn it around and you have nice support.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the flimsy cover that comes with it.  It's not a pillow where you can easily find a case to go on it and that scratchy, cheap cover isn't soft enough.  One other thing - I'm a very small, only 100 pounds.  This fits me perfectly so I wonder if it would be as comfortable if you are a bigger person.  My arms can stay inside it but maybe that isn't necessary?  I leave it for you to decde.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CY8D4LN00UCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00064S4DK#wasThisHelpful","R3CY8D4LN00UCD","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21TPY9BVC9IKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm cursed.  I'm a night person in a day person world.  When I was younger, I could work swing shift and keep my natural hours, but after I had kids, that was no longer possible.  Not only that, but I chose a job working in a school, and I have to be bright and cheerful and ready to work at the ungodly hour of 7:00 a.m. when all reasonable people are just getting to bed.One of the hardest parts about being a night person is the actual getting up in the morning. Alarm clocks are jarring, heart-attack inducing inventions. I am an expert at hitting the snooze button, to the point that I still need my husband to actually wake me up.  When I got my iPhone, that became my alarm but still, it has a snooze function and I would still sleep an extra hour if left to my own devices.For a couple of years I've been looking at this alarm clock.  Will it magically turn me into a day person?  Will it even wake me up?  Will it be a big waste of money?  I finally broke down and bought one, and I'm very glad I did.This is a very pleasant waking experience.  The gradual light does make it feel like dawn is breaking.  I don't always wake to the light alone, but I do sometimes.  It's nice to snuggle back while the light gets brighter and brighter.  I chose the birds to wake me up and they do, in a gentle manner.  The snooze button is easy to hit, with the clever design that sticks right out.  But the best part of that is it only turns off the sounds, not the light.  So, when formerly I would hit the snooze button and go fully back into my dark, cozy dream-world, now the light stays on and I don't go back into such a deep sleep.  The next time my birds start to sing it's a lot easier to get up.  I rarely have to hit snooze more than 3 times, a far cry from 10 or 15.I found set-up a breeze and the instructions simple to follow.  It also works very well as a side lamp for reading and it's nice that you can dim it so as to not bother your partner.I've had this light for several months now and my mornings, while still difficult, are a lot easier on me.  Hearing an alarm is not something I dread anymore.  No, I'm not a morning person and I guess I never will be.  But, mornings are a lot less painful with this method of awakening.  It is a pricey alarm but worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R398764MTORY5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XN4RIC#wasThisHelpful","R398764MTORY5R","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21TPY9BVC9IKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This light is pretty good, but I really wish the beam would focus down tighter. At 100 yard the beam is around 50 feet wide. This light is just about the same thing as the Mini Cree zoomable led flashlight, only a little brighter and a lot bigger.I have uploaded three pictures to compare. In the first picture you will see three lights. The round light on the left is Stanley LEDLIS 10W Lithium Ion LED Rechargeable Spotlight. The middle light is the SecurityIng® High Power, and the one on the right is the mini cree. The lights are aimed at a field at about 100 yards. As you can see the Stanely 10w spotlight is illuminating all the way to the back of the field which is about 200 yards. In the second picture, I aimed the Stanely 10W spotlight a tree that is 220 yards away. You can make the tree out. In the third picture, I aimed the SecurityIng® High Power at the same spot and you cannot see the tree.This light would be great if it would zoom in narrower, but it is still a pretty good light.  My biggest complaint is the five mode function.  Each time you turn it off, it goes to the next mode when you turn it back on.  I have many other 3 and 5 mode led lights.  Most of them reset to brightest each time you turn them on and then you can half press the button to change the mode.  Others remember the the mode the light was in when it was turned off and and that is the mode they are in when you turn them back on.  On this light though, the mode changes each time you turn it on and that can be a little inconvenient if you are using it for some purposes like hunting. I think I will try to go in an bypass the circuitry to see if I can make it a single mode light that comes on at max power each time.Here are product links to the two other lights used in the test.http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-LEDLIS-Lithium-Rechargeable-Spotlight/dp/B00AHJZBCG/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1417704958&sr=1-1&keywords=stanley+10whttp://www.amazon.com/Flashlight-Torch-Adjustable-Focus-Light/dp/B006E0QAFY/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1417704990&sr=1-1&keywords=mini+cree","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IRAKTLZMVCHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9RGEW8#wasThisHelpful","R3IRAKTLZMVCHS","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This would be a five star deal if the laser was stable.  I bought this to use on my new Savage Axis 2 XP .223 rifle for varmint hunting.  When I got it out and first installed it, I was very please.  I have my gun sighted in at 200 yards and it was easy to adjust the laser to match the cross hairs.  I thought all was well until I got my gun out to go hunt tonight and looked through the scope and turned the laser on. It was about two feet off.  Had I not checked it before using it, I would have missed everything I tried to shoot at.  I got the Allen wrench to readjust it and did so, but while adjusting it, I noticed that any pressure I applied to the front part of the laser caused the laser to move radically. After zeroing it back in, I reached up and ever so lightly touched the front edge of the laser body and it knocked the laser off about a foot. I did the same to the opposite side and it moved back.  The laser is securely mounted and does not move.  It is the front part of the laser housing that moves.The bottom line is this laser is not stable at all and cannot be trusted. The slightest bump or touch will knock it way off. For a laser that is designed to be a targeting device this instability is inexcusable.

"This is a really good book if you want to learn about the heresies of the Faith Movement and learn about all the blasphemous, stupid and absurd things that men like Kenneth Copland and Benny Hinn have said over the years.  The reason I gave it only three stars is because of a couple things.  While I agree with everything of what Mr. Hanegraaff said about the faith movement and it's ties to the cult and occult, I found the book painfully redundant.  Just about everything about the faith movement is covered quite thoroughly in the first few chapters.  The rest is just an exercise in redundancy for the most part.The one thing that really concerns me is the very last section of this book titled, ""The Three Universal Creeds"".  In this section Mr. Hanegraaff quotes, ""The Apostles' Creed"", ""The Nicene Creed"" and ""The Creed of Athanasius"".  There are several reasons that I find Mr. Hanegraaff committed a great error in ending his book with these creeds.1. When you are making an intellectual argument against something you claim is false, you must closely examine yourself to make sure that while you are pointing a finger at someone else, you are not pointing three fingers at yourself.  While Mr. Hanegraaaff, makes some good arguments against the teachers of the faith movement, if he himself is guilty of the same kind of ideology, everything he said is called into question.  By quoting these three Catholic Creeds as his closing statement, Mr. Hanegraaaff solidly aligns himself with the Catholic church, which is guilty of almost every single one of the anti-Christ, anti-God heresies that Mr. Hanegraaaff condemns the faith movement teachers of making.  The Catholic church's whole foundation is based on the concept that there are men mere men who are ""God's mouth piece on earth"" (i.e. the pope).  The Catholic church historically is the worst distorter of the clear teaching of Holy scriptures and has taught many outrageous heresies over the centuries, and continues to do so today. It would take a book much larger then ""Christianity in Crisis"" to even scratch the surface of the spiritual crimes and scriptural heresies committed by the Catholic church over the last fifteen hundred years, but in the end you would find that the Catholic Church is the largest cultic organization on earth.  By quoting these Catholic Creeds Mr. Hanegraaaff is essentially using the statements of one cultic religious group to discredit the statements of another cultic religious group, and in doing so, he commits intellectual suicide and discredits himself as an unbiased judge.2. When making an intellectual argument, your closing statements are the most important part of your argument.  It is in your closing statements that you want to present your most solid evidence for your case.  While the Catholic creeds that Mr. Hanegraaaff quotes in his closing statements, do contain some truths derived from the Holy Scriptures, they are not in fact ""The Inspired Word of God"".  These creeds are not found anywhere in the Bible.  In using them as his closing statement, Mr. Hanegraaaff is exalting these creeds as the definitive authority on the subject of God and Truth.  Essentially, Mr. Hanegraaaff, is saying, ""These are the most authoritative things that I believe and why you should believe what I am saying.""  In doing so, Mr. Hanegraaaff, exalts these creeds even above the very scriptures themselves. Why?  Because, I am sure that, Mr. Hanegraaaff, knows hundreds, if not thousands, of passages from God's Holy Word, that he could have used as his closing statements, but he chose to use these creeds, because he considers them to be of more authority and the decisive word on the subject. In doing so, he also commits the same crime that he accuses the faith teachers of.  The faith teachers exalt themselves as the anointed and then claim that they receive ""Special Revelation"" that they then use as the authority on the subject of truth instead of the clear teachings of God's Word.  The Catholic church is guilty a thousand times over of committing this same exact crime, and by using their creeds in his final statements, Mr. Hanegraaaff has committed the same crime he accuses the faith teachers of.3. In a few places throughout the book, Mr. Hanegraaaff, refers to historically accepted Christian truths or traditions as an authoritative counter argument to what the faith teachers are teaching.  While this is not as much of a case of intellectual suicide (when it comes to his case against the faith teachers) as aligning himself with the Catholic church, it never the less is a huge hole in his over all case against the faith teachers.  Why?  Because one day in the future, what the faith teachers are teaching today will be considered, ""Historic"".  And, since what they teach is accepted and followed by million of people claiming to be Christians, including the most major and influential ""Christian"" figures of this day, these faith movement teachings could also be qualified as ""Christian truths and traditions"".  Imagine if you will, that at some point in the future another person like, Mr. Hanegraaaff, were to try to discredit a false teaching of that day by using as his source of authority, the accepted Christian Truths and Traditions of this era as taught by the faith movement teachers.  How much authority should that generation grant to that argument.  I propose, NONE.  So when, Mr. Hanegraaaff, uses as a point of authority what was historically accepted as Christian truths or traditions, he is relying, once again on man's opinion for the bases of his argument, and not the clear teachings of the Word of God.  This opens him and his whole case up for attack.Now I want to make it clear here, that there is much to be learned from this book as a whole, and I am not trying to discourage anyone from reading it.  Mr. Hanegraaaff, does present some very good, Bible based, solid arguments against the teaching of the faith movement.  His section on, ""Apologetics: The Defense of the Faith"", is very good and I highly recommend that that section should be learned by heart by every person who calls themselves a Christian.  I believe that, Mr. Hanegraaaff, was very sincere in his writing of this book, and that he desperately wants to free people from the deceptive teachings of the faith movement teachers and I applaud him for this effort.  My concern is that, Mr. Hanegraaaff, is blind to the hypocrisy of his own beliefs, especially when it comes to aligning himself with the Catholic church, which is guilty a thousand times over of the same heresies as the faith teachers he so vehemently attacks in this book.  I know this book was written a long time ago and my hope is that, since then, he has disaligned himself from the Catholic church, and now relies solely on the clear teaching of the Word of God for the bases of his arguments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GYTKDXPVCFRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0890819769#wasThisHelpful","R3GYTKDXPVCFRS","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought 3 of these to upgrade some old systems.  I put one in a Fujitsu laptop and the other two in two custom built Desktops. On the laptop I am running Windows Vista Business. On one desktop I am running Ubuntu Linux 14.04 and on the other I running Windows 7 Home premium. On all three systems there has been significant performance gains vs my old disk drives.  Start up time on my Win 7 desktop has been reduced from 2 Minutes to 32  seconds.  Applications open and run incredibly fast.  My overall system performance is smoother and faster on all systems.Now, I am seeing a lot of 1 star reviews here lately and all of them are centered on Firmware version 5.0.6, which supposedly has reduced the read and write performance of the drive from 450 Mbs to 170Mbps.  I have checked the drives I bought and they are all Firmware version 5.0.6.So what does this mean.  Well, I am not going to argue about the read write speeds and whether they have been reduced by the firmware update.  I am just telling what the real world results have been with my three systems.  The truth is, these people that are complaining are talking about maximum capabilities and very few people will ever push their computer hardware to their maximum capacity.  Another truth is that a computer is only as fast as it's slowest component.  So even if you had a hard drive that could read and write at 1TBps but your motherboard bus speed was a maximum of 200 Mbps, the fastest speed you would get out of the drive is 200Mbps.  The overwhelming majority of computers that consumers are using have cheaper motherboards with slower bus speeds.  There are motherboards with super fast speeds that cost more by themselves then what most people pay for their complete computer system, including monitor, keyboard and mouse.My point is this.  This drive is one of the lowest cost drives on the market. Other drive of the same size cost two to three times as much.  If you have the money to spend and want to pay more, go right ahead, but depending on your other system components, you may not see any better performance over this drive.  All I know is that this drive with firmware 5.0.6 drastically improved the performance of all three systems I put it in and I would not hesitate to buy it again if I needed to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N7T570WRLOUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A1ZTZOG#wasThisHelpful","R1N7T570WRLOUV","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE: 10/06/2014Well after writing my original review, I bought one of these for myself and after using this phone for several months, I stand by everything I said in my original review, however, there are a couple things I would like to add.  I have actually stopped using the Terrain myself and switch back to my old S2 Skyrocket.  I really like the phone itself and it bothers me that I had to switch back.  The main reason I had to switch back has nothing to do with the phone itself, but has to do with the people who design the android apps.  I am a heavy business user that depends on several business related apps every day to do business.  Several of my business related apps do not function properly on the Terrain because they are designed exclusively for larger screened smartphone and/or are incompatible with candy bar style smartphones.  In a world where there still exist millions of candybar style smart phone like Blackberrys, I find it almost inconceivable and totally inexcusable that serious business oriented app designers would design an app that would only work on smartphone with huge touchscreens.  But alas, that is the irresponsible tech world we live in.  Because of this, I found myself having to carry my old S2 Skyrocket around with me so I could use it to run the apps I needed that were incompatible with the Terrain and it just made no sense, so I was forced to switch back, even though I liked the terrain much better.The second thing is that I require quite a few apps for many purposes (i.e. camscanner, acar, aquamail, etc, etc).  Even though this phone has the same amount of ram as my old S2 Skyrocket, I ran out of ram app space before I got all my apps installed that I need, and this is after disabling all other non essential apps like facebook and all the at&t crapware. I never ran into this bottle nrck no matter how many apps I installed on my s2 skyrocket (that has the same amount of ram), so I am not sure who is at fault here. Is it a phone design problem, an Android problem or something else.Regardless, I still like the phone and will continue to use it on days when I require a rugged waterproof phone.  It take pretty good pictures and videos and the battery life is much better then my Skyrocket.  The battery charges very fast too.  If they were charging 200 or 300 hundred for this phone I would reduce ny rating down to a 4 start, but at $85, it is well worth 5 stars.Original Review:Bought this for my son who destroyed his Galaxy S3 in less then three months. He has only had it a few days, but he already loves it. I think I will buy one for me for when my Samsung Galaxy bites the dust.Don't let the price fool you. This is a great phone with good specs. In fact, you will be hard pressed to find a ruggedized smartphone with these kinds of specs at any price. It has a dual core 1.5 Ghz processor, 8GB of internal memory (expandable to 32GB with MicroSD), 2G, 3G, 4G and LTE capability, Corning Gorilla Glass 2, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS radio, Accelerometer, proximity and compass sensors, and even a FM radio antenna for crying out loud. It has military grade water, dust and shock resistance. It has rear and front facing cameras. And the list goes on.Honestly, this phone should be priced in the $400 to $500 dollar range. The reason it is not, is only because the NEC company drop it's phone lines and does not offer support for them anymore. So what does this mean? Well, all that it means is that NEC will not be releasing any updates for the operating system on the phone. The phone comes with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) which a very good version of android and should be good for as long as you will own the phone. Besides this, Android is an open source operating system and there are many people in the android community writing custom android operating systems (roms) for phones. For example, I am currently running android Kitkat on my old Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, but neither Samsung nor AT&T have released this upgrade for this old model phone. The android community made this ROM for my model of phone and it works great, actually it is much better then the ROMs from the manufacturers because it's not full of bloatware (useless programs manufactures and phone service providers stick in the operating system that you can't get rid of and that hog system resources).The bottom line is this. This phone is priced at $85 bucks and that is highway robbery for a phone with these specs. The one thing you need to know is that this phone is a WORK phone and is not intended to be used as a toy.There are some reviews that complain about how small the screen is. REALLY!! It's like these people cannot read or something! They order a candy bar style phone with a real keyboard and they expect to get a full size 5"" screen like what comes on an S5 or something. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! How can they complain about the size of the screen when they knew that it was a small screen when they ordered the dang phone. That's like buying a red car and then complaining that the car is red. Are they being serious?I have not found any reviews that have any serious complaints about the actual functionality of this phone, and that is all that matters. Yes, there are always going to be some glitches with the android ROM or app incompatibility. But these kinds of glitches and complaints are present even in the newest of phones on the market. It is just part of a fast moving, ever evolving, technology market that never stays in one place long enough to work all the kinks out.PROS:1. Unbelievable price!2. Incredible specs for a ruggedized smartphone.3. Military grade water, dust and shock proofing.CONS:1. Manufacturer has discontinued support.Bottom Line:If you need a great rugged, waterproof, dust proof and shock proof, smartphone with LTE connectivity, your search is over. Don't worry about the lack of manufacturer support because, if this thing works out of the box, you should never need any support. At a price that is one fifth of any other ruggedized smartphone with these specs, you can afford to buy several, just in case you drive over your first one with a bulldozer and manage to break it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8CMWU4V0A92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZPI04S#wasThisHelpful","R2V8CMWU4V0A92","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The battery life is better then I ever had with my S2 and my Skyrocket. I have been able to use the phone for everything I used my Galaxy's for; scan receipts with Camscanner, track vehicle expenses with Acar app, use as a navigation device with Google maps, track vehicle engine data Torque via a bluetooth OBD2 scanner, do emailing on my 6 email accounts with Aquamail and much much more.  I do miss the larger screen on my Skyrocket, but I do not miss all the headaches with sluggish performance, freezes and glitchy hardware I had with both my Galaxy's.

"Every American Christian should read this book and take what it says to heart.  Unlike a lot of modern theological books that are written by people sitting in air conditioned offices that have never paid a price for their belief in Jesus, this book was written by a man that eventually and voluntarily gave up his life for the cause of Christ.  As a person, who myself has faced persecution and arrest in anti-christ countries as a missionary, I can attest to the validity of the core message of this book.The idea that God loves you too much to let you suffer, is about the most blasphemous and false doctrine to ever permeate the Christian church. It is especially rampant in the United States of America where preachers preach the false doctrine of self gratification, self indulgent Christianity where God is reduced to genie in a bottle that you can rub with the write words (faith formulas) and get anything you want.  Where salvation and lavish prosperity is taught as a birthright because you were lucky enough to be born in the the country of America, and because of this God loves you more then any other race in the world and would never consider letting you suffer even the slightest bit.The Cost of Discipleship will open your eyes to the truth about what is necessary to truly follow the ""real"" God of the Bible.  An omniscient, omnipotent creator who deserves to be worshiped and served.  A God who deserves to be followed by His creation that loves Him above all else and trust Him and respects His decrees more then their own opinions, culture or traditions.  A God who requires His followers to honor Him as King in their lives and to be patriotic to His kingdom more then their own countries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3EWFR37KJ0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684815001#wasThisHelpful","RD3EWFR37KJ0I","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good fan and cooler.  I bought two of these and used them on AMD CPUs (it can be used for an Intel CPU as well). The reason I cannot give it five stars is because it is a lot more difficult to put together then any other Fan/Heatsink I have ever used.  The instructions are not clear on how you are supposed to do it and once you figure it out, you find out that one of the screws that is needed to attach one of the feet is almost impossible to get in because is sits directly under the fan and there is no way to get a screwdriver on it without taking the fan and fan housing off.  I was able to get the screw in without taking the fan off with a pair of needle nosed pliers, but it was very difficult and took a lot of patience.The other reason I cannot give this five stars is because on both of my motherboards it blocked one of my ram ports making it unusable. This thing is huge and requires a lot of room.Aside from the above problems, I have no doubt that it will keep my cpu cool.  It is well built and very low priced for what you get.PROS:1. Low cost.2.

"These are great little cheap surveillance cameras.  I bought two of them to install in my parents house to monitor it remotely while they are on a two month long vacation to Canada.  There have been a lot of break-ins in their neighborhood.  I chose this model because it has alarm inputs that allow me to wire door sensors to the camera that will take pictures of anyone opening the front or back doors of the house and send me alerts via email when the doors are opened.  This method is way more reliable then using motion detection, which results in false alarms and failed detection.  So far they have worked flawlessly since I installed them.I use the IP Cam Remote app on my android phone to remotely access the cameras and control them.  For the price that I paid ($43) these things are 5 star.  They function well and come with their own DDNS (dedicated internet address you can use for remote access).  The video quality is about the only area that could be complained about, but this no different then any other budget security cam.  I have paid as much as twice as much for other cameras that video quality that is just as bad.  Honestly video quality in security cameras is a rarity.  Just think of all the video you have seen on the news from store video cams of robberies.  Have you ever seen one that was clear and easy to identify the perp?  See what I mean?  And those are commercial grade cameras!  There are cameras you can buy that will give you better video quality, but they are not cheap.  The video quality of this camera is good enough for most security proposes and for the price, they cannot be beat.  NOTE: The lens can be manually focused to improve video clarity by rotating the black ring around the lens.One thing that I have to mention hear is that, to my surprise, this camera came with the special connector that goes to the alarm input panel.  I have bought other cameras with alarm inputs that did not include the connector and had to buy them extra.  Let me tell you, those little buggers are hard to find.  The last time I had to order them from England because that was the only place I could find some for sale.PROS:1. Low Price2. Has Alarm Inputs and comes with the special plug connector.3. Includes dedicated DDNS for remote access (so you don't have to set this up through another provider).4. Focusable lens (manual)CONS:1. Low but average video quality for cameras in this price range.Bottom Line:For a $43 remotely accessible security camera with night vision and alarm inputs, it is really hard to find anything to complain about.  For anyone needing cheap home security and remote monitoring these things are the way to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HY63ZWWDNL9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JLPWAK#wasThisHelpful","R2HY63ZWWDNL9U","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I monitor my grandparents (elderly, home bound) and parents house (travel and are away from home a lot).  I am using these in combination with security cameras to monitor traffic that go in and out of doors.  My cameras are set to take pictures each time a door is opened and these things have worked flawlessly.  Of course you need a security camera that has alarm inputs (not many have them) for this to work.  Using these door sensors is way more reliable then using the motion detection feature of the security camera. With these, there is never a false alarms or missed events like I use to get when I was using motion detection.  The cameras take the pictures and email them to me and I get them on my smartphone in just a few seconds no matter where I am.  If I get a picture of an unauthorized person going in their houses I can access the camera remotely and monitor their activities and if they are up to no good, I can alert the police and provide them photos if they don't get their in time.This summer I was stuck in downtown traffic in Houston Texas, when I got a Front Door alarm email from my Grandparents house in Lubbock Texas 500 miles away.  The picture was of a man I did not recognize, so I remotely access the camera to see what was going on.  The young man was standing in the front door way talking a miles an hour to my grandfather who has dementia.  I immediately called their house and got my grandmother and asked her who the man was and what he wanted.  She said he was a salesman trying to sale them a home security system.  She then walked over to him and said to the man, ""We don't need anything you are selling"".  She then told them man to look up at the camera and said, ""My grandson is watching you right now and is on the phone asking who you are and he has pictures of you.""  I watched the whole thing and it was so funny.  The poor security alarm salesman just hung his head and walked away.

"I guess if I were to talk about just the housing base, I would have to give this maybe a three star.  The housing base is okay, but very unstable.  Even with everything tightened up it is still floppy and will shake in the wind.  But the housing is not the worst thing about this unit, that prize goes to the lens cover.The lens cover on this makes it completely worthless.  It distorts the image and invert the colors.  Everyone knows that security cams don't have the best image to begin with, and this thing makes them 3 times worse.  During the day time the colors are inverted and the image kind of looks like looking at an old color negative film slide, a slightly out of focus one at that.  If that were all it did, I would say okay, it might still be usable, but that is not all. Keep reading.This lens cover destroys any night vision use of the camera.  At night when the Infrared lights on the camera turn on to give you night vision, the IR light reflects off the lens cover and turns everything white.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to see anything at night.  It is like looking at a bright flashlight that is being shined into the camera lens.The bottom line is that lens cover on this thing is made out of the wrong material.  I have other outdoor cameras with similar looking lens covers and they don't have these problems.  The colors on my other outdoor cameras look natural and they do not reflect IR light.  The manufacturer of this unit needs to do some research on what type of lens material to make their lens covers out of.  They need to find a material that does not invert the colors and that allows IR light to pass through it without filtering it or reflecting it.PROS:Low CostAllows most indoor cameras to be used outdoorsCONS:Unstable constructionLens cover distorts images and inverts colors.Not usable at night because lens cover reflects IR light into the camera lens.Final thought.  This is a great idea that needs some more development, at least by this manufacturer.  As it is, this unit is not ready for sale to the public.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9G2UX846Q3CC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XU7OL0#wasThisHelpful","R9G2UX846Q3CC","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update: Warning! Dangerous! Burn risk!Well, my first unit died.  Actually it almost burned up while on my ear.  I had just finished a call and left it on my ear when all the sudden I felt pain in my ear and ripped the thing off.  It was extremely hot and even though I switched the power button to off, it continued to heat up to the point of melting and eventually died when the battery ran out.  I had all kinds of problems with my first unit from day one, and I have a friend that also says he has all the same problems.  After it died, I called into Plantronics and they were very helpful.  They were very concerned that it almost burned me and had me send my unit to a special technician to have the unit dissembled and investigated to see what caused it to heat up.  They were very eager to replace the unit. I honestly did not want another legend and requested another model.  They offered me the new Edge, but since it does not have an ear loop like the Voyager models, I did not want it.  So I had to take another Legend.  Well, my new Legend has all the same problems as my first one and more.  I absolutely hate it.  I really can't understand why so many people give this model high reviews, nobody that I know that has used one likes it.UPDATE:I am beginning to hate this thing.  4 out 5 of people complain about the the sound quality of my voice when holding a conversation.  In most cases I have to switch to the handset to continue talking with them.  I thought it might be a bad mic in my unit, but I talked with a friend that has the same model and he said he has the same problem.UPDATE:In my original review, I had not had this unit long enough to comment on it's features.  Again I want to state here that I am a long time Voyager user that has used 4 different models of the Voyager Pro line.  My last voyager before this one was the Voyager Pro HD.Now that I have had this unit for a month, I can better comment on it's features and compare them to the Voyager Pro HD that it replaced (my wife washed it). There are several things that I will have to say that are improved in the Legend over the Pro HD.  The ear sensors that automatically switch from the phone to the ear piece are much better on the Legend then on the Pro HD. The sensors on the Pro HD only worked every now and then, but the sensors on the Legend have worked every time I have tried it.Another feature that I have found to be better is voice command and recognition.  I absolutely could never use my Pro HD for any kind of voice command or voice to text (v2T) function in anything less then a perfectly quite environment. Using it while driving was impossible. But I am able to use my Legend while driving and in a room where other people are talking, and I would have to say that it is surprisingly accurate in noisy situations, but of course it is not perfect.  Battery life has been exceptional for me as well. All of my Voyagers have had great battery life but I feel I am getting even more out of this Legend.The one thing that is not better and is actually worst in the Legend vs the Pro HD is the bluetooth connection strength. The distance that I can walk away from my phone before the reception starts to degrade is about half the distance of what it was with my Pro HD.  About 10 feet is all the range I can get out of this Legend, where as I could get 20 to 30 feet away from Pro HD before the reception started to degrade.This unit does have a little better noise cancellation then the Pro HD, but noise cancellation in of itself creates other problems.  Noise cancellation is the process of filtering out the ambient sound from the audio stream that is going into the mics.  Plantronics accomplishes this through dual mics, one to hear what's coming out of your mouth and one to monitor the ambient sounds in the room.  The built in software tries to filter out the ambient sound that it is receiving from the second mic, but in doing so it also filters out any audio tones from your voice that are in the same range as the audio tones in the ambient sound.  The result of this filtering is that the outputted audio (what the person on the other end of the line hears) is muffled and lower in volume.  This is one of the reasons that there are several reviews about sound quality issues with this unit.  But this problem is not unique to the Legend, it effects all bluetooth units with noise cancellation technology across the board, with maybe the exception of Jawbone devices, which does not use speakers, but instead uses vibration sensing technology to convert the vibrations it feels in your jaw into sound.The two main drawback of this device is the proprietary charging cable and the volume control which does not work with my Galaxy Skyrocket (read my original review for details).PROS (over the Voyager Pro HD)1. Better ear sensors2. Improved voice command and V2T function.3. Improved Voice Cancellation.4. Improved Battery life.CONS1. Shorter bluetooth reception range.2. Rare Proprietary charging cable that is difficult to find and expensive to replace.3. Volume control that will not work unless in an active call.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is my 4th Plantronics Voyager headset in 6 years.  I really like the Voyager line and have been relatively pleased with their quality and durability.  I am hard on my headsets and these things stand up to my abuse.  I normally only have to replace them when I lose them, which coincidentally, is why I bought this new Legend.I have only been using this new Legend for a day so I can't really comment on it's features yet, but so far it has been about on par with my last Voyager headset, the HD Pro.  I am only writing this review now, because there is one thing right out of the box that is a glaring defect of this unit over the other models I have owned.  This unit does not use the standard micro USB charging standard that my last three Voyager units did.  Honestly, this came as a huge surprise to me because I saw this mentioned no where in the description when I bought it.  I would have certainly never bought this Legend had I known that it came with a unique custom charging cable.  I really have a hard time believing the stupidity of Plantronics in deciding to go with a custom proprietary charging cable when the rest of the electronics industry, even the old hold out Apple, are all going with the micro usb standard for charging small electronics. Just when you think the environmentally unfriendly idiocy of old was gone, when every electronic gadget had it's own proprietary charger and you had to carry an extra bag along with you on trips just to house all your chargers; Plantronics starts playing that old game again. Who cares if it creates more toxic landfill waste and customers have to carry a bag full of different cables, when a single cable would do. Right?Again I want to make it extremely clear that this headset has a custom ""PROPRIETARY"" charging cable.  You will not find this cable in most stores.  It is very unique, and if you lose the cable or need and extra, you will have to order it online.  You have been warned.The only other thing that I have found so far about the Legend that I consider a con is that the volume control on the headset does not work in conjunction with my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket.  The headset controls will not increase the volume of the headset and the phone volume controls have no effect on the headset either.  The only way I have found to get the headset volume controls to work is to wake the phone up and try to adjust the volume, and while the volume bar is active on the phone, then and only then can I adjust the volume by using the headset controls.I will probably return this Legend and buy another HD Pro.  If I don't, I may update this review later on.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38SMV7Y4F157X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092KJ9BU#wasThisHelpful","R38SMV7Y4F157X","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The bottom line here is that this is the best deal on large cell bubble wrap anywhere.  I have looked and looked for a better deal and you just can't find a lower price on large cell bubble wrap then this.  The problem is that you never know what quality of bubble wrap you are going to get when you order here.  I have ordered from here three times and each time I got a different quality of bubble wrap, it also came in a different format each time.  Some came in a huge roll and others came in cardboard box.  The first batch I ordered was decent quality.  The second batch I ordered was really bad; the bubbles were not fully inflated and 25% of the bubbles were flat.  The third batch I ordered was the best (it came in the cardboard box).  The bubbles in the third batch were so full they were hard, like a balloon that is on the verge of bursting.If I ever need large cell bubble wrap I will order here and pray I get the good stuff.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVGXVYOGW2RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PL7STY#wasThisHelpful","R1DVGXVYOGW2RN","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for the Roku 3500R HDMI Streaming Stick.When I received the device it would not work with none of my TVs when plugged into the HDMI ports.  When I contacted Roku support about they immediately said that they would send me an HDMI extender that would fix the problem.  I asked them why they were so sure a simple extension cord would fix the problem and they said that there was a known defect with the HDMI connection on the 3500R being too short and not making contact with most TVs.  It took a few days for the part to get to me and it did fix the problem, but just barely.  You have to hold your tongue just right for the 3500R to make a connection, even with the extender, and if it gets moved even the slightest, it loses connection.Once I got it to work, I thought my problems were over.  I thought wrong.  The device gets extremely hot and freezes up and has to be unplugged to unfreeze it.  After a long troubleshooting session and Roku support, it was finally revealed that the Roku 3500R is an HD content ONLY device that requires a minimum of a 3.5 Mbps internet connection to work.  Roku recommends at least a 5 Mbps connection for best performance.  Of course this is stated nowhere in the documentation or on the Amazon.com ad page.  The bottom line is that people who have a basic cable or DSL internet connection cannot use the 3500R.  I have a good solid 3 Mbps connection and I cannot use the 3500R with my connection according Roku tech support.  Roku support emphatically stated that the 3500R will only stream HD content.  I was very surprised to find out about this limitation. Most other internet streaming devices I have used had smart bandwidth sensing technology and would adjust the quality of the video stream according to the speed of the bandwidth connection.  Roku support suggested that the solution to the problem I was having with their device was for me to spend another $30 a month to increase my bandwidth to make it compatible with their device.  I AM NOT KIDDING! I asked them if Roku thought it wise to make an internet streaming device that would only be usable by a small fraction of internet users.  They had no comment.  I asked them why this LIMITATION was not mentioned anywhere in the documentation or in the advertised specs?  Their response was that; ""The 3500R is a beta product and they were still working all the bugs out.""  These are Roku's words, not mine.THE ROKU 3500R IS A BETA PRODUCT WITH BUGS!  Wow!  Glad to know that Roku has no problem selling a product that is buggy and has known defects and crippling limitation.  Not to mention using all of us as unpaid beta testers.Aside from the hardware defects and software limitations and bugs, the 3500R would be a nice streaming device, but there are some features I immediately found lacking in the interface as well.  Here are the features found lacking.1. No Free Content filter option:The main reason I got the Roku is to watch free content. I have never and never will pay for cable or satellite TV.  I am satisfied with watching commercials to pay for my TV habit.  The problem is that most of the channels that Roku promotes are paid channels or subscription channels that require you to have a cable or satellite subscription.  Now I understand that this may be good for some people, but why not offer an option to list only free content for people like me. I mean, if you are like me and are looking for free content only, you will spend hours wading through Roku's endless menus to find something to watch.  It takes 3 to 4 steps on each channel to find out of there is any free content available, and each time you have to go back to the beginning and start all over again.  This takes several minutes each time you try a new show or channel because the 3500R is very slow to load.  It would be great if Roku would add an option to the menu that would allow you to list only free content.  It would save users hours of time wading through hundreds of paid and subscription only channels and content.2. No Parental Controls or mature content filtering.As a parent that likes to filter what my child watches (especially what they can access when I am not around) I found it to be a huge oversight that Roku does not offer any kind of parental controls or content filtering options.  Just like with trying to find free content, you have to go through multiple steps to see what the ratings of shows are.  If you are a parent, let me warn you right now, the Roku can access almost ANY kind of video on the internet and there are even channels that are dedicated to adult content that your kids can access without any restrictions.  It would be great if Roku would add an option to filter all content by a rating system and/or require a password or pin to watch anything over a certain rating. I find it appalling that in a world where our children are being targeted by perverts, that a responsible company would not make filtering adult content for the protection of our children a priority.3. No Access to Network TV channels like ABC, NBC, and CBS.There are a few shows that I like to watch that are on network TV.  I have an HTPC contacted to my TV as well and I use it to go directly to these channels via a browser and watch these shows.  I was very surprised that the Roku has none of these channels and only offers these shows (which you get see for free in a bowser) as a ""Pay per Episode"" option.The Bottom Line!If you have a Nintendo, X-Box 360, Smart TV,  HTPC or any other device that allows internet streaming, you have no need for a Roku of any kind, especially if you do not have some type of cable or satellite TV subscription service.  A Roku device offers no advantage over a standard internet browser and is actually a lot more limited.  You can access everything a Roku can right on your computer, actually you can access a lot more from your computer.  You can access HULU free from your computer, not from Roku (Paid Hulu Plus only).  You can access Network TV shows (CBS, NBC, ABC etc.) from their home site for free on a computer; not from a Roku.  You can install parental controls on you computer, not on a Roku.  You can connect any desktop or laptop and most tablets to your TV to use it as and HTPC and get all the content on the internet you want right on your TV.If you already have a cable or satellite subscription it might be worth it to get a Roku, but aside from that, I can't really see any advantage to the Roku.  Actually, all I see is disadvantages, and that is not even considering the hardware and software defects and limitations of the 3500R.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L1HY7KJENS95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INNP5VU#wasThisHelpful","R2L1HY7KJENS95","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unlike most obscene modern TV series that promote sexual immorality and human depravity to unprecedented levels, Dr Quinn is decent show about decent people with decent morals.  There is a whorehouse represented in the show, but the women are depicted as victims of circumstance that detest the life they live, rather then the modern trend of praising sexual promiscuity and demeaning anyone who seeks to live a decent moral life as stupid and crazy.The acting is superb and the stories will touch your heart. Like most series, season one is always the best.  If the writers kept this pattern through the rest of the series, it would be great.  Hopefully, they did not follow the patter of many other TV series that start out with a great decent cast and story line and then, once people are hooked, they slowly start adding and pushing political moral agendas that are counter to American traditional values. I have not seen the later seasons, so I cannot say if this show does follow this pattern.  I thoroughly enjoyed season one though and recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHZZKVN9QG6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007K0PIY6#wasThisHelpful","R3DHZZKVN9QG6H","AIVU1J51MJ9O2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIVU1J51MJ9O2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Chocolate and caramel are two of my favorite things, and I have a lot of experience with candy that combine them together. My gold standard here, for milk chocolate, remains the Godiva Milk Chocolate Caramel Bar, which is magnitude better than their bite-sized Milk Chocolate Caramels and similarly a magnitude better than these. However, those of us who have to watch our waistlines can't chow down on large chocolate bars without paying the price, and sometimes a little bit is better than a lot.In those cases, these are a good option. Comparable to the competitive Godiva minis, it doesn't stint on the caramel - which is soft and sweet and adequately coated in chocolate. Whether that's a good thing depends likely on whether you like Hershey's milk chocolate. I typically do, in mixtures, although not always in stand-alone. (I'm more of a dark chocolate fan; if I'm in the mood for pure milk chocolate but not for breaking the bank, I usually go for Dove.)There is one danger inherent in ordering soft-filled candies in bags online. A small portion of the candy in the bag I received came crushed. I have yet to find a candy at a moderate price-point that avoids this issue. It's a built-in risk of the packaging. Sometimes you find the same issue buying them in stores, when they are damaged in transit.When it comes to any grocery product that is widely available, price-checking is a good idea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NYNGIKIF4PXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BK152A#wasThisHelpful","R3NYNGIKIF4PXN","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having had to buy medical gloves to care for a diabetic pet, I soon discovered that they were useful to me in other contexts as well - especially cooking. I do not like handling meat with my bare hands for fear of cross-contamination. I wear medical gloves when making meatloaf or hamburgers or when cutting chicken or other poultry - really for anything that requires much contact. This is my first go at Ammex, and I have found these gloves a good and reasonable alternative to the brand I usually buy  (SafeTouch latex gloves by Dynarex - it doesn't matter to me if my gloves have latex or not). They are currently cheaper. This lot has been supple and comfortable and has withstood activity. I am not a large woman, but the large gloves are a comfortable fit for me. My hands and feet are woefully stubby. If you have very large hands, the large may be too small.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9C2O12GB9MB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF49SZW#wasThisHelpful","R9C2O12GB9MB8","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using these shower gels for a couple of weeks now and have different feelings about each. They all lather richly and seem to clean about equally (with caveat for the gourmet, which has abrasives in it).My favorite is the ""Perfume"" gel. The one I have is rose-scented, and while the scent is quite strong it doesn't seem to trigger my scent-sensitivity. I am inclined to migraines and cannot wear perfume because of that. I find this leaves a noticeable but not overpowering scent of rose behind that dissipates gradually over a few hours.Following on that, the gourmet ""mango"" has a very pleasant but far more subtle scent. As mentioned above, it has an abrasive agent in it to help exfoliate. Some shower gels overdo this to the point that using them becomes unpleasant. I haven't experienced that with this one, but as with any abrasive gel you want to handle with care. If your skin is sensitive, you may suffer for it.Finally, the ""shine"" gel was a bit of a disappointment. I was counting on some lingering shimmer from it, in line with the brief ad copy, but so far as I can tell it rinses off cleanly. Ordinarily, this is a good thing in a soap, but it does kind of scoff at the whole notion of ""sparkling"" after you use it.Currently, the set has a decent price for the volume of product. The packaging is normal for shower gels, which means ""slippery when soapy/wet"" - not a feature I appreciate, but I don't feel like docking them for being like everybody else.Preference plays such a major part in scents that it's hard to say that what I like will also please you, but these products have certainly pleased me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DRHXW2V9GG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CCM02Y#wasThisHelpful","R25DRHXW2V9GG9","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to my son, who has been using this exclusively for several weeks now, this is a massive step up in electric razor quality, although at a premium price - gets closer, more comfortably than any of the mid-priced electric shavers he's tried before. It charges quickly and performs quietly and well, even on wet skin. The self-cleaner is a bit complicated, however, and the base is bulky - it takes more counter real estate than he can easily spare. He's found these worth it. In the past, his main gripe with electric razors has been their inefficiency, as a result of which he tends to abandon them quickly for manuals.

"This system may be a little complex for beginners/non-professionals, like me. While set-up is pretty easy, but the system is not optimized for the casual. Instructions are minimal.

However, while I feel like I've just scratched the surface on it in three weeks of use, I've managed to get it functional and to produce some pretty interesting o output.

"There are some people who are specialists in shampoos who can talk about the ""handfeel"" and the lathering abilities and the kinds of things you'd read about in a hair design magazine. I'm not one of them, and my 18-year-old son, who is using this product, is even less.What I can say is this - he's been using this product for several weeks now with good success. It cleans his hair well and leaves it soft and manageable. It does have a distinctive perfume, as all Axe products do. Hard to characterize it, exactly, but it's a bit piney - kind of outdoorsy and fresh. The smell lingers. Have care what other scented products you mix it with.Also be aware that one of the key ingredients here is Dimethiconol. This silicone-based product can make your hair look fantastic - it coats it for shine and to smooth out frizzle. It also builds up. You should occasionally (every two weeks for instance) use a clarifying shampoo (wash rinse wash rinse - as Dimethiconol is not simple to dissolve) to strip off the build-up, or your hair may eventually become lank and limp. The Dimethiconol build-up can prevent the hair shaft from absorbing moisture and the clarifying shampoo is drying, so this is probably not a good shampoo for you if your hair is prone to dryness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16AHOCW22WAD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70QKBK#wasThisHelpful","R16AHOCW22WAD2","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I want to be upfront here that my problem with this book is the read. Enrique's story is an important one to add context to the life of an illegal immigrant to the United States and to her family, to the impact that it creates for her son, for the steps that he is willing to take to avoid a life of crippling poverty, apparently without hope. Whether you are for relaxing standards or for tightening them or even for just keeping them the same, it's still a topic that deserves thoughtful consideration and understanding from every aspect.But this book - oh, my word, this book. I found it repetitive and dull; a horrible slog to get through. It's a well-researched story, and I don't doubt that the newspaper series the book is based on deserved the Pulitzers it received. But the constant regurgitation of not only facts, but words and phrases went a fair way to killing momentum. The focus not only on key details that help set the emotional heart of the participants but also on trivial, exhaustive details killed the rest.Kudos to Nazario for the hard-work of putting this profile together, but I did not even remotely enjoy the read.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW75NTI3AEVM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GPJW6G#wasThisHelpful","RW75NTI3AEVM7","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A ""daddy's girl,"" Kelly is frank about the impact that her much-loved father's genius and his substances (as well as those of her mother) impacted her. Those interested in reading about other people's lives may find much of value here about the experience of growing up in such an environment, about trying to figure out your own role and be successful in your own light in the shadow of such fame. Those looking for the insightful and sometimes biting social commentary of George himself would do better to look elsewhere.Kelly's strengths here are her candor and completeness. The latter also presented occasional challenges to me, as there were times when the reading was a bit slow.

He discovered early on that it's important to apply it thin; sunscreens have a tendency to sting the eyes when you sweat, and this one is no exception.

A popular high school athlete, after an accident sidelines her from the team she takes to drugs and a new crowd of friends whose partying could get her killed. On this night, quite quickly.The basic premise is an intriguing one, but ultimately fell short for me. The idea of being trapped in dark sewers with a killer is a pretty horrific one, but as the plot advanced I kind of checked out - or more formally ""lost my suspension of disbelief."" Maybe some compelling explanations of what was going on could have saved it for me, but there's nothing like that - so it wound up feeling random.That said, the writing is overall solid with a nice flow and consistently constructed characters. While the plot lost me, the writing made it possible for me to finish anyway (mainly because I was curious to see just how unreliable our narrator was). I wouldn't write off the author (and might even read her earlier book, with the hopes that it will be better grounded),  but this book was a solid ""meh""If not for the overall deftness of writing, this would be a 2 at best for me.

"For people already familiar with the classic SIMON, this game will hold few surprises, which for me is not a bad thing, as nostalgia is what interested me in this product. The original SIMON was fun. Relatively melodic, playable in both competitive and solo modes, it was pretty addictive, with a high replay value.This version essentially offers one game - what the classic called ""Simon Says."" In this game, Simon presents players with an increasingly complex sequence of sounds (including the visual cue of lighting the colored wedge corresponding to the noise), and players must reproduce them. You can play this game in solo mode or in ""pass"" mode, where each player has a unique sequence to remember.Missing from the original are the ""player adds"" mode (in which Simon makes a sound, you reproduce and add a sound, Simon reproduces and adds a sound, and so on) and the ""choose your color"" mode (in which 2, 3 or 4 players play the game simultaneously, each operating a single color - 2 colors for 2 players; for 3 players a color is eliminated - with players being eliminated gradually until the last man standing). The Micro series is also missing the difficulty level selector - a slider that allowed you to adjust the number of sequences Simon would offer to declare you having ""won"" the game. I do not remember the original Simon tracking your score numerically, as this one does - maybe that compensates for the fact that most of us will end this game with the ""razz"" sound of failure.What the smaller version lacks in diversity it makes up in portability. The volume on this is not so loud that I can't tolerate it in the car (your mileage may vary, as they say), and it's easy enough to slip into a backpack for play anywhere. (Lacking an ""off"" switch, note, it may be noisy in doing this. This is not a good game to bring for a school game day, unless your teacher has a Phillips head screwdriver to put back a removed battery.) A larger child can hold this in one hand to play if he or she chooses, depressing the wedges with the fingers of the other hand. It can also be placed on a surface, although its small size means it's rather easily knocked off. (A catastrophe that doesn't seem to hurt the game, but may impact the frustration level of the player.)Note that there is another miniature version of the game - included in the set I liked above and individually at Hasbro 14397018500 Simon Memory Game Carabiner Edition - which offers a carabiner presumably specifically to attach it to backpacks and the like. I have not tried or even seen in person that version, so I'm not sure how it relates to this in size. But according to reviews I've found, it also lacks an ""off"" switch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IU2JUA7Z3FPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4OP3OW#wasThisHelpful","R3IU2JUA7Z3FPK","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was a page turner for me; highly poetic in places but not overly purple, it presented an extremely sympathetic protagonist who has a serious disconnect from his own story. It's an interesting place to be, as readers. We can understand the bits that Todd cannot, so what the other characters in the story say and do makes more sense to us than it does to him. We also have a rich view of Todd's own interior monologues, so we know what he cannot vocalize to them. It carried me along like some kind of mute witness, wishing that I could actually do something to straighten things out.Todd is not only disconnected from the events in his life, but from the people. Those around him largely see a flat, affectless aging man, a man whose condition perplexes them or causes them to view him as less than human. We see a person longing for connection, simultaneously reaching back into his past for memories of the mother who loved him best and into the present for a woman who might love him now. None of which he can truly convey.So much rich texture in what is really a small story.

"This is a very sturdy ""tablet light"" for preschoolers that really delivers. Brightly colored, fun, and offering easy access to tons of educational apps, it's a pretty good way to let a child feel sophisticated (if you have iPad envy in your house, for instance) while still limiting her to age appropriate activities (and limiting the potential to do damage). The video camera and voice recorder are fun; the ability to personalize, fantastic. The apps are diverse and engrossing.That said, it does have some potential challenges. We encountered our first on setup, as two computers declined to recognize the LeapFrog. This proved to be a Firewall issue; once permission was given in our settings for the device, it functioned without issue.More troubling, it eats batteries like air.

Once the can is opened it either must be consumed immediately or refrigerated/frozen and consumed within a week.Honestly, if you're not buying these for camping or prepping or something else that requires long-term storage, you can probably find a cheaper source of dried apples.

"My 17-year-old son is the videographer of the family. I asked him to test this product and report back to me, and this is what he has to say.Having used Corel a few generations ago, this is not all new, but it's got some great new features.  The interface has always been pretty intuitive, and this is unchanged, but the list mode of your media gives you tons of information on your videos, making it much easier to identify what you want. And when you are using a video in a project, there is a green check on it--this helps avoid using the same clip twice, which is a nice feature.There are several new features that are a true plus for the software.One that is particularly appealing is the ability to record narration and system audio at the same time. If you want to do a screen capture of yourself doing something (a new feature anyway since his last version) and explain what you are doing as you are doing it, you can. This is an especially good feature for those who want to review videogames or films or riff them.The new freeze frame effect lets you not only grab a moment of a video, but grab a sequence of specific duration and easily pull it out to play with, putting it in different positions as needs serve. The audio ducking tool is a good one for people who do voice-over narration over these sequences, because it automatically lowers the volume of the main track when you narrate and returns it after the narration clip is ended.Text overlay on films has been given a lot more customization, including blending and transparency. The ability to move captioning within your project easily is cool.Masking and green-screen have both been enhanced, with better blending capabilities and easier-to-use green-screening even in lower light scenarios.The program also supports more video formats than it formerly did and, with the optional purchase of a plug-in, will allow you to create BluRays.His dream program, I know, is Adobe After Effects, but with its monthly subscription business model there's no way that's on his budget.

"I'm getting to be quite a connoisseur of these. This the third variety Mountain House meal I've tried - the other two were breakfast options - and this is by far my favorite. The reconstituted eggs were doable, but this is something I would actually eat at home in a time pinch. The eggs were emergency-or-camping-only. My husband was not as big a fan of the flavor, which he found bland (better with hot sauce), but to me it was about on par with a decent frozen dinner. Not home-made or restaurant quality, but pretty good. The rice was a little al dente, the beef was a little tough. But good.This is good news to me, because I bought a metric ton of this stuff before I ever tried it. When I got the opportunity to sample a few flavors, I figured it would be a good idea to see what I was in for. I'm not a full-on prepper, but I try to set aside some supplies for an emergency, and I had been told that Mountain House's offerings were good. I'm so glad that I was told right. These blow MREs out the water.I am a bit bugged by two things. First, I don't like that this is ""2.5 servings."" I've said before that I think foods should be sold in quantities of whole persons. But a larger issue for me is that serving size. A healthy adult man needs between 2,000 and 3,000 calories a day. A healthy woman needs 1,800 to 2,000 calories per day. For 2,000 calories a day (light for a man, heavier for a woman), that's about 667 calories a meal, if you do the ""breakfast, lunch and dinner"" division. A serving of this isn't even a third of that, at 180 calories. I'd be packing one of these per person, but only if I had something to add to it.Plan your meals accordingly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LOCXZ7SF21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RJM2GX6#wasThisHelpful","R11LOCXZ7SF21","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skin problems don't go away with age, unfortunately, but essential skin oils do. Standard pore strips had never had ill effects on me before - like most people, I was simply in awe at the stuff collected on the little strip and relieved to be cleared of what seemed like filth. But the stuff you see clinging to the strips is generally not dirt or blackheads, but sebaceous filaments - a combination of skin cells and sebum collected in a channel intended to help get sebum to the surface of the skin. Sebum, of course, isn't filth - it's a necessary skin protectant. It helps keep bad stuff out (dirt, bacteria) and good stuff in (moisture). Without it, you get dry, flaky and perhaps even cracking skin. You can get rashes and, yes, even acne. What's more, all the empty channels left behind when you remove the filaments don't go away. They're permanent. And they will refill within a matter of weeks, because they're supposed to be there and doing exactly what they do.I'd always regarded that tight-skinned feeling following use of a pore strip with cleanliness, good hygiene, but this time it feels more like a burn--and four days after use, my skin remains quite unhappy with me. I think I'll leave my sebacous filaments where they are. At my age, dry skin is more an issue than oily.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UH55914QVFNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6IHQCC#wasThisHelpful","R2UH55914QVFNT","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so this story is pretty far-fetched, even within the internal logic of the tale, but I didn't care. When I started reading it, I expected it to be kind of ridiculous. It was recommended to me, and I picked it up with great skepticism. But it turned out to be incredibly sweet. Ehd and Elizabeth are not just separated by the ordinary cultural gap. Ehd is a man of his time, not just pre-literate but barely verbal or even able to grasp the concept of language. Elizabeth is light years beyond him intellectually, but they need to bring both their skills together to survive in his hostile prehistoric landscape. In the doing, they build a love story that is really surprisingly touching. I teared up more than once and at one point openly wept. Kudos, Shay Savage.I love it (5 stars) is a little too strong for me. Sometimes, Ehd's perspective and preoccupations do get tedious - his obsession with reproduction comes to mind - even though it feels plausibly authentic enough to put that aside. And without spoilers, I actually felt like the epilogue broke my mood. Too, though the concept was intriguingly different, it took me a bit to really get caught up.If I could, I would happily give it 4.5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12W4AX5WEMBRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFV9AXY#wasThisHelpful","R12W4AX5WEMBRS","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was delighted when the opportunity for this one came along.This game is very much in the vein of others we play. Your goal is to get rid of your cards - not to be the last one holding them. Along the way, you have the opportunity to play ""karma"" cards to either make your opponent eat cards or to prevent your having to do so.

"I own a metric ton of this stuff, but had never tried it, so when I got the opportunity to pick up a couple of single pouch breakfast offerings for review, I figured it would be a good idea to see what I'm in for. I'm not a full-on prepper, but I try to set aside some supplies for an emergency, and I had been told that Mountain House's offerings were good.They are. I have now tried two - this one and the Precooked Scrambled Eggs with Bacon.The stuff does not really look good in the package. Freeze-dried eggs look like styrofoam, but adding a cup of boiling water, stirring, and letting it sit turns it into something surprisingly tasty and filling. This is the second variety I've tried, and like the former I found it a bit dry. I wasn't sure before if I had overstrained it (you're left with a bit of soup from the rehydration process), so I didn't strain it as aggressively this time, but it didn't really help. The moisture loss is internal, if you can make sense of that - compared to moist, gleaming scrambled eggs, this...isn't.As with the other variety, the flavor of this is good. Seasoning is heavy (lot of sodium in these), but that's what makes them palatable. I prefer the other flavor, but that's not because of any innate difference in quality. My husband liked this one better.Mountain House's Pro Packs offer a gratifying meal for a small outlay of effort. They will serve well in an emergency or if you are away from quality fresh ingredients - much better than many of the emergency foods I've stashed (and choked down) in the past. My buckets of emergency backup food seem at this point like a good investment, and I wouldn't hesitate to take these camping for an almost-like-home meal.I do have the same issue with this that I did with the last one.

"This is an adorable concept with some nice features, but it does have some issues about which potential buyers should be aware.The cover is charming and fun, it offers some padding, and the seams are well reinforced. It's sturdy and should survive some abuse. The velcro tabs for the straps are also sturdy, as are the ears - which is a good thing, as those ears are tempting carry points. The straps are not too long, which is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that they're less likely to get hung up on things when not in use holding the iPad in position. The downside is that they're kind of less useful in holding the iPad in position. In my car, the seat-to-back-of-seat ratio is not optimal for hanging this device as pictured, not and still have a child of two reach the pad.My major concern with the unit is the stand at the rear. I've included a picture of this - it's quite flimsy. My stand arrived with a curve that predisposes it to close, and the only thing keeping it open is a bendable nylon strap (same consistency as the hanging strap) that is also predisposed to close. It doesn't take much to make this stand fold in upon itself, and unfortunately two-year-olds aren't known for their gentle touch. This item doesn't remain standing for long.The rear of the cover has some fit issues, as per picture two. It is held closed by a velcro flap where the velcro is small and centralized in the middle. Right out the box, it is already beginning to curl (picture 2), and it will be very easy for small fingers to find purchase to pull it open. It'll also be appealing for them to do so, as the most eye-catching thing on the back is the logo - which is right in the middle of the closure.Speaking of the logo, the one sewn onto the side (picture 3) has slightly sharp edges, especially at the corners. I wish it were a little more soft, given the age of the intended audience.It's a really nice concept with some nice design features but a few flaws that I hope they will improve in future iterations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMX5CWXN2OARU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK4V8YK#wasThisHelpful","RMX5CWXN2OARU","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do not read Showalter religiously but have picked up enough of her books over the years to be pretty familiar with her style and her evolving trends. For a while there, people were concerned that she had toned down the sex to the point that she was losing a big part of what constituted her stories. Well, friends, I don't know if this is the first book where the trend reverses, but the sex is here.I realize this is a bit like saying that you read Playboy for the articles - highly suspect - but I don't really care whether my romances have explicit sex in them or not. I generally skim or skip when the action gets too hot and heavy. (If I want erotica, I know where to find it.) I read Showalter because she manages somehow to go really super dark in her plots - hyper-violence! epic battles of good vs. evil! superbeings clashing over world-shattering stakes! - while still being really whimsical. Sometimes maybe a little on the verge of too much, maybe. The women in this book sounded to me like a Cosmo quorum. But it's still playful and breezy and good-spirited and leavens the darkness nicely. Fantasy-horror-rom-com.Sometimes I have a problem with Showalter's world building. She's been at it so long and has built such an amazing canon that I'm constantly stumbling over plots and people I don't remember or just don't know, and I've run into a book or two where I felt sidelined by subplots or set-up for a future book. That wasn't an issue at all in Burning Dawn. There were references to the broader mythos and, yes, some groundwork, but it never distracted from the main story or left me confused.Anyhoodle, if you pant over alpha men and flippant women with a heart of gold, if your stomach doesn't churn when people are disemboweled or beheaded in fiction (or if you can push past it), if you can handle a story that is simultaneously grim and bouncy, AND if you do not shy at some pretty explicit shenanigans between (and above and nowhere near) the sheets, this could be the book for you.Fun times.

Removable sides on two ends make tending the fire easy, and the vinyl cover helps protect it from exposure between uses.

"I am not a doctor, pharmacist, chemist or herbalist. I'm a woman of a certain age who takes vitamins and supplements and who is prone to waking up in the middle of the night with her clothes as wet as if she'd just coached the winning team at the Super Bowl. (Please don't ever douse me with Gatorade. I have enough experience with pulling away clinging clothing at this stage to know I don't much care for it.) I keep spare nightgowns by my bed. I've been taking this stuff for a few weeks now, and I think it has helped. It hasn't proven a miracle drug for me - still with the middle of the night clothing changes - but I think they are happening less frequently and perhaps less severely.A bit of research shows me that the top ingredient, Nakai, has shown some effectiveness as an antiandrogen - which means that to at least some extent it blocks androgens from impacting your body. Medically proven antiandrogens are given to women for things like acne, amenorrhea (that who cessation of menstruation thing), excessive hair growth, and loss of hair caused by androgen. It seems to be the source of most of the claims here. Next on the list, cynanchum wilfordii, is a little harder to find, but it's used to treat anemia and, according to the documents the makers of this supplement submitted to the FDA in 2006, may also enhance libido. (They say it's used that way in Korea.)  The third ingredient on the list, phlomis umbrosa, is touted in that same document for general tissue repair.People who take supplements should always be mindful that ""natural"" and ""over the counter"" do not necessarily equal safe. Foxglove (aka digitalis) is a natural ingredient, but it can cause seizures, heart arrhythmias and even death. St. John's Wort, freely available and commonly used to self-treat depression, can cause birth control pills to fail and organ transplant rejection. I had a friend years ago who took an herb she had been told would help her morning sickness only to discover that it was the main ingredient in an abortifacient used in China. If you have a medical condition and especially if you are taking other medications, talk to your doctor or pharmacist to make sure this is safe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PHM1AO5Z49JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9OIFFW#wasThisHelpful","R1PHM1AO5Z49JI","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a bit a smoothie fanatic, so my blender sees a lot of use. This one, while pricey, is quite powerful and has been very effective at blending even hard frozen ingredients. It's loud--I've never met a blender that will quietly crush ice, but this one seems louder than most--but that's not an issue for me. I like that it feels very stable. The glass top is heavy; the plastic base seems lightweight in comparison but is much larger in proportion to the pitcher than usual. I've had no issues with rocking or walking in use.That said, I can't honestly say that this blender is enough of an advancement over my previous (a KitchenAid in this family) to justify the huge jump in price. Is this one better than that? Yes, I believe it honestly is - although there's also a possibility that my old KitchenAid is suffering from some age and seems worse than it started. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now, and it's a workhorse. But is it worth more than three times as much as KitchenAid? I'm not that specialized, myself.

"This entertaining fantasy novel has a seriously dark side. On the one hand, there's a truly gruesome villain who is horrifyingly brutal in the way he treats women. On the other, there's a gorgeous romantic lead who is horrifyingly brutal in the way he treats women. This latter element has been pretty divisive. I guess it comes down to this: can you buy that an 18-year-old female jinni might have complicated and confusing feelings for the incredibly hot and evidently charming master who has basically tortured her for years? I can. And personally I never got the feeling that Demetrios was trying to excuse the bad behavior or downplay the severity of what Malek did. Nor did she ever portray Nalia's confused feelings as healthy.The book was not a perfect fit for me, but it was an enjoyable read. I haven't read much (maybe any) jinni fantasy, and Demetrios's take seemed rich, with a fully realized culture behind it. The romance elements of the novel were not as deeply engaging to me as this and the threat of the aforementioned truly gruesome villain. I'm way more interested in this fractured society than I am in Nalia's love life.This is the first book in a trilogy, so there's plenty that's left unresolved, but I'm happy to say that I (at least) got a good sense of closure. I can't stand hanging series that offer no payoff for the book in my hand - generally, by the time the next comes out, I've either forgotten the original or just no longer care.I may not have loved it, but I liked it - it kept me reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QGUGB88I7B6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006231856X#wasThisHelpful","R1QGUGB88I7B6R","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I think this book has been miscategorized: ""humor and entertainment"" did not describe the experience I had, and I'm glad of it. I understand that the marketing strategy here is likely meant to capitalize on the popularity of the 2014 film The Interview, but I think that doing so fails to give credit to what Fischer has actually produced: a taut, terse book about two people whose lives are savaged by a corrupt empire.I learned a ton about Korea (both north and south). While predominantly about the massive personal impact Kim Jong-Il and his regime had on the lives to two kidnapped South Korean filmmakers, the book contextualizes their story well, politically, economically and philosophically. And it does this painlessly, without feeling remotely like the history lesson it is. There's nothing funny about what happened to Choi Eun-Hee and Shin Sang-Ok - it's horrific. The book doesn't lapse into melodrama, though, but communicates details straightforwardly, with a highly readable brisk pace. It's a gripping, engrossing tale.Those who have any confusion on the issue should be aware that this is not an academic work; there's no apparatus here, and Fischer clearly has his own perspective on events, which he seems to feel comfortable interjecting throughout the tale. I didn't find this intrusive, as I'm not looking for an academic work on the subject. If you are, you should look elsewhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22EAD504YO7UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250054265#wasThisHelpful","R22EAD504YO7UP","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This safe offers a substantial sense of security. A hefty 135+ lbs. when empty, it's not going to be easily carried away from your home in an invasion, and the earsplitting alarm (that thing is LOUD) that it emits when moved is going to discourage thieves from even wanting to try. (You'll want to make sure you don't enter the code incorrectly too many times, or you risk that same very effective discouragement.) In terms of entry, you can use the keypad alone or add an extra layer of security by using the keypad and the key, requiring that both be provided to open it.The safe is solidly constructed, I haven't tested flameproofing or waterproofing, but I trust ETL verification. ETL Verified Marks are bestowed by the Intertek Corporation. This performance testing service is paid for by manufacturers, so the ABSENCE of a mark doesn't mean a feature doesn't work, but Intertek's reputation relies on their trustworthiness in giving the marks. They have over 1,000 labs across the world, and if they say that the safes they were given to test in this line offer 1-hour fire protection for digital media up to 1-hour at 1700 F / 927 C in the event of a fire, I believe them.On the subject of digital media, please note that the safe's instructions say ""DO NOT store any film based technology or media in this safe."" This is due to the risk of moisture accumulation within the safe, even if you retain (as you are supposed to) the desiccant they provide and replace it or recharge it (as you are supposed to) every six months. Negatives, floppy disks - not here. Likewise, you are advised not to store watches, stamps or photos in the safe and, if you do anyway, to first put them in an airtight container. Pearls are another no-go, but not because of humidity. Evidently, they will simply melt if your safe is engulfed in fire. Other things not to store: firearms and medication (I imagine the humidity again) and combustibles (not sure why - but I'd rather not store combustibles in my safe anyway).Please note that this comes with a warranty that you need to register.

"This book offers a complete introduction to DJing, covering aspects from building a set-up to using your set-up to creating a demo to standing out in a performance setting. In keeping with the ""For DUMMIES"" brand, it offers to do so in a way that makes sense for complete neophytes - no background knowledge needed.Completely to my surprise, I am a beginner DJ. Always a vocal fan of DJs, I was pleasantly shocked to receive at Christmas a Numark iDJ Pro Professional DJ Controller for iPad, which comes with some amazing features but, alas, doesn't come with skill.

For the truly aspiring professional DJ starting from nothing, this thing could be gold. 395 pages long (sans index), it very thoroughly explains what your options are in DJing and how to become the DJ of your dreams. This starts with about 185 pages (15-200) of discussion of equipment: what you can buy; which you should buy (according to your resources and the type of DJ you want to be); how you should set it up. All of this is written in a conversational, easy-to-digest style that makes what could be pretty dry reading pleasant. (Since I'm reviewing the book, I read all of this even though my DJ Toolbox was put together for me, and I did find some scattered tips that were interesting and useful even in my situation.)Actually mixing and modifying music is the focus of section 3 - 84 pages are devoted to mixing, beatmatching, and scratching. This section is incredibly dense, but still readable. There's a lot of information packed in here. Coming from the newbie perspective (with educated ears and clueless hands), I felt it offered some solid tips for grasping beatmatching basics and striving for the next level. It talks not only about the hows, but the whys of effective mixing and scratching.Part 4 begins with more attention to performance and technique. Within the context of ""Getting Noticed and Playing Live,"" it offers some next-step tips for those who have mastered the basics in Part 3, specifically beatmatching and mixing. It goes into the art of using your playlist to build energy and mood in your audience, to please your patrons (both in constructing your demo and in live performance). Intermingled with all of this are some of the nuts and bolts of professional djing - how to market yourself, what to look for in an agency, what to look for in a gig.The book is a very well-rounded look at DJing as a profession, and as such is not so much focused on DJing as an art as would have served _me_, but there's plenty enough of that included to take me at least a little closer to Van Cliburnism. I imagine we all know that no book will take me there completely: I need technique (which this offers in spades), but I also need talent and time to develop it. You don't learn to be ""like a pro"" from reading, but from playing - with aptitude. On the whole, though, this is an impressive blend of business and art, and I imagine that it could have a lot to offer the person who aspires to be the next Armin van Buuren or Wundrkut or even the guy people want to play their weddings.If you're a true beginner, though, and want to get the best from this, buy the book BEFORE you buy the gear. If you've already got the gear, well, it still has a lot to offer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18JN3X3FLL3OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118937287#wasThisHelpful","R18JN3X3FLL3OT","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and while I can say that it delivers what it promises - hair is thicker while using it - it also kind of kills style. They recommend applying it to roots and midshaft for layered hair, but in spite of following these directions to the best of my ability, I wind up with an all-over pouf that is difficult to style.My hair is just a touch past shoulder length at the moment. It is fine and has always been very straight. I have only within the past few years learned that a great stylist can create the illusion of volume with the clever use of layering, so these days my hair tricks people into thinking I have some texture. I thought I'd give this a try to see if it could better that effect.As near as I can tell by evaluating the ingredients (see the bottom of this post, as these are not at this writing listed on Amazon), this product relies on several hair-coating agents meant to give the appearance of volume. PVP, Polyvinylpyrrolidone, is the ingredient that gives many hairsprays their holding effect. VP/VA Copolymer inhibits hair from absorbing moisture and is found in mascaras and other volumizing hair products. The potentially drying, coarsening effects of these are countered by softening and anti-static agents, like cetyl alcohol (one of the good ones) and Polyquaternium 37.While the countering agents here do a pretty good job - my hair feels generally soft, if not as silky as it usually does - it still feels to me like trying to brush through hair that has been sprayed. I'm not styling so much as taming, and the end-result does not appeal.Longterm build-up has not been a huge issue, but I've not been using this long. Products that coat your hair will usually eventually weigh it down - contravening the lift its meant to provide and making it look a bit greasy. To avoid long-term build-up, I'd recommend a weekly wash with a clarifying shampoo. (I use Redken Cleansing Cream, and it works for me - but I don't know if it's the best or most economical.)For me, this is not a product I will continue to use. If my hair were long with fewer layers, I'd probably love it, but what it's doing now mostly is fighting against a great cut. In terms of what to expect from it, we're not talking about an 80s hair band's worth of lift, but definitely more volume, especially along the length.Ingredients are:WATER, ISODECYL NEOPENTANOATE, PVP, POLYQUATERNIUM-37, VP/VA COPOLYMER, CETYL ALCOHOL, POLYIMIDE-1, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HYDROXYPROPYL METHYLCELLULOSE, FRAGRANCE, SILICONE QUATERNIUM-18, TRIDECETH-6, MALIC ACID, TRIDECETH-12, GLYCINE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, GLYCERIN, HYDROLYZED VEGETABLE PROTEIN PG-PROPYL SILANETRIOL, ALCOHOL DENAT., AMP-ISOSTEAROYL HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, HYDROLYZED KERATIN, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, GREEN 3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MMLPIYP9ACYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1NBKSW#wasThisHelpful","R2MMLPIYP9ACYF","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a George Foreman fan. Lacking space and needed equipment for outdoor grilling, I've relied on indoor grills for nearly 20 years. To me, the most important features of these grills are removable platters (for easy cleaning), proper tilt (for easy cleaning) and adjustable temperature (for easy cooking) - this unit has them all. It's a good size for cooking for my family of three as well. I've tried hamburgers, chicken breasts and pork chops with good success. The angle is, as with past George Foreman's, great for grease runoff. I have had other brands in the past where the grease actually ran out the back because it wasn't steep enough for the grease to flow forward. The lid fits down better over the content better than previous George Foreman's, courtesy of the hinge lid.

"I'm a big fan of Clarks Women's boots. I wear a size 6, but have wide feet, so I generally get by with an increase to 6.5 - I have successfully done this with multiple pair of Clarks ordered from Amazon in the past. Unfortunately, these boots were not on the same size scale as my previous orders - they were tight across the forefoot to the point that I had to return them. I was sorry to have to do it - the leather is soft, and the shoes look good in person.

"What you get here is exactly what it claims to be - an item that will both sound an alarm and make it harder for a door to open. It has a great non-skid pad on the base that works on hard surfaces and holds up pretty effectively on carpet, too. Unlike with a traditional doorstop, you would not wedge the door closed with this, not if you want it to operate as an alarm as well. I tested to see if the alarm would still function if the metal plate was _partially_ depressed before it was turned on, and it did not. Make sure that only the white plastic goes under the door, and it should work fine to alert you and at least temporarily delay entry to give you time to react.The on-off slider is low profile, which is helpful for traveling, as you really don't want this going off in your suitcase, but I really wish that the battery compartment was not held closed by a screw. I don't usually travel with a Phillip's head screwdriver.

"This book reminded me a bit of The Great Gatsby.  Captures the spirit of a generation? Absolutely. Sure, not everybody in America is appearing on (or aspiring to appear on) reality t.v., but not everybody in Fitzgerald's time was hanging out in speakeasies, either.  What we have here is a warped mirror, one in which our characteristics are exaggerated but not fabricated. It is a legitimate slice of American culture: the drive to be something, to be a star, to elevate beyond the lot to which we were born to and receive the accolades that we need to feel special. Whether that's the pyrite shine of a toddler's tiara or a direct line to your personal Lord and Savior, the goal is the same: to have a place in the universe that matters. In a way, like Gatsby, the book is about the hollowness of the ""American dream"", our race to reach a meaningless pinnacle - upon achieving which, we race to the next. It is about the shallowness of reaching for fame and fortune above happiness, about the damage we do to those around us and to the relationships that really matter. Before we ever meet him, Ray has been pushed to a pinnacle beyond his capacities (much like daughter Bailey, groomed to attain a goal to reflect glory on his parent), and we can see the destruction that it left behind on him. A failed doctor who might have been an excellent nurse, he is self-destructing one pill-pack at a time.Further analysis requires spoilers, and I don't believe in spoilers. I'll just say that there's a lot of meaning packed in what looks deceptively like a lightweight book. Like Gatsby, this book could inspire essays and classroom debates. Unlike Gatsby, the students reading it will probably be having fun (no offense, Fitzgerald).What's really amazing about this book, to me, is that while it makes its point with mockery (and a lot of humor), it manages to do it with heart as well. It's easy to make fun of people. It's a lot harder to make fun of people without losing sight of their humanity. I not only laughed at these characters, but cared about them (some more than others). By and large, they were stupid, shallow, petty, sometimes even mean people, but they were stupid, shallow, petty and sometimes even mean people that Butler made understandable, sympathetic. As a result, I was flipping pages not only to find out what absurd situation the author would drop on his characters next, but to root for them to come out okay.Quite an accomplishment that.I can't go so far as to say it's the great American novel, but it's certainly a really good one. A painless read, you can get a lot out of it if you want to. Or you can just have some fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KD7TJR8D7WO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049725#wasThisHelpful","R2KD7TJR8D7WO6","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the condition itself, it seems, this memoir offers glimmers of light. I wanted to know more about the medical base of this disorder than Lyndsey offers, but I can hardly fault her for that - she wants it far more than I do. Suffering a rare, crippling disorder that cannot be explained must be incredibly frustrating. But as Lyndsey lives figuratively and literally in the dark, she manages to find some truths that might not otherwise be visible, lost in the distraction of the mundane. Her book is as much about developing an incredible self-reliance as it is dealing with near total dependance on others.While Lyndsey's book is often lyrical, I don't want to make it sound like she lives in or describes some mystical other dimension, where the loss of light has brought some kind of new age enlightenment. The challenges she has to overcome are profound and not always pretty, from stale air and bad smells to fearing the loss of a support network you need, literally, to survive. This is not a book of platitudes nor the musings of some kind of patient, medieval saint. It feels real.I found the book generally quite interesting, although a little emotionally detached at a few points, in part because of the narrative structure. Lyndsey's situation is vividly painted, in snippets, interspersed with musings on larger issues or reflections on work games or memories of life at different times. It's a good opportunity to learn something about what life is like in extremely different circumstances, to try to imagine how we would live in them, and to admire a woman who seems to be handling them amazingly well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y316N04ZGI67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539606#wasThisHelpful","R1Y316N04ZGI67","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find these kinds of things invaluable when I travel - when you don't have time for a full shower, but need a mid-point refreshment. This is the first time I've used these, and I was impressed. Inside of the package displayed currently on Amazon is a smaller, slightly more discreet pack in metallic pink with a resealable white triangle closure (kind of jarring, from a design standpoint) that can easily fit into a purse or three-ounce plastic bag. This contains 10 pre-moistened towelettes. These have a slightly fruity scent with a faint alcohol undertone. I can't wear perfume because of scent sensitivity, and these did not bother me, although what does bother people will be highly individualized. The towelettes are slightly textured, which adds some gentle exfoliation.In terms of using this on your face, you can - and I tried - but it's not something you'll want to do regularly. Denatured alcohol is the second ingredient on the list. The rapid evaporation is quite likely one of the reasons this is cooling and also can tame odor issues. But, unlike fatty alcohols, it can also be drying. If you must use it on your face, I'd follow up with a moisturizer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BT4QI3I3N9P1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBMJWWC#wasThisHelpful","R1BT4QI3I3N9P1","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one is a page-turner. I was quickly and deeply engrossed in Sam's mysteries, as he tries to work out why his friend killed himself but also resolve some more urgent and immediate questions, such as who is using his dead friend's online account...and why. Sam is a deeply sympathetic character surrounded by a strong supporting cast, and the music added an interesting layer of complexity to the story. I was about halfway through the book before I decided to listen to the songs called out in the chapter headers and found them a nice ""multimedia"" touch. However, they're not essential - if you don't like the music, you can ignore that aspect pretty much completely without any real loss. I was unfamiliar with half the songs before I started listening, and it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the story.The story wraps up nicely for the most part. I like closure, so this was mostly a good thing for me, but I have to confess that I felt one of the major plot points was shuffled off without proper attention.  No spoilers from me! And I don't want to overplay it. It didn't spoil the book for me - I still really enjoyed it.

"After years of barely bothering with makeup, I reached a point where I decided that I needed to look professional or something. I visited one of those premium makeup displays you find in department stores and got all the instructions I needed to achieve that, more or less, along with about $400 worth of makeup. To be fair to the makeup clerk, they evidently did a good job on more than just selling - I get compliments on my natural look. (Yes, really.) But I have been a slave to that routine and makeup line ever since.The Neutrogena eye shadow plus primer replaces three of the products I was using - a $20 brow lifting pencil, a $20 eyeshadow, and a (bet you can guess) $20 shadow eyeliner. It offers less quantities than the items I was using, but it's also currently less than the price of a single unit, and the compactness is a plus for me, as I travel. In writing the review, I've discovered that the line I uses offers a similar four-in-one product (so that saleswoman was even better at upselling than I knew), but even that is $35.00. The quality of the makeup seems pretty comparable to the line I've been using, and it works in the same way - swipe the brow, swipe the lids, crease and edge. Bam. The makeup goes on smoothly, blends well, and stays put.The one thing I find unacceptable about this product may come down to a matter of personal preference - I loathe the application sponge. I have been accustomed to using brushes and after several goes with the included sponge ditched it in favor of those. Aging skin (to be candid) gets thin and sensitive, and the sponge applicator feels a bit like sandpaper. The brushes seem to allow more precise control, anyway.On the whole, an effective makeup and, for me, a comparable bargain. It's also a reminder that maybe I ought to branch outside of the advice at the Benefit bar, now that I've mastered a basic routine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SVZ0U2W7YXKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLP9RSG#wasThisHelpful","R2SVZ0U2W7YXKS","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lightweight vacuum cleaner wins big points for versatility. It's got the usual attachments, but a big plus in the microfiber swipe - so much better than vacuuming alone for hardwoods. The low profile head of the main vacuum is a nice feature, as it fits neatly under the edge of a lot of my furniture, allowing me better reach on lighter clean days when I don't want to move furniture (and on those units like my bed which will probably stay put until I move or die). It's narrow enough to fit in the gap between one of my toilets and the cabinet next to it. Not having to bend as often to clean that space is a major plus! Alas, it's not quite narrow enough to do the same in the other bathroom. It's the first vacuum I've ever used that can go from carpet to hard flooring without fiddling with settings. The detachable base makes this a dream for stairs.It is a budget priced vacuum, though, and in a few areas it shows. First, this unit is noisy. Vacuums are, of course, but this one as from the get-go had a squeal like a fleeing boar (I imagine), particularly unpleasant in small spaces. Second, I miss the retractable cord. Third, while an excellent lightweight vacuum, it really doesn't have the suction of my older, full-size cleaner. I cleaned a 2,000 square foot house - top to bottom - with this unit and only filled the canister halfway. My larger vacuum seems to suck dirt from the center of the earth, and it accordingly must be emptied more often.As a final note, I have some trouble getting one of the attachments in and out of its storage point on the unit. I had to get my husband to put it on the first few times, as it was simply too tight for me to do it, and it's still hard enough that I find myself avoiding using the tool.On balance, I think this is an excellent vacuum for those who want versatility and portability, but those seeking heavy-duty cleaning may prefer to use it supplementally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATAJFB6QKRVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNKSRYG#wasThisHelpful","R2ATAJFB6QKRVV","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfamiliar with Martin's blog, I picked this up because I like memoirs and I love people who undertake challenges like this - ""Over the course of 195 weeks, food writer and blogger Sasha Martin set out to cook--and eat--a meal from every country in the world."" I was looking forward to reading about this journey in detail - something akin to A.J. Jacobs, perhaps the excellent The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible, I guess - and was a little taken aback to find the memoir more traditional in layout, the cooking challenge just a small part of it, later in the text. I guess the blog readers got the full details on the project. This is a  more intimate look at a life, chronological, starting before the author was even born.While I didn't exactly get what I was expecting, what I got was quite good. Martin's story is a poignant one, with a lot of challenges, ranging from extreme poverty to the repeated loss of loved ones. Cooking becomes a metaphor for connection and more, an actual vehicle for it, as childhood meals with family (or foster family) lead to her creating family and community of her own. Heart-tugging and heart-warming, Martin's story makes no apologies for the failings of her loved ones, but simply relates what she lives through and how she manages to start afresh.Aside from my surprise with the content, I really enjoyed the book and the recipes I've tried. (Yes, there are recipes: doable and delicious.)I do have a quibble with the title (though not the type to ding the rating): ""Life From Scratch."" Martin deserves all due credit for building something strong out of what she inherited, but everything in this book emphasizes that her life is not that. It's more akin to friendship bread. The recipes themselves are the starter, a web of traditions from her heritage and beyond. Her book becomes a way of passing that on. With a host of insights and recipes, Martin offers fodder for our building something ourselves.Strong and readable prose, clear direction, good recipes, and a likable, candid author make this a memoir to recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13R7W9O651YMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426213743#wasThisHelpful","R13R7W9O651YMI","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This coffeemaker has some sweet features. I love that the unit can brew large or small without loss of quality. As the only person in my house who drinks coffee, I don't need a massive coffeemaker on a daily basis, but I have regular company that swells my demand considerably. This unit serves both needs. It will also easily adjust the strength of the coffee. I'm particularly fond of the bold setting.The so-called ""sneak a cup"" feature works as advertised - on testing, I was able to remove the carafe for an early serving without creating a mess on the counter.The stainless steel carafe here is obviously going to be more sturdy than a glass coffee carafe. Good thing it's thick, as the heat of the coffee relies on it. Without a heating plate, it needs the insulation.  It's got a nice wide opening, which makes it easy to clean.I do wish that it was possible to view the coffee level in the pot. I have an electric water pitcher with a steel case, but it has a thin sliver of glass that allows you to see the contents. I realize that there might be a trade-off in temperature, but not knowing how much coffee is left in the pot is kind of disappointing.It would also be nice if it would make some noise to let you know when it's finished, particularly as the brewing cycle can run quite long (especially on stronger settings).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQME54P2PFZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I3V0#wasThisHelpful","R3KQME54P2PFZ1","AOEP96629WHHA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOEP96629WHHA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm surprised how much heat this little guy can push out. It easily sits below a desk, but this is really meant to be left out in the open for all in a room to experience. Really, this is overkill for heating up your feet at work.It has a digital display that lets you choose a range of temperatures, so it doesn't overheat a room. This isn't just an on/off switch, so it can tend to turn on and off to regulate the temperature of a room.And it does that masterfully. I've set this up in our master bedroom and my mancave, and in both instances I notice a difference immediately. Seriously, the second it is turned on it is blowing out hot air.Keep in mind that this does blow the hot air, it isn't like some other ones that radiate heat. The blower isn't loud, but it is present if you are sensitive to that. Very ambient noise, like the fan of a computer power supply.Finally, I appreciate the safety features. If it gets knocked over, it turns off. Actually, it tends to get a little upset if I try to move it without turning it off.Overall, I'm very impressed and happy with this heater.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH6LQK9NF8NCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVF0HYA#wasThisHelpful","RH6LQK9NF8NCC","A3F3B6HY9RJI04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B6HY9RJI04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like it, and will probably use it on occasion if it the mood hits, but I don't love it.First, I want to address the price. I hate the practice that some watching companies have of stating an MSRP of 5-10 times what they intent to sell it for. I'll admit, that is a huge turnoff for me on this watch. I'm probably alone on this...There are some aspects of this watch that I do like. The blue face is very unique and eye-catching, especially since it changes with every small adjustment in the light. The face itself is rather large, but that seems to be what people prefer these days.I also like the band. First, leather is generally more comfortable to wear, but I've never seen a leather band with a clasp. It took me a minute to get the concept around it, but it looks like a leather band but you don't unstrap the band when you want to take it off, you open the clasp and slide it off like a metal band. Really weird to me at first, but it grew on me. After securing the clasp and then running the leather band through the two loops, this is nearly impossible to have it fall off or get stolen. Plus, I like the look and the feel of the leather.There are a few things about this watch that I'm not a big fan of. First, it is really, really thick.Again, that's probably the style these days. It has a turn button the side for adjusting the time and day, but that also has another decoration around it to... I don't know. Look pretty? I guess? It doesn't do anything else and it is just not that attractive to me. The metal part of the watch that connects to the watch band is really sharp. I feel like I could slice cheese or open mailing boxes with it or something. It pulled on my hair when I first put it on, but that doesn't seem to happen as much anymore. The date window is really tiny, so you better have some good eyesight. What surprises me is that the hour and minute hands have a white area near the ends, which I thought might have been made of some sort of glow-in-the-dark material like I've seen on a ton of other watches I've owned. Nope. Just decoration. So at night, there is no way of telling the time on this watch without turning on the lights. So, beware of that!

"I was hoping to get something that was a little bit classy looking, but I wasn't really blown away by this watch when it came in. Don't get me wrong, it's okay, but not amazing. It felt heavy on my wrist, the bezel doesn't rotate, and the buttons on the side seem to be larger than they really need to be. I'm certainly glad I didn't fork out seven hundred bucks for this!! Pricing it closer to $100 is closer to its real value, as I do think I can get more years out of this watch than most things cheaper than this.But it does keep good time and the lens is very clear. Oh, and the box it came in was downright amazing! I've... never complimented a watch for that before.This might be a vain test, but when I wear my Citizen (which cost me closer to the $700), I get compliments on a regular basis.

"I think this is my sixth Otterbox I've tried out on my S6. The SYMMETRY version was my favorite, but I'm not sure if this overtakes that title or comes really close. I like the feel of the leather and I love the little slit to carry one card, which is what beats out the SYMMETRY. The screen is obviously a little more protected. However, I do have to deal with the flap when the phone is in use, which can sometimes work and sometimes get in the way. Oh, I also like how it tilts forward when you fold the flap under itself. It isn't much of a tilt, but the slight tilt is still better than just laying down flat when I want to watch something. I love the easy access to the power slot too, no need to remove any plastic covers or anything to get that to work. Thank goodness, it was one problem I had with some of the beefier cases. Otherwise, the thickness is about the same as I got with SYMMETRY... just a little more, and it provides some really good protection.You know what, I change my mind, I think this is now my favorite. There are so many more pros than cons on this. Don't get me wrong, all the OtterBoxes have been amazing, but I find myself using this case exclusively with no strong desire to go back to the SYMMETRY.The only thing that would make this more excellent is if the S6 would turn on when I open the flap, but I suspect that is more a limitation with the S6 than the case.If you like to fully protect your phone with one case, but don't want to go with one of the larger OtterBoxes that turns your phone into a (well-protected) brick, then I highly recommend looking at this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8SRLKO64ZAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJK46Q2#wasThisHelpful","RM8SRLKO64ZAX","A3F3B6HY9RJI04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B6HY9RJI04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I mean like REALLY REALLY fast. I'll turn it on, grab some frozen meat out of the freezer, and throw it on and it will hit the grill already sizzling.Cleanup is a bit of a mixed bag. The non-stick surface cleans up easily, but there is no easy way to really get in there and clean it. I just poured water on it while using paper towels to basically push the water and gunk toward the grease catch. Took about four cups to do the entire thing, I just made sure to empty the grease catch frequently so it didn't spill over onto my shoes.

"I had several people play with this since we are evaluating the keyboards we have where I work. I wasn't so much suggesting this one because of the niche market this aims at, but wanted them to feel the mechanical keyboard side of it with the quieter keys. Across the board, everybody said two things: ""Ooooooh, pretty lights! The keyboard feels nicer than the crap Dell sends as default, but the other mechanical keyboards feel better, though this is quieter.""To expand, yes, the lights are pretty. I wouldn't allow them in a work environment because, by default, the keys light up for a second after getting pressed and that has ""guess my password"" written all over it. I know they can be overridden, but this seems like one extra hole I'd have to patch up from an IT perspective. But, the lights are pretty awesome! After hooking this up at home, I do love how it looks walking into the room to use my computer.This does have a somewhat mechanical feel to it, which I like. They aren't the red or black buttons, which most people (including myself) prefer, but these are much more quiet. Significantly. Those who tried it did say that the louder ones would not be good in a cubicle environment because the neighbor would always hear them typing. So they actually preferred this keyboard (or something like it) in those situations.I'm surprised how quiet it actually is, while still being pretty responsive to the touch. Not my favorite to type on, but it is still a positive experience.Some other things: I like how you can customize the light show. I also like the media bar in the function keys, though it does take a bit of getting used to finding the function key just right to the (huge) space bar.At two hundred bucks, I'm a little surprised that this keyboard doesn't have USB 3.0 built into the back, but only USB 2.0. I'd expect nothing but the best when spending that much money.Which brings me to the build of the keyboard as a whole... it feels kind of light and flimsy. I wonder how it will hold up in the long run with heavy usage. Probably fine, but most mechanical keybaords are built like tanks and the plastic-like feel of this one kind of worries me. I'd be very nervous if I were in the habit of transporting it on a regular basis, but I just hooked it up to my home computer and it should be staying there until something better comes along.All in all, I like it, but I don't think I $200-like it. I was given this for free in exchange for an honest review. Honestly, I'd be upset if I had actually spent the $200. If (when) the price comes down, I'll recommend it more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV6ODB6E75Z07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SB6DO6M#wasThisHelpful","RV6ODB6E75Z07","A3F3B6HY9RJI04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B6HY9RJI04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great little audio receiver for my DSLR video camera for small video projects. I did a project about a year ago and something like this would have been extremely helpful, especially when working with XLR mics and multiple mic sources.

"I'm amazed how this bad guy will punch through so much paper especially with the staple portion being in the middle of the stapler. I'd think it would get more leverage at the end of it, myself. It is very effective, though you don't want to use it on just a couple sheets of paper because the longer staples will curl back in on itself and poke through the top. Just use a standard staple for less than 20 sheets of paper. This is for larger staple jobs, like 30-50--though I thought it did just fine with 20-30 as well.Also, you don't have to be the Incredible Hulk to staple with this. It really does take less effort, like most modern staplers. If you've got an older stapler that you're struggling with, this is a great replacement at a reasonable price.Oh, I thought the purple thing at the bottom for clearing jams was pretty creative. Finally, a stapler that isn't too proud to say, ""I'm going to mess up now and then, but now i've made it easier to get me back and working."" I've only use it for a week and it hasn't jammed yet. Maybe with more usage and age?I only have one complaint: the staples coming out the middle of the stapler. I wish it came out on the far end of the arm like, you know, every stapler out there.

"Pros:- I was surprised how loud this little thing could get.- This isn't something that is phenomenal, or something you'd use to entertain a room full of people, but it worked out well for playing some music or a movie louder than my cell phone or Kindle Fire could dish out by themselves. Also, I could position the speakers to face me, unlike the cell/Fire, which point away from me. This is a great substitute.- I haven't used it to charge any of my devices (good idea, but I haven't got that desperate yet).- I only have one, so I didn't test its stereo capabilities, but I thought that was an interesting idea.- Setup was easy.- I like that you can also go with an auxiliary cable instead of only bluetooth.- Pretty light weight and portable- Pictures indicated that it was a bit weatherproof.

"Got this in and my wife loved it. She thought it looked really well (she's a fan of silver) with her wardrobes. It's been a couple of weeks, and it has (so far) kept perfect timing. The Japanese quartz movement keeps excellent time at a much smaller price than a certain other country. She has tiny little bird arms, and I don't have a watch kit, so she had to go to a watch dealer and get it sized to her arm. So if you've got tiny wrists, this should still size well for you. The clasp is different than anything I've seen before. It clasps twice, instead of once. To me, it strikes me as a second point of potential failure, but it really holds on there when she is wearing it. It does take a little bit of force for the clasps to snap into place.Overall, it's a great time keeper and much cheaper than several other watches she's considered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NCHXUXWSD67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087IWCBC#wasThisHelpful","R2NCHXUXWSD67","A3F3B6HY9RJI04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B6HY9RJI04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maybe I should have been forewarned by the fact that the perfect Gwyneth Paltrow is in this film, but masochist that I am, I watched it anyway (the other actors weren't as irritating).  I'm one of those people who thinks that 12-Step programs have done much more harm than good, and this movie sure didn't change my mind. Tim Robbins, for example, plays a sex addict in ""recovery"" for many years and a genuine 12-Step cultist. He speaks in aphorisms and believes in every myth that AA preaches--e.g., that if you're not in a 12-Step program and going to meetings, you're ""white knuckling"".  And the actors who play ""recovering"" addicts repeatedly refer to sex addiction as a ""disease"" rather than taking responsibility for their own actions.A comedy this isn't.  This is an extended ad for AA and a film for 12-Step True Believers.  I am not one of those. The reality is that Alcoholics Anonymous and all its siblings have an extremely low success rate (5-10%). But ""Thanks for Sharing"" makes it look like one big touchy feely group grope with an icky sticky happy ending.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NF92ET0SKT6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNBS8MQ#wasThisHelpful","R1NF92ET0SKT6G","A6J7GN6ZOR085","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6J7GN6ZOR085?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've watched about 40 minutes of this film so far and I can guess where it's going.  It is pro-Christian God and full of offensive stereotypes (the ever-so-polite Duck Dynasty couple who spends the week nuking mallards and Sundays piously attending church; the smug, cynical, atheistic philosophy professor who mentally abuses his Christian girlfriend; the sweet, humble Christian student who earnestly wants to prove the existence of God; a disaffected Muslim girl with a big bad father, who secretly wants to be a Christian and whose preacher of choice is the well-known homophobe Franklin Graham;  and--most offensive for me as an animal rights activist--the brash and apparently God-less and friend-less animal advocate who challenges that nice Duck Dynasty couple and ends up with cancer).  It goes on like that. The non-Christians are all nasty and screwed up, while the Christians are without exception the nicest people in the world.When I was in my 20s working a lot of temp jobs, I got to know a co-worker who identified herself as a born-again Christian.  So I asked her what happened to people who weren't Christians after death, and she replied without hesitation that they went to Hell.  I never forgot that.  And it pretty much cured me of any illusions I had about Christianity being a tolerant, loving, peaceful religion, because basically her beliefs condemned not only atheists and agnostics to the eternal fires, but also anyone who follows other religions (Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jew, Jain, etc.).I recently lost my life partner, who, when I once asked him if he was an atheist, looked at me like he was puzzled and said he wasn't even interested in the question of whether or not God exists.  It was kind of like asking someone who doesn't care about sports what baseball team they're fans of.  It's a meaningless question.  And when he learned that he was dying, he didn't change his tune at all.  He made a comment not long before he passed away that he knew that after he died there was nothingness and he would cease to exist, and that was OK with him.  He was someone who did a great deal of good in the world, lived his life to the fullest, and many people loved and admired him.  You don't need to believe in ""God"" to be a good person.  Not at all.I was raised, somewhat reluctantly, as a Catholic by a mother who also never took much of an interest in the existence or non-existence of God.  In fact, when she was in an assisted living facility dying of cancer, she specifically asked me to keep the visiting clergyman away from her because she thought he was creepy.  I'm a bit different. After I left Catholicism behind in my early 20s, I still retained a curiosity about spiritual matters which has lasted many years, with a special fascination for eastern religions.  I would call myself a long-time agnostic, and it's for that reason that I'm watching this film.I hope it doesn't turn out to be the stereotypical Christian propaganda rant, but it looks like it's definitely going in that direction.  Clearly nobody has ever proven, nor are they likely to ever prove, whether God exists. But it doesn't follow that you should swallow a lot of religious gobbledygook on the off chance that you may be rewarded someday by a judgmental God who may deign to admit you to Heaven.  I believe that people should be good for the sake of being good, not for the promise of getting something in return, because that makes the whole process seem totally self-serving.I finally got through this film and I have to warn you it's a huge Christian propaganda piece.  I don't want to give away the plot, but I will say that creationism rears its silly head, the student tasked with proving God isn't dead only manages to show that scientists haven't proven his nonexistence (maybe that's because scientists don't concern themselves with theology?), it's unashamedly anti-Islam, there are highly improbable last-minute conversions, the Duck Dynasty killer makes another heroic appearance, and it's just generally absurd. Ick sticky skin crawly.  And I'm not even an atheist.I will say the acting is very professional, with a number of attractive young actors, so I gave it two stars.  But it's so biased against anything that isn't Christian that it's downright depressing. I didn't read the credits--I started fast forwarding toward the end--but I imagine Franklin Graham had a hand in it.  No gay characters whatsoever.  Watch it to know what to beware of, but take it with a boulder of salt.This is an honest review written by a real customer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM9XL2UOTYXT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFDLLGC#wasThisHelpful","RM9XL2UOTYXT0","A6J7GN6ZOR085","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6J7GN6ZOR085?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People with Asperger's no longer have to feel embarrassed about themselves. The 21st century is replete with them. It's downright trendy to be an Aspie. Bill Gates and the Silicon Valley geeks have done very well despite their conspicuous presence on the autism spectrum. And Temple Grandin is another example of someone with high-functioning autism who was raised as normally as possible and told that she could do anything she wanted, just like everyone else, and has been successful. That's the good news.The bad news is the fact that she chose to work as a Cattle Mafia enabler. I can't help but think of World War II, when Jews, gypsies, gays, and disabled people arrived by cattle car at European concentration camps, only to be greeted by lovely classical music and a courteous speech about how they were going to be allowed to shower and clean up after their long journey. They were deliberately calmed down so as not to be intractable and cause trouble for the Nazi guards, and then herded off to the poison showers. This is essentially what Grandin does. She tricks cows into thinking that they're in no danger with her specially designed walkways, when in fact they're being marched off to an ugly slaughter.While her ability to transcend her Asperger's, create a prosperous career, and write books is admirable, I cannot respect her choice of industries to work in. She presents herself as an animal lover and advocate who can communicate with nonhuman animals, and this film certainly reflects that. Yet she is not a vegetarian/vegan (claims that she tried it once and it made her feel sick) and is now trying to expand her operations to corporate farms, to fool millions more animals into imagining that humans have their best interests at heart.As an Aspie myself, I can empathize with the problems Grandin has with noise, touch, interpreting social cues, anxiety, etc., and Claire Dane does a masterful job of portraying Grandin's physical and psychological issues.Some people would argue that at least Grandin is doing something positive for the unfortunate genetic freaks created by the agriculture industry for human consumption. But as an ethical vegan, I say that so much more could be done, like encouraging consumers to stop eating and wearing animal products while educating them on the healthy way to do that and how a plant-based life can literally save our planet. People have got to stop swallowing the corporate Kool-Aid about the mythical superiority of animal protein. They shouldn't be obsessing on their steaks because there's an awful lot at stake here.This is an honest review written by a real customer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK3JGDWK39I6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Q35PLI#wasThisHelpful","RK3JGDWK39I6H","A6J7GN6ZOR085","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6J7GN6ZOR085?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have years of experience with Cushex (I gave it to a now departed dog off and on for symptoms of Cushing's), and although I can't prove it scientifically, I believe it extended her life and made her more comfortable.  She was diagnosed at the age of 7 with Cushing's after a dex test, and died at 13.  I rejected the conventional drug treatment, which was basically giving her DDT every day (as my vet recently called it).

"I've been using this product for probably 20 years, and I'm now 64.  I wouldn't say it's a miracle potion, but my facial skin is mostly wrinkle-free and looks healthy--and I only apply it about every other day.FYI, Unilever, one of the consumer product megacorps, now owns St. Ives, and this product has changed. I happen to have an old pre-Unilever jar which states the product is not tested on animals, but the other day, when I bought a new jar at a local pharmacy, I noticed that that claim was gone and there was a Unilever logo in the corner.  So I emailed Unilever asking if the product had been tested on animals, and their response was a link to a web page that contained an awful lot of PR BS about how they're trying to evolve into a non-animal testing company, blah blah blah. But no specific information about this moisturizer was offered.I compared the ingredients in the old jar to the new one, and I noticed that at least three of the natural ingredients are now missing and the order of ingredients has been shuffled.  So for any of you who are experiencing skin irritation, there may be good reason for that.  It's not the same product it used to be.  Beware.  I'm returning my jar to the store I bought it at and I'll be looking for an animal-kind moisturizer to replace it.Please consider writing your representative in Congress to co-sponsor the Humane Cosmetics Act.  The E.U., Israel, Norway, and India have already banned the inhumane and unscientific practice of animal testing on cosmetics. More accurate results can be obtained from human-based cell and tissue testing methods.If you want more information on cruelty-free cosmetics, check out, on the NEAVS (New England Anti-Vivisection Society) website, the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC), which certifies more than 500 brands that do not test on animals. Another excellent source is Cruelty Free International, which is a global campaign to end animal testing (more information on NEAVS website). You can watch the video by Ricky Gervais and read about actor Peter Dinklage's association with this campaign.And did you know that besides being unethical, animal testing produces severe environmental pollution?

I found this one and liked the crazy ""Aztec"" pattern, and it was definitely cheap enough for my purposes.  Fortunately I discovered before I ordered it that it's not made in Women's sizes but in Junior sizes, so I got a large instead of my usual medium.It arrived today and I'm glad I got the bigger size, because even in large there's not a lot of extra room for a sweater.  The hood, however, is so big that it actually covers my eyes, so I'll have to fix that by maybe wearing a scarf around the neck (or not using the hood).  I'm under 5'2"" and the sleeves are a bit long, but it looks OK if I fold them back because there are black cuffs sewn on underneath the cover fabric.So I'm giving this jacket four stars because it could be a better fit, but it feels toasty, it's made well, and I like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1149LMCLS3EQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4TJMVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1149LMCLS3EQE","A6J7GN6ZOR085","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6J7GN6ZOR085?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I must admit that I wasn’t expecting much with this spread. I am not a fan of Nutella’s product – I don’t dislike it, I just don’t care for it.This spread, on the other hand, I do like! It has a nice taste that is good combination of chocolate and almonds. It tastes good on toast, but actually tastes best when combined in a sandwich with peanut butter.

"Liquid Silk is made by BodyWise Limited, which also makes the excellent Maximus Personal Lubricant. Liquid Silk is a very good lubricant; it is indeed smooth as silk, and less sticky than most water-based lubricants. It also lasts longer than most water-based lubricants I have tried. Clean-up is easy, and the product does not seem to stain bedding – which is really nice!Now, water-based lubricants have a bad reputation because they have been known to cause yeast infections in some women. This is because they are usually glycerin-based. Liquid Silk, on the other hand, is based on propylene glycol, which is more long-lasting, doesn’t get gummy, and is not likely to cause yeast infections! That’s a huge plus!Only one caveat on this product, though. Though Liquid Silk is not silicone-based, it does nonetheless contain some silicone in it. This means, that you should never use Liquid Silk with any sex-toys made from silicone. This is because the liquid silicone makes the skin of the toy dissolve, making it sticky and gross, and eventually destroying it.So, don’t use Liquid Silk with silicone toys. But, use Liquid Silk! It’s actually a really great personal lubricant that works like a dream.(Review of Liquid Silk Lubricant)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPORSRRBO842E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIUFYDM#wasThisHelpful","RPORSRRBO842E","A1P27BGF8NAI29","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P27BGF8NAI29?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It seems like not all that long ago that coconut oil was under attack as some sort of poisonous food. Now, after more reasoned examination, it has been found that coconut oil is actually a rather healthy oil that, with judicious use, is a very good addition to your diet.I like this particular coconut oil for a number of reasons. First of all, I like that it is organically raised. Secondly, I like that it is carefully pressed and left unrefined. As such, you are getting a product that is about as close to nature as your can get.The first thing I did when I opened the bottle was inhale the lovely coconutty smell, which I love. Then, I made some good old fashioned popcorn. As you have always heard, the best popcorn is always made with coconut oil, as the taste is phenomenal. Since then, I have used it for a number of recipes, finding that it worked very well with my dishes, especially the pork and chicken.I have also used it on my skin, and thought that it did a good job – especially on my feet.So, if you want to get some really good, all natural coconut oil, then consider Island Fresh’s Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.

"Assembly: This set took me about ten minutes to put together. I did not find it hard to put together, as I have (all too much!) experience in assembling Hot Wheels sets and other toys. It only takes a modicum of mechanical ability, and some patience.Operation: This set is similar to sets I have seen where the cars are lifted up an incline, and then allowed to “race” down the track to the bottom, where they can be lifted up again. Unlike those other sets, though, this one is not motorized. Instead, it counts on the child to pump the mechanism to lift the cars more manually.Cars: This set comes with only one car, which is a bit of a disappointment, but my little guy experimented with all sorts of cars (and trucks and tractors) from his toy box, and found others that worked as well.Conclusion: My little guy loves cars and loves Pixar’s movie, Cars, so he was thrilled with this toy. He sits and plays with it a surprisingly long time. I like that it is not motorized, and requires him to be involved in making it work.I will be interested to see the other Pixar-Cars sets that Mattel is going to come up with, I can’t imagine how they would work together.Anyway, he loves it and plays with it.

"There's a new rabbit in town, and you have got to meet him!This toy from California Exotic Novelties is a well-designed piece of bedroom hardware. Like most rabbits, it has the rotating head, spinning beads in the shaft, and a vibrating tongue. However, this one goes far beyond the original rabbit in almost everyway.First of all, there is a ""Magic Love Bead"" near the head. This hard-point is right near the center of the rotation and can really help with G-spot stimulations.Secondly, the spinning beads are locked in place, which means no jamming. If you have one of the early rabbits, you know that that was a problem. This definitely helps prolong the life of the toy.Thirdly (and most importantly!) is the piercing on the tongue of the rabbit. It is a traditional barbell shape, and when the vibrations are turned on, it produces some pretty fantastic clitoral stimulation!I do, though, have two complaints against this wonderful toy. The lesser one is that the lights on the handle are unnecessarily bright. This can be a bit irritating when the toy is used in the dark, dazzling the eyes.The greater one is that while the bead on the shaft is completely covered in plastic, the barbell on the tongue is not. This means that one has to be very careful to clean the hole and the barbell. To make matters worse, the shaft of the barbell has a groove in it that can easily harbor bacteria, and since it is inside the plastic of the tongue, you must work to clean it out.That said, though, this really is a fantastic toy, one that produces a lot of pleasure.

"This past weekend a friend of mine moved into a rental home that had been closed up for some six months - the house was dirty and had a musty, unclean odor. I had just gotten this cleaner, so I thought that this would be a good test for it. I brought over my bucket and mop, my rags and sponges, rolled up my sleeves and got to work.The first thing I noticed was that this cleaner had a very pleasant smell to it. I cleaned the counters with it, scrubbed the sink and the tub with it, and finally mopped the floors with it. As a matter of fact, when I was done, I poured some down each of the drains.It did a great job of cleaning - exactly as you would expect from a Mr. Clean product. It left everything looking...OK, not new, it's an old house, but it did leave it looking nice and clean. The smell is much better in the house (the basement needs to be bleached, it leaks some and the sitting moisture was not a good thing), and she and I were quite pleased with the results.So, I gave this cleaner what I would consider an acid test, and it came through with flying colors.

"This is a fun piece of bedroom attire, perhaps the most unique piece you've ever purchased. To a large extent, it's two pieces in one. The one piece is a leather harness that wraps around you and puts you on display. It screams, ""Take me, I'm yours."" The other piece is a ring-gag, with chains that connect to ""bull-nosed"" nipple clamps. The combined appearance is a really exciting ""sex-slave"" look.The quality of the parts is generally good. The parts are not heavy leather and stainless steel, but rather a softer and gentler light leather or leatherette with light metallic fastenings. The overall feel is lightweight and reasonably comfortable.The o-ring in the gag is made of plastic, for the protection of the wearer's teeth, and is relatively small. This means that it will not take too long to get used to wearing it. But, it also limits what can be put through the ring and into the mouth. The guys might want to keep that in mind.When the wearer's head moves, it can also pull on the nipple clamps, adding more stimulation to play. These clamps are of the ""bull-nosed"" variety, and look nastier than they really are. They are coated in some sort of rubber, which provides a certain measure of comfort. Each clamp has a screw in the middle which you can tighten to decrease pressure on the nipple, or loosen to increase pressure. The pressure can be set anywhere from minimal to OUCH! A common technique is to place the clamp with minimum pressure, and then slowly loosen the screen until the pressure reaches the optimum combination of comfort and pleasure.Like I said, this is a fun harness to wear - it looks a lot more sinister and uncomfortable than it really is.

"I saw the C-string years ago, but only recently went ahead and got one. When you first see it, your first thought is that it's a joke! But no, this is a series piece of lingerie.First of all, let me describe it. The C-string has a flexible frame with a soft and wide area in the front, tapering to a narrow strip that fits between the buttocks, rather like a thong. Unlike a thong, however, there are no straps connecting the front and back via the sides, instead the flexible frame causes the C to hug your bottom.When worn under a dress or slacks, the C-string leaves absolutely no visible panty lines. Visually it is a stunning success, superior to any sort of panty out there that I am familiar with.You might think that it won't hold on, but it does a great job. When putting it on, especially after a washing, you will want to squeeze it closed a bit to make sure it is good and tight. The feeling of being hugged by the C-string is a bit unusual at first, but it's not uncomfortable and you'll get used to it quickly.Now, if you are going to be jumping around, I would not count on it holding on. I've never had it fall off, even when dancing, but I would hate to have a very public wardrobe malfunction, so I can imagine situations where I would not wear this.As for wearing this for sexual play, it's been quite a huge success for me! Its exoticness and minimalness makes it a hit. Also, when worn under a skirt, it can be quickly and easily removed, and just as quickly and easily replaced. Even just knowing that you are wearing it can drive him crazy.So, I think that this is a great piece of lingerie - functional and sexy!(Review of C-string)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMHHR4P2NUSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5F2GIC#wasThisHelpful","RHMHHR4P2NUSE","A1P27BGF8NAI29","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P27BGF8NAI29?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Shibue Strapless Panty is a rather different form of underwear. It is specialized for women who really don't want to show any sort of a panty line, or for those who don't want to show the side of their underwear due to a very high leg or very low side. They also work great for specialized occasions, when you want to maintain your dignity in spite of a minimum of coverage, such as when going for a massage or a spray tanning, or to try on swimsuits or lingerie.They fit on snugly, and you must avoid oils and lotions in the area, so that the adhesive can attach firmly to the skin. Let me be clear, the area must be smooth and clean.Once attached, they are comfortable and hold on well, though they do make going to the bathroom somewhat problematical. They should not be worn for more than six hours, so they are definitely not for all-day wear. Also, I must say I wonder what would happen if I got sweaty while wearing one.

The corn popped up quite nicely, with very few unpopped kernels left in the pan.The popcorn it produced was surprisingly tasty, even without adding anything more than some table salt. Yeah, I think that this is a very good popping corn. If you want to pop corn the old fashioned way, then don't cheap out and get crappy popping corn, get Kernel Season's Popping Corn!Let me make a recommendation here: a real good taste combination is this popping corn and San Francisco Salt Company's Cherrywood Smoked Sea Salt.

"OK, when you think of a vibrator, the shape that most readily leaps to mind is the torpedo-shape. The Jopen Vr9 is nothing like torpedo-shaped; instead it looks like a magic wand, and it is one!Instead of using girth to provide a ""full"" feeling, the Vr9 is designed for precision work, to stimulate the woman's pleasure points. Shaped something like a forte symbol, it has a vibrator at each end. You can use the thick end for some fullness, or the skinny end for more precise work. The elegant curves of the Vr9 allow for stimulation of the clitoris or the G-Spot, or anywhere else.Like all of the Jopen vibrators, the Vr9 is covered with a skin of warm and hypoallergenic silicone. It is fully waterproof, which means that virtually any part of the toy can be used for stimulation, and the whole thing can be washed under running water. It has no removable batteries, only rechargeable, built-in ones.There are two buttons in the middle, one each to control the two vibrators on the end - the buttons are very small, meaning that you will want to familiarize yourself with them, before you use it in your love-making. And finally, while the Vr9 looks like a forte, it is remarkably pianissimo, very quiet indeed.Oh yeah, and don't forget that the manufacturer boasts that all of their vibrators come with a free 1-year warrantee, so if something goes wrong with your Vr9, then contact them right away.So, to summarize, let me say this.Pros: Unique design and functionality, silicone, waterproof, rechargeable, quiet, and 1-year warrantee.Cons: Small buttons.If you want to expand your horizons a bit, try the Jopen Vr9.

"Trojan has recently moved into the sex toy field, and one of their best products is the Tri-Phoria. The Tri-Phoria is an ""outie"" vibrator - that is to say, a non-insertable one.The Tri-Phoria fits quite easily in the hand, and has three interchangeable tips. The vibrator has eight settings - five different speeds and three different pulse patterns. The handle is waterproof for easy cleaning, and the three tips are made of warm and soft silicone, which means that they can be thoroughly cleaned with bleach or even through boiling. The vibrator is powered with one AA battery.This is a very good vibrator, with lots of good features - it really works! I liked that the toy can be properly cleaned, and I thought that it had a nice range of power settings - one is sure to be just right for you. Now, compared to some toys, this one is a bit on the noisy side, so be careful about using it in a completely quiet house!

"Green Toys, Inc. is a California company that specializes in making environmentally friendly toys. How are they environmentally friendly? The company uses plastic made from recycled milk jugs (recycled right here in the US), forms them into safe toys (manufactured right here in the US), and packages them in recycled boxes (boxes that contain no plastics or metal ties, and are themselves 100% recyclable).Green Toys toys are really great for young children. They are designed to be compliant with all US and California safety tests, and contain no Phthalates or Bisphenol A - potentially carcinogenic materials that used to be used widely in plastics. I also loved the packaging that did not require 10 minutes to undo!It's a fun little toy that a little guy or gal can take outside and roll around in the dirt, one that you can then pop into the dishwasher.

"I always thought that any water-based lubricant was, by definition, glycerin-based. Well, Nooky Lube has proved me wrong!Chemical Makeup - Nooky Lube is water-based, which is nice because that means that it does not damage latex condoms and toys the way that oil-based lubes can, and it does not damage silicone-based toys the way that silicone-based lubes can. Also, Nooky Lube is not glycerin-based, which is great, because there is some evidence to believe that glycerin can help bring on yeast infections.Smell and Taste - The first thing I noticed was that Nooky Lube really and truly does not have a smell or a taste. I have tasted some pretty disgusting lubricants and this is a real change for the better!Viscosity - Some lubricants flow like water, which means that when you apply them to skin, they try to flow right off, dripping and making a mess. Nooky Lube is nice and thick, which makes applying it one less thing to worry about.Slipperiness - When first applied, Nooky Lube is hyper-slippery and causes everything to slip and slide! This lubricant really is up there with the best that I have ever used!Durability - Different lubricants tend to have different durabilities, which is to say that some last longer than others. Nooky Lube has a rather limited durability. We found that during play time, Nooky Lube had to be refreshed about every five minutes.Clean-up - Clean-up is always a must after using lubricants - oils and silicone-based lubes require it, and glycerin-based lubes become gummy and gross when left on the skin (plus it's easy to taste them when they are on your hands - disgusting!). Nooky Lube on the other hand seems to simply evaporate. After use, there seems to be nothing left - no stickiness, no taste, and no smell!Also, unlike many lubes, Nooky Lube does not seem to stain sheets, blankets or clothing. This is a really nice plus.Conclusion - Nooky Lube is an excellent lubricant, with a great range of properties. I love the way it evaporates away to nothing. If you need a long-lasting lube, then it will be one that leaves a residue and has to be carefully cleaned-up. Nooky Lube is relatively short-lasting but leaves little or nothing to be cleaned up.So, I say to use Nooky Lube liberally and have a ball!

"I have a eleven-year-old daughter who recently began learning how to play the Ocarina - a six-hole pendent Ocarina. So, when I was offered this instrument, I was more than happy to get it.This is, by the way, a serious instrument. Yes, it says, ""toy"" and you can use it as such, or as a cosplay prop, but you can learn to play it.The first thing that I noticed, when I opened it up, was that it is a very pretty looking thing. The one I received had a nice cobalt blue appearance, with no visible flaws in the finish. My daughter immediately switched her practice from the 6-hole Ocarina to this one.She says that the instruction booklet is not very good, but that the instrument itself sounds very nice. Quite often, in the late evening, I can hear her tootling away on this Ocarina, and it sounds surprisingly lovely.So, if you want to ""Legend of Zelda"" prop, then this is a good Ocarina for you to get - it looks very nice when worn around the neck on its included thong. But, if you want to get a good twelve-hole Ocarina and learn to play it, then you should also get this one as well.

"It's hard to give a confident, positive review on supplements with all the news about scams coming out today.Viva Labs seems to be relatively new (founded in 2011) kind of at the height of the nutritional supplement boom and it's difficult to find any legitimate reviews on their products.What I can say is that from the papers I've read most people don't get enough Vitamin C, RDA is less than 100mgs but some of the literature recommends about 500mg/day plus your fruits and veggies. From what I can tell it's safe to take up to 2000mg/day, and that it helps your body with all kinds of repair and nutrient absorption systems.These are 1000mgs so you only need to take 1 a day and you should be getting more than you need. Even if you eat another 500mg's (which is like 9 servings of fruits and veggies) you should be fine.They are in capsule form with a powder inside that, once I popped one open, definitely smells and tastes like the old, familiar, C vitamin tablets I got as a kid, minus the weird smell that always reminded me of pee. So, while not a lab based test, it definitely gave me a bit more confidence in them.The capsules are medium sized so they should go down without to much of a fight, they do for me anyway.The bottle says you should take these with a meal but so far, for me, if I don't eat they don't seem to make me feel sick or anything so I assume that's just to help absorption.So far no irritation in my stomach and it's nice to be able to take Vit C without the bitter taste or the pee smell :)I like em!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3577R8AURYL5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014Q8J2CS#wasThisHelpful","R3577R8AURYL5D","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just got the keyboard no more than 10 minutes ago and I already have it paired and working with my Galaxy S4 and my Galaxy Tab.Pairing was quick and functionality is super smooth. Set up is seriously like a 4 step process.Kinda wish there was a way to switch screens (if you have multiple home screens) or at least pull up and browse apps but as is it has plenty of functionality and everything works quickly.The only shortcut that doesn't seem to work for me is the apps button, which is supposed to pull up my active applications. However on my s4 if i hold down the home button it does the same thing and lo! Holding down the home key on the keyboard pulls up my open apps list.I like how the back lighting works, took me a second to figure out how to turn it on since the instructions are pretty much non-existant. Basically you hold down the function key and hit the less than key with an icon that looks like a... rising sun? I dunno, it's a light of some kind.That cycles the brightness and the Greater Than key cycles the color.What's cool is that the light goes off after a few seconds of being inactive and then clicks back on as soon as you touch a key.Back lighting is super important for me so I'm really happy with this feature.I'm not super happy with the feel of the keyboard, the keys don't really have much feel. They are super light and... ""clicky""? If that makes sense.The other thing that's kind of annoying is that there doesn't seem to be a way to make it un-pair, I can't even figure out how to turn it off, the power key doesn't seem to do anything. And if you accidentally hit a key it opens the search feature on your phone.There isn't much in the instructions about turning it off and it's definitely not the same method as turning it on.Currently I just turn off Bluetooth or un-pair from my phone and I'm good.Aside from those small gripes this is an awesome little keyboard and i cant wait to use it in my meetings when I'm taking notes.I like using google keep so I'm constantly swyping and then going back through and fixing the auto correct.

"I've only been taking these for a week so far but I have noticed a slight difference compared to the Glucosamine pills I was taking before.Less crunching and stiffness in my joints for sure. I've also been taking fish oil and a couple other supplements so it could be one of those as well but I've noticed a difference and that's what matters.What I can say is that I haven't gotten worse or lost the effects of taking Glucosamine/Chondroitin pills so they seem to be working and keeping me flexible.I lift weights about 4 times a week and at 40 it helps a lot to keep myself flexible and fluid.They are pretty big pills, I wouldn't call them horse pills but they aren't kids chewables either. If you've taken glucosamine tabs before they are pretty comparable and go down smooth with a big gulp of water.They only thing that threw me was they are bright yellow. Normally Glucosamine pills are white so that was a bit weird but checking the ingredients i dont see anything about coloring so I'm assuming its from the other ingredients.At any rate I'm happy with them so far and would recommend giving them a try if you're looking at supplements.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H4C9VMLMZDWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW3E2HW#wasThisHelpful","R3H4C9VMLMZDWL","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far I really like it.It's very compact so if you've got a DSLR with a battery pack it's not going to fit very well.It's also not ideal for a 70-200mm or anything that size. I can fit my large speed light but then i can fold the center flap over all the way.Right now I use it for a my Rebel T3i, my 50mm, my kit 18-55 and my large speedlight. It has a zip up pouch in the from with a couple of smaller pouches inside but surprisingly there are no pouches that seem to be dedicated to card storage. I say it's surprising because i have 4 other Case logic camera bags and they all have card pouches.The side pouches are super thin so you might get some small gray cards and some filters in there.Really it's a very compact bag for light use, not for a big shoot or carrying most of your gear around.Size aside, like most case logic bags, it's built solid. The molded base makes me wonder if these aren't the new replacements for the SLRC line.The have the camera sling in them just like those.By the way, the molded base on my SLRC packs has come in handy way to many times to count. I've set them down in snow and on wet concrete so many times. On top of that there's just more between your gear and the ground which I really like and became a bit spoiled by. I set one of my new bags (sand the molded base) down maybe a little harder than I should've because i was used to the case logic base. Gear was ok but the sound made my sphincter pucker for a second. Was no bueno!Matter of fact i have an SLRC-203 and I'm considering selling it now that I have this smaller bag. The 203 was just big enough to be awkward but not really big enough to carry a lot of gear comfortably.This bag carries almost the same amount of stuff but is much more compact and easy to tote.Great for travel or just being out and about with no real goals in mind.Definitely another solid entry in Case Logic's camera bag line.I'm keeping this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QK35K6OH1MKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ8DRMS#wasThisHelpful","R1QK35K6OH1MKN","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well obviously it looks really cool but how well does it work? Not to shabby.Aside from the toasting I love everything about this toaster. And even the toasting is ok.I like how it goes flat against my wall and takes up less counter depth. I like how it looks. The red is cool looking and watching the toaster glow red is kinda fun.My problem so far (I've only had it a couple days) is that it doesn't toast as hot as it's supposed to.If you look at the instruction manual it has a guide to show you what kind of toast to expect with each of the heat settings.By the guide a setting of 4 is a golden, restaurant style piece of toast, but I'm getting barely toasted. At 4 my toast comes out more like a 2.And it's not very even either.I don't get the toast I was expecting at 4 until I crank it to 5.5. In my old toaster this was a 3.Now once you get it up to that it does a great job and it seems to toast more evenly as well. On top of that you can see when the toast is the way you want it so you can just hit big cancel button to pop it out.It also has a reheat feature as well as a defrost and a setting for getting your bagels toasted and cooked through without burning.Overall I really like the toaster, I can speak to it's longevity but as far as a nice looking appliance that fits well on my counter and serves up toast, it does the job and looks good while doing it.It'll only hold 2 pieces of bread or 1 bagel sliced in half so if you're a massive bread consumer or a large family you might want to look at a 4 slot or bigger but for me and my daughter in this little apartment it's perfect.Definitely recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XW5C08CG07W2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGCKZNE#wasThisHelpful","R1XW5C08CG07W2","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have just started introducing my 6 year old to the Star Wars Trilogy and was super excited to see these come out.Not let down AT ALL by this model/toy.First of all it's super easy to assemble so my daughter was able to help with most of it. There were a couple of steps in the 9 step process that she needed my help with but beyond that she was completely capable of handling it.Next it has an electronic cockpit with lights and sound effects that is just wikked. The traditional Tie fighter scream as it flies by, the familiar blaster sounds not to mention it's just super cool looking. It has more detail than I expected and the light up cockpit (red led) is sweet.Honestly really impressed by these models. Cool looking enough to be a collectors item, easy enough to assemble to involve your little ones and then it has the lights and sounds like the original toys (I'm 40, used to have an OG X-Wing).Seriously very cool. Model kits are fun and the finished piece is basically like any other toy.It's been dropped twice now (on to carpet) and it's fine.If you're a fan this is a cool toy/model to have","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJX6L8AYY4BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125KV5RO#wasThisHelpful","R3EJX6L8AYY4BS","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been trying this for about 2 weeks now. Never really used much lotion so I've got some wrinkles starting to come in but I'm blessed with some good genetics so I still look pretty young. Still, those laugh lines and forehead wrinkles are starting to leave permanent creases and I figured it can't hurt to try taking better care of my skin.After 2 weeks I'm not seeing much difference as far as anti-aging, but I kind of expected that. What I have noticed is that, after I wash my face in the morning and put it on it does seem to hide/lessen some of the wrinkles and my skin does feel tighter. I can't tell if it's because I have a dry film of product on my face or if it's actually effecting my skin but it does seem to make a visual difference.It does seem to last almost all day but one really interesting thing I've noticed is that during my workout, while I have this on, my sweat tastes very sweet. Almost like I just rubbed my face down with sugar. I don't know if that's a good thing or not. The skeptic in me starts screaming ""Ha! You just rubbed a $40 placebo on your face!"" the other half of me is thinking, ""What's in this stuff? I wonder if maybe, sugar is good for your skin?""As far as brightening my skin, well it does seem to create a more, matte shine, less oily or dry looking..Either way I do see a difference when it's on, but not once I wash it off.At this point (2 weeks in) I'm labeling it more of a moisturizing concealer than an anti-aging/firming cream.I do like it though, hopefully it's helping my skin stay healthy and not just covering up the damage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HGQ5YAXDGCE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q9660L2#wasThisHelpful","R1HGQ5YAXDGCE0","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While it's made of mostly cheap plastic (i think the center grate may be metal) it still looks pretty nice and works really well.I used the included adhesive strips to mount it to the side of my shower stall and it has stayed attached through about a weeks worth of hot showers now.The one gripe I have is the pumps are really difficult to get started. They even come with a letter that says they may need up to 18 pumps to get started. That is a gross understatement. I probably pumped 100-200 times, seriously, before each one started working. I sat in the shower just trying to get this thing to work for at least a minute on each pump.My recommendation is to maybe get it started with some watered down shampoo or conditioner and then pour in the rest of your shampoo. I think once you get something going through then you create the suction needed to keep it going.Once you get it working though it pumps out a nice small amount and work consistently.I also like the little razor clip and the additional hooks for your washcloths/scrubby's.Nice little unit and works well once you get it going.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ZLO5VX45SZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3O0TI8#wasThisHelpful","R21ZLO5VX45SZ1","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 5yo daughters first time on a scooter and in 2 days she has completely figured it out.It's not to tough to put together, allen wrench is provided and if you follow the directions you should be able to get it assembled in about 15minutes.Once it was together we took it to the basketball court and started working on balance which was super easy with the 2 wheels on the front. After that turning, which was also pretty cut and dry, it feels like it turns a little sharper than those old razor scooters honestly.The scooter also has a brake on the back wheel that it took her till the second day to figure out.She's fallen a couple times and the one thing I will bring up is that if your kid doesn't learn to step off and kick the scooter out in front of them to dismount the curved bar will cause them to eat it pretty far if they fall forward. And it really wants to fall forwardEven though we've wrecked it a few times now on asphalt it still looks good, the design causes the scooter to roll more than just crash.But again, that bar will also roll your kid in an awkward way if they fall forward. My daughter actually slammed her collar bone into the asphalt because of the way she fell with it.So, teach em how to dismount and use the brake!Aside from that it's very easy to learn, very durable ( I rode it around for a bit and I'm 215lbs) and she has gotten lots of compliments from other kids at the park while riding it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DT9HOUM53TV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JA1HJEA#wasThisHelpful","R3DT9HOUM53TV9","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I see a lot of reviewers complaining about the plastic taste or smell. I’m guessing these reviewers haven’t bought a coffee maker in a while.Like most new, inexpensive machines you need to run a few brews with just water and then even a couple with coffee in them to get the coffee oils to coat the parts so that you don’t taste the metal, plastic, cleaners, etc. that the brand new machine tastes/smells like. You’ve got to break them in.With this one I ran two water cycles then brewed a couple of throw away pots. By the third or fourth pot my coffee tastes great again. You can see that I’m not giving the coffee machine 5 stars but it has nothing to do with the taste or smell of the coffee.My coffee tastes just as good coming out of this machine as it does from my Mellita 10 cup with the thermal carafe.Overall I’d actually give this machine a 3 star rating but it gains a star for the carafe. Let me explain.Aside from the fancy looks the machine is still just a basic coffee maker, it really doesn’t do anything more than a standard machine with a timer does already. It has a removable reservoir which is kinda cool I guess if your filling from the sink but if, like me, you use a filtered water pitcher to fill your machine then you don’t need a removable reservoir. It has a small carbon filter disk as well, which will remove some of the crud in your water but not nearly as much as a water filter, so again, if you use filtered water, it’s unnecessary.On top of that the machine just feels unnecessarily complicated compared to other machines that produce similar quality coffee. Instead of flipping the top open you pull the filter box out of one side and the reservoir compartment from the other side and then you reassemble once they’re loaded up.I do like being able to remove the entire compartment when dumping the grinds and it does go in and out easily but the whole thing just feels like fluff. The unit is about twice the size of my Mellita and does everything the same with the exception of the added filter.The interface is nice and big, easy to use/read so that is a plus. It also beeps when your brew is done.Some nice little additions.So why 4 stars? Well as I mentioned, originally I was gunna give it 3 but the Carafe is amazing! Seriously.It has kept my coffee warm overnight when brewed in the afternoon. That’s impressive. Compared to the Mellita, which I’ll maybe get 4 hours out of, it’s bordering on magic or alien technology.it pours smooth and the lid is a quarter twist on and off, it’s nice and tight with no drips.Really like the carafe.So if I was going to break it down, I’d actually give it 2 stars as a functional machine. It brews a basic pot of coffee but in an overly extravagant way.1 star for being a functional coffee pot and workingAnd 1 star for the really nice carafe.It looks nice, does the job and keeps my coffee hot without burning it.The carafe is solid and almost worth the buy alone.Beyond that, it’s a coffee maker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ROC3LHJ2BHTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SN80UK#wasThisHelpful","R1ROC3LHJ2BHTD","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've actually been keeping this light above a window inside my house as a kind of motion detector night light for now.Honestly didn't think it would get enough sun to keep charging but it has been working flawlessly from the day I turned it on.The lights are bright enough to dimly light up a small room, just enough to see what you're doing, but not so bright that they make you squint at the shock of them coming on.The motion detector works great, picks me up from about 6-7 feet away. The only issue I've had is that right after the lights go off there seems to be a small interval (maybe 30 seconds) where they won't come back on even if you wave your hand in front of the device.Inside the house I really didn't think it would get enough light to charge, especially with all the rain we've been having but it's been turning on and off for 2 weeks now without issue, so if you used this outside above your RV door or any door I'm sure there wouldn't be a problem. The solar cells are plenty efficient to run the LED's even with minimal sunlight.I haven't exposed it to the elements yet but even the off on switch on the underside is sealed up, it's clearly designed to withstand some water. I guess i could run it under the sink and update my review... actually I might do that.In the mean time I can say with confidence that this is a solid little light. Nice balance of brightness, not so bright it's gunna freak out your neighbors but bright enough to see what you're doing. Charges even in dimly lit areas and detects movement from a reasonable and useful distance.I'd recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208RVDNH9IFQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7JX82C#wasThisHelpful","R208RVDNH9IFQV","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great idea and well implemented.Living in an apartment and being a photographer/designer I love the idea of being able to hang my photo's without leaving a bunch of holes in the wall.You might be worried, like i was, that these use that same sticky tape that some bathroom accessories use to permanently adhere fixtures like towel hooks and such to the walls without screws and anchors. That stuff always pulls the paint off along with whatever you hung.This tape is more like the glue you'll find on perfume ads in magazines that hold the edges together so you can peel it apart. (I hope you know what I mean)It comes off easily and so far, in my tests, it has peeled off the wall without leaving any marks.The reason they can get away with it is that the frames are super light plastic so it doesn't take much to hold them up. Honestly you could probably mount these with poster putty if the backs were flat, that's how light they are.One thing I will warn in case you haven't read other reviews is that if you have textured walls these may not stick at all. My walls are flat matte paint and i have no issues.Anyway,What I really like is that the whole system is really well designed and thought out. The tape has a kind of... vecro-ish material on the back that you can press the frame onto and it sticks really well. Then inside the frame is a small bubble level that you can see from the front to help level out your frame. In the center is a strong magnet that attaches to another that is affixed to the back of the image.The whole thing goes together with very little effort and holds together nicely.My set came with a riser that is just an additional magnetic back that helps the picture sit a little further from the wall, like everything else it simply snaps on to the frame with a magnet.The great thing is that the backs of all of these are that velcro material so you can remove the riser, but still have the tape on the wall so you can slap a non-lifted frame in it's place.Again, everything is really well thought out and simple.In the catalog that came with these there are a wide variety of designs, I got some black and white Parisian Cafe style images that look nice but what I'm most interested in is the photo frames (which I'll be ordering).I can't really think of any gripes and I've tried, I guess maybe the plastic is so light that it feel a bit cheap but you don't see the plastic and it's not like you're going to be beating on it so it's not an issue. I've moved mine around while testing for this review and nothing has cracked or broken yet.I wish they had a larger frame or a wider variety of sizes but I'm sure that will come soon.Make sure you wipe down the walls for best stick. I use TSP and water to get em super clean.Beyond that you really wont need any help, tools, preparation or advice, they're seriously that easy to hang.Again, keep in mind that they may not hang on textured surfaces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5W7W1CL3HUN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7XCS#wasThisHelpful","R5W7W1CL3HUN3","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, Medium Tall!? Awesome!Second, soft, fits great, looks great, nice price!Third, durable, and color hasn't faded after 3-4 washes.Man... I was so happy when I found these. Nervous about the way they would fit and feel. I've gotten some junkers from ordering online here before but I really wanted a form fitting v-neck. I started by ordering 1 black one and was so happy I ordered a second black and then a white. I'm 6'4 about 215lbs and I work out 3-4 times a week. I'm still pretty slim for my weight and a large is a bit loose on me, which is nice for dressing baggy/casual, but if I'm wearing a slim fit dress shirt I want a fitting undershirt and I need a medium tall.They had medium tall!If you're my size you know how impossible it is to find nice, medium or even large tall shirts most of the time.These are perfect. Seriously. I've ordered 3, (2 black, 1 white).The tall sizes are nice and long, the fabric is soft, almost buttery, and after 3-4 washes the color hasn't faded at all in the 2 black shirts I've ordered.I just came back to order some looser fitting ones for the summer, unfortunately they are out right now so I decided to write this review.These are great shirts.

"I ordered two of these in September 2014 and they worked awesome. For such tiny speakers they put out surprisingly acceptable sound. They weren't making my neighbors bang on the walls but they were great for listening to music or watching vids on my phone when i wasn't at home or in a car.Last month I smashed one while it was in my backpack and decided to buy a couple more so i could have 2 on my PC and one in my backpack. I really liked them that much.Unfortunately the 2 I ordered this March (2015) have a completely different sound quality and the batteries stopped holding a charge with-in a week.It got to the point that I had to keep them plugged in just to keep them working, as soon as i unplugged one it turned off. Also the sound quality was tinnier and quieter even with the volume cranked.I really can't tell if i got two duds or if the quality assurance or production has changed since the first two I bought.I'd really like to recommend these but after this recent experience it seems like it's more of a grab bag and you may get a good one or you may get a dud.Hate to say it but I can't recommend these anymore.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8E5LGV7YZD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HHICKC#wasThisHelpful","RY8E5LGV7YZD2","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[UPDATE]I'm leaving my old review intact so that hopefully someone else might benefit from my mistake.Originally i had plugged the adapter into the USB 3.0 port on the side of my monitor. Apparently this was causing lots of interference and I got terrible range on the adapter. I recently moved the adapter to a front port on my PC case and I am now getting at least 16 feet of range from the PC on my bluetooth headset (LG Tone Pro).So moral of the story, if you're getting poor range or signal loss try moving the adapter to a port that is not obscured by another electronic. Back of the PC, Monitor ports or hubs behind your other PC equipment might cause issues with connections.Once you get it out in the open it works great![/UPDATE]Does it's job. Installs without issue.Range is terrible though. I'm using this for a headset and I can't get more than 5-6 feet from the adapter before it starts dropping signal.I can walk twice as far from my phone with the same headset.If you are just using it for a keyboard and mouse on your desktop then this is probably perfectly fine. But for anything with a range beyond 5 feet it might let you down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDBCMFNNIWJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Q45EF4#wasThisHelpful","RFDBCMFNNIWJU","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these as a supplement to my free weight workouts and so that I could carry a workout with me when I travel. In that respect, they have been great!They seem to be very durable, I bought them 4 months ago and use them 3-4 times a week. The Carabiners are solid and all but one of them opens and closes very easily (I have one that sticks sometimes).The set comes with a decent little nylon bag, it's nothing fancy but everything fits in it and it's a nice addition for organizing your gear.The amount of resistance you get from these is dependant a couple of key aspects.The first is that the resistance is partially dependent on the distance you stretch them (with-in their safety limits) so if you are trying to use these with a bench for something like a bench press you're probably going to be disappointed since you won't be able to stretch them far enough to get good resistance. I'm 6'5"" (198cm) and on my standard free weight bench I can't get a good stretch unless I go incline.This is the same for any kind of pull downs if you're tall like me. Anchoring the set to a doorway doesn't work for me since I'm so tall and my arms are so long. Even if I get on my knees I can't get a decent stretch out of them.I need to anchor them to the ceiling and since I live in an apartment that's a no-no. I plan to buy a power tower soon though so hopefully that will solve the problem.The second is that you'll most likely need to stack the bands for big, compound movements. You can stack ALL of them on the handles if you want and that's a decent amount of resistance if you can get far enough away from your anchor. I purchased the atomic green band to help get more resistance and when I stack them all together it's very difficult to stretch them when I can get distance from the anchor point.If you are careful, have good form and are deliberate in your movements you can do some solid squats, curls and shrugs with these as well, it's not as satisfying as moving a barbell or a couple of dumbbells but it's a workout and when you can't hit the gym it's nice to have the option, especially for the price and the minimal weight.Where the set really shines for me is in workouts like Incline Fly's, Incline Presses and crossover's or any kind of cable style movements (when I have a good anchor).Because the resistance lets up as you go back down in a press movement, you don't need to worry about the stress on your shoulders as much and you still get that natural movement you get with dumbbells. So you can really stack the resistance and not have to worry as much about getting hurt. Heavier load, less danger, I like it.There's also a lot of stabilizing involved so it encourages you to maintain proper form throughout your movement, another plus.I haven't figured out how to do a deadlift style movement or anything reasonable for calves which is unfortunate but for almost everything else they are a nice alternative when you need them.Again for bigger guys you'll probably want to order a couple of the big green ones and maybe an extra purple. Also, keep in mind that you will need a solid anchor and a space that allows you some distance. If you don't have those things you'll probably be disappointed.A FEW TIPS (some I've already covered).If you anchor to a doorway, you need to be standing on the side of the door that opens away from you. That way the door is held in place by the entire frame instead of just the latch.If you don't feel like the bands are hard enough, stack them, connect several of them together or buy some more big ones and stack those. If you still can't get enough resistance move further from the anchor point to where the bands are just starting to stretch at the beginning of your movement.Don't wrap your bands around anything sharp or abrasive and don't stand on them with cleats or anything other than flat soled shoes (I workout barefoot, but I have flat feet). Even small tears in the bands might cause them to tear and snap in your face. I snapped a band from my uncles set (different brand) and on further inspection the whole band looked like he worked out on a cheese grater or something, concrete floors, un-sanded wood beams, etc. All can be rough on the soft rubber.The nylon on the ends is kind of abrasive so if you're doing movements that will cause them to move across or press against your skin you might want to wear a long sleeve or a forearm guard since they can scratch a bit, they don't really bother me anymore but they did at first.All in all, I really like the set and I'm glad I bought it. I've traveled with it a few times now and it was great to be able to get at least some kind of decent workout in.Definitely recommend them and this brand seems to be well built and durable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T59KAGZNCL2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGAID78#wasThisHelpful","R1T59KAGZNCL2Z","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally these kinds of kid comforters are a scratchy cheap nylon that's not sewn together very well so I was hesitant to review this item but since it was on Vine I figured it couldn't hurt. At the very least we could wash it, let my daughter drag it around the house and then I could let everyone know what a piece of junk it was.Well, it's not a piece of junk.It seems as though it's actually really durable. We've washed it twice and she drags it out to the living room and lays on it while watching movies.When appropriate I like to put my Vine stuff through the gauntlet and this comforter has come out with flying colors.It's a really cute comforter and it's surprisingly soft compared to your standard ""bed-in-a-bag"" type bed sets.It's also big, so it covers her whole Twin bed and drapes over quite a bit.She loves it, not just because almost every little girl loves Frozen but because it's actually pretty and comfortable.Solid buy for parents with little fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXOGKYQAQI9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W9UXWK#wasThisHelpful","R1SXOGKYQAQI9S","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this through Vine just before i headed back to Colorado for a week to spend time with family.I've been in the Mid-west/North East for 10 years now (currently in Kentucky) and have adapted to the humidity so I knew i was gunna need something to protect me from the Mountain air.I'll just start by saying this stuff worked wonders for me. While my lips chapped up something nasty for the first few days my skin felt great.Any fragrance it may have is almost unnoticeable or just natural, which is nice since I'm a guy and didn't really look forward to smelling like flowers.I did let me wife try it and she commented that she really liked it and that it wasn't ""all greasy or oily"", I think we must have different opinions of oily though. To be fair I rarely use lotion but after putting it on I do feel a bit slippery. Still, after a few days it stopped bothering me and I was just happy my skin wasn't cracking.I've been back in KY for a week now and I stopped using it a couple days ago and have definitely noticed a difference, my skin feels dry again even in the humidity.The only brands I can compare it to are St Ives and Aveno. I definitely like this better than the St. Ives stuff that used to burn my skin when i'd put it on, Aveno feels a bit less oily to me but I feel like this works better to keep me from drying out.Honestly I'll probably keep using it unless someone hips me to something better.

Not only is it designed to be convenient no matter how you need to use it but the build quality seems to be pretty rugged so far. I've walked 1/2 mile with 4, 10lb weight lifting plates with some groceries on top, in it and had no issues... other than it was heavy.I really like the ability to grab it from the top, the side or use it as a back pack or a duffle bag. It's not loaded with a bunch of little pockets, it has a small separator on the inside below a small, zippered pencil pocket and one small zippered pocket on the outside that could maybe hold a cell phone or something. There's another separator on the back behind the backpack straps that could hold a few items like a book or a compact umbrella but that would make wearing it uncomfortable.The only issue i had was that one of the metal clips that is used to tighten the side straps was mounted backwards so i had to take it off with pliers and fit it back on correctly. The clips are very thin metal and honestly a bit sharp but it wasn't a big deal.It looks slick, it's tough and it's actually pretty comfy for me and I'm a big guy, 6'4"".Good buy as far as I'm concerned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9AP9L4CFKVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3LQF5S#wasThisHelpful","RD9AP9L4CFKVZ","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say that I've been using this for what... 3 weeks now? And I love it. I'd choose it heads and tails over the old spinning blade nose and ear trimmers. I'm seriously not going back to those. I threw my Panasonic in the trash.It takes a bit of getting used to and at first I couldn't get a decent trim with it but I've figured it out and it works great.Not only does it do a fantastic job with nose hairs but the attachments make it easy to clean up eyebrows and sideburns or edging up a beard.It's definitely the complete shebang and all of the attachments go on and off easily once you get them lined up.Its also water proof so you can wash it off after use but here's the thing, since it doesn't have the standard spinning blades inside a little compartment it doesn't collect all the hair and... shmutz like other trimmers do. So the clean up is easier and less dramatic.I have yet to have a pulled hair and while I've been nervous about it slicing the inside of my nose it hasn't happened yet. At first I thought maybe it was because it doesn't trim as close but honestly I can't see a difference between this and my old Panasonic. As long as you use it correctly (rotate it around the inside and make several passes) it does a great job of cleaning things up.Battery life seems to be pretty good so far but that leads me to my only hang up.Why is this thing not rechargeable? It makes absolutely no sense.I have 3 other trimmers, all rechargeable, waterproof, etc. I just don't understand the need for me to keep buying AA batteries for these things. And yes i know i can buy rechargeable batteries but wouldn't a plug be easier? I even have the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom trimmer and guess what, rechargeable! Same company, same general purpose... I'm sure it was a portability decision or something but man... sigh. end rant.Other than that I have no gripes. I really like this trimmer and will be keeping it with me. It has a nice carrying case that should make it easy to bring on trips and with all the attachments I feel pretty covered when it comes to clean up grooming.Definitely happy with this product. Just wish it was rechargeable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A6ZA17ALDZ1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSKH6#wasThisHelpful","R2A6ZA17ALDZ1J","A2WBEJH71SND3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WBEJH71SND3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some products are just designed to separate people from their money, and this is one of them. The box contains about $3 worth of materials -- some colored pencils, 16 sheets of paper, an instruction sheet, and an envelope. The price you pay for the product also includes an additional service. When your very dedicated child has filled all 16 pages, using only his talent and a box of colored pencils, you can put the papers in the envelope and drop them in the mail. Later, a wonderful keepsake art book arrives in your mailbox, complete with a picture of your kid and a bio on the back cover. Very nice.Do you see the problem with the scheme? Most of the people who buy this very expensive kit will never mail in the pages. Most people's kids are not that talented, or that dedicated, or they get bored quickly, or nothing they produce is worthy of immortalizing in a book. Oh, I am sure some people will mail in the pages and enjoy the book. But I am also sure that a whole lot of other people will not. I will not, because I do not have any particular talent with colored pencils, or the desire to spend hours on such a silly project.The Crayola company is selling an expensive publishing job that only some its customers are going to use. It's a gold mine for Crayola, because they are selling more service than they actually have to provide. Every customer who does not mail in the pages represents a profit for Crayola.This is the kind of toy that looks like it would make a good gift for a kid, but I don't think the kid will like it. If you want to publish your kid's artwork, there are other ways to do it.

"Probiotics saved my life! Or at least they made my life liveable again. I won't bore you with the details of my adventures with C-diff and my long slow recovery. I'll just say that I am convinced I would not have recovered at all if I had not started getting serious about probiotics. My health finally started improving when I tripled the dose. I took a pill three times per day for months. I took probiotics with every meal. I tried every brand I could find. I took different brands at different times of day. I just overloaded my system with all the probiotics I could find, hoping something would colonize and stay in there. It worked! I am, mostly, recovered.I don't take massive quantities of probiotics any more. I just take one capsule a few times per week. I can't speak to the efficacy of this particular brand of probiotics, because it is hard for me to distinguish between them. Here is why I am giving this brand five stars. Here is what it says on the label: ""Viva Labs Advanced Probiotics features a wide spectrum of friendly bacteria that colonize the GI tract to alleviate intestinal discomfort and provide optimal digestive relief. Our proprietary 6-strain blend features two of the most clinically validated strains available. NCFM and HN019 valued for their defense against immunity and ability to restore intestinal flora"".I applaud the sentiment, even if I am not quite sure what it means. Is ""defense against immunity"" a positive? Anyway, I am glad that research is being conducted into the study of which probiotics have an ability to restore intestinal flora. That's the kind of information that is useful to know! Thank you, Viva Labs, for that bit of enlightenment on your product label.One more thing I should mention. After my months of intense probiotics, I noticed my finger nails are very hard now. They don't peel or bend like they used to. I attribute it to getting more nutrition from the food I eat. Probiotics are great! Take more of them, and you will feel better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31X4CEYYEQBU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAWLVGU#wasThisHelpful","R31X4CEYYEQBU4","A2IYX5W3A1N3VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IYX5W3A1N3VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not fond of vampire books where the author tries to reinvent vampires. I mean, vampires are already a perfect literary construct. Vampires follow certain rules. They are destroyed by light, and they can't come into your house unless invited, for example. If you change the rules to suit your story, fine, but why would you call them vampires when clearly they are not?The real problem with this book was not just another butchering of the concept of vampire. The real problem was, it was nearly unreadable. I could not get in to this story. The back story was covered in the first few pages, and it made no sense to me. Gareth was alive and then he was dead and then he was alive again, and all the other vampires are dead, only some are back. Adele had powers and now she doesn't, but she might have some in other places. A confusing beginning.It might have helped if I had read the previous trilogy. Perhaps if I had gotten to know the characters I might have liked them. But I didn't know the characters because because right away, they sprang into action. They were running around fighting and solving problems before we had a chance to get acquainted. It was too much. So I would say this book has a problem with pacing, and a problem with character development.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDP69GBPU7FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=163388094X#wasThisHelpful","R2PDP69GBPU7FH","A2IYX5W3A1N3VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IYX5W3A1N3VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can have any size coffee, from a big pot to a single cup.It comes with a permanent filter, a go cup, a frother, and a measuring spoon. You can make lots of great coffee drinks with the recipes in the included recipe book. I had a big cup of Hazelnut brew with whipped milk and nutmeg.

"This is a very pretty incarnation of the classic Claddagh ring. I wear it on my right hand, with the point of the heart facing my elbow. That means I am in a serious relationship, and not available. There are other meanings for the ring as well. Mothers can give these rings to their daughters, for example. It can traditionally be worn as an engagement or wedding ring, but in this century I think it works better as a promise ring. If you give it to a girl, say something sweet, like this:""This ring means I am offering my heart to you. Wear it for a while and get used to the idea.

There is a center insert lining bag that buttons at the edges. You can take the lining out and wash the onion peels and potato dirt out of it. I think this is a smart thing to do, because burlap does not wash well.

"This high quality backpack has the features and fittings of fine luggage. It is large, with just the right number of useful pockets. It is suitable for travel, including trekking through the Pacific Northwest on trains and ferries. There is plenty of room for spare clothes, electronics and snacks. The side pocket is very deep and it can be used for an extra pair of shoes. The large front compartment zips on a curve, meaning the bottom of the backpack is wider than the top of the backpack. This gives the backpack stability when it stands upright.I would say the backpack has a masculine aspect. By that I mean, the heavier zippers and rectangular zipper pulls are a style that men tend to prefer. In my experience, men do not prefer dainty or feminine looking bags. Women are more open minded. Both men and women should like this one.There is an unusual open pocket on the padded side of the bag where the straps are. It is an open sleeve that extends half way up your back. You can use this padded inner sleeve to hold your jacket. Just pull it through and fold it down, and your jacket is hanging nicely and not getting wrinkled. This is a much better idea than tying the sleeves together around your waist. You can also use the padded inner sleeve to attach the backpack to the handle of your rolling luggage.I would say this backpack is very well designed.

"The bear company has a dozen styles of youth bow. This is the newest and most innovative. It features a rigid riser, flexible side limbs, finger guides, and a whisker biscuit.The central riser is heavy aluminum. It is uniform around the axis, meaning it can be successfully used by left-handed or right-handed people. There is an attachment for holding four arrows, but only two are included.The highlight of this model is the ""whisker biscuit"", which is a wonderful invention. It is a circular hole lined with course hairs. You put the point of the arrow into the circle, and the hairs hold it steady as you take aim. When you are ready to fire, the arrow head, and the shaft, and the vanes all whoosh right through the whisker biscuit in a straight line, and the arrow continues to travel in a straight line. It is an excellent way to shoot an arrow.A whisker biscuit is an upgrade on adult bows, but this bow has this very advantageous feature built in. Of all the features of all the bows, it seems to me the whisker biscuit is the most valuable one to a parent. It will give your kids that extra bit of help they need. Kids don't always take to a new sport like archery. They can get easily frustrated, which makes parents frustrated too. So we give them little advantages to get them off to a good start. A whisker biscuit is a little advantage that can mean the difference between giving up on archery and making a success of it. So unless your kids are naturally athletic and competent at things like this, do yourself a favor and buy them the bow with the whisker biscuit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJOKACCP4TATN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R2CD60#wasThisHelpful","RJOKACCP4TATN","A2IYX5W3A1N3VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IYX5W3A1N3VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although I have only had the shoes for a little while, they give the impression of being very sturdy shoes that will last a long time. The shoes are designed for running, but they are also great for walking and sitting.Comfort is one thing, but let's talk about style. I just love the look of these shoes. It is not easy to find black sneakers that are as cool looking as this. They have sleek, streamlined curves, mixed textures and subtle colors. The shoe looks grown-up and sophisticated, but it also looks ready for action. I love the ""Ignite"" logo. Of all the things a shoe can say, ""Ignite"" is probably the best. That's the kind of encouraging word you want to see when you put your shoes on in the morning.I think the sophisticated look of the shoe will make them popular with the skating crowd, but also with people who just want to look good in a comfortable shoe. Highly recommended, this is a beautiful pair of shoes","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAYUC2T2NZ8VO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKYVF8Q#wasThisHelpful","RAYUC2T2NZ8VO","A2IYX5W3A1N3VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IYX5W3A1N3VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised when these arrived. I wasn't expecting them to be this nice. They come in a useful box with an angular cut that keeps them upright and together. These garden stakes are ""craft quality"". They are finely cut with perfect angles. They are clean with no dust or splinters. The color is very light beige, almost white. The wood appears to be pine, but I can't say for sure. The stakes are not made from hollow walnut, that is  the name of the company.You can use the stakes in your garden. They are tall enough for pole beans or raspberries. Just place them the right distance apart, and run strings between them. That's the most obvious use.Creative uses depend on the time of year, and the holidays are coming up again, so here are some suggestions. For Halloween, make a picket fence around comical tombstones in your front yard. For Valentine's day, glue big hearts on the ends and put them along your front walk. For Christmas, use the stakes to add strength and support to a nativity scene, or to hold up low strings of Christmas lights. For birthdays, make signs to announce ""the party is here"". You can also use the stakes to hold garage sale signs.So, there are many uses for these fine high-quality stakes. Admittedly, this isn't a product that everybody needs, but if you think you need them, you can buy these stakes with confidence, because they are very good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPSPKHVOZOZ5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OPCE1I#wasThisHelpful","RPSPKHVOZOZ5W","A2IYX5W3A1N3VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IYX5W3A1N3VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This watch is beautiful. Is it practical? I don't know. It has four dials, one big one and three little ones. Two of the little ones are for the stopwatch, and the other one is to orient you in your day. In case you don't know if it is 3:00 am or 3:00 pm, you can figure it out by staring at the little dial for a while. Why would you do that? Frankly, I think you wouldn't, any more than you will use the stopwatch function. Those little dials are simply ornamental. The whole watch is ornamental. But what an ornament!This watch looks great on my husband. My husband is a big man, but he is not a flashy man. On weekends he likes to wear cargo shorts and one of those tee shirts with the three wolves howling at the moon. He's a casual, comfortable guy. But I see him as something more. I see him as a great man, the head of a family, a good provider, steadfast and loving. He is my ideal man and I love him.He wears the watch because he is in the habit of wearing a wristwatch. I don't think he knows how alpha it makes him look. But I know! I know my great man has a great piece of jewelry, and I glow with happiness when I look at this beautiful watch decorating his beautiful arm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFSUAESB5XWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCSRXA0#wasThisHelpful","RPFSUAESB5XWI","A2IYX5W3A1N3VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IYX5W3A1N3VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One of the challenges is to get things in the right place, like get the windows on the outside and the furniture on the inside. Even when you get it right, you find another way to do it. It's hard to keep your hands off the building pieces. They are very appealing.The magnetic stickers are really cute and fun.

"Oh, I wish this story had gone a different direction. I like the writing style, and for the most part, the story was a page turner, but at the end it just kind of left a bad feeling. I found the relationship between Avelynn and Alrik to be unlikely in the extreme. What did these two have in common? Apparently, lust. He didn't rescue her, and for most of the book he wasn't there for her, and he chose his brother over her every time. Extenuating circumstances, yeah. Disappointing circumstances! Who needs a hero who isn't a hero? Who isn't even there? What does she see in him?The middle part dragged. The beginning promised action and Viking attacks and rescue from a forced marriage. But that didn't happen for ages. In between we had pagan rituals, sneaky trysts, and dirty sex. Icky sex. Leave-your-family-and-screw-a-thug-on-the-beach sex. With your best friend and co-conspirator giving you a lesbian hand job to warm you up for it. Yuck.What does Avelynn see in Alrik? I couldn't tell you. What does he see in her? Who knows.

"The shredded memory foam pillow is an interesting advancement in pillow technology. I had a memory foam pillow before, but it was too stationary. I like this kind of memory foam because it moves around. You can reposition your head during the night. It just feels better.That said, this pillow was too high for me. I am a back sleeper and I like just a little bit of elevation for my head. My husband, on the other hand, is a side sleeper, so I tested it out on him. So far, he loves it. He said his neck and arm feel better in the morning with the extra elevation and support from this thick, firm pillow. I have not noticed much snoring from his side of the bed either, so I'm thinking this is a pretty good pillow.There is a lovely bamboo-rayon pillow case that comes with the pillow. I suggest you use it, and don't put another pillow case over it. Don't worry, you can unzip it and wash it when you need to. The reason it is good is because it is a stretchy knit fabric that moves when the pillow moves. If you put a woven pillow case over it, you get a different feeling, like the pillow is firmer and harder. It sort of ruins the effect of the memory foam.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFUFATQ9470TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012B78114#wasThisHelpful","RFUFATQ9470TX","A2IYX5W3A1N3VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IYX5W3A1N3VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a quality Halloween prop that will help with your decorating. You don't have to put it on your table.

If you have creative impulses, there is a lot you can do with this fabric.The picture shows a white lining which isn't actually there. This is a a mesh fabric, and as such it provides no protection at all for your table. If you are going to serve food, then you will need another table cloth under the mesh to protect the table.

"I already have a professionally installed alarm system that is monitored by a service, and I also have a camera system plus extra locks plus lights plus dogs. I live in Las Vegas and that's how we like to do things here.I tested the Myfox system, and I have mixed feelings about it. It works, but it does not provide very much security. I would say it provides only a small fraction of the security I am currently used to. I live in a big house with lots of doors and windows, and having a security system that only covers a single door doesn't seem like much of an advantage. I think anybody familiar enough with my house to want to rob it would know which door the system is monitoring and simply choose another way in.I recommend this security system to people who live in apartments. I think this would be useful in a place where you only have one door. Then if one of your disreputable friends decides to make an unexpected visit when you are not home, the loud piercing siren will announce his intrusion to your neighbors, who will assemble in the hallway and hopefully beat him senseless. I can see this device being useful for a scenario like that.For someone like me who needs real security for a big old house in a bad old city, I think it would be better to invest in a professional system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHWSFLHXDYW9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZWBUP2K#wasThisHelpful","RHWSFLHXDYW9F","A2IYX5W3A1N3VB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IYX5W3A1N3VB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first experience with recreational EMS, and I am hooked. I am an older woman who has always exercised, so I have some arm muscles to begin with. I like to row a kayak, so I need strong arms. I find it more difficult to lift weights as the bones in my fingers and hands are delicate now and it doesn't take much weight to cause joint pain. I can't believe there is an easier way to build up your arm muscles! This is great.I found the system to be simple to set up and use. The battery needed to be charged, but otherwise it was ready to go. I had a little bit of trouble peeling the covers off the gel pads. Possibly they melted a bit in my hot Las Vegas mailbox. Be sure to fold the pads in half and peel from the middle. There are orange arrows showing you where to peel.Pads should not be shared because they tend to get icky when bits of your skin stick to them. This is a personal appliance, not something you would share with anybody. Let your roommate buy her own electrical muscle stimulator.The instructions recommend using the muscle trainer 3 times per week. I used it yesterday and my muscles ache today like I paddled 5 miles up the Colorado river. All that benefit while sitting quietly and watching television? It's like magic!

"I have a little experience with these Ultimate Body Presses as I had the Ultimate Body Press Wall Mounted Pull Up Bar installed for about 3 years before I removed it to install the Ultimate Body Press Ceiling Mounted Pull Up Bar, which I also received to review.  While I prefer the ceiling-mounted bars over the wall-mounted bars because of the wall clearance that you can allow for in how far you place the ceiling-mouted bars from the walls, the different Ultimate Press Body Presses for the ceiling each have their advantages.If you want a straight bar suspended from the ceiling, go for this product if you have 8' ceilings or if you have 9' ceilings, go for the Ultimate Body Press Wall or 9ft Ceiling Mount Pull Up Bar.  If you want a foam-padded angled bar, go for the Ultimate Body Press Ceiling Mounted Pull Up Bar.  If you don't know if you want a foam-padded angled bar or a straight bar without foam, I personally would recommend this product.  This one will last you a lifetime, whereas the foam-padded angled bar will require some maintenance in time to replace the foam.  The advantage of the foam-padded version is that it gives you ONE more grip position than this white version.  The foam-padded ceiling bar has wide, narrow and straight-out grip positions, whereas this white version will only allow you wide to narrow grip positions.  However, this product does not have any foam to break down and I can't see anything on this product needing maintenance or attention for the life of the product.  That's the advantage of this product - it's simple and will last a lifetime.  If you usually wear gloves, I find that this un-padded version is preferable.  The textured grip that is formed into the steel pull-up bar is enough to get a firm grip.  I found that the foam on my Ultimate Body Press Wall Mounted Pull Up Bar wore out after 3 years. It just begins to tear from the constant strain put on the foam.  Over time, it also became brittle and bits and pieces would scuff off on hands and gloves.  (It can be replaced with bicycle handle foam, but it's a pain to remove and replace).This is a beautifully constructed and finished product.  I think the white risers actually add a designer touch to the product, which is good if you are installing this product inside of the home as I have done.  It is just a tad nicer to look at over the all-black finish of most of Ultimate Body Press' products.  The welds and paint job are top notch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R378KU12NIRV5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFD36IW#wasThisHelpful","R378KU12NIRV5A","A14DLOV1GBUUWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DLOV1GBUUWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously been using the Ultimate Body Press Wall Mounted Pull Up Bar.  I actually took this unit down before I requested this ceiling-mounted version to review.  I found that we weren't using it because it was so close to the wall.  The wall-mounted version only allows you 13"" clearance from the wall, which is way too little room and we were just scuffing up the wall with shoes.  I very much prefer this ceiling-mounted version over the wall-mounted version.  You can hang it from the ceiling at your desired location, and I suggest you allow yourself a couple of feet from the wall so you don't kick the wall (especially true for beginners). This way, you don't feel smashed up against the wall, if you care at all about your walls and their appearance.When I first assembled the product, I thought, like others, that the holes were off.  I tested both configurations for 16"" and 24"" rafters, and tried to ""dry fit"" the unit before trying to install it up on the ceiling.  When I assembled it for 24"" rafters, the installation holes were 24-3/8"" on center.  When I assembled it for 16"" rafters, the installation holes were 17"" and 17-3/8"" on center.  This led me back to the instructions, and after reading them and reading others' reviews, I followed the instructions and first installed the brackets to the ceiling, and only then tightened the pull-up bar.  This method worked fine, as others have mentioned.  This is the key to installation - follow the included instructions.As with my previous wall-mounted product, the fit and finish of the product are top notch.  It has heavy duty tubes and plates.  I expect that the foam will deteriorate over time as happened with my wall mount version, but it is replaceable with some time and patience.  (It can be replaced with bicycle handle foam.)  I am very impressed with the clean welds, high quality paint job and what seems like thicker foam than my previous wall-mounted version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PO67FF06CZ1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXUWOB6#wasThisHelpful","R1PO67FF06CZ1H","A14DLOV1GBUUWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DLOV1GBUUWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is exactly what I was hoping for when I requested the product to review.  It works perfectly to light half of a standard size closet (in an apartment home). (See attached photo, which shows the product in use with no other lighting.)  I think you would need two for a full-size closet.It is sufficiently bright and the auto on/off feature works as you would expect.  When I say that it's sufficiently bright, I do mean that it's bright, but it's not the type of light that is going to blind you!  I actually wish that it would be a tad bit brighter, but it will work for most situations.It comes on when we slide the closet door open. It has a convenient plate to wall mount the light and comes with two very small screws and wall anchors.  Alternatively, it has magnets that should allow you to mount it to metal without adhesive or fasteners, for a temporary/movable light.I can't gauge battery life, but it does come with 3 AA batteries, which I plan to replace with rechargeable ones once they no longer work.

"Update:  I have used this mat literally every single day since it arrived.  It has been many months now and I absolutely love this mat.  It has become one of the most useful kitchen tools and it still looks like it did the day it arrived.Original review:When I saw this drying mat available to review, I thought to myself: ""Do I really need this? Am I really going to use it?""  I've used towels sine the beginning of time to dry the cutting board and pots and pans that don't fit in the dishwasher or have to be hand washed.  I have to say though that it is much nicer, handier and effective than I thought it would be.  I didn't really know what to expect before it arrived, but I am pleased with the construction of the mat, especially for the current Amazon.com price if I were buying it myself.  While I probably would not have purchased it on my own at first, I plan on buying one for my parents because it's an improvement on one of those daily household items, which can make life easier.I really like that it folds up to fit different spaces.  I have a small cutting board where I like to dry things and folding it in half works perfectly.  I like the grey color because it is not going to show water marks as much over time.  I have also really enjoyed the fast drying feature.  When my items are dry, I simply hang the drying mat over the oven handle to finish drying before folding the mat up and placing it in the drawer.

"The unit I got worked fine for about 5 weeks, then started going off.  The first time was in the middle of the night for no apparent reason (scared the bejesus out of us since the unit was in the bedroom).  I called First Alert and was told that I needed to clean the unit with an air duster monthly.  I went out and purchased a can and cleaned the unit.  I asked the representative if I did any harm by not cleaning it after 4 weeks and she said that I didn't and they have a 10-year warranty.  I reinstalled the unit with fresh batteries and it started beeping within an hour and then proceeded to do it about 3 more times until I pulled the unit off the wall and decided that I am returning it.

Also, the green LED is so faint that I couldn't see it unless I was within a foot of the unit.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM3LER5P1IRPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8MVW44#wasThisHelpful","RM3LER5P1IRPB","A14DLOV1GBUUWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DLOV1GBUUWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this camera several months back even before it was technically available on Amazon and I have a lot to say about it.  First off, I had some prior experience with the previous Sharx outdoor cameras when I installed them several years ago at a family member's house.  Sharx has really improved the cameras over the past few years.  I told them that I loved their cameras so much that I was going to write a review about them, so here it is.You will need some networking know-how to install these cameras.  They are not for those without any networking knowledge at all, or at least not for those without patience or willingness for troubleshooting, as with most IP cameras. Despite how much most claim to be plug and play, you will need to be able to work things out on your own.  It takes some time if you don't know exactly what you are doing.You may be trying to decide between this camera and another one by another manufacturer that looks very similar.  I would highly recommend that you aren't fooled into thinking that saving a few bucks won't matter.  Sharx customer service is by far and away the best technical support that I have ever, ever, ever come across.  (I have been tinkering with PCs since the mid 1980s...)  The folks (I think mostly guys) at Sharx are willing to answer any question you may have and they usually respond within 24-hours, sometimes much quicker.  The technical support that these folks provide is worth the weight in gold.  I can't say enough good things about them.  Their patience, willingness and accurate information has just blown me away, and I am really a hard person to please sometimes.  Their support is especially valuable if you haven't set one of their cameras up before, or any camera up before.  Even though I had experience, I ran into some small hiccups with my network and they helped me work out the kinks.As for the camera itself, the build quality is top-notch.  I absolutely love the wide angle 1080p image.  I am getting 15 fps.  It's so awesome that people have no idea that it is recording such a wide view...very deceptive.  People think that because the camera is not pointing at them that it isn't catching them.  I had to become very creative to pole mount the camera since I can't attach it to a wall.  I ended up getting a PoE injector that Sharx recommended and it has worked out well.  I'll probably come back and add more to this review as the details come back to me in time, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy this camera again. After running it on SecuritySpy on a Mac for a while, I have since migrated to BlueIris on PC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSBIDYTLMA1I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGY7LQA#wasThisHelpful","RSBIDYTLMA1I5","A14DLOV1GBUUWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DLOV1GBUUWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This complimentary product came along at the right time for me to review as I have been shopping around for a convection oven for a couple years now.  Living in an apartment, we are limited with the regular 1970's gas oven.  For many things, the gas oven is ok, but if you are a baker or even if you just want faster and more even cooking, you often need convection to get the best results.  These types of ovens are great if you also don't want to heat up an entire wall oven for just cooking or reheating something small.  This oven excels at heating up quickly, whereas our gas oven takes about 5-7 minutes of pre-heating to get to cooking temperatures.My heart had been set on the Breville BOV800XL because I had done enough research to know that is really what I would put my own money toward.  I can't compare the two because I never got the Breville, but if price is a concern, the Breville is about 2-1/2 times the cost of this convection oven.  For many, that may be reason enough to at least give this unit a try.The biggest problem we've run into with this unit is just the sheer size of the unit.  It is monstrous and takes up a lot of counter space.  This is the biggest downside for people such as us living in an apartment.  If you are short on counter space, this is probably not the convection oven for you.  It is simply gigantic and I would recommend getting out your tape measure and making sure you have room before considering this unit.  It's great that the unit is so big because you can fit many and large dishes inside, but it's also an inconvenience if you don't have room to spare.The convection works exactly as expected and has provided results as good as we've been wanting from a countertop convection oven.The unit is a little on the light-weight side.  It definitely looks like it should weigh more than it does, but this has not affected the performance and in no way reflects my 4-star rating.  The main reason for a 4-star rating and not 5-stars is the aesthetic design of the oven.  Compared to the Breville's aesthetics, this oven is just not as pretty to look at on the counter.  This oven is functional, effective, if not basic looking.  If you don't want to spend a lot for a Breville, but are in the market for a very large convection oven, this unit is worth good consideration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYEHT9HGGM87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXSR486#wasThisHelpful","RHYEHT9HGGM87","A14DLOV1GBUUWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DLOV1GBUUWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been through enough digital timers purchased here on Amazon that I've had to replace that I jumped at the opportunity to review these analog timers.  I still had a couple digital timers that I've been wanting to replace that these fit perfectly.  For my case (and I think most others), analog timers will work in 99% of most applications.  Only when precise timing is needed would a quality digital timer be preferable.  I have been through digital timers by Westinghouse, Coleman Cable, and Hydrofarm, among others.  From my experience, I think analog is preferable because there is less to go wrong.  While I no longer have any of the digital timers except the Hydrofarm left, I still have all of my analog timers by Woods and Stanley.Both of the timers in this combo have worked well for me.  My biggest complaint is that the white indoor timer allows you to plug in a grounded appliance or fixture, but doesn't have a ground itself when plugged into the wall.  This is not a big deal for lamps and small DC appliances which do not have a ground.  However, if you want to plug in an appliance which has a ground, and you want it grounded, this could be an issue.  The package doesn't advertise that it is grounded, but allowing you to plug in a grounded appliance is a little strange.  Most other non-grounded timers don't allow you to plug in grounded appliances or fixtures.  The black outdoor timer in this combo passes the ground through, so it's a non-issue for that timer.My only other complaint, albeit minor, is the construction of the black outdoor timer's housing.  I really wish that it had a better closing mechanism.  The timer that I received easily opens from the bottom since there is really no latching mechanism.  It could really be improved with a toggle latch buckle on the bottom, which I may install myself.  I wouldn't let this discourage you from purchasing the combo as the timer works as intended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FK81LYZZFZNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFKU0P4#wasThisHelpful","R3FK81LYZZFZNL","A14DLOV1GBUUWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DLOV1GBUUWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who is a little DIY-inclined, I shy away from electrical because of my fear of house fires.  Around where we live, it seems there's a report every month of a house fire starting from suspected bad wiring.  This is enough to make me very hesitant at wiring myself.However, this Lutron MSCL-OP153M-WH Maestro switch was as easy as can be, especially if you are installing it at a single-pole (only one switch connected to your lights) switch location.  For my case, I installed this in the bathroom and after cutting the power, I only had to connect the ground from the current switch to the ground on the Lutron Maestro, then connect one of the switch wires to the black terminal on the Lutron Maestro and the other wire to the brass terminal on the Lutron Maestro.  It doesn't matter which wire goes to which of the two terminals (black and brass). That was the extent of installation for a single pole location.  They include wire nuts as well in the package.The instructions detail installation for multiple-pole locations as well, but I didn't venture into those sine it was more than I needed.  Installation appears to be more complicated for these installations.Lutron made the programming as easy as possible as well.  I also really love the flexibility of this switch.  After pulling out a tab on the bottom of the switch, you enter the programming mode and they made the programming itself very simple.  Each of the features of this switch is easily programmed separately.So far, this switch is performing as expected and I couldn't be happier.  The dim on and dim off function is so nice.  It has been working perfectly with my newer G7 Power Eureka LED 22W (110W) 1600Lumen BR40 Recessed Light Bulb, Dimmable 3000K Soft White Light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMI802A7EGSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAO4NUM#wasThisHelpful","R1GMI802A7EGSA","A14DLOV1GBUUWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DLOV1GBUUWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not a usual listener of New Age music, but I enjoyed this album a lot. Three aspects of this album that I noticed throughout the album:- The tempo is very slow relative to music I might regularly listen to- The piano is prominent: always very clear and bright - there isn't any muddiness to the voices on this album- This album is very consistent with its voices, piano, piano pad, violin, chorale voices, only deviating once that I remember with a lead saxophone voice (that wasn't especially strong relative to the others)Three standout songs on this album that I would recommend listening to first:Track 7. Albinoni's Secret Smile: Albinoni AdagioTrack 8. Memories of the Ice Cream TruckTrack 11. A'la M'ode to Joy: Ode to Joy (this is high praise as Ode to Joy sends me back to the youthful despair of piano lessons)I found the complexity of the playing in the final third of the album to be the most enjoyable part of this album.Make no mistake - this is an album for a specific audience of listeners.

I really enjoy this case I think a lot of OtterBox users will as well.I received this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UCVYZEFN006Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWSSMLG#wasThisHelpful","R1UCVYZEFN006Z","A1FRIBXUEIRNQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FRIBXUEIRNQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"***UPDATE October 1 2015***I mentioned below that the battery level indicator had not been updated - and while that is technically true, in iOS9 the battery level percentage is given much more accurately in the notification center pull-down.  Simply swipe down from the home screen and right there under ""today"" it displays both your phone's remaining battery and the Jaybird X2's in percentage points.  Very useful if you are paranoid about running out of juice.*** =ORIGINAL REVIEW***You want the best Bluetooth earbuds? Wondering if these X2's are worth the extra cabbage over the already stellar Jaybird Bluebud X?  At first glance, the X2 seems to be a minor cosmetic upgrade from the Buebuds X and in some senses that is the case.  After testing these out (as much as you can in a couple of weeks) I'm pretty sure they are the way to go.  I was actually sold as soon as I fired them up - right out of the gate the new sound blew me away.  They sound so much richer and are even louder than the old model, and all the other little improvements are just gravy.  Sweet gravy.So, they are louder and sound better.  The battery also lasts a little longer.  My old X's usually last 5 or 6 hours.  I've yet to run these out after 6 and I just charge them every other day out of paranoia.  The second biggest improvement is in the microphone.  Whereas before I dreaded taking calls on the X.  I'm not even sure my wife realizes I'm using these.  The Bluetooth connection is (seems) better - I've never had problems before, but I've had zero drops.  They look better - they are basically the same ""Frankenstein Bolts"" design, but they've done away with the chrome accents in favor of matte black (that's what I got anyway).The company didn't redesign the physical earbuds much at all, actually.  Of course I wish they were smaller, but this is still the most compact Bluetooth design out there (as far as I've seen).  Once they're in your ears they disappear - to you at least, as long as you don't try to lay the side of your head on a pillow.  Jaybird has improved the ""wings"" supposedly, but I've never needed those.  I use foam tips and they hold them in amazingly well.  The nice thing is that they've packed in a whole set of foam tips this time around.  In fact, ComplyFoam has designed a new line of tips specifically for Jaybirds.  They do have a noticeably wide ""stalk"" and it took a little magic to get even the biggest cored tips to fit.  Unfortunately they haven't yet made a Tsx version (my fave), so I'll probably keep on using those, but the new green ones are easier to install.  They are available only from Jaybird as of now, but the folks at Comply told me soon you can order directly from them as well.There is also a case which is just about a as pointless as the old case. However, the included flat micro USB cable is the same great cable that came with the old model.Two more gripes: the instructions are now mostly online.  The packaging is just as extravagant, but somehow they decided to get rid of the nice booklet that had detailed steps to fitting and using the included strap-shorteners and other convenient-to-have info.  Now there's just a tiny card and a suggestion to visit them online.  Second, they didn't update the software to improve the battery level readout.  On the iPhone at least, the battery strength is displayed on the screen next to the Bluetooth symbol.  But it's only got three settings: full, part full, and running on empty.  I've used others that have 5 or so levels, wand it was more useful (partly because the battery didn't last half as long).The voice-feedback works identically to before: a nice female voice tells you when you've connected or if you've powered them on or off and a few other things - it sure beats interpreting beeps.  The controls have changed a little though, they no longer beep every time you change the volume or the track.  I guess it's better?Really, the new sound signature and better battery are enough to make these worthy of an upgrade.  The rest really is not such a big deal.  So if you want to save $40-$50, the old Bluebuds X are still a great option, but these are the way to go if you are starting from scratch or just looking for the best.  If you've never used Bluetooth buds before you are in for a treat - wireless is so much more convenient in every way, especially if you commute or exercise or ever listen through headphones.  And these are the most wireless, best sounding buds there are.I got mine for free, but I've bought so many pairs of the old ones I think it's buyback time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2953694Z62ZF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HSW4SM#wasThisHelpful","R2953694Z62ZF3","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like the form-factor of this portable battery.  The rounded rectangular shape feels great in your hand and fits in your pocket or in a bag without cluttering it up.  It looks better than it should, and the included charging cable makes it so much more convenient than a battery that requires you to carry around an extra cable just to use it.  My only gripe is that the included cable only charges at the lower power, so if you want to use the high-powered port you do need that cable.  Not the end of the world, but it would be nice.I get easily two iPhone charges out of this, but I've actually only rarely run it down to nothing so it's hard to say exactly how many it hold in real life.  Frankly, you might want a bigger battery for heavy travel or a long time away from an outlet, but for a long day or two away from the wall this should come in really handy without weighing you down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36MWFOUWH4WK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UC8V0BS#wasThisHelpful","R36MWFOUWH4WK1","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So unique looking, in fact, that it's a bit of a conversation piece.

"If the charging dock actually played music, then this would be a near-perfect basic clock-radio.  It would still be bare bones, but it would do everything it looks like it should do.  You are probably still going to want a real stereo, but the sound is pretty decent, it even seems to be stereo from two separate speakers.  Certainly good enough for bedside news podcasts and low volume music.  The clock works as advertised, so do the alarms.  It's small.  It only gets FM, and the lights aren't backlit or textured, so you'll have to memorize their functions in the dark, but at least the snooze bar is oversized.  Best of all, it's $13!  You can buy something nice when you get a new phone with a lightning connector.  It's just annoying to have to plug in that audio cable, and even more annoying to have to unplug it or yank the clock radio off the table.

"Brand new out of the box, the charging via the USB port didn't work consistently.  I tried it with several cables and several devices, and sometimes the charging would work, but most often it would just sit there and not connect.  We had bought it so that we could use it with the 30-pin connector now and the lightning cable later when my daughter upgrades her iPod, but it's not nice enough to to put up with the lightweight crappy build at this price... for a third of the price you can get a 30-pin only clock radio with the same limited functionality and mediocre sound quality.

"This is such a good invention I wonder how it's taken so long to come up with.  The TP comes just like it looks in the picture - six squarish rolls in a package the size of four traditional rolls.  Because there's no center cardboard tube they pack down by about 30%.  It is exactly the same paper as Quilted Northern (luxurious), and once it's on the roller it works about 95% the same.  The difference is that the rolling isn't quite as smooth but it's perfectly fine.*NOTE* The Amazon web page seems to have changed since I received this - it used to clearly say it was ""Quilted Northern Ultra Plush Bathroom Tissue"", and the sticker on the packaging reflected the same.  If the product hasn't changed you should know it's some of the thickest, softest paper out there.The one minus is the slight difficulty of putting it on the roller.  Supposedly, you squeeze the outside of the roll and it should open up, but that didn't work so well for me.  I had to open it up manually.  Also easy, but I know my 7 year old daughter will be less delicate, and it will probably take a little getting used to for all of us.  It would be nice if there was a tab or something sticking out to make it more obvious.  Again, not a deal breaker, but that's why I'm not giving it the full 5 stars.If you are one of those classy people who forego the roller altogether and just keep your TP in a basket you'd be crazy not to get this.  I hope it saves a lot of trees.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39WK0K7ERM2FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DQJKTE#wasThisHelpful","R39WK0K7ERM2FB","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are used to using Sonicare brushes these will probably feel a little strange at first.  The brush head LOOKS noticeably bigger than the standard Sonicare brush head.  When put side-by-side however, they are actually just a little bigger - at least the are that the bristles cover is.  The bristles on a Diamondclean head flare out more, while these have a bigger base but come out straight from there.  In your mouth, however, that base definitely feels bigger and bristles so, too.  I didn't have any problem reaching any part of my teeth or mouth, but it does feel very unfamiliar for a Sonicare - which is still half the size of a standard toothbrush.Brushing-wise, it's hard to say what makes these heads different, at least in a functional way.  The packaging has some pretty pictures of the brush head bending (the base where the bristles attach is made of a soft rubber-like plastic), but they don't go into any technical detail, and this webpage has even less.  I can't deny that my teeth feel as clean as they ever have for hours after using these things, but I always feel that way after using my usual ""DiamondClean"" brush head as well.  This head has longer, stiffer, bristles and it does feel like they got into the crannies between my teeth, so I am happy to have gotten these free for review purposes - they are all so expensive it's hard to justify paying even more than usual just to try something new.  I will try to get these again, but honestly, I would buy whichever brush head was cheaper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AN4WWEEU8SNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012QQEVM8#wasThisHelpful","R3AN4WWEEU8SNP","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are good colored pencils for kids, but they look better than they actually turn out to be.  The lead is actually pretty hard and it's hard to color in large areas - it's better for line drawing - so even though they are designed to appeal to youngsters they can be a little frustrating.  We only got the colored set, but I'd be interested in the black ones to just use as mechanical pencils.  Don't get me wrong - my 7yo daughter was pretty excited when she got them, and we have been taking them along for drawing at restaurants, but she prefers regular colored pencils when she's drawing and coloring at home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RA3FKNM9G5K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105U1YV8#wasThisHelpful","R2RA3FKNM9G5K7","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a little bit on the small side for a bath mat, but otherwise it's totally worth the $10 if you like the color.  It's not particularly luxurious, and the ""popcorn"" texture is a curious texture for a rug that you will be walking on in bare feet, but I actually have come to like it.  It's also not particularly hefty and has no grip or rubber on the bottom so that it tends to slide around and bunch up a little.  DII Oceanique makes softer mats for the same price (the cotton ribbed version), but if you like a more raw style than this is the way to go.

"According to specs, all Sonicare toothbrushes are essentially the same - they all vibrate at the same speed (31,000 strokes per minute) and can all use the wide range of available brush heads (except for the older Essence line).  That is to say, they are all incredible at cleaning your teeth and if you've never used one, you are in for a real treat.  The difference between models is sometimes negligible, and often more than a little vague - all the bells and whistles are of dubious value.  Often, the simpler the toothbrush is, the better it is - there's less buttons to break and less to pay for.In practice however, there are some features that may be worth paying for, but it really depends on your needs and the openness of your pocketbook.  I have been through several Sonicare brushes, and the model I was using prior to this one is the 2 Series, pretty much the barest-bone model there is.  I really like it, but I prefer this new HealthyWhite Plus (AKA Series 5) - not because of the buttons or features, but because I think it is actually built better.  Moving to the Series 2 from the model I had before, I had noticed (as had many other people) that the brush had a loud rattle (or buzzing) when it wasn't in your mouth.  It was a little distracting, but I honestly thought it had to do more with the brush head than the handle.  However, I immediately noticed with this new brush that the buzz is almost gone - and if you look at the photo I've attached you can see that the brush head sits significantly closer to the top of the handle than on the Series 2.  I tried them both with a variety of brush heads, and always got the same result: the new model is much quieter.  It's nice, but I really don't know if it's worth twice the price.This model has a few superior features as well. It has a ""Quad-pacer"" which alerts you every 30 seconds to change to another area of your mouth.  All the brushes have a 2-minute timer, and you can definitely do without the 30-second alerts, but it is nice just to note the passing time.  It also uses a Lithium battery instead of the NiMH battery, which gives it three weeks between charges instead of two.  Obviously that's better, but honestly, going two weeks is fine.  This model also has three power levels and a whitening mode.  Whitening is really just an extra 15-seconds of brushing that get tacked onto the end of the 2 minutes, and unless you have sensitive gums, you will probably never use the lower power settings. Philips touts this as ""6 different modes"" which is a really just the math of 3 power levels x 2 cleaning modes, and it's really nothing to write home about.I really like the new Diamond Clean brush head that is included with this set - but you can put any head on you like.  The charger and travel case are the standard-issue Sonicare accessories and will also work with most other Sonicare brushes.Really, it's the better build that has locked this in as my daily toothbrush, but if I had to pay (I was provided both these brushes free for review purposes) I don't know if I wouldn't rather pay $30-$50 for the more basic model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R106V6GUNWRSSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR86BY#wasThisHelpful","R106V6GUNWRSSS","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great kit to add to your kid's arts and crafts supplies, but it won't be the simplest or the easiest.  I'd actually give it 3.5 stars, but my daughter is on the young end of the recommended age (just turned 8) and she needs help using it, so I have to give the system the benefit of the doubt and the bonus 1/2 star.  She didn't take to it as quickly as her Rainbow Loom, but I think she will like it more as she uses it.Basically the kit contains a white plastic ""spin loom"", a lot of colored thread, a few other pieces, and a set of instructions.  The instructions are well done and easy to follow, and there are also video instructions on the web.  It seems like hours of creative fun, and the bracelets are actually pretty nice, although the big knots are a little distracting.The problems we had were twofold - the loom can take a lot of force to turn correctly.  It's almost a two-person job to turn the dials and move the twist threads properly.  Second, the threads are wrapped in such a way that they become tangled almost as soon as you start using them, and we had to throw out several feet of each one we used.  Maybe we'll figure both of these things out as we go along, but they made things a little frustrating.Bottom line: great bracelets, plenty of supplies in  the kit, hours of fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q4KPMTEJ1ILC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060LLICC#wasThisHelpful","R2Q4KPMTEJ1ILC","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm basically just going to start with a transcription of my 7-yo daughter's reaction: ""What?!  Awe-some!  Look mommy, Shopkins!  This is just like the one that Fiona has, but different!  Thank you, Daddy!""Next, her review: ""I would say it gets 5 stars because it has two Shopkins and and a freezer section where you can put frozen Shopkins.  Also, I like the pictures of the ice-cream Shopkins on the inside of the truck, and I hope I can get those Shopkins.  It's awesome.""The facts - this is a Shopkins themed Ice Cream truck.  It rolls, and the top opens and there are a few compartments inside that also open.  It comes with two Shopkins exclusive to this set, a couple of ""cooler bags"" for holding Shopkins, a spinning three-shopkin ice-cream cone stand, and a sandwich-board.  To an adult these look pretty cute but it is a little worrisone that the whole theme of these tows are ""shopping"".  However, after sitting and playing with them for a while I think I get it a little bit more.  They are about shopping in a similar way to a fake grocery store is - it's vaguely educational on the one hand in that kids are being exposed to ""things"", and on the other, these tiny dolls are really cute and inspire a lot of imaginative play that has zero to do with shopping.The packaging is heavily decorated but it all has to be destroyed to get the toys out and seems like a waste.

"This is not my usual cat litter - we usually go with one of the various ""Fresh Step"" varieties - but I was happy to test this out and have my mind changed.  Unfortunately, I am left unconvinced.  This litter did not seem to be significantly ""lighter"" than my old litter, and it certainly wasn't any ""fresher"", and I am dubious about the ""unscented"" claims as well.  In fact, I'm thinking maybe they need to scent it up a little.The best feature of this litter is undoubtedly the packaging.  The big jug with the large screw-off cap and opening is incredibly convenient compared to the cumbersome box that I am used to.  It's easy to carry and easy to pour, no matter how full the container is.  It's what's inside that's the problem.  The litter itself is a dark to medium gray (darker than Fresh Step), and it clumps perfectly well, but I noticed a poof of dust every time I'd pour some out.  Not the end of the world, but I think the claim for 99% dust free is a real stretch.  The picture that accompanies the ""dust free"" claim on the jug is of cat's paws, and I will agree that I didn't see any paw prints around the box, so they may have me there.My biggest issue is with the scent.  Even before the cat used the litter I noticed a slightly disgusting acidic smell.  It was worse after the cat had used the litter.  I have never noticed that smell before using my old litter or any other litter that I've tried.  It didn't keep the cat out of the box, but it does really bother me.I will possibly try one of the scented varieties because I do really like the jug, but I will probably avoid this type from now on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U1V05PXNEEYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6EXLEO#wasThisHelpful","R1U1V05PXNEEYL","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this to replace a truly premium leather case that unfortunately just couldn't hold up to months of use and was coming apart at the seams.  This one sacrifices some premium feel for sturdiness and should last for the rest of the life of the 5s (if I can't find a better one).It is much more leather-like than the Apple official ""leather"" snap-on case.  That's what I care about - I want something that replaces the cold glass and metal in my hand with a soft supple natural and grippy surface that is a pleasure to hold.  So, it's better and I would give it 3.5 stars if I could - it just about gets the job done.  But calling it ""premium leather"" is comical.  It does seem like genuine leather, but it's stretched so thin that it is not particularly soft to the touch and it falls short of adding much of the desired grippiness that would keep it from sliding off of your dashboard or center console.It looks nice and the fit is perfect - it also seems to be built reasonably well - the outer ridge/lip is actually capped with plastic, which will probably help it stay in decent condition, but does distract a little from the leather feel of holding the case since your fingers are always touching the hard plastic edge.If looks are enough for you to forgive some lesser leather, then the price is right you will like this case.  Obviously, it primarily protects the back and sides and you should get a screen protector for the front.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTS26GZCHDGK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNYU48M#wasThisHelpful","RTS26GZCHDGK6","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to find a decent leather case that actually feels like leather and gives your iPhone that extra bit of luxurious grippyness.  So many are advertised as genuine leather but feel stretched so thin that they might as well be plastic.  This case is definitely not plastic - it's a thick (almost too thick) piece of suede-like tan leather glued to a plastic shell that protects the sides and back of the iphone 5/5s.  It's not exactly the softest piece of leather, but it is a lot better than most.  The nice thing is that as I've been using it it has taken on a nice patina from the oils in my skin, and I think it's just getting better looking.  It also truly feels like a natural material in the hand, and as it ages will become more unique.The problem I've had with other cases like this is that the top edge is sealed with something other than leather.  Some are rimmed with a piece of plastic, others with a strip of rubber.  Inevitably, this is where the problems start as the case comes unglued.  You are constantly touching that part of the case and, inevitably, this is where the problems start as the case comes unglued.  This case wrapes the leather all the way around the top edge and completely seals the few exposed ends with matching tan plastic.  It SEEMS like a much sturdier option, and there are no obvious places where this thing will start to unravel.That same lip of the case actually rises a hair above the front screen and provides a small level of protection to the front as well.  If you lay your phone face-down, the face will not actually be touching the table.The only complaint I have is that, while the case is very snug and isn't budging as all, it almost seems to be tiny bit too small for the phone.  I mean, it fits, but the edges seem to be a straining a bit, and I can still see a bit of the metal band on the inside edge of the case.  Honestly, this may be the design of the case, and I'm just used to other cases, which are thinner and fold over that strip a little more.I got this to replace another leather case by Waxhaws, which was better leather but just could not stay glued.  I just need this to last another 10 months until my contract is up, and it looks like this is going to last and stay classy the whole time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NFY5TP5YYYVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009DJ4FUU#wasThisHelpful","R3NFY5TP5YYYVV","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Typical Aqua Sphere quality, exact same fit as normal non-polarized Kayenne goggles.  The polarized lenses were amazingly useful in the bright sun and clear waters off of Miami, they cut the sun and glare and left me with a clearer image than the simpler dark lenses.  So comfortable and for all intents and purposes leak-free - I can wear these goggles for extended periods of time.  For me, totally worth spending almost twice as much on these over the Kayenne with ""Smoke"" lenses as I plan to use them exclusively for open-water swimming.The Kayenne lenses are larger than the Kaiman models, and their triangle shape moves the bridge a little higher so it doesn't pinch my nose (which is of the larger variety) at all.

"Once you get a Sonicare toothbrush you will never go back to regular brushing.  So what makes this brush different than other Sonicare brushes, and why would you buy this one over another?  It's a slightly complicated question but it's worth asking since you will most likely keep and use this brush for years so try to get one you like.I believe all Sonicare brushes (except the ""Power-Up"" series) have a top vibration mode of 31,000 strokes per minute, and all of the brushes except for the ""Essence"" line can swap out their brush heads for whichever style you prefer.  So basically, all the differences come down to the handle style and handle features.  Many of those differences are pointless and only a few are really even necessary, so I usually opt for the the simplest model - they're usually cheaper and frankly, there's less buttons to break or deal with.This Series 3 brush is great and has a somewhat unique set of features.  It's got the same newer slim handle, and the main feature here is that it has three cleaning intensities designed for cleaning sensitive gums.  I've never had a problem using the full-intensity mode, but my gums are relatively healthy, but I do like the new lower-intensity settings for just cleaning the gum area.  To set the intensity you just press the button twice quickly and it advances to the next level.  Next time you use the brush it will revert to the last intensity used - not sure if this is a great feature or not, because I then have to cycle through the settings to brush and back again to clean my gums.  BUT, if you have sensitive gums it's probablyu worth it.There are two other significant differences between this model and the basic Series 2 brush.  First, this model uses a Lithium Ion battery, as opposed to a NiMH, which should give it about a third more brushes before it needs recharging.  I have both, and to be honest, I have not noticed much difference.  Both brushes seriously go for weeks without charging.  It's amazing actually, so while a longer battery is nice, the other model is no slouch.  Second, this model has the ""Quad-Pacer"" timer, which takes the normal 2-minute timer and beeps/pauses briefly every 30 seconds to prompt you to move to a different part of your mouth.  Frankly, if you're a grown up you should be able to keep track of which of your teeth you've brushed, but I like it just because it keeps me aware of how far into the 2 minutes I am.This model does include a travel case and a charger (the same charger that comes with all Sonicare brushes), and one special gum-centric brush head.  Supposedly it's rounder and shaped to be good for your gums AND teeth.  Whatever, I like the Diamond Clean heads, which also claim to stimulate your gums.I have noticed that with these new models there is more rattle noise than I remember in my old (broken) FlexCare model.  Just a little, and it's not in the handle.  With no brush head attached they just emit a low hum, but with a brush attached it gets loud until you put it in your mouth and start brushing.  Once the brush is pressed against your teeth, even a tiny bit, it quiets back down.  It's the same in this model and the series 2, so I think it's a function of the new style of brush heads.Cleaning wise, this brush seems identical to the cheaper Series 2 and the more expensive FlexCare models. Meaning that it's excellent. Only if you need the sensitive-gum treatment modes is this particular model a must-have.  There is a more expensive FlexCare model that also features three intensity levels.Great brush all around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Q3F6O7NPMPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67T3O#wasThisHelpful","R18Q3F6O7NPMPW","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE:  I actually have both the 7 port and the 7 port +2 hubsThis is a very sleek USB 3 hub, and it works perfectly well, however I might have been hoping for more than it can reasonably be expected to do. The short review: if you need a USB 3 hub this is pretty ideal.  If you want to use it for mixing USB 2 and USB 3 and charging higher-amp items like and iPad, you should definitely get the upgraded model with the two charging ports, but even that is a little problematic and you might need to upgrade to  a thunderbolt dock or something (more expensive) like that.The documentation is particularly minimal and what there is leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  Will attaching USB 2 and USB 3 items together to this hub slow the performance of the USB 3 devices?  What power is supplied to which ports?  When I initially ordered this hub I could have sworn it mentioned two of the data ports could do 2.5 amps (for an iPad), but now there is no mention of it anywhere - not on the device or the packaging (so maybe I was imagining it?).  Do the two ""charging ports"" on the deluxe model also provide data transfer? (that answer I could test for myself easily: NO.  This leads to a more swapping of cables, which was what I was trying to avoid by installing this hub).Physically this is a very nice hub, but it has a few design issues that make it less than perfect.  It is sleek and slim and nicely built, BUT the arrangement of the ports makes it impossible to really take advantage of it's small size.  Specifically, the ports are on four sides of the hub, meaning that if you use them all ( and you have to use at least three) you get an octupus (octobus?) type of arrangement of cables coming out of it, and it is very hard to get it to stay in place.  The power cord attaches on one side, the input attaches in the back, and the seven USB ports are on the front, and the charging ports are on the other side.  I would have much preferred to have the power and input cords at least attach in the back together, and the charging ports to also be on the front - that would make it longer if you kept the spacing the same, so an even better arrangement would be to incorporate the charging ports into two of the USB 3 ports and mark them clearly.Also, while not as frighteningly large as some of the reviews make it out to be, the wall-wart power supply IS pretty big and will take up two or even three outlets on a typical power strip.  However, this is only the case fr the 7 port hub without the charging ports - the UH720 model actually has an in-line power brick that plugs in with a regular-old plug.  There's still a big power-supply, it just sits in the floor instead of in the outlet.SO - if you need this strictly as a USB 3 hub you are good to go.  I attached two USB 3 hard drives to my iMac and noticed no degradation of transfer speeds from having these attached directly to the computer.  The problem I see is that if you mix USB 3 and 2 they will all work, but it is much harder to determine what happens at that point.  Certainly the USB 2 devices work fine (this hub and USB 3 in general is backwards compatible), but I've heard that on some devices mixing the two will bring everything down to the slowest speed, and the problem is that many of the devices I have are not USB 3 - even Apple's lightning connector cables are  USB 2!  Note that I have not noticed any real slowdown yet, but I'm not really sure how to easily do that.  Add that to the complication that these ports do not supply enough power to charge more power hungry devices like an iPad anyway, and it seems like I'm back to needing a second hub or messing with the cables every time I need to charge or sync an iPad.  As I mentioned before, the extra charging ports are great for charging, but they don't provide for data-exchange with the computer.One more note, and a contradictory one: it is nice to have the dedicated charging ports in that sometimes you don't want to do a data-transfer (or automatically launch iTunes).As everyone else has mentioned, the hub is very nicely built and requires zero installation beyond plugging it in (with the nice 2-foot long included cable).  I'm definitely going to continue using the 7+ hub, but will keep my eye on it for transfer speeds and charging configurations, which I will update you with here if anyone is interested.  A lot of the problems/issues/questions I have could be addressed with better documentation - and I have looked on the TP-Link website and at the downloadable documentation and I am still not sure - even the wording ""actual transmission speed is limited by the setting of the device connected"" is unclear (I understand that USB 3 will not speed up USB 2 devices, but does USB 2 mess with the transmission speed of USB 3 devices connected at the same time? it depends on the internal wiring of the hub, which is not mentioned)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2Y2E9VKRX3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTK16FK#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2Y2E9VKRX3B","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Short answer: this basically turns your iPad Air2 into a laptop.  The iPad itself snaps into one side of the case and can then stand up like an open laptop (at one of three possible viewing angles), close like a clamshell, or fold the keyboard behind for a more typical (albeit heavier) tablet configuration.  It works pretty much flawlessly.There's basically two easy steps to setting it up: snap the iPad into the case and pair it to the keyboard with bluetooth.  It took three seconds total, the snapping-in portion being by far the more difficult part.  Pairing was almost too simple - there's no power button and the keyboard went into pairing mode automatically when I had the iPad in the case.  Then, every time I needed to type something I just used the keyboard.About the keyboard itself - it's great.  The keys are surprising solid feeling for such a slim piece of hardware, and have a nice bounce and click to them.  I did find I had to make doubly sure I pressed the space bar, but I quickly adapted to it.  It basically looks like a Macbook keyboard BUT there are a bunch of keys that are specific to an iPad and are incredibly useful.  Among them are the ""Home button"" which brings you back to the main iPad screen, the ""App Switcher"" function button, a ""screen Grab"" function, and volume and track control.  All truly great, and there are probably a few more that I haven't figured out yet.  One thing that is lacking is a comprehensive instruction manual - there's only a double-sided instruction sheet printed int the tiniest lettering and it only covers the basics (but in several languages).Once your iPad is in the case and you've used it for a while you'll find a few other nice physical touches.  The buttons are all exposed and accessible, as are the speaker, headphone and lighting ports.  The keyboard turns on and off automatically when it's closed or folded behind the tablet.  The magnets that hold the ipad up as a stand work very well and there is no sliding or give when in use - but it's also very easy to close, making the whole system very versatile.One excellent thing that I like - and this is a function of Bluetooth, not specifically this keyboard - is that even with the keyboard attached via Bluetooth you can still attach Bluetooth speakers or headphones.  It really just seems like your iPad has turned into a laptop computer.  It seems very sturdy and high-quality as well.There are only a few things that I don't love about this case/keyboard:I wish there was a ""send"" button.  When I type iMessages the Enter button acts as a carriage-return, and I still have to press send on the screen.  This is one of those things I wish there was an instruction manual for, as I feel like there must be a way to do it that I can't find.I would like to be able to rotate the iPad in the stand.  If I launch a vertical-only app (like instagram) I have to turn the whole thing 90 degrees.  I understand the ""Pro"" version of this keyboard allows for that, but this doesn't.  There might also be some poccasions where having the iPad vertical would work better anyway, and you really can't do that with this case.  Not a deal-breaker, but it's a little awkward.Lastly, it's heavy.  Or, to be more exact, it turns my amazingly light iPad Air2 into a much heavier device.  I don't actually know that they could do much about it, as the keyboard is amazingly thin and the battery lasts for (up to) 6 months on standby, and the physical keys are great as they are, and the part that holds the iPad is open-backed, so I don't know how they could trim much weight out of it.  It's just a fact that it really adds a lot of weight, which is nice when it's being used as a laptop, but not great when being used as a tablet for any extended amount of time.  The only thing I think they could do about it is make it easier to pop the iPad out of the case - right now it takes a few seconds of fiddling around and twisting and pressing the case with a lot of pressure.This is a great option for a keyboard and stand for your iPad Air2.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R174FA02UK7Z2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTDTT5Y#wasThisHelpful","R174FA02UK7Z2C","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice looking - but not beautiful - sound bar that is primarily meant to improve the sound from your tv and also serves as a speaker system for all your stereo needs in a medium sized room.  It will definitely sound better than your tv's built - in speakers but, honestly, will not beat out a more expensive set of speakers and an amplifier.  It fits pretty much perfectly with a 46"" television, but would work with any tv with audio outputs.The pictures here don't lie - it's basically a long back rectangle capped at both ends with a bluish tinted metal section.  The cap on the left hides the power cord and the cap on the right houses all the inputs and the control buttons and (small simple not-annoying) indicator lights. Included in the box is a remote control, a simple wall-mounting kit, and one rca cable.About that cable: my new Toshiba LCD tv doesn't have an RCA output so it's useless.  I can only imagine that a lot of new tv's can't make use of it, either.  That's the audio cable with a red and a white plug on each end.  You can split a headphone output with another type of cable, but I got a TOSlink digital audio cable to take advantage of the better audio.  It would've been nice if one had been included - a basic one is about $7 at Amazon.Three are several inputs on this thing: the RCA input, a digital optical input, a stereo mini/3.5 mm (headphone), and Bluetooth.  So you can pretty much attach it to your tv, your phone, and something else simultaneously.  You can use the buttons on the unit or the remote to switch easily between them.  Depending on the connection and the device you can either use the volume control for the device or the volume control on the remote.  Bluetooth setup was a breeze and the range was great - I had my phone in the next room with no dropped signal.The sound from the bar is great for what it is, and it will be a major improvement for your tv.  It's small for a sound bar, so you could probably get a better one if you had a larger tv, but compared to all the Bluetooth speakers out there it's huge, and it sounds a whole lot better as well.  We use this to play music all the time and it's great.  We have not quite figured out how to control the volume with the TV remote, but I think that has more to do with the TV settings, so we are using the small remote for volume in the meantime .","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4RE26SLVX67D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ4MOLU#wasThisHelpful","R4RE26SLVX67D","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*POST-SKI TRIP UPDATE*  My wife wore this jacket for a week of skiing in Utah.  Granted - 4 of 6 days were in the the high 30's and sunny, but this jacket worked flawlessly, and even garnered compliments from a hired pro and ski-shop workers and friends.  She also found that the hood is indeed roomy enough to fit over a helmet when adjusted properly, which is not so useful on warm days but is always nice on a windy chairlift.  On the colder days this was a excellent outer layer, and if it had been even warmer she would've gone without the liner so this is a no-brainer for a ski trip. This is a very nice looking jacket if you like the dark-purple color.  The shell material still has a softness to it that belies it's weatherproofness.  It almost feels like suede, and is very nice to touch.  In fact, despite it's purplishness this jacket is quite stylish, and my wife got compliments left and right on it here in New York City's latest wintry mix of snow and ice and rain.She is wearing it for the winter weather now, but really we got it for an upcoming ski-trip.  We've worn Helly/Hansen jackets for skiing for years and were happy to take them up on a free upgrade.  Unfortunately, after wearing it around for a while I think we are a little disappointed... not in the construction or the style, but the I am afraid the design leaves a few things to be desired for real winter sports.Basically, this is a 3-in-1 jacket - the shell and the lining can either be worn separately or zipped together to make an insulated winter jacket.  That part all looks and works great.  It's reasonably warm, and the windproofing and weatherproofing seem top-notch.  The outer pockets are lightly lined and officially qualify as ""hand-warmer"" pockets, but they could be cozier.  The hood can be operated one-handed and the zippers all have nice long pull-tabs for gloved operation.  Cuffs and the waist are all easily adjustable and cinchable, and zipping in the liner is pretty straighforward, and once it's in it feels like it was built in.All that sounds great, right?  The problems are really that there seem to be some things left out that would make this a better winter-sport jacket.  Mainly, the lack of inner pockets and a detachable powder-skirt are making my wife less than thrilled about wearing this on the mountain.  There's nowhere to stuff your gloves (not to mention goggles).  Even if you leave those out, there is no great place inside the coat to stuff a phone and a wallet.That being said, the coat is versatile and it's nice you can wear it in different configurations and will work in a range of conditions.  And it will definitely keep you dry and pretty warm.It also runs a little small - we'd usually get a small but the medium fit better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Z0KMYY308Y9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IB5KQ82#wasThisHelpful","R4Z0KMYY308Y9","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"very nice set of basic markers for your whiteboard.  We use these for my kid's easel, NOT for work, and they're pretty good for that.  Actually, it's nice that they are office products in that they're built for work and not for play.  The tips are tough and stay sharp, and there's plenty of ink unlike some sort of toy marker set.  The downside is that the colors are just basic.  Two blacks (nice), one red, one blue, and one green marker.  They all have no-roll caps and a chamber you can peer into to see the ink levels.The nicest things about this set are actually the extra items.

"It's winter now, and in New York it's freezing, pardon my French.  I jumped at getting a free tube of this cream because it's exactly what I need for the wind and sun and generally miserable conditions that  await me every time I go outside.The cream is soft and smooth and practically odorless - I don't know exactly what makes it ""FOR MEN"" - maybe the other Nivea products contain perfumes?  Applied to the exposed parts of my face it has protected my from chapping and sunburn.  It feels great and works really well.  Occasionally I'll use it at the end of a long day if I have dry skin.The 2.5 oz bottle is actually pretty big - if you order three for $20 it seems like a decent, if not great, deal.

"This is the smallest printer/scanner I've seen that isn't some sort of weird mini printer.  You give up a few features, like automatic double-sided printing, but all the compromises seem minimal for the smaller footprint, especially considering just how rarely I need to print things nowadays.If you, like me, just need something for the occasional printing and scanning job and not for hard core office work, then this may well be the printer for you.This printer wins the size war by ditching the paper tray for a more old-school pop-up paper-feeder.  Usually, you leave it collapsed and tucked away, and when you need to print something you extend the feeder and drop in some paper.  You can certainly leave it open, fed, and ready to go if you feel like it, but that does make it a little less classy.There's minimal set-up involved - it connects to your Wi-Fi network and can be accessed by any computer/phone/tablet on that network.  I believe you can even print remotely using the app.  Set-up via the front panel was reasonably straightforward, and I have had zero issues printing from or scanning to the computer (iMac).  It's AirPrint compatible, so it will print from an iPhone without any third-party apps.Print quality is pretty good - great for documents, and completely acceptable (if not spectacular) for photos.I hope it lasts forever and I never have to buy another printer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38UXYTGKWIHVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBAPEYE#wasThisHelpful","R38UXYTGKWIHVZ","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hadn't thought of it before but the first time I used this on fragile wine glasses I realized that it's dangerous to use such a hard-handled brush.  The metal handle was constantly clinking and threatening to break my favorite glasses.  Truth be told, I didn't ACTUALLY break any, but I was being very careful.  The head is pretty big as it is, so when you get it in there to clean out a tall glass you can't help but bang it against the glass rims.Otherwise, it's just like the other OXO Dish Brush, just more expensive and slightly better looking.  Non-replaceable head, bristles that inevitably get bent and discolored, and a small hole for hanging - which is too small for the hooks on my dishrack.Also, even thought the steel is nice looking, it's hollow on the underside, so there are sharp (not knife-sharp, but not easy-on the hands, either) edges.

"Vacuums, amiright?  So many to choose from, so many compromises, so many gimmicks, and all for something I don't even want to use anyway... and they never last!I want what everybody wants - something that makes cleaning easy, and that means it actually cleans, and cleans as many surfaces as possible as easily as possible.  AND, I've decided not to go for broke and buy one of the ridiculously expensive models because they seem to break just as often as the ordinarily expensive ones.  Also, I want a bagless model, as the last thing I want to do is EVER run out of bags.Enter the the Hoover Wind Tunnel Bagless Cannister...REASONS TO BUY:1. Price is right2. Cannister style (preferred by my housekeeper and easier on the arms than a heavy upright)3. Bagless4. Powered Bush-Head (and other useful tools)5.  Wind-tunnel design with HEPA filters.The early results are in and I think this is a pretty great vacuum.  The power-brush-head is something that seems to be harder and harder to find, especially in this price-range.  A lot of other models and brands feature a carpet-head, but it spins the brush with only suction-power and I have found that inferior to a truly mechanized brush that really beats the dust out of your rugs.Everything works well and is very ergonomic - the extension wand is sturdy and the the whole unit seems well-made.  It took me a few minutes to figure out how to dissemble the dust canister (you need to empty the inner filter as well and it's kind of hidden in there), but once it was back together it snapped right back into place.I have yet to have a problem with overheating as a few other people have mentioned (which worried me), but I do agree that the extension cord is shorter than I would like.  However, the auto-rewind works very well.  I really like that the rewind and power buttons are both foot-operated (big buttons that you step on) and that saves my back a bit.  Also, there's a notch that lets you stand the wand up when you're not using it and saves the thing from crashing to the floor.  There's a strange three-way attachment for corners and curtains that is a little odd - you flip it around and pull it open to use different features.  I'd rather have separate tools, but these work fine.I hope this is the last vacuum I ever buy, or at least it lasts long enough for the next revolution in cleaning to come along.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMW0UYNZB4EBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJQQP46#wasThisHelpful","RMW0UYNZB4EBQ","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They don't roll that well, but they have a knack for disappearing before the cat can find them, only to reappear as soon as you walk by and either crunch into the carpet or jab your foot like a ball bearing.My cat loves them I'll probably get more","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUR2P3A7RTHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LE5KWS0#wasThisHelpful","R1LUR2P3A7RTHH","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is pretty much a perfect gift for a six-year-old girl who loves Lalaloopsy.  Mine squealed with delight when she saw it.  It's not so perfect for adults though, as I dreaded immediately the thought of her getting those markers and stamps all over herself and things other than the doll.We tore it open and got started - the markers worked but I fear they might not last too long.  The stamps worked too, and there was less color rubbing off than I thought.  Things were easy to erase with the sponge, but the ink seemed easier to wipe off the sooner you acted.It's very cute, and your kid will love it.

"I am a long time beginner guitar player.  I know some scales and chords and can pick out a few songs, and would never pretend to be a real musician.  I play my guitar for fun - and unfortunately this thing was just not very easy to enjoy using, at least not straight out of the box.  It's not exactly complicated to set up or connect to an iPad, it's just a completely different process than connecting anything else.  Also, the included instructions are sparse.  What I wanted was a nice friendly brochure that would really lay it all out : ""Welcome to your new JamStick!  Let's get you up and running!!!"", but really it took me 45 minutes before I understood what I was dealing with and could get a handle on what I might be able to do with it.  It's very customizable, but the instructions are on the website and you need to download some new firmware and it helps to understand guitar to know how you want to customize it.  I just wish that the default settings were better so I could have played it first and dug into tweaking it later.In short, I can't vouch personally for the advanced user - but reading all the reviews seems to indicate that this is a great tool and instrument for musicians and ambitious beginners.  For a casual player though, I really think it's just a little too daunting.The packaging and build are great, I look forward to taking it on a long vacation where I cdan really dig in, but at home I'm just going to keep playing my acoustic guitar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R292QS0XQD64ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JA8QD40#wasThisHelpful","R292QS0XQD64ZY","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very colorful map/puzzle of the USA - pretty much exactly what it looks like.  I was hoping it would help my young daughter (and me) learn about the 50 states, their landmarks, and whatever else might be shown on the map.  It's about 3 feet x 2 feet, which is much bigger than our other 50 states map.There are  few problems here though, that make it impossible to recommend this map:1.  It may have ""50 magnets"", but they are NOT all states.  There are magnets for the Great Lakes, but a lot of the smaller states are lumped together.  I guess they couldn't be bothered separating them, but it's hard to explain why Long Island isn't part of the New York piece.2. The magnets don't work very well.  Texas and Florida just keep sliding off and everything else wiggles out of place if you breathe in its direction.3.  the board warps.  This probably goes a little towards explaining the magnet problem, but it's a serious design flaw - and it's dry as a bone at my house, so it's not due to moisture.Otherwise, it's a pretty map, with lots of interesting information and you could stare at it for hours and see new things in it all the time.  The quality issues are going to send it to the trash heap sooner rather than later.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QEHVNNAHAJF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMT1PHC#wasThisHelpful","R1QEHVNNAHAJF8","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Took a little adjusting to settle into the groove of this book and the new selection of characters and viewpoints, but it was totally worth it.  It's a slow burn that builds up to a gripping end that may lack the punch-in-the-gut shock of the Red Wedding, but was incredibly compelling and fascinating.  It expands and deepens the world of Westeros, while completely ignoring the goings on in Esos (except for the Braavos).  If you liked the other books there's no reason not to tear through this one.For the TV fans out there, this is the first book that covers events yet to occur on the show - although there is a little overlap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZQXOA4SFSNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCKGPC#wasThisHelpful","R37ZQXOA4SFSNS","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to love this, and really there's nothing technically wrong with it if you're using it a certain way, but it's got a couple of flaws if you - like me - are hoping to use it for cutting down on chargers and cabling while travelling (or even at home on a bedside table).Basically, this is a brick about the size of a big pack of cigarettes.  To it's credit it's very solidly built and feels like a high-quality piece of equipment.  The downside of that is that it's big and heavy.  Even the cable is heavy-duty and takes up a lot of space.  At one end there are four USB ports that are high-powered enough to charge four iPads simultaneously.  You can charge four of anything (that uses USB) easily providing you have the cables.I had read the promo material going in, and understood it was designed for an office or classroom environment, not specifically for travel, but until I  had it in hand I didn't understand exactly what that meant.  It really is a bit hefty to lug around in your carry-on baggage.  I packed it in my checked luggage and broke it out at the hotel, where it worked perfectly well for charging everything - although the charging maybe seemed a little slower than I expected (I could be wrong though, I wasn't being scientific).The other issue I have with it is how closely-packed the USB ports are.  If you are just plugging in USB cables, I don't think it will be an issue.  But if you have anything bigger it will either block the other ports or not fit at all.  For instance, I have a portable battery for my phone and there was really no way to charge it on this without some sort of extension cable.If you don't mind carrying it or don't plan on carrying it or have plenty of space, this will be for you.  You still need your own cables, but I charged up an iPhone an iPad Bluetooth headphones and a Kindle all at the same time, and only had to find one available outlet in the hotel room, which was great.  But not great enough that I would bring it in my carry-on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJA1E515U2UDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LA0F8E2#wasThisHelpful","RJA1E515U2UDL","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aqua Sphere goggles are clearly quality goggles, built and designed to be excellent for all sorts of swimming.  Still, goggles wear out, and I still manage to go through them, and I always go back to the Kaiman and Kayenne models.This new ""EXO"" version of the Kaiman is no exception.  Almost exactly the same as Kaiman, but made with a softer-yet-more-durable material that is designed to be worn for longer persiods of time.  They definitely feel softer and more gummy to the touch, but I have noticed very little functional difference.  They don't leak, stay reasonably fog and scratch free, and are very easy to adjust.This model has the new little levers for adjusting the strap - not the little squeeze buttons they used to use - and they hold tight and can be worked one-handed and quickly.  It did seem like the actual strap was shorter than usual, but still fit around my head - just with less extra handle flapping around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S8YCXE2G8YX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNYE3BI#wasThisHelpful","R3S8YCXE2G8YX","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the child-friendly version of the normal Sonicare electric toothbrush.  And as such it is an all-out excellent device for cleaning teeth.  If you shell out the money for it, your kid will love it, and will probably like brushing more than with any other toothbrush.  It's hard to argue with brushing when your teeth are so obviously getting clean.The main feature of this brush is a slightly smaller handle than on an adult-sized Sonicare.  It's not small, though.  It's a kid-grip friendly rubbery blue handle, with a removable face plate that can be decorated with one of the included 8 stickers.  There's also a second sheet of stickers that can be used to decorate the rest of the brush or just for further personalization.Ours came charged enough to use right out of the box, which is what my daughter wanted to do.  The included instructions are a little sparse and it was kind of confusing to determine what the lower button was for (the top button obviously turns it on and off).  I really could have used some sort of ""WELCOME CHILD, TO YOUR NEW TOOTHBRUSH!!!"" guide or pamphlet.  Instead we were digging around on the flimsy 4-language instruction paper, trying to figure the thing out.  Basically though, the brush has two child modes - a one minute timer that vibrates at a lower level, and a two-minute timer that vibrates a little more vigorously.  You can choose one with the the bottom button, and both modes have an ease-in period, where the vibration is ramped up across the first two-weeks of brushing.  At the end of the minute/two minutes, the brush makes a cheerful chaime for a job well done.This model comes with a single brush head.  The stem it mounts to looks the same as the one on my adult Sonicare, and I'm sure you could swap it out/replace it with any Sonicare brush.This is a premium piece of hardware, and it feels as well-made as any Sonicare I've seen.  it should last for years and years, and the charge should last weeks at a time.  You and your child will not regret getting one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKFX0M0SV7SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LB3X868#wasThisHelpful","RXKFX0M0SV7SZ","A38QHZEEYZKT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38QHZEEYZKT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wonderful, warm, soft jackets - excellent for cold weather. Purchased 4 in small. The dogs love them, like to wear them even in the house. They close with one long strip of Velcro which makes the easy to close but allows less variability in tightness. These parkas are very easy to put on, and have front leg sleeves which make them much warmer and stay on and fit better.  The hood glops over their faces so it works better with them snapped back.  The color is more beautiful than the photo - I would not really call it green, but more of a golden metallic khaki. These jackets are far more beautiful than expected.You really won't know how they fit until you try them on. With 4 dogs who fit small range, the jackets are plenty roomy except for the girth part. They are much too small to wear Mediums. The jackets don't close completely on all the dogs but the Velcro adheres well enough to keep the jacket on. 3 of the dogs have either T-shirts or GOIBY fleece vests that they wear underneath.I can let the dogs out in the fences in yard to do their business and play even in nippy weather without feeling guilty or worried.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNLB93KXC2VEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009757FE8#wasThisHelpful","RNLB93KXC2VEN","A2GA55P7WGHJCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA55P7WGHJCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I buy dog clothing fir functionality, not cuteness - though am very pleased that the dogs do look cute.

I eat a lot of food packed in cans that I purchase mostly from Amazon - mostly canned fruit and black beans. It's fun to use and avoids putting stress on my hands. No mess at all. The price is excellent.  This is much better than the $40 can opener that I have to return. I do not use it on cans with a pull tab. Does not take up much space on the counter, and is attractive. It is weighted well - making it more stable during operation and most likely sturdier than some other lighter ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI0QWM8OH7YP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CGQD4#wasThisHelpful","RI0QWM8OH7YP5","A2GA55P7WGHJCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA55P7WGHJCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very pleased so far, have been using them for more than a week. This tip is firm and is covered with what looks like metal mesh. Makes good contact with devices with no marring or scratches. They arrived quickly by Amazon Prime.Metal container is cute and protected them well in shipping. They are not fancy and they WORK. I had just purchased some much more elegant styli for $19 and the tips crushed and then fell off as soon as I started to use them. The utility of these was refreshing, hard to go wrong at $3 apiece. If a problem arises, I will amend this review.As the reviews vary greatly from one to five, I am wondering if they work better with some devices than others.I am using mine with iPad2 and iPhone 5 with excellent results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFIPYSC57Z0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UDGFIK#wasThisHelpful","RXFIPYSC57Z0U","A2GA55P7WGHJCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA55P7WGHJCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have purchased these several times and like them a lot. I usually pour off the liquid and leave just a little for taste - without some liquid they are very bland if served by themselves. Good protein addition to a meal for vegetarians and vegans. Do not cause (me) any flatulence when the liquid is poured off. The price is good for organic black beans, but does cost more than regular Goya canned black beans from the supermarket. Costs about the same as twice the amount of Goya canned black beans.The main attraction is ease of delivery. The cans do not have a pull tab, and need to be opened with a can opener. Good staple to have in the house.My last delivery was the first time that a can was badly dented. I but it in a container of water to see if any bubbles came out, and none did. I thought that I would be able to eat it, but once the can was opened the thought of eating something that might make me sick made me gag. Once in my life I got food poisoning and the pain was beyond description, lost 15 pounds in a week, and 2 months later lots of hair fell out plus muscle wasting. I will ask company if they are willing to send me a replacement can.Just called Amazon; consultant Tanisha was excellent. A partial refund for this order has been credited to my account. All's well that ends well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQTZLBUDOMQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LKXRU4#wasThisHelpful","R3VQTZLBUDOMQU","A2GA55P7WGHJCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA55P7WGHJCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For those viewers who already have interest and some knowledge about the Rosenberg case, this is an invaluable addition. The granddaughter was pleasant to watch and listen to, seemed very open-minded and interested in finding out the truth about her grandparents' activities and motivations before and after arrest. This also shed light on other players in this shameful failure of the US criminal justice system, including Julius Rosenberg's brother who falsely incriminated him (and admitted so later) and a colleague in the Communist Party who was imprisoned for 19 years for refusing to falsely incriminate Julius Rosenberg.  An aspect of which I had been unaware was that the Rosenberg's had been wonderful parents; the son, the granddaughter's father, convincingly shared how happy and loved and safe he and his brother felt during their early years.  Their parents had been very much in love with each other.  SPOILER ALERT: The two young sons of the executed Rosenbergs had to be removed from the care of Ethel's mother because of her cruelty to them. Julius Rosenberg did give or attempt to give technical information to the Soviet Union, but was likely about the angle of a propeller, and could not possibly have been about the atomic bomb, the crime of which he was accused and for which he was executed; Ethel was completely innocent; she was used as a hostage in a power play to try to coerce Julius into making a confession to avoid having Ethel executed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OW5IV9YZ5PM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBHDH6G#wasThisHelpful","R1OW5IV9YZ5PM6","A2GA55P7WGHJCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA55P7WGHJCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just received these this evening. The pens look and feel beautiful, but not working very well. After using it just a few hours with iPhone and iPad, I looked at the nib and it has become dented, twisted and it falling out of the pen. Just tried another stylus - thinking that perhaps the first one was just a dud. Within half an hour the end of the tip is all smashed in. i tried the rest and they all fell apart.I am truly perplexed on how this product received such high ratings. This is simply, unequivocally the WORST stylus I have ever used. And so pretty too!I will have to return them. Usually I can use a stylus for months or even a few years.UPDATE: the sellers saw my review and took the initiative to email me; they wrote that a small batch had been made with flaws, and asked if the tips were falling off, which by this time, a day later, they were. They said that they would send me replacements of the tips which would arrive in a couple of weeks. I am still sitting on the fence about whether to return the whole set or not. I purchased two stylifor $5.99 from another company, and am experiencing no problems whatsoever. ANOTHER UPDATE: At long last received the replacement ends - sent from China I think and SLOW - they sent 4 replacements instead of 7. I spent half an hour and could not get a single one on. Nearly shredded my fingernails. When I emailed the company, they had the balls to send me a Whole list of complicated questions about had I done this or that to replace the ends. I asked if they were going to pay me by the hour. No tools came with replacements.  Am mad as a hornet by this point. I notice that the price dropped $2 since I bought them.  I am glad for those customers who had a good experience, but mine sucked. The company responded promptly to my last email and I received the refund within a couple of hours, and a courteous, apologetic email.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SLHTS2UUREQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFMILFY#wasThisHelpful","R2SLHTS2UUREQY","A2GA55P7WGHJCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA55P7WGHJCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just received this charger today, so I cannot speak to its longevity. It is far more attractive and better made than the photo shows. It does come with one short cable to charge the charger. You connect the smaller port, which resembles that of an iPhone 4, to the charger and the USB end to your energy source.  You WILL need another cable to charge your device. I charged my iPhone 5 16GB while using it in about half an hour. My phone has been losing charge rapidly recently, so I will carry it with me in my purse. The price is fantastic!UPDATE:Still working. Purchased a pink and a gold and carry them in my purse. Just took a road trip and they really saved the day - forgot my charger and these worked fine.  Had the price not increased,I would be buying more. Still very much worth it at $10 apiece.The little instruction book is easy and worth the few minutes to read it. There is a tiny button on top, if you don't press it, it will not charge your phone even while it is connected by the correct cable.  Works fine with iPhone 6 Plus, though phone does get a little warm.

However, it's a nice addition that perhaps someone else can use.Everything was wrapped up and packaged nicely and since I always wear makeup, I was more than happy to receive this at a discounted price for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LB046BZK3KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NZAYPC#wasThisHelpful","R2LB046BZK3KU","A221VX2BGTIYLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221VX2BGTIYLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very pleased with this so far. We have a large grill on the back deck and while we have two lights out there, it's still not bright. Living in Florida, we grill about four times a week and this is the perfect way to see easier since we often grill at night - in fact, we rarely grill during the day since my husband is at work. The other great thing is the waterproof construction since all it does around here is storm, which I love but it's not great for electrical items.It's very quality made and simple to use so I recommend it for when you need extra light at your grill.

"This is a very cute little mp3 player that makes a great gift, especially for a kid or someone who is new to technology. The reason I gave it a less than perfect review is the price. For just 4gb of capacity, I feel that the price is high. It does what you need it to do for the most part and it's a simple player that doesn't have bells and whistles but if you lost it, you wouldn't lose sleep over it like you would a Smartphone or iPod. However, I do believe that in all fairness, the price should be lowered to be comparable to what you get in capacity - just my opinion.However, it does allow for 64gb of capacity and has Bluetooth so those are extras that reflect the price.I received this product for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLHY4FJI8DLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UN5SHS#wasThisHelpful","R1HLHY4FJI8DLT","A221VX2BGTIYLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221VX2BGTIYLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story is about Kate. “The book follows Kate from her early life in Savannah before the Civil War, to Europe, where she meets the real Dracula. Trying to create a new strain of people, Dracula experiments on Kate.”It's different, innovative, and definitely something I enjoyed immensely.

To find the killer, he’ll need to control his many compulsions. Unfortunately self-control has never been Ben’s strong suit.”From the start I was intrigued and from that point on, I just kept reading.

The heat, the people dressing casual at a funeral, the concrete set up from an old restaurant, and we've been to the Florida Keys so I felt the entire vibe of the location.Each book in the series was exciting, fun to read, and really honed in on the whole Florida feeling of which I could relate.I highly recommend this set because you get three books for the price and each one allows you to start the next one seamlessly and full of anticipation.

"I've got a few wallets at home, they range in price but this Timberland would be the cheapest of the lot.  In terms of quality I was somewhat impressed with this wallet.  The leather looks and feels very nice, definitely not something I expected for the price (around $20 at the moment).  You've got one bill slot, unfortunately (I prefer two), two ID windows, 5 credit card/card slots and two more slots on each side under the card slot/ID area.  So there's quite a bit of space for your various needs and for the price I'd say this is an easy recommendation.

"Have used this Eureka heater for a few days now and am really impressed with it.  It's similar in style to some of the ""fans"" you can get and it's got a very nice aesthetic look, sleek design and it was beyond simple to put together.  You're pretty much screwing the base to the heater and turning on the power on the bottom.  The remote is small and getting to the battery can be an issue if you don't pay attention to the instructions (then again the instructions aren't the greatest as they are on the back of the tiny remote).  You press to the side and the battery slides out easily enough.  The remote works fine although I do have some issues about the fact that once I turn the heater off it takes a few seconds to actually turn off so I'm not sure if it is off from time to time.  The unit itself will give off a bit of a 'smell' initially but it heats up very quickly and will warm up a room in just a few minutes.

"Considering the price point, this is a good headset for what you're paying.  Setup is not hard, works with the consoles or computers.  The sound quality is good but nothing special, then again it shouldn't be out of the ordinary for a hundred dollars.  The best aspect of these headphones is that they are wireless making for one less cord to be bothered by.  The cord that does come with the speakers is too short though, so if you want to use it with your console or PC it won't be very comfortable.  The headset itself is comfortable enough but I did get some fatigue after a few hours, there is pressure on your ears as you're wearing it although the top of the headphones have a nice foam insert so there's not much pressure on the top of your head.

"My house is multi-story with a basement and I have around two desktops, three laptops, and half a dozen phones/tables regularly attached to my wireless connection.  It's rare that I have issues with the connection as I have an excellent router but the one issue I did notice from time to time is that I would lose the signal when I was in the basement or standing outside my house and in my backyard.  This Amped Wireless TITAN-EX, High Power AC1900 Wi-Fi Range Extender proved to be the perfect solution to that issue.  Setup is quick and easy, once the unit is assmbled and connected to your wifi network you're pretty much off and running.  I ran to the basement to test the strength and walked around my house seeing how far my signal would now extend.  The Amped unit performed perfectly.  No issues in my basement and even outside I still pick up a good signal so I can now enjoy being/working outdoors with access to my wireless.  I haven't had much of a chance to test out the USB 3.0 port and how well that option works with this unit but in general I don't think that technology has advanced far enough to make it worthwhile to share files of anything but music, that is limited sized data rather than large file sizes (which I've had issues with previously when it came to sharing over wireless networks).

"""The Confidence Game"" is an entertaining read but one that's watered down for a broad audience.  It's engaging, definitely readable, but at times can be quite repetitive.  The author uses her degree and knowledge to weave a story based on multiple studies and experiments done throughout the past century to show the various ways people can be conned into parting with their (usually) hard-earned money.  The ideas aren't new, the examples are abundant (so much so that a few of the stories date from a few years back) and they touch on all aspects of society (be you rich, poor, well educated, white collar or blue collar).  The allure of easy money, the want and sometimes need to trust someone who's just entered your life but has in various ways proven to be ""trustworthy"" and ""honest"" leaves a distinct impression on many people that often enough leads to unintended consequences, humiliation, and theft.  The topics covered in each chapter could probably have an entire volume devoted to them alone.  There are many ideas presented and to grasp them all, especially when looking at ourselves from the side (or our actions in hindsight), is impossible from one sitting.  This is in many ways a starting point for readers to take a step back and take a look at their previous actions and how they can avoid making similar or new mistakes in the future.  We have all been conned in one way or another, we've all experienced false hope or tried to believe in something that in hindsight seems preposterous.  Knowing what situations to look for, what to be aware of, and what to avoid will undoubtedly help us lead a life that's more rewarding not just for ourselves but also for those around us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZSBFD73650G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427414#wasThisHelpful","RLZSBFD73650G","A2UKE7GIVC7XFW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UKE7GIVC7XFW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not a huge coffee drinker but considering you can make coffee and tea with this machine, I was interested to see what it offered.  Personally, I'm satisfied with the machine as it is.  It's easy to setup, it heats up very quickly, and you can make coffee/tea within about 2 minutes.  Why I'm giving this four stars instead of five is because I'm finding the cost of the 'capsules' to be too much.  More so since I don't like quite a few of them (Cappuccino and Mocha were not great at all, my favorite from the flavors I received with the machine was Chai Tea Latte, so I'm looking forward to trying more of the tea offerings in the near future).

My only issue with this product is that I'm not at all a fan of the scent.  Then again my hair is short so having to smell it regularly after showers isn't a a problem.

"Very nice scent that doesn't linger after the shower.  Works well as a body wash but I'm not thrilled about the shampoo & conditioner aspects of it.  As a body wash it'll leave you feeling clean and refreshed (party thanks to the nice scent) but I think as a shampoo & conditioner it'll work well enough for those with hair that doesn't need much upkeep/maintenance.  Otherwise, I'd suggest keeping your body wash, at the least, separate from your shampoo & conditioner.

It's not huge so it doesn't take up too much counter space, it's easy to open and close and easy enough to operate once you get the hang of things.  You've got a bit of a variety in terms of what you can make (aside from the steaming you can do while cooking your rice) and the finished product is delicious.

It works on regular gasoline and for up to 8 hours you'll have power once you start it up.

Similar to Le Male and Cool Water, Eternity has somewhat passed its prime and has become outclassed by the number of fragrances available today and by better quality compositions, at least in my opinion.

So I'm not surprised that Eternity isn't doing much for me or that's it's quite forgettable.  On my skin the scent is very familiar with green notes seemingly dominating the life of this fragrance.

"I'm somewhat torn about what I want to give this computer in terms of a star rating.  It's probably between three and four stars at best but really it's a three star system.  Windows 8 helps but overall you're getting a very basic set up here.  Hardware wise, you've got four USB ports (two in front and two in back), one additional USB 3 port in back, and an additional SD slot in front.  You can hook up two monitors (one via HDMI) and that's about it aside from internet and sound.  The keyboard and mouse are the most basic of basics and really aren't even worth mentioning.  The system itself is mediocre.  Four gigs of ram just isn't that much, more is 500gb of space, and they're still making Celeron processors??  If you need a backup computer, if you need a computer for your grandparents, if you're a poor student who needs to write papers and go online for the most part, or if you're only going to use the most basic of applications then you can readily invest in this system.

Vaja cases last, the leather is great and it takes a beating while offering a good amount of protection (depending on your needs and which case you decide to go with).  This 'ullu' 'Premium leather snap-on case' seems to be a miss for me.  The outside is leather but the interior is plastic.  The corners are not fully covered either on top or on the bottom (the Vaja case I'm using now is practically a copy of this one but with better protection, including fully covering all four corners).  This ullu case doesn't feel very 'premium' if I'm honest.

However, when I tried to connect this speaker to my computer via bluetooth I had absolutely no luck.  Not sure where the problem is as I've been able to use other bluetooth devices with my computer, but it is the main reason for a four rather than five star review.If you're making a call, the speaker works very well.  I kept it at a 3 foot distance and never struggled to either talk or listen to the other person.

"David Stahel's latest work, 'The Battle for Moscow', is somewhat removed from his previous volumes on this topic.  This is his fourth book and it becomes evident that what was clearly visible on a majority of pages in his first three texts is missing from much of this latest effort.  That is, there is a significant lack of tactical and operational descriptions of battles.  At least one amazon reviewer has already commented on how disappointed they were to discover this.  Yet, in this supposed 'weakness' lies the strength of Stahel's argument(s).  The Wehrmacht on June 22, 1941 was a vaunted fighting force that managed to defeat and conquer most of Europe.  The ensuing invasion of the Soviet Union showcased, on the surface, the Wehrmacht's military prowess operationally and on a tactical level as numerous encirclements and victories were achieved.  Stahel outlines them all quite well (mainly in regards to Army Groups Center and South) in his previous volumes.  That is, the Red Army lost hundreds of thousands in the encirclements at Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, and finally at Viazma/Briansk.  Yet, the narrative that concentrates on the victorious outcomes of those encirclements misses the forest for the trees.Thus, 'The Battle for Moscow' is a somewhat different creature than Stahel's previous works because it highlights again and again the slow progress of the German Army in the latter half of Operation Typhoon throughout November and early December of 1941.  There are no major battles, encirclements, or defeats of the Red Army because German forces were incapable of launching significant operations to achieve such feats, and when a major city was taken, Rostov by Army Group South, it eventually had to be evacuated due to Red Army pressure and German inability to hold it.  Stahel thus forces the reader to assume the physical and psychological state of the German Army through the numerous diaries, letters, memoirs, and battle reports that he quotes from.  The exhaustion of German troops was palpable on very page as they became bogged down in the mud of early November while hoping for a sudden freeze to create conditions for an eventual lunge toward Moscow.  And when that freeze did come it brought with it new obstacles that while facilitating one last push toward the Soviet capital also meant a whole new level of exhaustion, misery, disease and madness for countless soldiers.Additionally, on more than one occasion Stahel draws the reader's attention to the genocidal nature of the war that Hitler unleashed against the Soviet Union and the complicity of the Wehrmacht in the numerous stages of the Holocaust and the deaths of millions of Soviet prisoners of war.  One simply cannot discuss Operation Barbarossa or Typhoon without highlighting the numerous difficulties the Germans faced in the rear from Soviet partisans and how they treated the civilian population as the cold set in and they needed both clothing and dwellings to keep warm, which often meant stealing from the local population and displacing it to fend for themselves while appropriating their living quarters.Finally, much of Stahel's concentration rests on the German commanders and their actions throughout November.  Unlike many self-serving post-war memoirs, archival documentation from this period shows that generals like Bock, Guderian, Kluge, etc., had a choice in how they handled their troops and assignments.  None were forced to go on the offensive, the majority of those decisions they took for themselves based on a variety of factors until their forces were simply beyond the means of, in some cases, even picking up their weapons.  No German general was dismissed at this point (dismissals would come after the Soviet counter-offensive commenced) and yet being on the frontline, knowing the situation their soldiers were facing, they continued to ignore the exhaustion of their troops, the limits of their mobility (lack of trucks, tanks, planes, etc.) and forced their depleted formations onto the offensive again and again.  What was the end goal?  Moscow was never supposed to be captured, but encirclement was no longer an option as the targets were far too distant for what the Wehrmacht could hope to accomplish in November or December.  Thus, Stahel emphasizes the disconnect that existed between the goals of German commanders and the reality of what their forces could accomplish, with the final result being a situation that soon found exhausted and depleted German troops retreating in the face of a well-developed and planned Soviet counter-offensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRW01V6FWS4WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107087600#wasThisHelpful","RRW01V6FWS4WS","A2UKE7GIVC7XFW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UKE7GIVC7XFW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second conditioner I've tried from Pantene and it's very similar to the other in this line.  The scent is nice and not overpowering (at least for me), you'll need a little more rather than less depending on how much hair you have (I have short hair and with this conditioner I use more than with some others) and the end result is good, but I wouldn't say great or anything special.

"I'm not new to war literature but I am somewhat distant from literature that deals with the Vietnam war.  I've read some texts on it and am always interested in new accounts that deal with interesting missions and individuals.  In some ways I think this book could have been a lot more than it was.  When you get right down to it, you have something that reads more like a journalistic account than a 'biography'.  This is a short read at under 300 pages and a quick one, which reflects well on the author's writing style and abilities.  But there are many 'actors' to keep track of and often they're introduced rather quickly and without much depth with the end result that there's little connection between the reader and the subject(s).  Nonetheless, the main subject of the book, Roy Benavidez, is definitely the stuff of 'legends'.The author begins with a description of Roy's background and family, which helped him become the man he was when the Vietnam war was in progress.  There is a small history dealing with Studies and Observations Group (SOG), which was in charge of numerous intelligence missions in and around Vietnam (and I'd have loved to hear more about them) and then the fateful mission that had Benavidez running 75 years from a helicopter to give much needed support to his friends is recounted from numerous points of view and eye witness accounts.  The final chapters deal with the numerous issues involved in attempting to get Benavidez awarded the Medal of Honor and the bureaucratic red tape that almost made that 'mission impossible.'  Overall, this is an entertaining read with some amazing details that will make you stop and reread sentences and paragraphs on more than one occasion as you check if what you'd just read was actually written.  Stories like these might make many think of the familiar motto ""An Army of One"" but in truth that statement belies the fact that while one man can make a huge difference, men like Benavidez display such heroic qualities in response to the society and environment that reared them.  There is no 'army of one', but there are some men who encompass all that our armed forces should strive to emulate and those back home should recognize and celebrate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPKMCNTX8Z1UJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139512#wasThisHelpful","RPKMCNTX8Z1UJ","A2UKE7GIVC7XFW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UKE7GIVC7XFW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was contacted and asked if I'd be interested in reviewing this Digital scale and I agreed.At the moment I have an Omron Full Body scale that I'm using so I was able to check the accuracy of one against the other.  In general this Smart Weigh scale is very nicely designed.  It doesn't take up much room and is very simple to use.  Just insert the batteries that come with it and step on it.  It will turn on, record your weight, and that's pretty much all there is to it.  Comparing this Smart Weigh scale to the Omron there was a consistent 1lb difference in the weight both scales recorded.  The Omron was showing my weight 1lb heavier than the Smart Weigh.  Unfortunately I do not have a third scale to figure out which of these is lying to me.  A 1lb difference isn't horrible though and it's very helpful to see and track your progress with the different color set up so you know when you've gone up or down in weight.  This is especially helpful for those who don't weigh themselves daily and aren't keeping a log.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85AG60MKKVHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1U42YO#wasThisHelpful","R85AG60MKKVHQ","A2UKE7GIVC7XFW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UKE7GIVC7XFW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You have a choice of four different types of baking cups. This review is for the “sophisticated staybrite” cups. My baking cups came in packs of six pastel and six packs of a navy blue print. You get twelve boxes and each box has liners for 36 cupcakes. You’re not going to run out for a long time.I hate greasing muffin pans and I can never be totally sure all cupcakes will detach unscathed so these liners are the answer. The thing I like best is they can stand alone without a muffin pan so you can get all the cupcakes on one cookie sheet for those dreaded “cupcakes for all” school parties and no muffin tins to wash..Since the liners are foil you can also use them for things like mimi-meatloafs . They are pretty enough to serve as nut-cups or individual candy cups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335RCY4A26BJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E03C6I#wasThisHelpful","R335RCY4A26BJP","A2G04D4QZAXL15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G04D4QZAXL15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading some of the other reviews I really wasn’t expecting much of this apron. Actually I was surprised.  It is fairly good quality material for the price.  The top and skirt part are a crisp percale and the waistband is cotton twill.  I didn’t like the big floppy, unnecessary bow so I removed it, opened it up and used the fabric to make a six inch wide pocket.  There is enough fabric in the bow to make two pockets if you’d like.  The waist ties are about three feet long so, depending on your waist size, you can pull the ties around and tie the bow in front..I give the apron a good spray of fabric sizing before ironing. It would look very cute over a black outfit. No, it’s not going to offer much protection for serious cooking but it makes you look so Martha Stewart-ish. I think it would also be fun for a young “kitchen helper”.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJYRG2YVISIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IEBTR2#wasThisHelpful","REJYRG2YVISIS","A2G04D4QZAXL15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G04D4QZAXL15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Refrigerator shelf liners? It sounded like a good idea at first. No more scrubbing up milk dribbles, just replace with a clean liner. In reality they didn’t work that great.  They cut down on the light quite a bit and scooting the milk cartons out caused them to slide or bunch.  I think the whole point of glass shelves is so you can see what’s in the bins without opening them. Maybe the liners aren’t really meant to be used on the big shelves?So, I cut them to fit the bins and the shelves in the doors and they look very nice.  I like that they are reversible with a very pretty design on both sides and that they are washable.Note: this review is for the fridge liners.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G74T3VLTFKA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRHB176#wasThisHelpful","R3G74T3VLTFKA1","A2G04D4QZAXL15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G04D4QZAXL15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fortunately for the Oster marketing department I’m the one writing this review and not my animals.The fountain is lightweight, easy to fill and clean. I think it’s very attractive (well for a cat fountain).  The sound is very soothing once you get over the compulsion to check for leaky faucets.So, the animal test: “Baby” AKA scare-dy cat took one look at it and slowly backed away.  The Himalayan looked at it like “You’ve GOT to be kidding!” and walked away with her tail in the air.  My very smart Aussie has touched the electric fence a couple of times and avoids anything that buzzes or sounds the least bit electrical.  So five stars from me, one from the animals.

"This printer is a very sleek, compact, nice looking little printer. It was simple to set up. Go to 123.hp.com/setup for simple instructions. You can use it without a computer but if you want to use a computer be sure to set this one as default before sending your print job. One of my favorite features is the self-deploying output tray. I’m embarrassed to tell you how many times I’ve forgotten to pull out the tray and I’ve had to crawl around on the floor looking for the pages. Also you can set it in “quiet mode” if you need it to be quiet. You will have to set up your printer separately on each device you want to use it with. It does great photos although it only has one tray so you will have to set-up for photo paper. Two- sided printing works very well.Re: the instant ink. It will save you about 50% on ink. If you sign up in the first 7 days after activating the printer you get three months free trial.  Be sure to go to hpinstantink.com to cancel if you don’t want to continue or your card will be charged. You can choose a monthly plan based on your pages printed, not ink used.

"That sounds like some kind of oxymoron joke but when I looked around I was surprised at how many other plastic electrical items I have.  It is true, when you lower the toasting lever, it doesn't have that satisfying thuwnk-twang you get with a metal toaster but it works great.  It has the toasting rods like a high end toaster/convection oven I have, not the coiled wire which just seems to toast the surface of your bread.My toaster has a very nice finish and I like the red, retro look. I haven’t tried the defrost mode but it works great for everything from bagels to fat slices of sourdough bread. It is so easy to clean with the removable crumb tray and glass door.Be sure to remove all packing material and heat the toaster on “4” before using.  There is a one year warranty but you can double that if you go online to register the toaster.

"I’m always curious when someone says “It smells like something my grandmother would wear.” Is that a bad thing? Is the grandmother 50 years old and “poison” and “obsession” were the popular perfumes of her youth? Or maybe she’s 80 years old and still wears the Chanel # 5 she wore when she was thirty? My own grandmother always seemed to have a baby on her lap and she smelled of Johnson’s baby powder and graham crackers so I guess everyone has a different idea of what grandmothers smell like.I guess the point I’m trying to make is that the sense of smell is a totally subjective thing and, besides, perfumes will smell entirely different on different people when it combines with their particular body chemistry.The ""Love is on"" eau de toilette  comes in a very pretty, melting- heart bottle which is in a transparent red plastic box. I think it would make a very nice gift and you might love the fragrance.As for the scent… I was disappointed to say the least. I like a light, floral scent and I couldn’t detect a floral tone at all. It sort of reminds me of a combination man’s shaving lotion and burned toast after I wear it for a while.

"It’s not totally clear to me why they call this an all-in-one printer.  I have two all-in-one printers (one Epson, one Canon) which include a fax, document feeder and print legal size documents.  Yes, I know FAX machines aren’t used as much nowadays but we still get requests, mostly from European countries, and it’s better to have a fax and not need it than to need one and not have it.All of that being irrelevant I can tell you Canon makes very well made and dependable machines.  Although the measurements are given in the description I was surprised at the weight and size of the printer. It is much larger than some wireless printers I have seen. It was simple to unpack with a minimum of packing material.  I suggest you go to canon.com/ijsetup and click on “installation while viewing video”. The instructions are much simpler than trying to interpret the set-up guide. Just follow instructions on the 2.5 LCD screenOperation is only guaranteed on windows 8.1, 8, 7, vista and XP. My guess is if you have windows 10 you can go to their website to find a work-around if the printer doesn’t work with windows 10.The printer printed flawlessly, from an iphone, using the included sample photo paper. This printer seemed much quieter than most.Be prepared for a sticker-shock heart attack when you have to replace the ink.Sometimes I wonder if it wouldn't be better to just buy a new machine with included ink.You can buy individual cartridges but it always seems cheaper to buy the ""bundle"" tanks and  I always buy the XL size cartridges because I think they are more economical. 100% US based service and support at 800-OK-CANON.Made in Vietnam.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFVTMSCIHA2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZHLQ#wasThisHelpful","R1TFVTMSCIHA2H","A2G04D4QZAXL15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G04D4QZAXL15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since we plan to use this seed for “dormant seeding” I obviously can’t tell you how this particular bag of seed will grow but we planted some last spring which did very well. Of course you will need to prepare the ground properly and water well. Even letting the seedlings dry out for a few hours will kill them. The seed will take 14 to 21 days to germinate.For dormant seeding you plant in Dec, Jan or Feb and the seed germinate in the spring.“One benefit of dormant seeding is the freezing and thawing of the earth creates crevices in the soil and makes an ideal seedbed. Once conditions are just right in the spring, since the grass seed will already be in place, chances of germination are much improved. This may be beneficial for areas that experience frequent watering bans.” You can “overseed” with winter rye if you want.When planning a dormant overseeding soil should be prepared by aerating or power raking prior to the ground freezing. Any soil amendments for adjusting the pH, such as lime or sulphur, should also be applied prior to the cold weather. Starter Food for New Grass is recommended in the spring, when new seedlings emerge.If you can’t plant for some time the seeds will be viable for a long time if stored properly. You will have a reduction in germination of 5 to 7% for each year the seed is kept.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QID3HWAHOFON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CA42ULQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QID3HWAHOFON","A2G04D4QZAXL15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G04D4QZAXL15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first time  we (well, my dog) have tried the venison flavor of Nutro although we've tried several others. The first ingredient, venison meal, has 300 times the protein of just the meat so that sounds good to me.  Nutro doesn’t add artificial flavors or colors (like Science diets titanium dioxide) so the fewer things to cause allergies and stomach problems the better. Also their minerals are chelated. If you go to their website they have a six page glossary of ingredients and their use and they are up-front about their ingredients and where they come from.Now to the true test…Does the dog like it? Yes! Of course she prefers the canned chunky Nutro but I try to give her some of each.The food may seem a little pricey to some but my Aussie seems to eat less of the protein rich food than the stuff with lots of fillers, like corn, and I'm sure it saves on vet bills.

It seems very stiff but maybe it will loosen with use.The file pockets only go half way down which seems a little odd. The ID tabs for the files are in the pencil pocket under the front flap. When you have the binder fully stuffed, with file pocket and paper, it will only expand to a max of two inches and still zip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4OCYS72NGNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NS2LG#wasThisHelpful","RI4OCYS72NGNH","A2G04D4QZAXL15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G04D4QZAXL15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been doing a lot of research on dog food lately and I've come to one major conclusion: Dog food is like sausage. You're really better off not knowing what is in it and how it's made.Nutro is the one dog food I've found that has ingredients I can understand and nothing to activate your gag reflex. No ""by-products"" or ""plasmas"". They have a six page glossary on their website explaining the ingredients. They have been in business since 1926 and never outsource. Their food is mostly 4 or 5 star ratings on dogfoodadvisor.com.My Aussie absolutely LOVES the Nutro food especially the chunky ones.

"I wouldn't want her to know I said this but there is a certain little Shih Tzu who looks like a little barrel with buggy eyes and a tongue hanging out. It's really not her fault. She is so picky and we tend to give her what she wants and it's not always the best for her.Like all Nutro items I've reviewed this is another quality dogfood.  These are the first ingredients: Chicken, Chicken Meal, Whole Brown Rice, Brewers Rice, Rice Bran, Pea Protein, and Whole Grain Oatmeal. The eighth ingredient is powdered cellulose.  This isn't in most of their recipes but helps in the weight loss food.  I checked to find out what this was and this is their answer:""Powdered cellulose is a natural source of fiber that supports healthy digestion. Cellulose is a part of the NUTRO FIBERBLEND(tm) Formula which includes the ingredients Dried Plain Beet Pulp, Flax Seed and Cellulose. Cellulose is included in the formula because it provides a great source of insoluble fiber for digestive health. The digestive tract works best with an optimal balance of soluble and insoluble fiber levels, and FIBERBLEND(tm) is used to achieve this balance. Pets need insoluble fiber to aid in waste elimination and promote gastrointestinal health.  Cellulose is used in many pet foods and human foods. It is the most common natural compound found on earth, as it provides structure to cell walls of all plants, including fruits and vegetables.  The Nutro Company uses cellulose made from virgin paper. The supplier of our cellulose follows the Food Chemical Codex (FCC), which is a compendium of internationally recognized standards for the purity and identity of food ingredients. ""When I contacted another well-known manufacturer about the source of THEIR cellulose this was their answer: ""Once it is purified it is impossible to determine its original source."". Nutro is transparent about all their ingredients and they have a 6 page glossary of descriptive terms used....All of which is beside the point, I guess.But the true test; will she eat it?  Yes, if it has a little warm water or broth sprinkled over it to soften it a little or maybe a teaspoon or two of baby-food pumpkin or applesauce mixed in.  This is pretty good for a chubb-O who usually has to be bribed with bacon.I think The fact they don't use artificial color, flavors or preservatives might also  help her allergies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCB9NLR9STYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQRK742#wasThisHelpful","R2PCB9NLR9STYW","A2G04D4QZAXL15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G04D4QZAXL15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Of course your results with this conditioner will depend on your type of hair. I have fine curly hair and it left my hair very soft and shiny. Because of the palm oils I think it would work even better on dry, frizzy hair.The directions on the product page say you can use it on dry hair but I think that is a miss-print and probably refers to the nourishing oil (third step.) The directions on the actual bottle just say ""...press in to damp hair, leave three minutes and rinse.""

"It all started for me a little over 15 years ago with an old White's 5900. My grandmother lost a ring somewhere in her massive, poorly maintained yard, and it was up to me (and a second hand 5900) to find it.Long story short, I did just that - and found out that I rather enjoyed hunting in the process.Over the years, I went through many more metal detectors before settling on the Time Ranger some time in 2010. My previously favorite MD was the Garrett Ace 250 (which my wife currently uses - used actually).Hunting is a great hobby, and will pay for itself within a few years (or much sooner if you are lucky).I spent a little over $400 on my Time Ranger, and it paid for itself on the third day - when I dug up a very nice ring (while hunting a popular beach).I went back there countless times over the years, and while I didn't get any more major finds, I do quite often get silver and gold rings, as well as massive amounts of coin. This alone should tell you how great the TR is, since that beach is hunted by dozens of other enthusiasts.A few years ago I got my wife into the hobby and she has been using my old Ace 250. For a while we would go out a few times a week, but that came to an end when hunting made a comeback. These past few years everyone seems to be walking around with a metal detector, looking for lost treasures.While we no longer have time to hunt every week, we make it a point to go out at least once a month, and try our luck. I sometimes follow behind her (if the area looks promising), and since the TR has a greater depth range than the A250, often find things she missed.My deepest find was a coin that was almost 14 inches BELOW ground. Her Ace 250 swept right over it (literally), but the TR had no issue finding it. It was so deep that I almost gave up on it after digging out about 12 inches, but my pinpointer confirmed something, and I kept going.Now I know it's not fair to compare the Ace 250 ($200 dollar detector), vs the Time Ranger (400 dollar detector), but since the TR can now be bought for under $170, it falls in the same price range as the Ace!Both are great detectors, but the TR comes with more bells, whistles, and options. My cousin actually bought the 350 model a few years back and I often find good stuff he missed, while he has no such luck if I lead (although I do try to leave him plenty of junk).I also sometimes compete in sponsored hunts, where I usually end up in the top 10. I never actually took first place, that is usually ""reserved"" for people with thousand dollar machines and a lot more experience than me (but I did come in fourth twice so far, and fifth quite a few times as well - beating out some very expensive MD's).But enough ranting, let me tell you why you should buy this metal detector.First of all, the price is outstanding. Dollar for dollar, you can't beat this machine unless you move up to the Garrett AT Pro. I will be the first to admit, that machine is technically better - but the price difference is huge. If you have $600 to spend on the AT Pro, by all means go with that. Eventually I will upgrade to the ATP as well, but only when it falls into the $400 (or below) range.Second - as long as you know how to ground balance your unit, this thing will detect pretty much anything you want it to.Third - it is waterproof. Just don't submerse it too far and get water on the circuits/display enclosure. Having said that, their support is nice enough to repair your system fairly cheap and extremely fast if you do get it wet.Fourth - You can actually exclude certain items and metals from being found with a simple press of a button! Careful when using this feature though, since I found a LOT of jewelry that read out as pull tabs.Fifth - If you have the patience to learn this wonderful detector - it will last you a life time and get you a lot of great finds.I actually just bought another one for my wife, and sold her Ace 250 on Craigslist.To sum it up, this is a great detector at a great price. I hunted rocky mountains, sandy beaches, and everything in between. Never had an issue with the detection rate or quality. Salt water can get a little tricky, but adjusting the sensitivity quickly fixed the problem. So go ahead and buy confidently. For under $170, you will NOT buy a better metal detector at the moment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15VCLBEI7JOGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005A3L6#wasThisHelpful","R15VCLBEI7JOGK","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work out quite often, and since I am (sadly) no longer in my 30's, I sometimes become very sore after increasing weight. My usual solution is a soak (with salts of course) and Tiger Balm - LOTS of Tiger Balm.I have used and reviewed plenty of these things, and have to say that this vi-tae product is the best pain relief salt I have ever used. The pleasant wintergreen, rosemary, and cedarwood smells overpower pretty much everything else in this mix, resulting in an aroma that is somewhat similar to Tiger Balm. The mix also contains hints of thyme, eucalyptus, and some other pleasant pine-like scent that I can't quite put my finger on.Even more surprising is how effective it is at easing my soreness after a work out. A 35 minute soak left me completely relaxed, and while some discomfort remained, it wasn't too bad. I even decided to skip the Tiger Balm, and that is the biggest praise I can give this product. In fact, it was so effective that I decided to try it again, thinking the first result a fluke. So I increased my squat weight by another 10 pounds and did an additional set - which of course resulted in soreness the very next day. Sure enough, another soak took care of it once again!Having said that, I do have an issue with this mix as well. The 16 ounce container has (at most) enough salt for just five soaks, and sells for $31.50. That is a bit excessive, and puts them on the same level as spa salts (even more expensive than some spa salts actually).If vi-tae lowers the price, and sets up a subscribe and save option with Amazon, I would gladly recommend this product to everyone, as it is I can only recommend it to those that actually need proper pain relief, or don't mind the high price for a quality product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKAT2UBOAKTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4M38NS#wasThisHelpful","R2MKAT2UBOAKTZ","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that this game is not for everyone, it mostly caters to those of us that grew up on Roguelike's.Like most games from the genre that inspire it, there are no instructions. You are simply dropped into a level and are left to figure everything out on your own. However without skills, leveling (leveling up), looting, or money - this game is much less cruel than most other Roguelike's. Having said that, what it lacks in character attachment and certain other areas - it more than makes up in plain deviousness (and enemy placement). Instead of having unlimited moves as we do in most Roguelike's, Ending only gives you a set amount - making the whole thing require a lot more thought, although not until the later levels... The most hardcore can also argue that this set of limited moves imposes the same barrier on you as food does in most Roguelike games, and I agree - to a point.I won't ruin it for those of us that enjoy the challenge of figuring things out, but I will give a hint to some of the people that say the enemies in this game have no rhyme or reason. Quite contrary.Simply look at the way the enemy is positioned, and know that every time you move - so does it (all of them to be exact). Ending uses a turn based movement system (like a lot of other Roguelike's), and it has to be exploited to win.Another hint - take a very close look at the enemies that face you. Specifically which of their ends are ""fat"". That ""fat"" end can destroy you if the enemy attacks before you do.Final hint - You CAN destroy white (not grey) blocks, and sometimes it is beneficial to destroy something (even an enemy) to force everything else to move, other times it is actually detrimental.That's all the hints I will give, since I don't want to be utterly flamed by the people that thrive on games like these. If you have any questions, post them in the comments section and I will answer.With the hints out of the way, lets get back to the real review. Ending has a wide variety of enemies, even if they are all represented by a combination of lines, x's, and squares (those of us that played Akalabeth, think of the world map). There are even enemies that can't be destroyed and whose only purpose is to literally get in your way, move you, and prevent you from escaping the level by reaching the end (presented as a block with a staircase leading down).Ending has three game modes (although only two are drastically different), a puzzle mode where you have to proceed level by level, a survival mode where you are brutally hunted by enemies as you try to escape (this is the mode that will mostly interest the Roguelike fans), and a mode where you can pretty much pick your levels.5/3/2014 Edit: I am WRONG here. The third mode is actually a level editor. Please take a look at T. Crowe's excellent review for more info.The game's minimalistic approach encompass everything about it - from the music (there is none), to the graphics (think old Atari or early computer games). There is even only a single permission in place (which should be removed, since it serves no purpose in a game such as this).Having said all this, I will once again state the most important part of this review - THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. It caters to a niche of gamers, and does so extremely well.My suggestion to the developer, is to add a tutorial mode that will explain a few things about the game, and one that is entirely optional so as to not impact those of us that enjoy figuring things out on our own. My other suggestion is to please remove the single permission you have in place. What purpose does it serve?Other than that, this is a VERY solid game, and well worth the price of admission - and VERY recommended as today's free app of the day.As a side note, Mr. Aaron Steed - I would really LOVE to see you take on a full Roguelike game on the Android. It is very obvious that you love the genre, and have enemy, trap, and level design in place. Why not add gear, loot, and leveling to the equation?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QC1SM9KTV1RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNJF3OI#wasThisHelpful","R1QC1SM9KTV1RA","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now I may not be the best person to review this game, since I am a LEGO fan, a Star Wars nut, and a gamer that enjoys top down 2D shooters. So this game hits me on multiple levels, and when I got to fly the Millennium Falcon, I went full on nerd mode.The game is a very simple top down shooter, with some interesting levels, pleasant graphics, and excellent sound effects. You can chose to pilot for either the Empire or the Rebellion, and this will impact the vehicles you have access to, as well as the enemies you face. Sadly the levels stay mostly the same. The destructible environments are also a nice little feature, but nothing game changing.There are 18 levels spread through two campaigns (Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War) and 4 planets (Geonosis, Endor, Yavin, and Hoth). Combined with the simple but effective upgrade system, you will really be playing this for a while. By destroying your enemies and collecting their scraps, you can upgrade your ship with everything from extra HP to super-weapons.So why did I score this a 4 out of 5? Well while there are no in app purchases at the moment, the permissions in the game ARE already there to allow for such nonsense.I see absolutely no reason to have the following permissions in a single player game:Open network socketsAccess information about Wi-Fi networksAccess information about networksFinally, even though the game IS pretty large, I ended up beating it in just a few hours. Having a lot more levels, upgrades, and Microfighters would go a long way to making this game stellar.To sum it up, yes the game is easily worth the $.99 cent entry fee, and even though you can beat it in just a few hours - it offers a lot of bang for your buck. Add in the lack of IAP and you got a winner. Hopefully the game gets updated with more levels and Microfigthers, as well as stays IAP free.5/9/2014 Update: While the game ran just fine on my two test phones (Nexus 4 with a custom ROM, and a stock Nexus 5), it does have performance issues (including crashes) on some hardware. The issue, most likely, revolves around the obscene amount of RAM the game uses. There seems to be a memory leak within the app itself, as this number seems to increase the longer you play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RN7TSW932F7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQIPX68#wasThisHelpful","R1RN7TSW932F7P","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love sprinkling this into the whirlpool and taking a nice, long soak with my wife, while smooth jazz plays in the background.The pleasant smell of Hinoki and Ginger permeate the air, mixing perfectly with the warm Florida breeze, and all our troubles simply soak away...That is until my daughter runs by, ""accidentally"" tips over the speaker and our glasses of wine, causing the whole experience to come to a very abrupt end.Jokes aside, this stuff is amazing. It smells great and helps to relieve minor aches and pains. However $27 bucks for just 66 ounces is expensive, since to get any kind of soothing effect I had to use about a fourth of a container per soak.After looking around locally, I now get 5 pounds of Hinoki and 5 pounds of Ginger/Chamomile bath salts. That whole order costs me LESS than a three pack of this stuff, and lasts a lot longer. Now the quality is not as good as what this product offers, but the price is much less for over twice the salt.If they ever lower the price to be more reasonable, I will gladly boost this up to a 5 star review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QPKMTKIE6R1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ET7338#wasThisHelpful","R2QPKMTKIE6R1L","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we lived in Florida, this was pretty much a necessity. With this swimsuit on, you don't really have to worry too much about getting your child to stand still for 10+ minutes while you apply sunscreen.My daughter could spend hours in the pool, and I would lounge on the chair next to it (in the shade, with some ""refreshments""). I had her come out ever 30-40 minutes to re-apply sunscreen to her arms and face, and back in she went.Money well spent.As an added bonus, the suit allowed my daughter to wade into the deep end (with my supervision of course), and swim around there, which she loved. I asked her many times if the floating foam got in her way, and she always said no.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R324170OCZBOM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00872A2X8#wasThisHelpful","R324170OCZBOM3","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a pretty bad fall and ended up hurting my back. The doctor prescribed me some muscle relaxants and painkillers, but they didn't really agree with my system and made me pretty dizzy... Meaning I couldn't even drive.They also took 20+ minutes to kick in, and stopped working every few hours.Having used the regular Tiger Balm before for minor aches, I decided to give this Ultra Strength rub a try.My wife would massage this stuff directly into my back and within minutes the pain would become nothing but a dull ache.There really are no side effects with this ointment, unless you count the strong menthol smell that will follow you for hours.Most importantly is that unlike painkillers, two applications of Tiger Balm would last me the day. Yes, the pain was never completely gone, but the improvement was huge - AND it didn't have any impact on my driving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17K751X6RZFHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00016R9T8#wasThisHelpful","R17K751X6RZFHF","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having used this product for a little over a week I lost about a pound. So while I can not comment on the health benefits, of which many are claimed - it did help me shed some weight. This is most likely due to the fructooligosaccharides contained within.I changed absolutely nothing about my diet other than adding this to my yogurt (instead of honey), and my tea (instead of honey and evaporated cane juice).I didn't really feel better or more energized, but my wife claimed to have more energy (which she used to nag me with, I kid, I kid), and she lost about a pound as well.Not bad for a week of use. We will continue to use this syrup and will most likely buy it again when we run out.My wife actually bought Yacon syrup before from Whole Foods (or the local vitamin shop), and it tasted terrible - like dirt. So we didn't really use it. At least this brand tastes like a mix of honey and molasses, with a hint of nut. Huge plus, but it's still a bit too earthy for me. My wife was OK with the taste, but she is also OK with drinking Kombucha daily - which is also quite healthy if home brewed, but tastes weird to me.As with all supplements, this should be taken in moderation - no more than 4 teaspoons per day. Otherwise some stomach issues may occur (mostly gas).If you want to check out an actual study on the benefits of Yacon for weight loss, please check for the link in the comments section. Amazon still stupidly does not allow you to link to sites in the main portion of your review.Finally, I have to comment on the price. $21.97 per 8 ounce bottle is a bit steep. I checked my local vitamin store and an 11 ounce bottle cost $17.99. Having said that, I do believe it is the same brand that my wife purchased previously, and as I said - that stuff tasted like dirt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLXIT5KSUXPHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNU6MFI#wasThisHelpful","RLXIT5KSUXPHT","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off this review by saying that I LOVE, LOOOOVE TES games. I loved them ever since I first played Daggerfall (before all the patches that made it playable), and played Arena shortly after I finally finished Daggerfall. I have been following TES very closely from that time on. Heck, I even liked Redguard, and everyone I know tells me that game is terrible.So I was extremely excited and ordered the Imperial Edition from GMG as soon as I found a 20% off code (I had to buy two copies, so I did not want to shell out that much for an MMO with a monthly subscription fee).I have been playing this game for a while now (remember Imperial Edition gets a nice head start option), so I think I can finally give a decent and most importantly spoiler free review of this game.Early access actually started off pretty well. The character creation is great, and both my wife and I were able to create the avatars we wanted. We also quickly jumped into a friends guild - and that is where our first surprise came... EVERYONE in TESO can SEE your ACTUAL account name. In fact adding a ""friend"" to your list, gives you their actual account name.My account names are always weird and have nothing to do with my real name, but my wife usually uses a combination of her first, and last name. Meaning everyone and their grandmothers knew they were playing with a female. This lead to a lot of people (even those from our guild), that would start asking her where she lives, her age, and if she was hot, etc.In fact a lot of ""friends"" that we met in TESO had their names and year of birth as their account name, since they were not warned that this name will be so freely and publicly available. Heck, some people even had their state in there! I kid you not, one of the players I met had FirstNameLastNameStateDOB as his user name. What an epic fail in this day and age to not CLEARLY warn users about something like this.After we got out of the ""newbie"" areas, the game started to really lack polish. A LOT of quests were broken, requiring you to re-log and hope you get in the instance where the quest is working. The best part is that while you re-log, you can actually experience a character rollback. I completed a quest, only to re-log and find out that I never completed it. These random rollbacks had a very major impact on the game for us. We all lost money, experience, time, and most importantly LOOT and materials...Moreover, a friend that was playing with us re-logged only to be greeted by characters that were not his. He called it a night after that. The issue was fixed the next day. That's right... There was some database linking error and the poor guy literally (temporarily) lost access to HIS characters. Not a big deal, since it was only the second (or third) day of playing, but this is unacceptable.The game was taken offline for a good 10 hours (or more), and everything appeared to be fixed, however after playing for a few more hours we ran into broken quests once more, and more harassment for my wife due to her very obvious account name (that we petitioned to have changed with no response so far).While I first loved crafting in this game, it involves quite a large chunk of time AND inventory management, making it lose its charm rather quickly.Want to research and improve something? Well that will take 6, 12, 24 hours real time. You do not have to be on for this, but that is QUITE a time commitment. My biggest problem with this was when I started research on an item and logged into an alt. Came back a few hours later only to find that my crafter got rolled back and never started the research... So I started the research again and went to sleep, ONLY to log on the next day and find out that he was ONCE AGAIN rolled back to before he started the research. That was quite infuriating.Now lets move on to the inventory system... Which is downright terrible as it gives you only 60 bank slots total... That are shared across ALL your characters... 60 SHARED bank slots is a joke, since one crafter can easily fill those! Everyone in our guild is simply rolling alts as an alternative bank, and I personally have 4 characters with full inventories as my bank mules... I have people in our guild that have to use spreadsheets to keep track of who has what materials, and that is a pretty big design fail.Either give each character 60 bank slots, with 10 shared slots on top of that - or increase the shared number of slots to 120+.Speaking of crafting, most nodes in the game are guarded by NPC's, and since they are not instanced to your character - it means that other players WILL run up to the node while you are taking care of the mob and steal it, quickly running away as you finish the mob.This gets even worse in dungeons. The best loot I have seen so far is either crafted or comes from a dungeon chest (not the dungeon boss). This means that you (or your group) can be fighting said boss, and some idiot can go loot your chest... So you get NOTHING. To make things even better, if you kick said ninja looter they stay in the dungeon with you and are free to continue ninja looting... What is this? I don't even....The game is not all bad however. It does have some epic parts! You can become a vampire or werewolf, heck you can even get impregnated by a wasp and give birth to a waspling that will follow you around (and protect you), thinking you are its parent.My most ""OMG"" experience so far has been riding through a forest and having my horse make a nervous neigh, only to find that it was scared of a wolf that was fairly close by. That is pretty epic and really made the world feel alive.The quests and instancing also get an honorable mention. Although it is still a very theme park like game, I really enjoyed some of the voice acting and quests. The heavy instancing also makes it possible to feel like you made a real difference on the world.Moments like that aren't too common, but they add a lot of extra to the world, making it truly feel lived in.Finally lets move on the Pièce de résistance, and the reason why I am giving this game such a low score (I would actually give it one star had it not been for some awesome moments).As of right now, there are two HUGE issues in the game. Widespread duping (and it will get a lot worse when people find out how easy it is), and the client is being trusted with a LOT of things. I will not be saying exactly what, but a simple HEX EDITING program is ENOUGH to allow one to speed hack, teleport, have unlimited rolling AND dodging... Meaning PvP in this game is about to become utter garbage. The PvE is affected as well, but PvP is completely shot.Apparently ZeniMax did not learn from the folks at Cryptic after they had plenty of issues due to keeping so much clientside. Google ""mmogfails"" and read up on their disaster. Unless TESO acts fast, I can see the same thing happening here. Also check the comments section for more info. I can't post links in this review.I think I will give this game some time to mature, maybe a year or two, and play The Secret World and Guild Wars 2 in the meantime. Both are buy to play games, and do certain things better than TESO. The story in TSW is the best I have seen in any MMO to date, and GW2 does most other things better than TESO. As a bonus, neither game allow you to cheat and gain a huge advantage over legit players.Sorry Bethesda, it really pains to give you guys a two star review - but certain problems with the game (mostly due to poor design choices) really hinder its enjoyment for the Mitchell family. WHY... WHYYYY trust the client in this day and age?As a side note, I want to comment on how terrible ZeniMax support is (and not just because they haven't responded to my wife's account name change request after multiple days).My acquaintance (a 62+ year old retiree that I sometimes do computer work for) was BANNED from the game due to a ""TOS violation"". After multiple (failed) attempts at contacting support, he finally got a reply and was un-banned after an ""investigation"" took place...He is now literally done with the game. You lost a very big fan there, and it was all due to sloppy work. Not nice ZM/Bethesda... Not nice at all.I hope that you enjoyed my unbiased, spoiler free review of TESO. Now I would like to make a request of you, the Amazon gaming community. If you downvote my review, can you please post your reason for doing so in the comments section? I have posted nothing but our honest opinion and experience of/with the game, and would like to know why I will be getting downvoted (and I know those are coming)... Unless you work for ZeniMax damage control that is, or never bothered to read my review and are downvoting simply because of the way I scored the game. Than feel free to ignore my request.Anyway thanks for taking the time to read my rather large piece, and see you all around!4/11/2014 UPDATE: Please check the comment section. There have been some interesting developments after I published this review.4/18/2014 UPDATE: WOW, I didn't even notice that I started getting helpful votes. I really wonder how that happened. I was sure that this review would be forever buried and tagged as unhelpful.4/18/2014 UPDATE 2: Oh I see. The dupe finally got out and people started looking a bit deeper. Honestly I am surprised it took this long, since anyone messing around in the guild bank had a pretty high chance of figuring out how to do this. We discovered it by accident and made a forum post about it... Only to have it deleted. Shortly after that it was all over guild chat and people were duping Grand Soul Gems and more. I honestly thought the dupe would get out that same day, but apparently I was wrong.4/19/2014 UPDATE: Seems like ZeniMax introduced another bug into the game. This one will allow you to get unlimited mail (chests) from your hirelings. I simply don't know how to react to the way they are running things.4/19/2014 UPDATE 2: Earlier today I received an e-mail from a reader that asked to remain anonymous. This e-mail contains instructions on yet another dupe, and this one (like the original) will allow you to dupe everything. I just tested it out and can confirm it works. The author informed me that this exploit has existed since launch. I think I am going to call it quits with ESO. I don't want to reward incompetence with money, and most importantly my time. Consider this my final update to this review. I will be doing the only thing ZeniMax understands and speak with my wallet. Honestly, it seems to me as if ZeniMax is simply using the PC crowd as beta testers for their console release of the game. It is my firm belief that TESO will be buy or free to play within a year of its launch. My guess, sometime in early 2015, probably a bit before April.I would also like to make a request. For the last few days people have been sending me quite a lot of ESO bug reports and issues. I want you all to know that I have no impact on them getting fixed. Please don't e-mail me regarding this game.Edit: 5/18/2014 UPDATE: Although we no longer play The Elder Scrolls Online, I want to point out that ZeniMax DID in fact charge us both right out of the gate for an EXTRA month (on TOP of our ""free"" month of gametime). We were charged an extra $15 when we entered in our CD-Keys. This is unacceptable! After a few e-mails with ZM, the money was refunded back to my credit card, but that is yet another example of ZM's incompetence.Thank you for your time,- Sam","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U46C1NVZVAMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4BGLOG#wasThisHelpful","R1U46C1NVZVAMV","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A DVD... It all started with a DVD... This DVD... Did I mention this kit comes with a DVD?After my wife bought it for me at a garage sale, I took great joy in my new (used), red, one pound ball, and super sexy (although scratched) DVD disk.Upon smoothly inserting it into the DVD player using my (soon to be acquired) epic Tai Chi skills, I cracked my back and had to call it a day.When I came to, I not only knew Tai Chi, but also Kung Fu. Next thing I know, I am honing my skills in a temple and just as I am getting good, I find out that it will soon be turned into a strip mall unless we come up with one million dollars.It's about this time that I also meet some guy (pretty convenient, eh?) that tells me I can make some nice money with my mad Tai Fu skills and we get swept away into the world of unlawful street fighting.Long story short, I woke up and put this little kit in storage. Because it really doesn't teach you anything. I mean with the instructor facing you, all the moves have to be reversed. Not too hard, but annoying. The instructor looks like he knows his stuff, but goes way too fast toward the end, and I didn't see any full forms here. Just a bunch of stuff thrown together.Contrary to my dreams, I am no Tai Chi expert, but he could have at least thrown a few short forms into the DVD, because as it is - this is simply a bunch of exercises, and nothing else.Your best bet is to either take a few classes, or get a better DVD. Try YouTube and search for ""Peking form"". There are much better, free videos out there, that also go into a lot more detail.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEP79HQ0O9M8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BK7F48#wasThisHelpful","RAEP79HQ0O9M8","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I snagged this at my local Best Buy for $450 AND got to use another deal they had to get an additional controller for 15% off.My total came out to be a few bucks more than what Amazon wanted for just this bundle. To make things sweeter, I also got an additional 1 month free of Xbox Live Gold membership, since they were giving out these cards with a physical purchase of Titanfall. I spoke to a blue shirt and he told me I can take one if I get the bundle too. Thanks Best Buy!Best Buy also has a deal on ""accessories"", where you get them for 15% off if you buy a game, well this comes with a game and rings up the accessory for an extra 15% off.So I bought the Titanfall Bundle + the cool Limited Edition Titanfall Wireless Controller + an extra month of XBL for a few bucks more than Amazon wanted for the base bundle. Seems brick and mortar stores are finally able to compete with Amazon!It may be worth calling your local Best Buy to see what kind of a deal you can get, since Amazon still has not bothered to price match the Walmart or Best Buy deal.Now on to the bundle - It does not come with a physical copy of the game, nor does it come with the special limited edition Titanfall painted controller. No idea why, but it comes with the standard black controller, and a code to download the game onto your Xbone.While I am still downloading Titanfall, I can already say that the new Kinect is simply awesome. I love controlling everything by simply giving it voice commands.I will update this review later with more info on the game itself, but if YouTube videos are anything to go by, I will not be disappointed...UPDATE:Amazon now has a code - ""XIAMAZON"", that when entered brings down the price of this bundle by $50.Way to go Amazon! I hope my review is what got you guys to do this. Probably not, but I can hope, can't I?So now Amazon is once again the top dog. Having said that, I am still happy with my Best Buy purchase because I got the additional controller I wanted, and an extra XBL card on top of that.Edit: According to the manager at my Best Buy, to qualify for the extra XBL card, I had to buy the Limited Edition controller, and the Titanfall game. Not just the game. That is why the LE controller is also 15% off when bought with Titanfall (or the bundle), and the normal controller is not. So just FYI for those interested.As a side note, the LE controller looks and feels exactly like the original Xbone controller, but the TF paint job gives it an extra OOMPH (IMHO).UPDATE 2 (4/6/2014):TARGET now has this bundle + 12 months of Xbox Live all for $449.99. Even cheaper if you have the Red Card. Refer to the link I provide in the comments section for more info (Amazon won't allow me to link to Target in the main review).Just had multiple friends order this epic deal.Comes out to just over $460 foor most people after using Red Card (free shipping too).I am uploading a screen shot of their web page for a reference point as well. Hopefully Amazon will price match.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8UADXWD5IQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIHU44E#wasThisHelpful","R2O8UADXWD5IQR","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was going to write an actual review for this title, but I can't be bothered - it is obvious Magisoft didn't when they created this 2D running ""game"".There is really not much to say. You can jump to avoid hazards or attack to kill monsters. Both of these actions are done through tapping the left or right part of your screen.That's all there is to this uninspired, boring, and buggy app.The graphics are quite nice, but the sound and gameplay are pretty bland. In fact, this so called ""game"" seems to be mix of fantasy and crap - I call it fantacrap.In the two hours that I ""played"" this, if it can even be called that - the game crashed three times. No errors, no nothing - it just stopped responding. The controlls also leave much to be desired since there is noticeable input lag, and sometimes the touch is not registered at all.How this simple app (that looks like it was homework for a ""My first Android App"" class) is priced at $10, I don't even know. I think they meant $1.00, but misplaced the decimal point.This is one of the worst ""runner"" type games on the Adnroid, and I really have no idea why it requires the Full Network Access permission, nor why it uses bandwidth while played - being that there is literally nothing that requires this.To sum up, feel free to download it as the FAotD, but do not spend a single cent on it - the game is NOT worth it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6O1CUEBVWDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GNBQ2K#wasThisHelpful","RC6O1CUEBVWDK","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a free ""sample"" at GNC with a purchase of some protein.I work out quite a bit and have to simply laugh at this scam.This product will NOT do anything that it claims. At most it could possibly increase your libido, however it will NOT boost your testosterone (by much anyway). This can NOT be done through a ""mineral blend"". Don't fall for their lies and purchase it.Please be sure to check the comments section of this review for actual research that shows their active ingredient does not work.If you want to boost your testosterone, you need Testosterone Injections, which also have plenty of side effects.Want to boost your testosterone (by a bit) the natural way? Do this:1. Make sure you get enough Zinc.2. Get a lot of Vitamin D.3. Get rid of all processed sugar in your diet.4. Get more good fats.5. Consume more whey protein.6. Add Squats, Deadlifts, and Military Press's to your workout routine.7. Do NOT buy crap that has not been tested and has wild claims.Stay away from products such as this that are designed to prey on the gullible and uninformed.Side note: Want to build more muscle? Consider Whey and Creatine. Also add full body exercises to your routine. Take a closer look at point #6. It will show you what I mean.Update: Wow, look at that.

"Before I start this review, I will say that I purchased two of these instead of PS3 controllers. Both were defective and refused to update their firmware via the app (Nyko PlayPad Firmware Updater). The second app (Nyko Playground BETA) had issues detecting Amazon versions of their supported apps (or told me there was an issue pairing the controllers). The Google Play versions of said games worked, but a few supported titles purchased from Amazon did not!Now lets get into the review.I bought two of these to use with FPse and some games. I mostly wanted to replay my legally owned Final Fantasy games in all their PSX glory - boy was I in for a disappointment. On the first controller, one of the sticks kept getting stuck in random positions, causing my characters to keep running around. On the other, the side buttons (BOTH OF THEM) would get stuck and get me into an infinite menu loop.Really Nyko? What the heck are you doing with these controllers? Do you not care about your own reputation anymore?Moreover doing a Google search reveals this to be a COMMON problem!Let's move onto some more issues. FPse would not detect the dual sticks as separate entities until I updated the firmware, which was impossible as the app fails to do so (for both controllers, on the Nexus 4, 5 AND a Samsung Blaze).I tried playing some Sonic games, and while the ones I purchased from the Play Store worked, the one I got from Amazon DID NOT.All in all, these controllers are downright horrible. They have issues with buttons sticking after being pressed, and the Android apps that are meant to enhance them do not work!Maybe if I got a fully working one, I would write a different review - BUT out of the two I bought, BOTH HAD multiple issues. This is simply ridiculous in this day and age.Please take a look at my pictures for more info (either in the comments section or via Amazon's customer images).At the moment, I bought some PS3 controllers from Target (they were cheaper than these buggy jokes), and am using those instead - they work like a CHARM with my PSX (and all Android) games.So my advice is to stay away, FAR away from these so called ""Pro"" pads.Even at $19.99 the Nyko Playpad Pro is not worth it.If you root your phone, you can use the regular PS3 controller, which is of much better build quality, and is currently on clearance for $15 at my local Target.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O85I6YP96RBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092ZEINO#wasThisHelpful","R1O85I6YP96RBJ","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT: Updated and re-written on 4/1/2014 after some more compatibility and performance issues have been resolved.Ron Gilbert is a great designer and after hearing that he will be releasing a new adventure game, I went a little nuts. I mean after such great titles as Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, and the Monkey Island games (not even going to mention his non adventure games), I had VERY high expectations. I actually bought this game on Steam and for Android as soon as they became available.First of all let me get all this crash talk out of the way. They have obviously been making progress from when the game launched, but there are still issues.It runs flawlessly on my Nexus 5 and my wife's Nexus 4. I went through the game thrice on my Nexus 5 (with one crash), and my wife ran through it once on her Nexus 4 (with no issues). HOWEVER it does crash (is unplayable) on my friends Galaxy S3, and LG G2. No idea what the cause of this strange behavior is. After he rooted his S3, and installed a custom ROM (Cyanogenmod) - it worked fine. He does not want to root the G2, so I have no idea if it would work on that (while rooted).If the game is crashing for you, maybe try updating your version of Android (OS), or if you are at all tech savvy, root your phone and install a custom ROM (WARNING this will void your warranty and may brick/break your phone).Finally when you download the game from here, open it and let it run for a while - as it needs to download some more files and update. It may look like it's not responding, but it's actually downloading some data.With that out of the way, lets get on to the game.I will TRY to make this as spoiler free as possible, and I ask that you keep it spoiler free in the comments section as well.The Cave has a vast and varied cast of characters (7 to be exact), each having their own unique ability that will come in super handy when trying to solve puzzles. You form a party of three of these and head into *ominous voice* THEEE CAAAAAAVVEEE.While inside you solve various puzzles and interact with the denizens that thrive within. Using your character's unique abilities you get access to areas that others can't reach, so in order to get the full story you will need to beat the game 3 times. Don't worry, puzzles can be solved in different ways and every character has unique areas, which cuts down on the tedium.The game is also fairly short, clocking in at about 2-3 hours per playthrough, but much shorter your last time through. All in all I finished the whole thing in about 8 hours.Both the graphics and sound are excellent, with crisp visuals and some memorable tunes (and sound effects) throughout.Special mention goes to voice acting, with some very familiar voices that gamers will surely recognize.Another mention goes to the touch controls (that take a while getting used to, but are quite good after the initial hassle). This game proves that adventure games benefit greatly from the touch screen. Really, being able to play the game with such ease is pretty amazing. I thought I would miss the mouse, but I do not.See something? Simply touch it! That's all there is to the controls! Great job Double Fine!My only complaint (other than crashing on some systems) is that the areas you explore seem underpopulated, and the lack of tough puzzles (and puzzles in general) is a downer. I expected a bit more from Ron.My minor gripe is that once again there are unnecessary permissions (for a single player game) in the form of:Open network sockets, Access information about Wi-Fi networks, and Access information about networks. But that is most likely for the following reason: Allows verification of Google app Entitlements.Still, no IAP or extremely dangerous permissions (and classic gameplay) prevent me from giving it anything but an almost perfect score.Simply put this is (currently) one of the best adventure games on the Android platform, and well worth the $4.99 asking price.If it did not crash so much on different Android hardware, I would make it a 5 star game - that said, my friend managed to get a REFUND from Amazon after proving that it kept constantly crashing on his G2 and Galaxy S3, AND he got to keep the game to boot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKZ0TSPA9UKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8WCPE2#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKZ0TSPA9UKD","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is simply great, but is geared more for the outdoorsman than a regular person.Why you would want to use this over a regular charger I will never know, but unless you want to bring a giant battery/generator with you on your fishing/hiking/biking/camping trips, this will do the job - and do it well (although a bit slow).I have used it multiple times while on my combination fishing/camping trip, and it does not disappoint.I put the solar charger on the top of the tent in the morning, with the battery out of direct sunlight - and leave for 5-6 hours. When I come back with my drained phone or GPS, this will charge it up over the next few hours.The charge is slow, yes I said hours - but this entire package (battery and solar panel) is so light that adding it to your gear is incredibly simple. No heavy batteries for me thank you, and at its current sale price - it's a steal.I actually ordered another one today so that I can have two of them going at once for a longer charge.Now a bit of a warning. This package weirdly does not come with any sort of carry case, which is an annoyance. The solar panel also does not do well when not in direct sunlight. I took it biking once through a wooded area and after a 4 hour trek it was enough to charge my phone to a whopping 27% (from 9%). However when we reached our destination, I quickly placed it on a sunny table and the problem resolved itself.However for the current price ($22) this is the BEST SOLAR CHARGER available on Amazon, and I tried them all (well, OK - I tried some of them). I paid $87 for it the first time around, and even at that price this thing is great for those of us that like to enjoy the outdoors!Side note:You can really use the solar panel to charge any battery with the proper USB connection, or even use it to charge your item directly (although then you can run the risk of overheating).Also for those that want this kit just to charge their home devices while at home - stay away. It is not worth it (well maybe it is at its current price). Without direct sunlight, the solar panel is kind of a dud.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20SLDZBDU7LDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANZ22EY#wasThisHelpful","R20SLDZBDU7LDA","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Words can't even describe how disappointed I am in this ""game"". Having played the original Google Play version a while back, I was happy to see a ""Full"" version as Amazon's FAOTD (since the free version had a lot of forced IAP)... Too bad this IS the same exact version, but for some reason it actually costs money to download on Amazon.Why Anger B.C. TD Full is pure garbage:- The game is available for free on the Google Play Store.- FORCED IAP in a ""PAID"" game.- You are limited to one hero, if you want the other two they cost real money.- Certain towers can ONLY be bought for real money.- Consumables that are required to finish a level must also be bough for real money.- Extra levels cost money. Only the firs FIVE levels are included in the ""full"" game. The rest have to be bought for real money.- Overly difficult to force IAP. Anyone see a pattern here?But wait, that was just about the ridiculous amount of IAP. There's more:- Anger B.C. has terribad Engrish spelling and grammar. Quotes like ""Different kind of soldier and turret, they have different way to go up"" are fairly common.- The gameplay is very grindy and monotonous. This is true of a lot of tower defense games, but Anger B.C. doesn't even try to do anything to switch it up like most TD games.- HORRIBLE rate begging. Unless you agree to rate the game, a screen asking you to do so will pop up EVERY time you launch the game.- Stability issues on the Galaxy S III and the Blaze. Stock firmware caused crashes on both systems after prolonged gameplay.- Poor tutorial with no explanation of anything.- Annoying pan/zoom feature.- I could go on an on, but it's just easier for me to list the things I liked, which is actually nothing...How garbage like this made it into the Amazon Android marketplace is a mystery.This app is a complete waste of Amazons great Free App of the Day, and has absolutely nothing going for it. Don't even bother downloading this junker.Update: Anger B.C. TD Full is now priced at $0.00 and no longer at $.99 cents. Even free the app is simply too limited. There are a lot of better freemium TD games out there.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1381TAXCWDKK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091QSPT2#wasThisHelpful","R1381TAXCWDKK6","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really excited for this game, especially after watching a few of the videos that I will post in the comment section (Amazon doesn't allow linking to other sites in their reviews). I went so far as to pre-order the game on Steam and now wish I could get a refund.The ONLY good thing about this game is that the whole thing can be beaten in under 5 hours (less if not for the bugs). According to Steam, I played this game for 7 hours so far and have had 4 crashes, as well as encountering literally countless bugs, the best of which was doors NOT OPENING, or getting STUCK in the environment - forcing me to reload multiple times... Yeah. No idea how this made it past quality assurance... Way to go Gearbox, way to go.But honestly, the bugs aren't even the worst part. What makes this game so terribly boring is that it feels like an on rails light gun game, with terrible and uninteresting level design (there are some exceptions to this). Why an Aliens game has such limiting environments is beyond my understanding. Invisible walls and missing textures also serve to bring down the little immersion that some of the better designed areas bring to the table.The enemy AI is absolute garbage and allows you to easily blast one Xeno after another as they calmly walk in front of your shotgun (or get glitched in the environment and just stand there). Getting hit in ACM by an alien is virtually impossible.Eventually you also get to fight some humans, but nothing changes. You can still Rambo your way through everything using your trusty shotgun with what feels like unlimited ammunition and pinpoint precision.Next up is the AI of your squad mates, and wow... It is not uncommon to see someone glitched in the environment or running around in circles during a firefight. You simply can't make stuff like this up!All in all this game has the absolutely worst AI I have seen in recent releases, which is even more disappointing seeing as how Gearbox promised us ""incredibly advanced AI"".Gameplay doesn't fare any better. At one point you are forced into a stealth level and a few Work Loader sequences. That's it. And they are all as bad as the rest of the game. There is NOTHING new or even marginally exciting in Aliens: Colonial Marines. In fact, it makes the disaster that was Duke Nukem Forever seem like a masterpiece. I also don't understand what happened to ACM's graphics and animations. A few of the older demo videos of ""actual gameplay"" that Gearbox was showing off look much better than the retail game does on my (almost) top of the line gaming machine. Even on the highest settings this game looks like Doom 3, which looked good when it came out years ago - but has not aged too well in the graphic department. For some reason ACM also animates much worse than D3 - the animations seem stiff and forced.Even if I could forgive all of the above, the story is terrible (even more so considering that this is supposed to be the sequel to the films), complete with COUNTLESS plot holes, and ""WTH"" moments. Without giving anything away, dead characters are brought back to life with no explanation, and areas that have been nuked are now back in perfectly serviceable conditions (once again with no explanation).I suggest that you stay away unless you can get the game for around $10, since in its current state that is all ACM is honestly worth.I am currently working with Steam to try and get my money back due to all the false advertising Gearbox did before the game released (links in the comments section). Hopefully they will honor my request like they did with The War Z.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HUPV7MRE5LLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009K6YJTS#wasThisHelpful","R3HUPV7MRE5LLT","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise is simple. This is yet another get object X to point Y in the least amount of time possible game. This time it involves a tractor, a rock (gold) and a truck.Honestly it seems like somebody's rushed Java assignment than an actual game. Using your tractor (yes, the game spells tractor as traktor, go figure) you need to move a tiny stone into the back of a truck. There are usually objects in the way that also need to be moved. That's it. That's the WHOLE game!The tractor controls are overly sensitive and it moves as well as animates poorly. You can literally drive on air...After the first twelve missions I was utterly bored. Honestly it is just repeating the same thing over and over, with very little variation. To make matters worse, there is no actual digging involved - you just clear rubble away from your chunk of gold and move that gold rock to the truck. If that sounds interesting, by all means go ahead and try it out.The only good thing I can say about Traktor Digger is its lack of dangerous permissions. Other than that, it's a stinker and should be passed on. Too bad, since the concept is good, and if the developers actually tried - it could have been interesting. As it is, I don't recommend that you buy this game. Go ahead and download it as today's free app of the day, but prepare to be bored...","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JW8CPFNOBINK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009N8CWLA#wasThisHelpful","R3JW8CPFNOBINK","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I received this book from the author for reviewing purposes, however if you check my other reviews it should be clear that I am always brutally honest and often (overly) opinionated.With hat out of the way, lets move on.I really enjoyed Rhyme Time, especially the hand drawn art style that is used throughout this book. Something about the overly exaggerated facial features (especially the eyes and nose) made the characters stand out a bit more than they would have otherwise.I also thought the few jokes that were thrown in were above average and made me smirk on more than one occasion, however my amusement was cut short before it even really started due the book's length. There are only a few dozen drawings and sometimes they are reused.The story itself is fairly bland, but that can be forgiven since everything is written with rhyming in mind (more often than not). Without giving too much away, this book sets the stage for three shopkeepers taking on the mob. When I say sets the stage, this is literally all it does. It brings our three heroes together and leaves ALL conflict unresolved. I was expecting at least a few questions to be answered, but got nothing.If Rhyme Time cost only $.99, I would happily give it a four star rating and recommend a purchase - as it is the length really drags the whole package down. While I still think it's worth the current $1.99 asking price, I really wish it was quite a bit longer (or cheaper).I think Rory Scherer is on to something here, it just needs a bit more polish (and a few dozen more pages).","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MBPQUR5461OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008TCVW1M#wasThisHelpful","R1MBPQUR5461OI","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't understand why there is so much hate for this game. My almost five old daughter absolutely loves it on her little Atom powered netbook.The graphics (and sound) are cute, and the gameplay is easy enough to grasp. Honestly for adults there is probably nothing here, but children will be enthralled by this overly simplistic strategy title. There are things to build, items to gather, and monsters to fight. Anything that gets a thumbs up from my daughter, also gets a thumbs up from me.Now while I don't think it's worth the full $6.99 asking price, it's certainly a good enough deal for free (or even $.99 cents).I don't know how long the SQRLUVIO will work, so hopefully you manage to snag King's Legacy as a free download. Otherwise hold off until it gets to the $.99 price point.Side note: There are a few reviews that say you can't proceed past level three, that is false as my girl is already on the fourth level.

"Glad to see that Amazon actually screens our reviews and the last game ""Big Brain Quiz GOLD"" was replaced by something that is actually, well, good.Barnyard Mahjong HD is a pretty solid mahjong solitaire (tile matching) game with a lot of bells and whistles. While it's obviously designed for a much younger audience (the sounds and music are all kid friendly, but not annoying), I had quite a bit of fun with it.I still dislike that there are network permissions, but all things considered - the one permission that is involved here isn't too bad (unless combined with other permissions), and I have not encountered major internet traffic from it (just a few KB - that's normal). MUCH better than the previous FAOTD.The Good:- Good graphics for a mahjong game. Everything is bright and cheery. Very kid friendly.- Fun music and sound effects. Once again, everything is a bit over the top but that is to be expected from a family friendly game.- The puzzles actually change (tile wise) if you restart a level! This is very important as it contributes to the already high replay value of mahjong solitaire.- A save feature is implemented, so you can resume where you left off.- LOTS of levels. There are over 160 of them, and since the tiles change locations each playthrough - well, this will last you a while.- Is still mahjong solitaire, so it is easy to like if you enjoy these types of games.- You can zoom in and out. I honestly wish every mahjong game had this feature.The Bad:- Permissions. The Open network sockets permission is still something to think about as it allows this app free range internet access, and is simply not needed in a single player game.- Social Media integration. - Gah, enough said. I really don't like Facebook or Twitter in my games.- You can buy more games from the developer by following a link on the main screen.- A lot of questionable positive reviews from people with only one or two other reviews under their belt.The Ugly:- I found nothing truly ugly in this game.Scores:Game - 4/5Permissions - 3/5Combined - 4/5. I had fun with this game and so did my daughter.Conclusion:If you are into mahjong solitaire games, you should just instantly download Barnyard Mahjong HD as today's FAOTD.

"Big Brain Quiz GOLD is actually an above average quiz game, the point of which is to play through five rounds while picking one of three categories. There seem to be plenty of topics, and the UI is very appealing, however all of that is utterly destroyed by the incredibly malicious permissions, constant data access, and an incredibly high price.Kindle users should also be aware that this app does use Amazon's GameCircle.The Good:- Lots of questions and categories - this really is a must for trivia games, and Big Brain does not disappoint.- Nice, clean UI - You can even pick the style you want!- Good sound effects - although there is no music, the effects don't annoy or get in the way (as they do with a lot of quiz games). There is nothing overly wonky here to distract you from answering questions.The Bad:- The ability to purchase more games from the main menu (this is becoming a staple in Android apps).- Annoying fact tidbits that can't be disabled - every time you answer a question, you get a little tidbit of information  accompanying it, even if you answered correctly. All it does is add another button you have to press between every question.- Overpriced at $5.99.The Ugly:- NASTY Permissions (explained below):-- Read only access to phone state - This permission gives an application access to the IMEI, IMSI, and your phone number (as well as incoming and outgoing calls). So think of it as a massive tracking cookie that keeps tabs on everything you do, and that you had no choice in installing.Many software developers use this permission to track purchases and piracy. However the potential for disaster is huge here. A lot of companies will pay good money to get the information above, and once that falls into their hands...-- com.android.vending.BILLING - For easy billing, etc. Usually included for IAP.--- Open network sockets - This permission gives an application free range Internet access.-- Access information about networks - This permissions ""informs"" the device on what kind of networks you are running.-- Access the list of accounts in the Accounts Service. - Allows access to a list of ALL accounts in the Accounts Service.I have NO idea why all these permissions are required in a single player game, this is simply ridiculous, but that's not even the best part. It gets better you say? Why yes it does:- Constant stream of data while you play. The longer you play, the higher this goes. I wonder why... Check out the uploaded image and see for yourself.Scores:App is a 3/5.Permissions are a flat out 0/5.Combined score: 1/5.Conclusion:If not for the nasty permissions and constant stream of data that this app is guilty of, I would have given it a solid three stars. If you play on a rooted device with proper protection this really won't bother you much and you should download it as today's FAOTD.I do not suggest you purchase it for the full asking price, nor do I suggest that you use it on an unprotected device.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXKDPF98P7D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J4P5CW#wasThisHelpful","R2EXKDPF98P7D4","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wacky Sound Effects is a simple soundboard that for some reason requires a lot of nasty permissions. The UI is pretty sloppy, and so is the sound quality.

The effects seem to (mostly) be pulled from the internet. This alone renders this soundboard worthless.- Trying to charge for what is available for free elsewhere.

"My time with Dante: The Inferno was both pleasant and frustrating. This is the only game that I have played so far that made me both like and hate it.I liked the graphics and sound, but HATED the controls. I liked the fact that there are no permissions, but hated the CONSTANT rate begging. I really liked the level design, but hated the lame attempt at the story (and the fact that you can't just turn it off).With that little rant out of the way, lets move on to the review:The Good:- Pleasing, yet simple graphics. Just take a look at some of the screenshots, the game looks great.- Addicting top down puzzler game play, with some BRUTALLY difficult levels.- Good music/sound and effects.- NO PERMISSIONS (at the time of this review).- Great level design (although a bit repetitive in places).- Achievements.The Bad:- Constant rate begging. Every few levels a pop up will ask you to rate this app. There is no ""no"" option, just ""Yes"" or ""Later"".- Lame story with no way to turn it off. You can chose to skip the text on a PER LEVEL basis. Sure would be nice to have an option to disable this drivel.The Ugly:- Terrible, jerky controls that almost ruin the game. Yes, they really are that bad. It actually seems like the game is lagging and I found out that it is much easier to quickly tap them than count on the darn things working properly as you glide across them.Score:Game: 3/5 (if the controls are fixed and the rate begging removed, I will bump it up to a 5).Permissions: 5/5Combined: 3/5 (I am going to dock an extra star for the terribad controls, I even made up a new word to describe just how terribly bad they are).Conclusion:I liked Dante: The Inferno more often than not, and although there are a lot of infuriating issues here (most of which can be fixed by smoothing out the controls), I enjoyed his trip through hell.I highly recommend this game as today's FAOTD, however I honestly don't suggest that you spend any money on it until the controls are improved. There were countless times when I failed JUST because they did not respond properly.It is beyond infuriating, and the checkpoint system that is in place is no substitute for properly working controls.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGSKN02ZUV8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YX8BVE#wasThisHelpful","R2QGSKN02ZUV8X","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked Alphabet Car, in fact if it wasn't for the issues that I will mention below, I would have given this app a four star rating. As it is, I am honestly worried about letting my daughter play around with it.The object of this game is to drive down the road and pick up letters to spell the required words. There are multiple difficulty levels, each increasing the word length by one letter (starting with the Beginner and Preschool 3 letter word category).The tilt and touch controls are spot on and music/sound are all of appropriate cuteness. The graphics (although repetitive) are also fairly nice looking. Every three levels you clear, you get to unlock a new car and ARE TOLD to rate this game... EVERY THREE LEVELS. It just doesn't stop (images uploaded with review).Then there are the incredibly nasty permissions, including ""read only access to phone state"", which combined with the included network permission makes this app incredibly dangerous. I also don't know why this game causes so much IP traffic (image uploaded with review).The Good:- Bright, flashy, and kid friendly graphics. You can customize your bus with different color combinations and the environments look good (if not a bit repetitive).- Great sound effects, voice, and music. Everything sounds exactly like a learning game should. I also like how the words are pronounced.- Large word selection (but there are still plenty of repeats through the levels on the same difficulty).- Easy to learn controls. You can mess around with speed by moving the clutch up/down, and the tile controls are very responsive.The Bad:- Repetitive game play. Literally the only input you have (other than increasing/decreasing speed) is moving the android device from side to side while the same ""road"" backgrounds loop and repeat on your screen. A little more variety would have gone a LOOONG way here.- Multiple other links that allow web access built into the app.- Got stuck on the ""animoca"" loading blue screen and had to be restarted.- Rate begging. Every three levels you clear, Alphabet Car asks you to rate it on Amazon. This is incredibly annoying (image uploaded).- There are links to buy the sequel right there on the front page. Shameful to have it in a kid's game!The Ugly:- Read only access to phone state - This permission gives an application access to the IMEI, IMSI, and your phone number (as well as incoming and outgoing calls). So think of it as a massive tracking cookie that keeps tabs on everything you do, and that you had no choice in installing.Many software developers use this permissionsto track purchases and piracy.

What is done with the data that is obviously collected?Scores:Game is a 4/5.Permissions are a 1/5.Combined score: 2.5/5, since Amazon doesn't allow .5 star ratings, I am making a call here and rating the app 2/5. If you are not worried about your data, or play on a rooted device - feel free to use my ""Game"" score as a final score.Alphabet Car is worth it as a free download - as long as you have a rooted device with ad/tracking block software installed, or plan on using it in Airplane mode.

Out of all the companies I have dealt with, they are probably the worst - as their underhanded business practices (using poor re-branded GPU's, subpar parts, etc), and poor customer service combine to create a perfect storm of mediocrity.The sad thing is, I used to be a huge Lenovo supporter (thanks to their excellent ThinkPad line), but just got let down a few too many times with all their other products.Contrary to my warnings against doing so, a friend recently purchased this Y480 model. After playing with it for just a few hours, he was at my doorstep and asking for help. We ended up returning this product and I will go on to explain why in this review.My biggest issue with this heap is that the so called GT640M LE in this laptop is a re-branded (and under-clocked) GT 550M (image uploaded with review). Its actual performance is WORSE than that of a 550M in my wife's much older Acer (with a slightly weaker CPU to boot). Almost 4% worse according to 3D Mark.However the best part of this wonderful GPU is that it overheats and throws up tons of artifacts on newer games such as Guild Wars 2, Planetside 2, The Secret World, and even Tera Online! These artifacts persist for a few minutes before going away while the fan kicks into overdrive and your system sounds like a jet engine.Sound popping is once again back in this model, just like with previous IdeaPads. Every so often while gaming it makes a snap crackle and pop sound. Very distracting, and I am sad to see that this is still a problem (I had it happen with a previous IdeaPad purchased years ago).Contacting Lenovo support, we were told that the Y480 has no known sound static problems, and the GT640M LE is actually the 384 shader version. I offered to provide the tech with a screenshot stating the opposite and was told that screenshots could be faked... Yeah, amazing support. The tech suggested that we send in the laptop for repair and told us that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but if they found nothing wrong - we would be charged a service fee.Below is my standard Good, Bad and Ugly review.The Good:- The third gen I5 in this laptop is fairly powerful.- Keyboard has a nice feel to it.- Good wireless card.The Bad:- Sound device issues. The random static like pops are enough to drive you insane while gaming.- Terrible 1366 x 768 resolution. Not that the GPU can handle even that on lower settings (in modern games).- Slow 5400RPM Hard Drive, that for some reason is also very loud.- Less than 1 hour of gaming time, and about 3 hours of YouTube browsing.- Horrible touchpad that had issues properly detecting clicks.The Ugly:- Old GT 550M re-labeled and sold as a 640M LE. This is done by NVIDIA but Lenovo is one of the very few laptop manufacturers that use the (MUCH CHEAPER) 96 shader version. The real 640M LE is supposed to have 384 shaders (and I have mine running at 850 MHZ without a problem - in another laptop that is).- Comes loaded with a loads of trash. Anything that includes McAfee Internet Security should be destroyed.Conclusion:If you want to deal with terrible customer service and sub-par hardware, by all means purchase this overpriced hunk of junk. I would stay away, far away. For just a hundred dollars more you can get a nice Sony, Acer Timeline or Toshiba laptop or ultrabook.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6PU98HSUUNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082PRAVC#wasThisHelpful","RD6PU98HSUUNR","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't understand the point of DREAM-e: Exploratory Dream Analysis and Interpretation. It's some sort of incredibly lame dream journal that allows you to chat with the ""AI"", and by chat I mean answer boring questions that repeat themselves over and over. It doesn't save you time, and it's certainly not interesting reading long winded replies.Trying to interpret a simple dream of my dead army buddy sitting with me by a lake took forever, and didn't even give me a decent result. Googling it yielded a much more satisfying answer, and it was accomplished in MINUTES. I also didn't have to answer the same question OVER AND OVER AND OVER (or pick the color my dead friend reminds me of).As it stands, I like nothing about this app. If it at least saved you time, I would understand its purpose - but it doesn't.I also can't fathom why this text simulator requires the open network sockets permission. This single permission allows DREAM-e complete internet access.The Good:- You can skip through a lot of questions by leaving your answer blank. The AI will just keep going and spouting off its drivel.The Bad:- Fake reviews. This is quickly becoming an Amazon staple. Too bad they are incredibly easy to spot.- Overly repetitive and tedious. Answering the same question 10 times and then deciding what color it should be is utterly pointless. What does it have to do with interpreting dreams? What about those people that dream in black and white?- Priced at $1.99? What makes this app worth more than 2X the price of other apps? In this reviewers opinion - NOTHING.- Doesn't even keep track of your ""analyzed"" dreams if you exit halfway through the long process. This means that you will have to start over.- I could list countless other things that I don't like about this app, but considering that I find nothing here that I actually enjoyed, it would be easier (and better for my sanity) to stop now.The Ugly:- Open network sockets in a text simulator? What for?- Privacy policy that states all our data is stored locally? Well why the network permission?- At the end of the app you can request ""expert"" interpretation of your dream (that's right, you can actually send all your private, personal data over to the creators of DREAM-e for ""expert"" interpretation).Scores:APP: 1/5Permissions: 2/5 (this thing does not need internet access).Final score: 1/5.Conclusion: DREAM-e: Exploratory Dream Analysis and Interpretation is a terrible app and a complete waste of Amazon's FAOTD. I will go as far as saying that this is the worst app I have ever tried out, and certainly one of the most pointless. I see nothing that this thing does that Google can't do better and faster.I have already removed DREAM-e from my device and suggest that you stay away from it as today's freeby. Obviously you should also not buy it at the ridiculously high (for Android software) $1.99 price point.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBJ4L1USZHMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007D3BQY6#wasThisHelpful","R3GBJ4L1USZHMX","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Critter Escape is an excellent game, the object of which is to reach the level's exit while trying to complete your other objectives - such as rescuing critters, beating up guards, or not being seen (among others). There are plenty of power ups (ghost, speed, mutation, etc) to help you escape the 100+ included levels.What I like most about this app is how it encourages you to think outside the box, and in no time my daughter was trapping guards in environmental hazards that were designed to slow down the player. I really enjoyed doing this as well and it was nice to see my little girl being able to pick up and play this without any issues.Since Critter Escape doesn't feature any nasty permissions, I really don't understand why there is Privacy Policy so prominently displayed on Amazon's web page. I monitored this apps traffic on two devices for about 30 minutes and saw nothing (obviously, because the permissions aren't there), so I don't really see the need for that policy unless they plan on adding network permissions into the game at a later point.At the time of this review, there is no IAP, no nasty permissions, and no bloatware installed with the app.The Good:- Excellent graphics. Critter Escape really takes advantage of your devices hardware.- Good sound and effects. Nothing much to be said about this, the music is good and the effects are downright awesome.- Phenomenal animations. Almost everything is animated well, down to your critter looking down and sighing when you chose to redo a previously completed level. Little touches like this add a lot to the game. My only complaint is that I wish the game took your outfit into account when you are done with the level.- Lots of ways to customize your critter. You can get many outfits (15) to play around with. I prefer the Mr. Peanut look.- Good level and environment designs. Just when I was getting bored of something, it was switched out in favor of something different.The Bad:- Controls. You have two options, but really can only use one if you play on a smaller screen. I found them to be somewhat frustrating and didn't like restarting a level because my directions weren't followed. When you start dealing with environmental hazards, the controls are simply not precise enough for bigger fingers.- Pathfinding. Aaah, the other issue that caused me some minor grief. It is ridiculous to draw out an almost perfect path only to have your creature (and his escorts) die because they got stuck on a corner RIGHT by the level exit.The Ugly:- Nothing really, Critter Escape doesn't have anything that I could classify as ugly.The Score:Game: 4/5Permissions: 5/5Combined: 5/5. Since Amazon doesn't let us give .5 ratings, I am bumping it up to a perfect score because I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game.Conclusion:Kiz Studios should be commended for designing such a great game, and praised for not using any unnecessary permissions or bloatware. Good job guys, I am really looking forward to more apps from you.I can't recommend this game enough as today's FAOTD, and even at the $.99 price point. Critter Escape is fun, and addicting (if not a bit repetitive), and if it wasn't for the sometimes buggy controls and pathfinding, it would be one of the better games on the Android OS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT9JFMXLZSC12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I7CVWC#wasThisHelpful","RT9JFMXLZSC12","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kids Word World - My First Words: Animal (Ad-Free) is an incredibly shoddy product. It tries to (blatantly and unsuccessfully) rip off ""My First Words"" (down to the STYLE!), and fails in every aspect.Not only does this game feature words that are far too complicated for children, it also has words that are simply misspelled. If that wasn't frustrating enough, the controls are also terrible and spelling out some of the words becomes an incredible hassle.The Good:- Nice, pretty pictures.- Lack of dangerous permissions.The Bad:- EVERYTHING else. Literally, there are only two things I liked about this application.- Misspelled words. I mean seriously, who writes sentences such as: ""There is no gray letters in right order, but when you drop a letter in the right place, it will be stick here otherwise it will not.""Also, what the hell is a ""chimpance""? What a mess...- Terrible controls. Getting the letters to properly line up (especially on the bigger words) is a major pain. Hell, even grabbing them can be frustrating because it doesn't always register your touch!- Hung three times on two different devices in just minutes of play.- Skewed up difficulty. How is ""Flowerpecker Bird"" an easy word, that is grouped with other words like ""Ox"", and ""Fox"", and ""Dog"".- No undo button, and sometimes the incorrect letters ""stick"", forcing you to back out (of the game) or move on to the next word...- I could list dozens of other problems, but I really don't want to bother - it is OBVIOUS the developer didn't and just wanted to make a quick buck.The Ugly:- There is nothing too terrible in this game, most of it just falls in the ""Bad"" category.Score:Game: 1/5Permissions 5/5Combined score: I REFUSE to use lack of dangerous permissions to bring up the score of such a terrible app. I am making a judgement call here and giving it 1 star. Honestly, I am still being too generous.Conclusion: Unless you want your child to learn how to spell words... INCORRECTLY, you will stay away from this junker of a product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LEYHV8V7SYFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Y8OBII#wasThisHelpful","R2LEYHV8V7SYFV","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know I will be getting a lot of downvotes and hate for this, but I don't write reviews to be popular. I do it to help people; and having developed a few apps myself, I think I know a little bit about the Android OS.For those of us with a rooted device, spotting apps that try to suck up our bandwidth is easy, not so much for the rest of Android users.I suggest that people without a rooted device download a little tool called 3G Watchdog (I actually encourage you buy the Pro version). It is a fairly good network monitoring tool (as good as you can get without a rooted device). Establish a baseline and then open Pick a Piggy. Now let it run for a bit while playing. All that ""up"" and ""down"" data that you are seeing is the game communicating with a server, and combined with the ridiculous permission the game requires - well, play at your own risk.I gave this app to my daughter on a rooted tablet and have no issues with it. The game IS fun and since my firewall is blocking all traffic, nothing can be done with my data.With that out of the way, lets move on to the actual review.Pick a Piggy is a pretty good puzzler that has you fling Pong the Pig across a hundred levels while collecting stars. Eventually you encounter electric gates that must be disabled, blocks to break through, and other hazards designed to slow you down. To balance this out there a few power ups and abilities that help Pong along.The game's presentation is marvelous, with great hand drawn graphics, a fun soundtrack, and excellent effects. Even though the app is obviously targeting children, I found it quite fun. If it was not for the ridiculous permissions, rate begging, and a stream of data while I played this game, I would have rated it much higher.The Good:- Addicting gameplay. While the objective may be simple, there are a lot of things that make each level fun.- Awesome graphics. The hand drawn backgrounds and animation really make this game stand out above the competition.- Great music and effects. Peppy and upbeat all around.- A lot of levels. A LOT of them, you will be playing this game for a while.- Good physics. Not overly wonky and bouncy (like in some other games).- Almost perfect control. I had no issue at all making ""difficult"" shots. Sometimes it did release before I wanted to, but that happens in even the best games.- You are only ranked on the stars you collect, so you are free to take your time and experience Pong's many ""death"" animations.The Bad:- No multiplayer of any kind. The permissions make this seem like a multiplayer game, but it's not.- It asked me to rate it while I was playing. Oh well, at least it didn't ask me to buy more games from the developer.The Ugly:- Read only access to phone state - This permission gives an application access to the IMEI, IMSI, and your phone number (as well as incoming and outgoing calls). So think of it as a massive tracking cookie that keeps tabs on everything you do, and that you had no choice in installing.Many software developers use this permissionsto track purchases and piracy. However the potential for disaster is huge here. A lot of companies will pay good money to get the information above, and once that falls into their hands...- Open network sockets - This permission gives an application free range Internet access.I still can't understand why this and the above permissions are included in a SINGLE PLAYER game.- Access information about networks - This permissions ""informs"" the device on what kind of networks you are running.- There is internet traffic to and from the Android device while the game is played!- No Eula is provided. What is done with the data that is obviously collected?Scores:Game is a 4/5.Permissions are a 1/5.Combined score: 2.5/5, since Amazon doesn't allow .5 star ratings, and I did enjoy the game - I am making a call here and rating the game 3/5. If you are not worried about your data, or play on a rooted device - feel free to use my ""Game"" score as a final score.Pick a Piggy is worth it as a free download - as long as you have a rooted device with ad/tracking block software installed, or plan on using it in Airplane mode. I am personally removing this app from my phone and leaving it on my daughters rooted + firewalled tablet.I would personally not pay for this game until the ""device state"" permission is removed.Hopefully you guys manage to find my review under what no doubt will be a lot of negative votes and hateful remarks with ""professionals"" telling me that I know nothing about permissions and am just paranoid. I simply suggest you do your own research on the ""phone state"" permission.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JW4NG5QM04EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HMX0DI#wasThisHelpful","R2JW4NG5QM04EW","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually had fun playing Quiet, Please!, even though it is obviously targeting a much younger audience. At heart, it is a very basic adventure game that has you complete tasks all around the house to quite things down so that you can relax.The puzzles all (thankfully) make sense and there are plenty of things to explore and interact with... But after about 20-25 minutes (just when I really started getting into the game), it was all over, and I took my time. If I had to guess, an experienced adventure gamer could beat this thing in less than 15 minutes. My co-worker's five year old son finished this adventure in a little over half an hour.A lot of people will hate the ""8 bit"" graphics that this game is presented in (not HD 8 bit, the REAL old school stuff), but I loved it. Quiet, Please! actually reminded me of the old DOS games I played many years ago.The Good:- No permissions! YEEEEAH- Addicting adventure gameplay.- LOTS of things to interact with. If you can see it, you can probably do something to it.- Great 8 bit graphics. I love anything that uses old school stuff.- Excellent sound. While there is no music, the cute jibber-jabber speech fits this game almost perfectly.- Encourages children to think as the puzzles are actually logical (as far as adventure games go).The Bad:- Lots of fake positive reviews.- No save option (not really too bad since the game is so short, but could be problematic down the line).- A link to rating this game in the pause menu.- A link to the Author's web page with links to the Android Market and the Play Store.- This is the SHORTEST adventure game I have ever played. Knowing all the puzzles, I could rush through it in mere MINUTES.- No replay value.The Ugly:Absolutely nothing.Scores:The Game: 4/5 (if it was longer, I would rate it a 5/5)Permissions: 4/5 (if the link to the Play Store and Amazon are removed, it will be a 5/5).Combined: 4/5Conclusion:Quiet, Please! is a great little adventure game that will provide you with a few minutes of entertainment. It is certainly worth the free download as today's FAOTD, but I don't think it's worth it at the $.99 price point. This is the shortest game that I have played in years. Combined with the fact that there is no replay value and I just don't see it as a good purchase.My suggestion to Nostatic Software is to add a few more zones to the game. A school seems like an obvious choice, and so does the playground. If that were to happen, and the playtime would increase to at least an hour (hopefully more), I would gladly recommend that people buy this little gem (even at a slightly higher price point).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HG7GRUNXSMBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088QDDDY#wasThisHelpful","R3HG7GRUNXSMBU","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really basic ""ride to the end of the level while avoiding obstacles game"". You can also pull off some tricks (that don't matter) by tilting your Android device while speeding down the track... By speeding, I mean slowly crawling. The bike moves at a snail's pace and there is literally no rush of speed in this game, just random obstacles and bumpy tracks thrown at you.Honestly playing this game was a chore, and I didn't enjoy it at all. I tried it on four devices and spent about two hours trying to find something good about it... Sadly I failed.The Good:- There are a lot of levels (too bad they are all tedious, short, and poorly designed).- You can customize your bike (wheels and color).The Bad:- Network permissions in a single player game.Open network sockets - Allows this app free range internet access.Access information about networks - Does exactly what it sounds like.- Poor graphics and animations. I don't know why it's labeled as HD, it is clearly not. The cartoony graphics are very bad all around. Even the tricks you can perform aren't at all exciting.- Only thing you are graded on is time. If you try to bust some tricks, it will actually take away from your time (score).- Bad physics and collision engine. You can literally fall and then get up again to keep riding if done fast enough. Or you can get stuck and even backing up won't do you any good - meaning you will have to restart the level.- No sense of speed. Not only does your bike move slowly, but the course design is terrible and littered with obstacles just to slow you down even more.- Terrible sound and effects. This game is best played on mute. The rag-doll biker just won't shut up when falling.- Has a lot of other games from the developer that you can purchase through the aptly named ""More Games"" button.- Inaccurate controls. Tilting doesn't always work as well as it should... Going backwards can also sometimes be problematic.- Lots of fake reviews. I don't know anyone in their right mind that would give this game anything more than three stars.- Crashed twice in the two hours that I played. Once on my S III, and once on my Transformer.I could list about a dozen other things that I disliked about this game, but don't want to waste my time doing so.The Ugly:- No ""Option"" menu. They put in the ""More Games"" menu, but nothing for options. So you can't even turn off the lame sound or re-calibrate the controls. But hey, I guess selling junk games is more important than making good ones.Score:The Game: 1/5Permissions: 2/5 (Single player games DO NOT need network permissions).Combined: 1.5/5. Since Amazon does not let you give anything half a star, I am making a call here and lowering the score to 1/5 because the game is terrible in every way.Conclusion:Moto Mania HD - Dirt Bike Challenge is not even worth the free download as today's FAOTD, and certainly not worth the $.99 purchase price. I already deleted and forgot about this game from the two devices I tested it on. The racing/trick genre is incredibly over-saturated on the Android OS, and I have no idea how Pig Out Productions plans to compete with this lackluster entry.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22VAX6SHPOXQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N9CZ04#wasThisHelpful","R22VAX6SHPOXQ7","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Namco has countless times tried to re-invent Pac-Man and put it back into mainstream gaming, failing horribly.Hexage Ltd has succeeded where (many) others couldn't. Don't let the games clever description fool you, this is simply an HD remake of Pac-Man, with more features and a somewhat decent escape story.The object of EVAC HD is to eat all the dots (colors) you can, while navigating through the maze and avoiding ghosts (other blocks) that try to capture (eat) you. If this sounds like a game you played ages ago, that's because it is; but re-skinned and re-imagined for this generation.I absolutely love all the changes they made here. Adding little spaces for you to hide and avoid ghosts (I am not calling them ""reds"" like the game does) was pure genius, and the power ups add even more strategy to the classic dot gobbling.Side Note:There is a lot of false information floating around about EVAC HD's control scheme.It greatly upsets me when people just randomly spew off made up facts about the product they review based on somebody else's summary. Trust me on this, there is nothing wrong with the controls and you CAN indeed move the joystick to suit your orientation.The Good:- Tight controls. Contrary to some other reviewers, I love the way controls are handled here. I feel they are very good and had no issues whatsoever on two phones and two tablets (INCLUDING the Kindle Fire).- Classic Pac-Man gameplay brings back warm feelings of nostalgia.- Ingenious power ups allow you to do everything from stunning to destroying your captors.- Minor puzzle elements (moving blocks to open doors, blocking off ghosts, etc) add a bit of strategy to the action.- Awesome graphics. I am a sucker for this type of HD-Retro look.- Excellent soundtrack and effects. My only complaint is that no classic Pac-Man tunes made it into the game, but I am guessing the developers simply didn't want to get sued.The Bad:- Social media integration. Really, can we stop it with this crap please? I don't want my device posting that I beat a level and advertise for any game.- Links from within the game allow you to access the Google Play and Amazon store (and purchase things from there).- NETWORK permissions in a SINGLE PLAYER GAME.Open network sockets gives this app free range internet access.Access information about networks allows it to do just that (for both your phone and wireless networks).These things are just not needed in a single player game and are here just for the social media and link aspects of the app.While there is no traffic going to and from the game while it is just being played, hitting some of the other links makes the network monitor light up like a Christmas tree (obviously).- The game is incredibly short. Adding another campaign would go a long way to justifying the higher price point.- Higher price point. The game retails at $1.99 but is NOT YET worth that price in its current state.The Ugly:Thankfully I found nothing too terrible in EVAC HD.Scores:The Game: 5/5Permissions: 2/5 (single player games DO NOT NEED network permissions).Score: 3.5/5, bumping it up to 4/5 because Amazon does not allow .5 ratings, and because I thoroughly enjoyed this game.Conclusion:I am a sucker for HD remakes of classic games, even more so if they are actually good (as is the case here). While I simply can't recommend the game at its $1.99 pricing point, I suggest you grab it as today's free download.If you enjoy classic games, give EVAC HD a try, and if they ever add another campaign (more levels), or drop the price to $.99, or remove the unnecessary network permissions - I would even recommend purchasing it.Good job to the developers for actually improving on a classic. You guys (and gals) did great work here, but some of the things I mentioned are preventing me from giving it a perfect rating.

"Before I start with my actual review, I would just like to thank NOMAD Apps for creating such an amazing game that is not only fun, but doesn't use any unnecessary permissions or third party spy/bloatware.AWEsum! is a really awesome (I had to do it, please forgive me) game, the object of which is to (vertically) line up numbered cubes and make them add up to create the game's current AWEsum!. These blocks fall two at a time and can either be rotated (by tapping the screen), or moved (by dragging them across the screen). They can also be forced into place faster by dragging them down (this also nets you a higher score).Speaking of scoring, you are awarded bonus points for using blocks of a similar color to create the AWEsum!, and there are multiple power ups included to spice up the gameplay. Getting two AWEsum!'s in a row (from the same pair of falling blocks) earns you a ""Swap"", which can be used to change the numbers on falling blocks, giving you more chances to score.The best part of this app is that there are no permissions, IAP, or bloatware included.The Good:- Simple yet effective graphics and a great UI. Everything you need is right there on the screen, with nothing to distract you from gaming.- Good sound effects, including the announcer.- Creative power ups.Number Bomb that will destroy all the cubes that match the number it falls on (usually resulting in multiple AWEsum!'s if done right).Double Arrow that will destroy all cubes in a row (either vertically or horizontally).Colored Star that will destroy all cubes of a color it lands on.- An EXTENSIVE help option. Everything you could ever want to know about the game is here.- Great option menu that will allow you to adjust your starting block height (turning the game into an instant math puzzle) and level (to increase the speed at which the blocks fall), as well as a myriad of other choices that can impact the game (even the controls).- Well programmed and runs on a wide variety of hardware without a problem or issue.- NO IAP, PERMISSIONS, or SPY/BLOATWARE.- No useless social media integration.The Bad:- Peppy music does get annoying after a while, thankfully it can be disabled in the option menu.- The AWEsum! is only calculated vertically, not across (side by side). I would really like this implemented in the future so that we can line up massive board clearing combos.- Questionable reviews - There are still five star ratings by users with one or two reviews under their belt. Sadly this is now becoming a staple on Amazon.

"The object of Tiki Lavalanche (Ad-Free) is to remove most non golden objects from the board while having the golden ones (cubes, balls, triangles, etc) touch solid ground (or each other) and not fall into the boiling lava.The premise is really simple, but there are plenty of things to get in the way (such as bouncing blocks, glass, bombs, etc), and each level has multiple solutions. You are not penalized on time or the amount of moves it takes you to complete each board - you are instead free to actually think things through.Now while the game does have IAP, I am on  Pack 5 (out of 9) so far, and have not used that ""feature"". The progression system allows you to easily unlock new packs by scoring well on previous levels. If you score poorly (one or two stars), you may need to use the unlock.The Good:- Perfect difficulty level. By not punishing you for moves made or time taken, Tiki Lavalanche lets you play the game at your own pace.- Good progressions system. Unlocking more packs is achieved through scoring well previous levels.- The graphics, while nothing special, really add to the game.- Good sound effects. There are quite a few blocks in the game and each has sounds associated with it.- Great physics engine that actually works well.- 135 levels to get through!The Bad:- IAP - self explanatory. I don't like any of my games to have in app purchases as an option.- Open network sockets permissions allows this app free reign internet acceess.- The Access information about networks permission does exactly what it sounds.Why the above two permisions are needed in a single player game, I don't know. (Well, for IAP and More Games button in the case of Tiki Lavalanche).- Boring, repetitive music (thankfully can be disabled).- Fake five star reviews.The Ugly:- Absolutely nothing. This is where I would make a comment about IAP or some glaring error, or maybe even a nasty permissions, but Tiki Lavalanche has nothing terribly ugly present.Score:The Game: 4/5Permissions: 2/5 (single player games do not NEED any permissions).Total: 3/5Conclusion:Tiki Lavalanche (Ad-Free) really is a good FAOTD, and is even priced well at $.99. I highly recommend it as today's free download, or as a future purchase.As always, having a rooted (and fire-walled) device is a plus when dealing with network permissions, because it is extremely easy to purchase/unlock things from within the game. This is an even bigger issue if your device can access things other than wireless (Edge/3G/etc).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FFOOI2ID0QZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BJRNXY#wasThisHelpful","R3FFOOI2ID0QZM","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A bit of a warning to those thinking I am giving Tera one star - that is NOT the case. I gave the game three out of five stars (check out my review below).It is simply the score that the terribly lacking DIGITAL Collector's Edition is receiving. In fact, if I could give it zero stars, I would.All this PC Download CE version does (other than cost a lot more) is give you the following in-game items: a level 20 Regal Frostlion Mount, a level 15 Velik's Bloodstone Necklace, and a level 40 Shakan's Bloodstone Necklace.You don't get any digital artwork, maps, storybooks, or in game convenience benefits (such as a store bought level one mount). This so called Collector's Edition doesn't even give you any sort of cosmetic gear/pets or exclusive voices/appearances!What makes this incredibly lacking package a Collector's Edition? En Masse Entertainment, I am asking you directly - why did you label this as such?Coming from other digital CE's this version is quite disappointing.The only difference between this digital CE and the regular version of Tera is the higher price tag and three useless items... If you feel that's worth it, by all means go ahead and purchase it (thus encouraging the developer to continue with these kinds of practices).---------------------- My review of Tera (the base game) is below ----------------------Tera is an action MMORPG, where auto attacking and tab targeting have been removed in favor of a much more fluid (and interesting) combat system. The game plays very much like your standard action game, and defeating enemies requires dodging, blocking, and being mobile. While you must still use a hotbar to trigger abilities, all of them have to be AIMED by you, and can be dodged just as easily by another skilled player (not by monsters, who have terrible, terrible AI). This results in some of the best PvP action I have ever encountered.All is not well however, as the game has quite a few broken quests at this very moment. They recently merged all their servers into just three (the PvP only Mount Tyrannas, the PvE only Tempest Reach, and the Roleplaying server Celestial Hills). This merge created a myriad of problems and broken quests for the team at Enmasse Studios. I tried playing a freshly made toon just for the purpose of this review and found that I could not progress through the prologue because of a quest glitch. Moreover, skipping the prologue and going to the newby area, I was again halted by a quest MOB not spawning - and this once more prevented progression. There were about 20 people trying to finish this story quest (you NEED to complete them), and swearing about the game being a bug filled mess.Logging on with my higher level characters, I was told there were quite a few more bugs in game after the merge (I asked in guild chat), and a lot of them impede progression.The Good:- Tera is incredibly gorgeous on the highest settings, of course you need a beefy computer to run it. My TimelineU M5-481TG-6814 can't handle it on medium or above, while running games like Skyrim on the high settings.- The combat is amazing. I love that auto attack and targeting has been removed. This is by far the best combat in any MMORPG that I have played, and I played a lot of them. The thrill you get from dynamically dodging or blocking (and countering) your opponent's attack adds a lot to the overall feel of things.- Environments and creature design are outstanding. Whoever created the world of Tera should be praised for a job well done. Everything from lush, rolling landscapes, to the mobs and races that inhabit it are all top notch. My only complaint about the races, is that all the females look like slutty supermodels (or borderline illegal for the Elin race).- There are lots of ways to customize your characters (however there are also some limitations - such as not being able to make a purely bald character).- Interesting progression system where you glyph your skills to modify them (there are usually quite a few choices to pick from), and lots of ways to improve your gear (crystals, enchantments, etc).- Fighting BAM's (big ass monsters) is incredibly fun (and they live up to their name). Killing a BAM is like hunting similar creatures in the excellent Monster Hunter games, but a bit more challenging. For all you MH fans out there, do yourself a favor and roll a Berserker - that way you should be able to solo most BAM's. That is my main, and the only character that I can solo most BAM's with (adding to the MH feel).- Server merges make for incredibly populated servers. There are countless players running and fighting all around you.- The world PvP is pretty good, and actually exists in Tera, as does GvG (Guild VS Guild) and Battlegrounds.- You can play for free, just like in Eve by purchasing a Chronoscrolls for in game money. You can also buy one from Amazon and sell it for in game funds. I haven't payed for Tera ever since this system was introduced a while back.The Bad:- There are generally only three quest types in Tera (of the fetch, escort, and slay variety). All MMORPG vets are familiar with these ""staples"" of the genre. Eventually PQ's do make an appearance, but by that time it is already too late.With the evolution that The Secret World has brought to the genre, playing Tera (or any other MMORPG for that matter just feels stale).- Plenty of broken quests after the server merge.- Grinding, grinding, and did I mention grinding? The best way to level up is still to repeat grind quests in key areas while queuing for dungeons. There is a huge drop off in the leveling speed at 40, and then again at 50. Getting up to 40 however is pretty simple.- The game does not deserve its M rating. It simply doesn't push the boundaries like Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures or make you think like The Secret World. Other than the nude patches that are floating around the net, there is nothing too inappropriate in Tera. When a game is rated M, I expect it to handle that rating with more than just skimpy dresses.- Tera's story is absolute generic garbage. Everything from the poorly voiced cutscenes to the terrible text. I tried to read the whole thing my first time through, but eventually succumbed to the ultra fast ""accept quest and move on"" mode. Star Wars: The Old Republic and The Secret World really handle this a LOT better. This is disappointing since I actually loved the Tera books.The Ugly:- Tera is dying. Unless they switch to F2P post haste, I am afraid that even the three current servers will not fill up. My guild, which consisted of hundreds of members months ago, is now down to 17-20 active ones. The merges helped quite a bit, but I don't know for how long.- The AI of some MOBs in this game is unbelievably laughable and makes the monsters in WoW seem like brain surgeons. You can exploit terrain and class skills to no end when it comes to certain encounters.Conclusion:Honestly it would be a mistake to not try this game out. It comes with 30 days of playtime, and if you do everything right it should be the only money you will need to spend (just purchase Chronoscrolls for in game cash).I liked Tera at first, I really did but as time progresses and I experienced other games, I couldn't help but give the game a three star rating. If you have never played an AMMORPG before, feel free to add an extra star to my review, but with the competition being what it is - I can't recommend this game too much. In fact, if it wasn't for my addiction hunting BAM's and world bosses, I would have probably completely moved on by now.---------------------- My review of Tera (the base game) is above ----------------------","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXAABDXXXRG4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RZT7NC#wasThisHelpful","RXAABDXXXRG4E","A334SLFQ5WGVAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334SLFQ5WGVAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Huge difference between pay me now or pay me later. I've had a number of Epson ""consumer"" inkjets in both narrow and wide carriage formats. They had the multiple tanks, all very small and about $15 a tank. My photography work finally expanded to where I took the leap to the Professional grade Epson 3880 printer. At $1700, the up front investment was huge, but I can see where I am going to make it all up on ink costs. The ink tanks in the 3880 are huge.What I found with the other printers was that I'd pay a couple of hundred dollars for the printer, then pay through the nose in the rapid depletion of ink. Besides the wider carriage capability of the 3880, the inks last forever, or it seems. I kept track of what I've printed since getting it. I've printed 150 posters at 13x19, 75 large format prints at 17x22, almost 450 at 8x10, and during all that was experimenting with printing on metal, wood, and canvas. I bought this tank because I was finally down to about 25% on it and wanted a replacement ready to go. The rest of the tanks are no lower than 35%.Yeah, the tanks are $50 each, but when you consider how much longer they last than the ones in the consumer world, it really saves money in the long run.

"For most people they will either love this movie or hate it, depending on three things.  The first is the cinematography.  The movie creates grand vista of background and highly detailed and ornate scenes for the action to take place, like at the palace.  If you love movies where every scene could be a painting of its own, you'll love this movie.  The second is how well you know the legend and if you have seen previous versions of the story.  If you are a big fan of feudal Japan and the Samurai, you will not be disappointed.  There are many details, some as simple as how the Samurai sign their names to the pledge, which flesh out what the Samurai Code entailed.  This is not your typical Samurai movie with lengthy and massive sword fighting scenes.  The action is there, but kept to a reasonable and maybe minimal amount to make the point.  The third is whether or not you understand this is a redemption movie.  A lot of people I met who hated the movie went to it thinking it was a battle filled tale of revenge, and they clearly did not understand the ending.  If you see how the characters are paying in this life for their sins as away of redeeming their honor in the next life, you will love this movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKN7G3H7VVV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEPDGKA#wasThisHelpful","R3PKN7G3H7VVV9","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a general rule I have stopped reviewing DVD's because I apparently do not know what it is that everyone wants to know and I get lots of ""not helpful"" comments.  However, I make an exception in this case.  I have started to make it a habit of finding the director's cut or unrated versions of movies.  I had only seen Chronicles of Riddick on cable and did not realize what I was missing.  This widescreen version has maybe 9 or 10 extra minutes of material which makes a BIG difference in the story line and fills some gaps in the story.  There are flash-backs to prophecy which explains more of Riddick's past.  There is an entire section where at the hangar where Riddick has some sort of power surge and wipes out almost all of Necromongers.  This explains how he got left behind instead of killed and it also explains Lord Vaco's respect for Riddick.

"One thing to correct that I saw in several reviews...this does not have lithium ion batteries.  This uses nickel metal hydride batteries.  They eliminate the ""memory"" problems of nickel cadmium batteries, but do not have the same power curve of lithium ion where they are at full power until when they die.  Nickel metal hydride batteries last a long time and fully charge, however they do have a more tapered power loss at the end of their charge than lithium ion.  BTW -  The one that came to me is the ""US and Puerto Rico"" version which means it did not come equipped for 240 volts as the product page states.The clippers have a very nice and clear method of setting the height of the cutting comb.  There are two combs, and the adjusting barrel on the handle clearly marks out which settings go with which comb.  Unlike a previous Panasonic cutter I had, this one allows you to adjust the height without turning the unit off.  Panasonic beard cutters have been the ONLY ones I have owned which do not tug or pull when cutting.  They cut quickly and cleanly.  My only issue with most all beard trimmers is the spot under my nostrils, where the comb cannot go and you have to use the bare blades and be very careful.

"UPDATE:  I had the chance to use the detachable day pack for a few days on vacation.  It was very hot, and the pack came in very handy to carry two bottles of chilled water (wrapped in a towel, and a couple bananas  We spent a day in Sante Fe, New Mexico and a couple of days in Albuquerque at 90+ degrees.  The day pack was very comfortable to wear and quickly got to the point where I only seemed to know it was there when I sat down and hit the back of the chair.Original Review: I think you need to be specific about your need on this backpack because it has a lot of features and is very flexible, but there are some things it is not.  First off, it is really two backpacks zippered together.  There is a small ""day pack"" which has a storage zipper-pocket for the straps.  That one will not hold much, maybe a few bottles of water, a change of lightweight clothes, and that's probably it.  The bigger one has a shallow outer compartment, net pouches to hold water bottles, and a largish interior space.  There is another zipper-pocket which keeps the bigger pack's straps under cover.What this pack is not, is luggage.  I don't think the fabric will hold up to any checked baggage situation and I would not see it handling a lot of jetway check bag treatment. It is not an un-wheeled duffel.  There are too many pockets and sections to use it for bulky items.  The pockets which are used to keep the straps stored make it a bit unwieldy.  There's a plastic or stiff board-like divider in it as well, which at first thought made me think it has a metal frame, which it does not.  It does have an aluminum ""spine"" piece to give it some support.One really annoying thing is the zipper for the day pack will spontaneously un-zip if put under pressure.  It is one continuous zipper, so it won't completely zip off, but it will un-zip completely on one side simply by pushing it.Okay, so why did I give it 4 stars?  I have see a lot worse for more money than this.  I got it on a free trial, but had I paid the listed amount, I would have been okay with it.  It is a decent school backpack with good padding for your back under the straps.  The area for a laptop computer is well padded on the inside, but a bit light on the outside.  It will still give adequate protection in all but the worst cases.  It's a decent bag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3174OMMKR1NDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOYLCCY#wasThisHelpful","R3174OMMKR1NDM","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lots of reviews noting they got a cheaper, generic product.  This came in the Vornado packaging and the quality of the filters is the same if not better than what originally came with the unit.  Can't say enough about my Vornado humidifier.  I have personally come to believe replacing these annually is the best idea.  I use bleach a couple of times per winter season to stop mold and other microbe build up and I think the bleach greaks down the material over time.

"Huge difference between pay me now or pay me later. I've had a number of Epson ""consumer"" inkjets in both narrow and wide carriage formats. They had the multiple tanks, all very small and about $15 a tank. My photography work finally expanded to where I took the leap to the Professional grade Epson 3880 printer. At $1700, the up front investment was huge, but I can see where I am going to make it all up on ink costs. The ink tanks in the 3880 are huge.What I found with the other printers was that I'd pay a couple of hundred dollars for the printer, then pay through the nose in the rapid depletion of ink. Besides the wider carriage capability of the 3880, the inks last forever, or it seems. I kept track of what I've printed since getting it. I've printed 150 posters at 13x19, 75 large format prints at 17x22, almost 450 at 8x10, and during all that was experimenting with printing on metal, wood, and canvas. I bought this tank because I was finally down to about 25% on it and wanted a replacement ready to go. The rest of the tanks are no lower than 35%.Yeah, the tanks are $50 each, but when you consider how much longer they last than the ones in the consumer world, it really saves money in the long run. Amazon continues to be the best and most cost effective source for my Epson inks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H794D8KPWMCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J3HCXG#wasThisHelpful","R1H794D8KPWMCC","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We recently were able to get a Silk'n Revit Microderm machine.  As my wife put it for these Proactiv+ pads, ""They're better than having nothing or if you are in a pinch.""  She did a test by using these to exfoliate and then went back with the Microderm to see what was left.  By her guess, the pads remove about 50% of what she usually gets with the Microderm.  These cost about $45 and the Microderm costs about $100, plus a modest amount for replacement filters.  In the long run, my wife feels the Microderm is the best option.Now, having said that, if you are travelling and do not want to haul the machine around, these wipes would be an excellent temporary measure until you return from the trip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X48M9Y4OBG4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTCUPZE#wasThisHelpful","R2X48M9Y4OBG4E","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been buying the ""normal"" Quilted Northern from the local ""Discount Club"" store.  As a Vine reviewer we welcomed the chance to test the new Ultra-Plush and we were not disappointed by the quality.  Face it, in TP you want absorbancy, resistance to tearing, and a soft touch to the tush.  This stuff is excellent in all three.  As for the Mega-Roll stuff, that one is purely subjective, however it does seem that the Ultra-Plush thickness causes you to use fewer sheets and thus the roll will last longer.  The price is on par with the big box stores, especially if you can get free shipping on it.  Frankly, if I can avoid fighting the crowds at the store and just have someone drop it off at my house...I'm there.  If you don't live near a big discount store, then this will really be a deal for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRNQ7EGB4DXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T44521U#wasThisHelpful","R3HRNQ7EGB4DXZ","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've done window films on home windows and car windows.  There is no doubt the UV reduction helps preserve drapes and carpets.  The glare reduction is not all that important, however the heat reduction is possibly the best feature, especially on a car window.  This is my first time using a 3M product and I was hoping they had resolved some of the annoying issues of other brands' products.  Unfortunately they have not.After doing a few of these applications, you get used to the far too thin film, working through clearing bubbles out of the film, and maddening task of separating the two layers.  It takes patience for an experienced person to apply and it can be really aggravating for a first-timer.  Can't emphasize the patience part of the process.I have never understood why the film has to be so thin and fragile.  One or maybe two mil thicker and this would be so easy to apply.  Flat, house windows should have a thicker film.  The thinner stuff would be needed for curved car windows and such.The end result is great.  There is a noticeable difference in heat build up and blocking almost all of the UV will help protect the drapes quite a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FWKNZ77IEOH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M4X7I#wasThisHelpful","R2FWKNZ77IEOH0","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works great.  The telescope came with a 32 mm eyepiece, so this is a little over twice the magnification.  It is too much for a full view of the moon, however it does help take close-up photos of craters and seas on the moon.  I bought it largely for looking at Jupiter and Saturn.

She started using t he Obagi products many years ago and I will not complain about the results, as she easily looks 15 years younger than her age.  We had to start mail-ordering the products because Texas put strict standards on products with hydroquinone, thus cutting the number of available suppliers and hiking the amount you pay.  My guess is that Obagi is starting to reformulate some products to avoid the restrictions in Texas and perhaps other states.  She will not be re-ordering this product unless she can get ""the real stuff"".  I can't get much in the way of specifics as to why it performs differently.

"This is a chopping, blending, pureeing beast of a blender.  I have recently had the opportunity to test several high-dollar blenders.  As for shear power, speed, and capacity this one is the best.  The carafe is 64 ounces which is between 4 and 8 ounces larger than most.  May not seem like a lot, but when combined with the shorter and wider design of the carafe it seems like a huge difference.  At 2.4 horsepower it has the most torque and probably more important it has reserve power so the motor should last a long time.  Drive is a splined shaft and socket, both large and made of metal.  It has some preset speeds and an infinitely variable speed adjustment.  It is not very stylish and looks more commercial in design.  One of the design features is stated as low-profile to fit under most cabinets on the countertop.  I have an older kitchen and the cabinets are lower than most.  None of the high-powered blenders fit under mine.  This Jamba is lower than most, but not as low as the small carafe Oster or the magnetically driven Kitchenaid units.  The rest of the materials are substantial and made of polycarbonate.  It seems like it will last forever.

"Works as advertised except for one small issue.  It states it eliminates the need for deep sockets, which is only partly true.  The pass-through ability of the ratchet and sockets only works on something that allow room on the side of the bolt to allow for the ratchet handle to swing.  Deep sockets are needed when a bolt can only be accessed from directly above (think spark plug) and the bolt extends far past where the nut seats.Aside from that one technicality, the set seems to do what it should.  The time-saving feature of being able to handle all types of bolt heads does not come up very often and almost never when in the middle of a job.  Items with splined nuts are hardly ever mixed in on a machine with hex or square nuts.  Usually one type of design is consistent throughout a product.The material (can't totally tell what type of alloy it is) seems lightweight, but I've really torqued down on some bolts to test it and there is no give or flex.  They seem to be extremely sturdy in their construction.  The storage ""case"" will not last long and should not be a consideration when you buy it.  It is going to break.

She works in the hospital and needs a sweep second hand for taking pulses and she had concerns about the constant hand-washing and contamination.  I saw this watch model and bought it for her birthday.  This works well in many ways and now she is sold on it.  The leatherette band is easily and cheaply replaceable, and it does not have all of the nooks and crannies of a typical bracelet type band.

"After just one use, my wife loves it.  After two uses, she claims she can't live without it.  She is very fussy about what she uses on her face and has skin that looks 10 years younger than she is.  This unit did an excellent job of exfoliating and smoothing out those small wrinkles.  Key to great results is to use light to medium pressure and keep the unit moving continuously.  Stay in one place for any length of time and you run the risk of redness or tenderness.  Except in only an extreme case of misuse can I see this leaving any permanent marks or damage.Update - My wife has used it five times now and claims that small wrinkles around her lips have disappeared and those around her eyes have shrunk.

"This is the weirdest and coolest blender ever.  There are no gears used to drive the blender blades.  It uses super-powerful magnets to do it.  It seems to have all the power of the geared models and it is quieter.  Because there is no motor base, the unit is lower than most and would fit under most cabinets while out on the countertop.  Clean up is easy and the unit is super-sturdy.  It can be loaded by pulling out the blender, however it does have a pass-through opening in the top of the unit which allows you to add items while the blender is spinning.  I have three concerns which make me give it four stars,  The first is what effect spinning magnets may have on other items or electronics in the kitchen  The literature says none, however it still worries me.  Second is the locking mechanism for holding the container in the unit.  It appears a bit flimsy, though modern materials can surprise you with how string they are for their thickness.  The last one is the price.  This unit is $500.  I've had units from Breville, Oster, and Vitamix in the $300 range which seem to perform as well.

"I am a neophyte with telescopes and decided that for what I want to do, this would be a good entry model for me.  I was mostly interested in looking at and photographing the moon, maybe some planets, and possible use it for other celestial background photo work.  It was also a shot at getting my feet wet before I plopped down thousands of dollars to find out I got the wrong stuff.  Turns out this is a good choice to cut my teeth and learn lessons.The unit is fairly rugged, self-contained, and more or less sealed so you can't accidentally mess something up.  It is heavy...too heavy for even the best camera tri-pod.  Combine that with the Earth's habit of rotating objects out of your field of view fairly quickly, you need a specifically designed tri-pod to handle it.  I got the one from Celestron with the azimuth controls so once I get the moon in the telescopes sights, I can rotate some knobs and keep it in view.  That works well without having to invest in a ""clock"" type mount.Photography can be done a couple of ways without investing in those purpose built units which are big on price tags and low in resolution.  The first way is to use an adapter to mount a digital SLR body to the unit. The second is what I did, which is another adapter from Celestron that allows you to mount a point-and-shoot type digital camera behind the eyepiece.  I used an Olympus TG-2 which worked really well, once you got everything aligned.  In some ways, using the rear display of the camera is easier to find and keep your subject in frame.As for the actual quality of the image, I am not an expert.  It seems very crisp to me and I don't seem to see any color issues.  What is important is setting the unit up correctly.  You need to use some local object to ""sight in"" the cross-hairs in the spotter scope to match what you see in the telescope.  Once that is done, it is far easier to find your astronomical targets.  It is still weird getting used to the idea of getting my eyes aligned directly behind the eyepiece and about an inch away from it.  I also like that the image is ""right side up"" like a binocular view rather than the flipped over version most telescopes have.  This will allow me to use it for nature viewing as well.This unit will get me through my learning phase until I know better what I want and how much money I am willing to spend.  I have attached two photos.  One is of the telescope on the tripod with the digital camera adapter.  The other is the first photo of the moon I took with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGDHKM5J6B68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038QYRDO#wasThisHelpful","R2NGDHKM5J6B68","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Interesting, fold-up design, but I wouldn't consider it a space-saver.  Basically the handles fold upward toward the nipper end.  So it goes from somewhat long and narrow to short and twice as wide.  Most tool boxes are longer than they are wide, so you may have situations where it fits your toolbox unfolded, but is too wide when folded.Some people said the latches for locking it in the usable position were weak.  That may happen over time, but initially they seem sturdy.  Fortunately, when applying force to cut bolts, the lock-out tabs do not come into play and everything works fine.  It seems to cut well, so long as you stay within the duty range of the cutter.  Bolt cutters come in different sizes for different types of bolts and chains you need to cut.

"In our offices, we have flat-screen TV's for our conference rooms, however they are in very large and heavy cabinets on wheels.  They take up a lot of room, are heavy to roll around, and invariably scratch doorways and halls as people move them from room to room.  Most are 32-37 inch models and we are in the process of upgrading to 55 - 60 inch models for better viewing, which will render the old cabinets useless.In researching mobile stands, we settled on this model and ordered for to test on a 55 inch TV.

As for the sturdiness, the central, twin tubes are quite large and thick walled, with cross-brackets which serve as reinforcement gussets.  These gussets also provide the attachment for extra shelves beyond the one it comes with.  The height adjustment of the mast and the variable adjustments for mounting the TV itself seems to be able to fit all TV's and all applications.  As for security, there are several ways and places where a security cable can be mounted to help keep the TV in a room from which you do not want it to leave.My only complaint is the very high shipping cost.  The box is large and weighs 85 pounds, so I guess it makes sense.  The weight is really something that attests to the sturdiness of the construction.  When one combines the cost and the shipping, it equates well to the same combination of other models where the unit costs more, but the shipping is much less or free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSPDYHK9W2QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006YBL0R6#wasThisHelpful","R3BSPDYHK9W2QK","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a big fan of this kind of wall anchor.  When I was a few dollars short of making my free freight threshold, i added these to the order.  They are a good size, not overly large for what is used with a #6 to #8 screw.  They do have something different than other types, which is the open design of the tail.  Others like this are solid from one end to the other.  This sometimes is a hassle if the only screw you have to use is longer than the anchor, as it has no where to go.  This one has a gap where it goes into the wall, so screws longer than the anchor just end up passing through.  So far it does not seem to have reduced its ability to stay in the wallboard.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259GHPXOZ3A5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051IB6OA#wasThisHelpful","R259GHPXOZ3A5Q","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know how much value my review is, as these are my first experience with turning tools.  I saw a video on making vases out of pencils and wanted to try it myself, having never used a wood lathe before.  My first attempts were a bit of trial and error, but pretty good.  As a newbie, these tools seem very sharp and durable.  I did give them a quick honing before using them right out of the box.  I had no problems cutting the wood or controlling the cut.  As I gained confidence, I soon realized that there wuld be benefit in having a longer ""reach"" on the blade.  I would call these a mid-size, and the projects I am doing seem to fit this side okay.  If I need to replace these, I might by a full-size tool for a bit more reach and a longer handle for more control.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D35NC0IZYBG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KIAE2Q#wasThisHelpful","R2D35NC0IZYBG3","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pricey, third-tier of filtration that has not been available locally.  I've had the under-sink GE filter for many years, as a last stage filter for municipal water.  The water in West Texas is hard, filled with minerals, and the city water has a funny taste.  Though I know it is ""scientifically certified"" to be drinkable, bottled water beats it for drinking...hands down.  Normally there were only two choices available at local hardware stores and those were becoming more inconsistently available.  When I went online, I found this filter which was a step higher in function than the other two.  I thought I would try it and I was really surprised how much of a difference this one made.  We use the filtered water for cooking and coffee, but now it is very, very close to being the same as the bottled water in taste (or the lack there of).  Through Amazon, the price was high, but not much more than what I was paying for the second-tier of quality at a local store.  SP far I am impressed with what it does, so now the question will be how long it lasts compared to the others.

"I am fortunate to have never had much need for lip balms, so most of this review comes from my wife.  On the other hand, I do have an opinion about how this balm is to kiss.  Some of the stuff my wife uses is waxy and somewhat annoying, but this balm is silky smooth and not waxy at all.  She says it melts into her lips instantly, and I agree.  The scent is very pleasing and not medical smelling or tasting at all.  Some of the stuff she's used in the past was medicinal and nasty-tasting.  It also has little or no taste, which is much better than some of the so-called medicated balms she has had from time to time.  She loves how it melts into her lips without a waxy residue.

"I have always wanted an answer to this question, ""If Febreze kills odors, how can it have a scent?""  With that odd point aside, this is a handy product for tough odors, which for us is dog odor.  We tired pre-treating their bedding, blankets, and sweaters.  With most washings there was still a trace of dog, but with this pre-treatment with Febreze there was none.  We did try one other reviewer's idea of spritzing our own bedding and it did give us a nice scent to fall asleep with in the air.  Another dog issue which it did an excellent job on was dog vomit.  They seem to like to up-chuck on our micro-fiber sofa which is stain repellent and cleans up well, however the vomit smell lingers.  This version of Febreze knocks it right out.  Who knows, maybe we'll just spray the dogs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWHMYQOOBT77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMVCIW#wasThisHelpful","R3DWHMYQOOBT77","A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I got it free on a sample program, however I am being told we will now be buying this stuff regularly. When she first tried it, she thought it was not strong enough to last through the day. She was surprised to see what she thought was only a medium-strength hold, turned out to be holding at the end of a busy work day.  She loves that it is ""combable"" if that's a word, yet it stays where you put it.  She says the fragrance is nice, but not over-powering like some sprays, and it is easy to control direction.

"There is just something about using brass hardware that I like - It's less prone to corroding than common steel, it's strong enough for most purposes, and brass screws and nuts are usually well made.

"Our spa tub is 6 years old and we use it frequently. This is not a miracle worker but it will clean most of the gunk out of your tub or spa bath. I run it for 15 minutes with the air off (air in the jets makes too much foam). I place my hands on two jets and release and repeat to cause turbulence in the other jets. This helps break loose stubborn alge film in the plumbing. I repeat this around the tub while it is running and then let it run for 15 more minutes. Then I drain, refil the tub and add about 1/2 bottle of peroxide and repeat the process to rinse and sanitize the plumbing. After that's all over we use Scrubbing Bubbles and paper towels to clean the grit and gunk that wound up stuck to the sides of the tub. This keeps the tub pretty clean for a couple weeks or a month depending on usage.By the way this has a nasty chemical smell in use - be sure to run the vent fan.We used to use bubble bath and baby oil in the tub, but apparently oils provide food for the gunk that grows in the plumbing. So we no longer do that. Now we just add baking soda (3 fluid oz cup full) to each bath. It's not as nice as the bubble bath and oil but it's good on the skin and somewhat less conducive to growing gunk in the plumbing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33XQ0LWW90U18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VGWL1G#wasThisHelpful","R33XQ0LWW90U18","A1FV6SJ6Z27O1E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FV6SJ6Z27O1E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a simple but well-made magnifier. The lens is just under 3"" in diameter. The magnification by my estimate is about X2 for an item flush against the back skirt of the magnifier. This magnifier appears mainly intended for reading printed material and photographs - And it does a very good job of that. The LED lights go on when you press on the top silver colored ring and goes off when you press again on that. The lens is made of glass which means it should be less prone to getting minor scratches which plastic lens are prone to get. The entire field of view appears to be well illuminated and the magnification appears to be fairly free of optical distortions except right at the edges.The large lens and field of view are very useful - It means you don't have to move it around as much as you would a smaller magnifier. And the magnification appears quite adequate for use in reading fine print or looking at pictures.Update: I left my magnifier out and my wife put it away for me in the case that came with it. If you are not careful that case will hold the light switch on and run the batteries down. Solution - hide or discard the case. When I replaced the batteries I found it had two each CR2016 lithium coin cells. When I replaced those with my own fresh CR2016's I found the battery contact was intermittent. I discovered that two slightly thicker CR2025 cells will just barely fit into the battery compartment and give a more secure connection. If you do this place a little piece of scotch tape or a piece of paper on the back edge of the first battery that goes in to prevent it from contacting the terminal that touches the outside edge of the top battery. If you don't the second cell will be shorted out and the light won't be as bright as it should be. The batteries go in positive end up. The CR2025 batteries should also last longer as they have greater current capacity unless you carelessly use that cover and run the batteries down.The case issue and the battery compartment issues reduced my rating by two stars - but it's still a good magnifier.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SEZQTN7E2LX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099R7FLC#wasThisHelpful","R2SEZQTN7E2LX2","A1FV6SJ6Z27O1E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FV6SJ6Z27O1E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was written before the Monash University studies on the low FODMAP diet for IBS.  I assume that this book is based on the foods that Ms Van Vorous can tolerate but unfortunately her list of tolerated foods doesn't apply to everyone with IBS.  FODMAPs are the type of sugars that cause inflammation in people sensitive to them.  I found  garlic and honey which are both high in FODMAPs used a lot in the recipes in this book and the recipes are not gluten free, and with gluten being another trigger in intestinal inflammation that makes no sense.  If you have the same sensitivities as the author you might do well with this but be aware that research and a scientific approach to the problem has come up with different conclusions.  Check out the Monash University information on the low FODMAP diet if this book doesn't give you the answers you need.  I do have a Masters Degree in Nutrition so I am somewhat knowledgeable.  I think it might be helpful to many if the author were to write an updated version taking the latest research into consideration.As for her other products, the Heather's Tummy Fiber ( acacia fiber ) and Heather's Tummy Tamers,  ( peppermint capsules ) are excellent products and very useful in managing IBS .","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JG439LSS3L78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569246009#wasThisHelpful","R1JG439LSS3L78","A2HB2T5E7J1BGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HB2T5E7J1BGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very enjoyable mystery.  The 4 stars instead of 5 mean that I think it was really very good and I would certainly recommend it, it takes a lot for a book to get 5 stars.  I read a few of the negative reviews by obviously prudish reviewers and it's their loss that they made such a quick judgement about one scene that was I'm sure was not out of character for the times, but was out of character for the Detective who who turned out to be very kind and caring.  Given that the book had absolutely no sex scenes and only what was probably normal behavior for the times it portrayed, the scene that had other reviewers on edge was truly insignificant.  I'm a woman over 60 and I took no offense.  I'm looking forward to the 2nd book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKMB045H068W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKUW8WM#wasThisHelpful","R1MKMB045H068W","A2HB2T5E7J1BGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HB2T5E7J1BGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This has all the same features ( except adjustment on position of overhead display ) for about half the price and it's a much better balanced clock with rubberized feet that doesn't tip over easily.

The waistband is a comfortable  cotton ribbing and seams don't chafe anywhere.  The drawstring ties on the inside of the waistband for a smoother look.

"I really had to force myself to continue reading this book.  Mark Helprin is a wordsmith - beautifully written descriptive sentences but there was nothing but perhaps the joy of a well written phrase to make me want to continue turning pages. The characters lacked depth, I never could feel connected to them. The story, while obviously meant to be fantasy, was too strange to meld with the realism, the tapestry was not well woven, and there seemed to be no point in many of the events in relation to the story.I enjoy a mix of fantasy and realism, George R.R. Martin did this masterfully in his Song of Ice and Fire Series.  Shirley Hazzard in The Transit of Venus tells a story of 2 sisters that is a beautifully constructed web that draws you in and holds you until the end, her characters and story are compelling.  Both are consummate storytellers who write with depth and insight, and by comparison Mark Helprin is a one trick pony.

When you cook and process foods the enzymes in that food are lost and you must rely on your own digestive enzymes which come from the pancreas.  Not everyone produces enough enzymes to properly digest their food.  So if you are having digestive problems,  taking supplemental enzymes makes a huge difference.

"SILENT CITY was an excellent mystery story. I really enjoyed the main character who is coming back from cancer treatment. She had an aggressive form of lymphoma and it was treated aggressively. She still has nerve damage in her extremities and other side effects of her treatment. The first day back on the job she is called to a murder scene. A popular elementary school principal is found dead in his apartment with a broken neck. His body has been posed like Christ on the cross.As Codella investigates she finds a plethora of suspects. Beloved by the families of his school, Hector Sanchez was not beloved by his staff or central administration. Many of his legacy teachers resented his approach; his assistant principal was bullied by him. He was opposed to his Superintendent's plan to buy a huge technology program.Codella has to get back up to speed quickly to solve this one. She is in a new precinct which she transferred to just before she began her battle with cancer and the precinct commander resents her ability and is constantly trying to undermine her activities. She is paired up with a new partner who has just transferred from Vice and who is a gay man getting his own harassment from bigoted colleagues. She also has to deal with her relationship with her old partner. They had a fight just before she transferred because he wanted a more personal relationship with her. She was caught off guard by this and, before they could resolve this, she was in the hospital fighting her cancer. She was also angry that he never came to visit her when she was undergoing her treatments.So Codella investigates. Is it one of the legacy teachers that Sanchez was trying to get fired? Is it the Superintendent who has her own secrets to conceal? Is it the salesman who is having an affair with the Superintendent and who wants his commission on this huge software scale? Is it the actress or her lesbian partner who has been pouring money into the school and who might have an inappropriate relationship with Sanchez? Is it the assistant principal who had been bullied by Sanchez?This was an engaging story. I educational infighting and politics rang true to this long-time teacher which was unsurprising since the author works in the education field. I liked Codella because of her desire to prove that she is back to form but who is forever changed by the battle she won.Fans of mysteries and police procedurals will enjoy this fast-paced, engaging story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OX0BU189XUDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629533742#wasThisHelpful","R2OX0BU189XUDS","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Evie and Zane's romance. They were childhood friends who sheltered and protected each other from the bad home lives they both had. Zane was abused by his drunken and drug addicted father. Evie lived with her alcoholic mother and her police officer father who was always gone. After their first sexual encounter was interrupted by Evie's father, both Zane's father and Evie's father were shot to death and Zane would have been a suspect if he hadn't run. He disappeared from Evie's life leaving her pregnant with his son.Nine years pass and they reconnect. Evie is now an artist who customizes motorcycles and Zane is the Vice President of an outlaw motorcycle club. Unfortunately, Evie has attracted the attention of the President of a rival motorcycle club which makes beginning a relationship with Zane very dangerous both for her heart and for her life.This story gives a good picture of life in a motorcycle club - a life I wouldn't choose for all the money in the world. Like me, Evie isn't sure that she can ever accept the way things are inside the club. When Zane is beaten for disobeying the club president, he accepts it as a logical consequence but Evie is ready to break up with him over it.I enjoyed the romance as both had to learn to trust each other again and forgive each other and themselves for the things that happened in the past. They also had to find a way reconcile their different lifestyles in the present.This wasn't a sweet romance. It was dark and gritty. Both Evie and Zane have sexual kinks that, luckily, they both share. Between murders, fires, and kidnappings the action in the story was gritty and dark too.Fans of the series and fans of dark romances will enjoy this intense story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HOGUW9TZXUBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250056624#wasThisHelpful","R1HOGUW9TZXUBN","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an entertaining romantic fantasy which is the third book in a series. I do not recommend beginning with this story because there are only references to events that happened earlier in the series and I found them more confusing than helpful. Living among us but hidden from us are immortal being from Welsh mythology. They are fighting a war between those who are pure-blooded and can shift between their human and wolf identities and those who intermarried with humans who are not all able to shift. Some are born able to shift, others are born human and can't shift, and still others are born as wolves with human minds.This story centers around Elen who was born human but who has substantial and unique magical powers which have made her very attractive to the leaders of the Guardians - the pure bloods. Pendaran who leads the Council of Guardians wants to control Elen and use her powers. Cormack is her romantic partner. Apparently he was one of those who was born wolf and couldn't shift to human until Elen did something to him in one of the earlier books. Cormack has lived with Elen as a wolf for three hundred years and loved her all that time. Now he has to learn to deal with a human body and has to learn if Elen can also love the man as she had loved the wolf.I liked the relationship between Cormack and Elen. I thought their scenes together, at least once they cleared up their misunderstandings, were very romantic. I thought the book had lots of adventure too as Elen has to deal with betrayal and imprisonment. I liked that Cormack never gave up on finding her after she was taken by Pendaran.This was an interesting story with wonderful world building. I would recommend reading the first two books in the series before reading this one though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTEU154WBPI46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266222#wasThisHelpful","RTEU154WBPI46","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jennifer Donnelly has written an engaging historical mystery and coming of age story in THESE SHALLOW GRAVES.Josephine Montfort's world changes dramatically when her father dies. Her sheltered life as the daughter of one of the first families of New York didn't prepare her for what she learns. But Jo doesn't really fit into her sheltered life. She wants to be a newspaper reporter like the famous Nelly Bly. She doesn't want to spend her life married to a rich man she doesn't love, caring for his home, and raising his children.Jo has a handsome potential fiance in Bram Aldrich whom she has known since they were children but she has no romantic interest in him despite knowing that she should.  When she meets reporter Eddie Gallagher, her future certainties are challenged. As she and Eddie investigate the murder of her father and she falls in love with him, she questions more and more the future that has been planned for her.Eddie introduces her to parts of New York that she has never seen and people she would never have gotten to know. She becomes friends with Fairy Fay, a young woman who has been raised by the local Fagin as a pickpocket and who has outgrown it and is to be sold to a madam as a prostitute.Jo makes discoveries that shatter what she knows of her family and her father. I had figured out who the villain was pretty early in the story and had some ideas about the secret that was being hidden but enjoyed discovering the truth along with Jo. I also enjoyed the glimpse into the 1890s for both the rich and the poor. Seeing what a woman's role and choices were made me very glad that I am living now and not then.This was a great story that was as much a mystery as an exploration of a time in history that is thankfully past. Readers will enjoy both the mystery and the strong character of Jo Montfort who finally makes her own choices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAVGEIX4EVED2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385737653#wasThisHelpful","RAVGEIX4EVED2","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack Logan isn't a big fan of football which is too bad since football is king at his high school and his father was the school's all-time record holder in many categories. When the school gets a new principal, his first change is to require all seniors to be on some sports team. Jack is recruited to be on the team by the new principal/head football coach but declines. Jack learns that the coach once dated his mother until she chose his father over the coach. He also learns that the coach - Muhldinger - is the type of guy who holds grudges.Jack teams up with some of his non-athletic friends and the girl who is going to be his girlfriend to form a soccer team. First they have to recruit a coach and their choice is a part-time Latin teacher from England. The team has decided to rebel against the win at all cost mentality of the school by trying to lose all their games.When a video of the principal/coach berating the team after their first game, in which they were blown out by a group of junior high school girls, goes viral. The Loses small time quiet protest gains more momentum than anyone was expecting. It is even picked up by the national press and the kids are being hounded by reporters. Then things escalate. One of the kids on the team is attacked and beaten up, sustaining a concussion and a broken wrist. Another kid has his car set on fire in front of his house.The simple protest that the kids had in mind soon becomes something that is almost out of their control. There are tensions between Jack and his dad who is also losing in construction job because of the bad economy. Jack's girlfriend Becca is also going through stress at home as her parents are divorcing and her dad has a new, younger girlfriend.This story was very readable and very engaging. I liked that it was about more than just sports. I also thought it realistically portrayed what social media can do to make a small fire into an inferno. Sports fans will enjoy the hapless performance of the Losers' soccer team and will enjoy seeing Jack discover a sport he enjoys and is good at. People who aren't sports fans will still enjoy the humor in the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ECCW2GOIVX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374301360#wasThisHelpful","R39ECCW2GOIVX0","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wren is a homeschooled astronomy buff whose academic rival is homeschooled Simon Barker. Their parents are friends. When Wren and Simon are recruited by the magical Fiddlers, both enter a world they didn't know existed.There was a recent civil war in that world between the Alchemists and the Magicians that has left lots of distrust between the adults and fear that the leader of the Magicians, Boggen, will someday return. Wren, Simon, and another new apprentice named Jack are all being mentored by Fiddler Mary who was Boggen's mentor.This story is told by Mary. So we get to learn most about her. We see a young girl who knows she is smart and who is sometimes envious of her rival Simon. There are some things he is quicker and better at than she is. She is not used to that and doesn't like it very much. What we see of Simon is a more easy-going kid who wants to be friends with Wren. Jack is more mysterious. He's always cracking jokes but is very secretive about his past while both Wren and Simon come from happy families.Wren learns that she has some unusual magical talents including that she is a Weather Changer and Dreamer. When she loses her temper, everyone learns that she is a Weather Changer which is worrying because Boggen was also a Weather Changer. She manages to keep the fact that she is a Dreamer secret. It is in her lucid dreams that she meets Boggen and other of the Magicians.This story was entertaining and exciting as the kids need to stop Boggen from finding his way back to Earth and starting his civil war again. I liked that the magic the kids did used nursery rhymes as their base. I liked that each chapter began with an altered nursery rhyme. I liked the relationship that grew between Wren and Simon. I liked the world building.Middle grade fans of fantasy will enjoy the sympathetic characters and fast-paced action of this engaging story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQP2HGOHLK5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291556#wasThisHelpful","R1BQP2HGOHLK5J","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DEAD INVESTIGATION was an engaging mystery told from two different points of view.Murray is a high school senior who lives in a cemetery and can talk to the dead. He is staying in the equipment shed after leaving the home of his prostitute mother. Murray believes that the dead people he talks to in the cemetery are his only friends but he fears that being able to talk to them means that he is mentally ill. Murry does have a couple of living friends too. Pearl and her father Janochek also live in the cemetery. Janochek is the caretaker.Deputy Roman Gates is an investigator for the local sheriff's office and is the second viewpoint character. Gates is dealing with a gambling addiction which caused him to be jailed and to lose his job. Now, reinstated but at a lower rank, he is trying to rebuild his life. He is also feeling guilty about the suicide death of his only child.Gates and Murray met before in a previous case. This time Gates is investigating the disappearances of a number of homeless people from the local area. He is also investigating the disappearance of a young man whose father is the CEO of Trask Engineering.When Murray begins hearing voices outside the cemetery walls, he first tries to ignore them. He doesn't want any publicity or any more suspicion from the police if he reports more bodies. Pearl wants to investigate though. And finally Janochek convinces Murray to contact Gates.Lots of action, excitement and danger happen before the case is solved. My one quibble with this mystery is its classification as YA. Since at least half of it is told from the viewpoint of 40-ish Deputy Gates, I wonder if it will appeal to YA readers.Fans of mysteries and characters with strange powers will find this one entertaining. Fans of the first book will definitely want to read this one to find out what happens in Murray and Pearl's lives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35U5NV8DUAKII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374302278#wasThisHelpful","R35U5NV8DUAKII","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NEWT'S EMERALD was a delightful Regency romp with magic. It reminded me of the best of Georgette Heyer.Lady Truthful Newington has grown up in the country with the company of her cousins and the supervision of her Admiral father. Now she has reached the age when she will be sent to London to make her presentation to Society and find herself a husband. However, before she can embark, her father shows her the Newington Emerald which will be hers when she reaches age 21. The emerald is a magical object which has been in the family for many generations. But a sudden storm and an unknown intruder arrive and, when things settle down, the emerald is missing. Her father is taken ill and in moments of lucidity he tells Truthful that he fears the loss of the emerald will destroy the family's luck.Truthful travels to London to stay with her Great-Aunt Ermintrude and locate the emerald. Her great-aunt reveals hidden depths and encourages her to dress as a man to search for the emerald. Luckily, her great-aunt is a talented sorceress who places a spell on Truthful's false mustache to encourage the deception.Truthful, now Henri de Vienne, runs into Major Charles Harkness who is convinced that Truthful is a French spy. Having been disappointed in love, Charles says some rude things about Truthful which makes her eager to live down to his opinion of her.However, the two of them need to work together to defeat the evil sorceress who stole the emerald and along the way, and despite many misunderstandings, the two fall in love. What I especially enjoyed in this story was the Truthful saves Charles's life at least three times. She is no fainting, helpless heroine.The characters were engaging, the plot was fast-paced, and the setting was intriguing. Other similar books include Georgette Heyer's Regency romances, Jane Austen's novels, and, for readers who want some magic with their Regency story, SHADES OF MILK AND HONEY by Mary Robinette Kowal or SORCERY AND CECILIA by Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DXHD5SL0AI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062360043#wasThisHelpful","R19DXHD5SL0AI6","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her cheating ex-fiance had set her up before dying in a car accident. Now, she is training dogs and trying to rebuild her life.Lauray Batisse was a military policeman whose K-9 companion died at the same time Law was hurt by an IED.

He was raised to believe that he couldn't do relationships. But it seems like Law and Jori kept getting pushed together. Jori has to go to him to give him and Samantha some more training. Also an investigation that Law is during intersects with Jori's court case. Law agrees to help Jori find out the truth about how she came to be convicted.The story has a lot of action and some sizzling romantic scenes as Jori and Law learn to take a chance on each other.

"This second book in the Noctis Magicae series was as wonderful as the first. Sophie Marshall is a second year student at Merlin College and married to Gray who is a lecturer there. While she very much enjoys the chance to learn about magick, she does not enjoy the prejudice and attention that is paid to her as one of the few female students and the long lost daughter of the King.When Gray is offered a position as a visiting lecturer at the University in Din Edin in the country of Alba and Sophie offered a position as a student there, they are eager to accept. However, Alba and Britain are separate countries and relations between them are somewhat tense. Sophie loves the university and is glad to meet and make friends with other female scholars. But the political situation isn't good. The land is suffering from some ills - crop failures and illness in some animal herds - and magickal interference is being blamed.Tensions escalate when it is learned that the next Chieftain of the clans, Lucia MacNeill a fellow student of Sophie's, has become betrothed to Roland, Sophie's half brother and second in line to the throne in Britain, there are protests that threaten to grow into riots. The political factions that see this as Britain's attempt to conquer Alba are very unhappy.Meanwhile, Joanna who is Sophie's sister is busy in London learning diplomacy from her guardian Sieur Germain de Kergabet who is an adviser to King Henry and Lord President of His Majesty's Privy Council. Joanna is on the inside knowing about the marriage plans of Roland, who has a monster crush on her, and Lucia MacNeill. Joanna is also planning a visit north to visit her sister and Gray.Shortly before Joanna's arrival, Gray is kidnapped though, at first, it is assumed that he has been called home because of his father's illness. Time is lost because of the need to give him time to travel from Alba to the south of Britain but when a second letter is received, Sophie knows that something is very wrong. She learns that other foreign mages have also disappeared. She is determined to find her husband. In fact, she must find her husband because the longer he is away from her the more sick she becomes. Their marriage had linked their magick together. If she can't find him, they will both die.This was a wonderful story. The world building was amazing. I loved the combination of magick and political intrigue. I also loved the growing relationship between Gray and Sophie as they adjust to being married. Sophie is a wonderful character who has immense magickal talent but no desire to use it for political gain.This book will be going on my Keeper Shelf along with the first book in the series - THE MIDNIGHT QUEEN.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T1P3QQZPJDK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02DYA#wasThisHelpful","R1T1P3QQZPJDK9","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But when she returns to her aunt's cottage after the funeral, she surprises an intruder who is searching the place and who attempts to kidnap her. She is rescued by Baron Maximillian von Stauffenbach who offers her a ride to London and answers to her questions. He is convinced that she is in deadly danger and deposits her with an old friend of his Stoker.Stoker is grouchy, disheveled and living in a warehouse down by the river surrounded by his natural history specimens. He isn't eager to be a refuge for Veronica but owes Max and thus agrees. Veronica and Stoker clash for a number of reasons. She questions the accuracy of his labels on some of his specimens and, worst of all, cleans the place up because she prefers a tidy organized environment. When the baron is murdered, Veronica and Stoker want to solve the crime but the police have decided that Stoker is a suspect in the crime. The two wind up fleeing the city.On their way out of town, Veronica is approached by Edmund de Clare who offers to save her from Stoker. And while they are in hiding at a traveling curiosity show, a groom with suspiciously soft hands and refined speech named Mornaday also offers to rescue her from Stoker. Veronica wonders why she is suddenly drawing so much attention.Orphaned, illegitimate Veronica has a secret past of her own. Those secrets are very threatening to some people who would either like her dead or who would like to control her. Veronica has to find a way to neutralize the situation to save both Stoker and herself.Veronica is a wonderful character. She is a free thinker. She seems oblivious to the danger she is in. In fact, she acts likes she's ten feet tall and bullet-proof. She has a confidence that borders on arrogance and absolutely no tact. She is quite smart and has no need or desire to be under any man's protection. She is anything but a typical Victorian woman of the gentility.I loved the relationship between Veronica and Stoker. Their arguments and other conversations were filled with wonderful dialogue. I liked the way he came to treat her as an equal partner and I liked the struggle between them until he did. Stoker is a man with secrets that Veronica would love to probe but she is giving him time to share them.I can't wait to read more books in this new series to find out how their relationship grows and find out what new mysteries they solve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3D0XSEVQ6MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451476018#wasThisHelpful","R1O3D0XSEVQ6MG","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a very entertaining dystopia with a healthy helping of magic. Joyeaux Charmand is a Hunter. Hunters are the ones who can fight the Othersiders - monsters out of world mythology - by using magic, physical training and weapons and a pack of magical creatures to assist. Joy is called to go to Apex city to join the core of Hunters there who protect the heart of the country and the important Cits.When she gets to Apex city, she learns that things are not the way she had supposed. She was raised in the Rocky Mountains far from the East Coast and she was trained by Masters at a monastery. That is all secret though. According to her story, she developed her powers only recently - instead of when she was a small child - and has come to the city for training. She didn't expect that the Hunters would each have their own video feeds and that huge numbers of people followed the feeds. She didn't expect to be taking part in a popularity contest.But Joy is an excellent Hunter which quickly moves her up in the ranking which incites the jealousy of Hunter Ace who has had a long hold on first place. Joy also makes friends with her mentor Karly and another Hunter called the White Knight who is also a Christer, a minority religious sect.Joy was also called to the city by her uncle who is the Prefect of the Police. The Hunters who are not in the Army are under his command. He warns her that someone may try to use or influence her in order to get to him. He has political enemies. Her uncle has as an assistant a Psimon named James. Psimons can read thoughts and are generally feared and avoided. Nonetheless, James and Joy become friends.This book was very exciting to read. There were lots of battles with mythological characters. There was also a lot about finding like-minded friends. Joy was an interesting character who battled loneliness but who has a strong sense of duty as a Hunter to protect the Cits who are in danger from the Othersiders.This is the first book in a series. I'll be haunting Mercedes Lackey's website waiting for news of the additional volumes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQ4L4IQ56D62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484707842#wasThisHelpful","R3GQ4L4IQ56D62","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this story which is a riff on the Cinderella story. Nicolette is the daughter of a famous inventor mother and an entrepreneur father. She seems benignly neglected by both of them. She wants to be an inventor like her mother who is her teacher when she can work her daughter in around inventing. She gets her nurturing from the housekeeper who is half-Fey.After the death of the queen from an illness carried home from where the Fey live, the king turns against all things fey. The magic that Nicolette's mother infused in her inventions has made them terribly unpopular. The issue of the fey has also caused Nicolette's parents to argue. When Nicolette's mother catches the same disease that killed the Queen, her father refuses to deal illegally to get the fey remedy that could cure her. After her mother's death, her father remarries a woman who share his anti-Fey sentiments. She has two daughters and Nicolette initially hopes that they will become her sisters. But after her father's death, things change drastically for Nicolette. At age 10, Nicolette becomes a servant for the Steps.Luckily, she still has some of their former housekeepers magical gadgets to help her. But she spends a lonely six years as a despised servant before she receives a letter from her mother on her sixteenth birthday. The letter gives her access to her mother's hidden workshop which opens new opportunities for Nicolette. She is befriended by a small clockwork horse and a bunch of clockwork insects. She determines to invent things to sell so that she can someday have a place and workshop of her own.On her first trip to the market, she meets Caro and Fin who befriend her. They are her first friends. But when she returns home, her stepmother has discovered her workshop and has destroyed it. Most hurtful is that she destroyed the clockwork horse. However, her friends are still there to encourage her and her stepmother didn't find the hidden workshop.Nicolette - now renamed Mechanica by her spiteful stepsisters - is determined to win recognition for her inventions at an up-coming Exposition and Ball. The stepsisters are determined to use the Ball as an opportunity to meet the hidden Heir Christopher and to catch his attention so that he will make one of them his wife. Mechanica doesn't care about catching a prince; she wants to build her own life on her own merits.What I especially liked about this story was that Mechanica was someone who was determined to act and make her own happy ending. I liked the worldbuilding and the combination of magic and invention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AZRZRJTW30MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547927711#wasThisHelpful","R2AZRZRJTW30MC","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in the Cainsville series. In it Olivia learns a lot more about her past. She is also learning about what the fae want from her. Being Olivia, she isn't going to give it to them unless it is what she wants too.This story begins with a phone call from James who is Olivia's former fiance and her current stalker. Both Gabriel and Ricky have tried all they can to get him to stop harassing Olivia but nothing has worked. Olivia can't understand how the man she loved enough to accept a marriage proposal from could ever become the person he is now.Meanwhile, Gabriel and Olivia are still working on getting her birth parents out of prison. They have already proven that they didn't commit one of the murders that they were convicted for. They are still pursuing leads that have grown cold in the twenty-two years since they were convicted. Olivia finally gets to meet her father in prison which is a very traumatic experience for her.Olivia is also having visions of the past which are providing her with at least as many questions as answers. The fae are telling her that she, Gabriel and Ricky are reliving an old story and her choices could determine the fate of the fae.I like Olivia a lot. As Rose's tarot card reading tells us, she is bright, perceptive, intuitive and independent and sometimes cold-hearted, critical and cynical. I like that she knows what she wants out of life and isn't going to let anyone push her around. I also like Ricky who is a perfect romantic partner for her.I love Gabriel who is such a heart-breaking character. As a child he suffered both abuse and neglect at the hands of his drug-addicted mother. It has made him into an adult who is very protective of what he has. He can't touch and has no emotional intuition. He is very private and isn't going to risk his heart with anyone. He knows this about himself but has no way to change. I like that Olivia also knows who he is and is determined to be his friend no matter how hard it is.While this book has a satisfying conclusion, I am glad that the author has already sold books four and five in this series. I can't wait to find out what happens next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ISHZW5TE9F5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052595306X#wasThisHelpful","R1ISHZW5TE9F5D","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"RED LINE was an excellent police procedural with an engaging main character. Matt Sinclair is just back on homicide after a variety of difficulties - shooting a suspect, an arrest for drunk driving, and a stint in rehab.Matt's first case is that of a teenage boy found dead at a bus stop outside a hospital. The boy was a straight arrow from a neighboring and wealthy suburb. His father is a surgeon at the hospital. Matt also finds himself saddled with a rookie female partner. When a second body is dumped at the same bus stop, Matt and his partner spend hours trying to find anything that connects them. Both cases bring back another case of Matt's. A couple of girls were left at that same bus stop two years previously. One wandered in her dazed state into traffic and died as a result of being hit by cars. Matt was too deep into his alcoholism at the time to devote as much time to the case as he should have.What this book shows in great detail is the day to day slog of police work - the interviews, the reports, the need to put various small bits of information together to build a case. We follow Matt as he works this case and deals with supervisors who want to force him out of homicide and a girl friend who is a television reporter whose job often puts them in conflict. We see Matt dealing with the long hours and high stress of the investigation and we see him struggling with the desire to take a drink.Chapters from the murderers point of view add some real creepiness to the story too. This was a well-plotted mystery. I had no idea who the criminal was until Matt and the other detectives figured it out.Fans of police procedurals will greatly enjoy this fast-paced, well-plotted story. I look forward to more from this debut author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MP7R121D3EDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629531944#wasThisHelpful","R3MP7R121D3EDF","A6XR7Y415RPD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6XR7Y415RPD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The FPD quickly concludes she committed suicide.  Though he detested Marta’s inability to silently clean his home, Amerasian insurance fraud investigator Rick Van Lam sends flowers but feels he has no reason to attend the funeral of an acquaintance he employed.Marta’s niece Karen Corcoran disagrees with the official cause of death.  She pleads with Rick to investigate.  Even though he knows Karen has a powerful monetary incentive to get the ruling changed as Marta’s beneficiary, Rick agrees to look into her aunt’s death.  Inside Marta’s home, Rick finds no evidence of a depressed person, but instead learns the deceased was a devout Catholic; which makes killing herself less likely.  As he interviews people who knew Marta, Rick finds many adored and cherished her; while others like her nephew and a gardener loathed her; but a motive for murder remains elusive.The second Rick Van Lam investigation (see Caught Dead) is an excellent Vietnamese-American whodunit in which the sleuthing provides a fabulous look at the subculture.  The strong cast starting with the late housecleaner turns this into a terrific mystery.Harriet Klausner","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG5C1I8GQ4RUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204284#wasThisHelpful","RG5C1I8GQ4RUG","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The two cops break down the apartment door of a single woman.  The overwhelming smell leads them to a female’s posed corpse.  Pete collapses when he recognizes the victim, as Mariela Camacho who remains the love of his life though he married someone else.In spite of a suicide note and the medical examiner’s contention; Pete adamantly insists Mariela would never slice her throat; other evidence surfaces that supports his assertion.  Grieving Pete thinks back to the Dominican Republic when he was a teen whose parents died. Tio Polito took Pete in and raised him along with Mariela and two other girls.  However Pete also knows Polito’s business interests are deadly illegal, but when he and Tolya find evidence of an international serial killer both fear for Karin as the Jewish Heritage Museum chief curator seems lost likely next.A. J. Sidransky refreshes his overarching Forgiving Maximo Rothman premise of connecting a current Washington Heights police investigation with Judaism thriving and welcomed in the 1940s Dominican Republic compared with ugly suppression by Soviet Russia.  The main characters are three-dimensional and the rotating subplots superb.  We fans will never forgive Mr. Sidransky if he fails to bring back Kurchenko and Gonzalvez for a third Upper Manhattan investigation.Harriet Klausner","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZVFWNSW1CQ39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990951561#wasThisHelpful","RZVFWNSW1CQ39","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Survivors were enslaved, but a few escaped notice because they were “passing” as “normal”.In present day Oklahoma, Delilah Morrow always assumed she is 100% human and never gave a first thought about the Cryptid.  On her twenty-fifth birthday she enters Metzger’s Menagerie to watch in horror a several-thousand plus mob taunting a werewolf.

She arranges over the internet to swap houses with Harvard History Professor Charles Brewster who hates the Yuletide holidays.  To Charles' bah humbug chagrin Leavenworth, Washington including Emily's home comes out of a Christmas catalogue.  Meanwhile, Emily's friend Faith Kerrigan travels to Leavenworth to spend time with her while Charles' brother Ray travels from New York to Boston to spend time with him.  Adding to the mix-up is that Emily's daughter is in Florida.  As the two couples (Emily and Ray, and Charles and Faith) fall in love, each learns the real meaning of the holiday that miracles occur.“The Forgetful Bride.”  Even though they have not seen each other in two decades, Joseph tells everyone that Caitlin is his wife.  When she was eight and he ten, her older brother “witnessed” his sister and his best friend “marrying”.  Upset with Joe, Cait insists to him (and herself) she loves her boss Paul.  Joe says she loves him and on Christmas Day, he plans to kiss his bride.With a plot similar to the 2006 movie The Holiday, though released earlier (in 2004), Trading Christmas is an uplifting holiday tale that uses coincidences to make the point that miracles exist when love blossoms.  The reprint of the 1991 Forgetful Bride is a “second chance” holiday romance, but Joe’s constant contention grows cold and Cait’s irritated reaction seems over the top of the Space Needle.Harriet Klausner","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3LV6OPB9WBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831829X#wasThisHelpful","R3T3LV6OPB9WBT","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unlike the jolly New York shoppers, father and son never forgot the tragedy that occurred two decades ago on Christmas Eve when Jake’s mom and sis died.  In Brooklyn, Holly Larson struggles with having her eight year old nephew Gabe living with her while her widower brother serves in Afghanistan and their parents provide medical assistance in Haiti.  Finley Department Store seasonal employee Emily ""Mrs. Miracle"" Merkle thinks Jake and Holly are a perfect match; she plans to live up to her nickname using a toy that Gabe wants as the matchmaker.“The Christmas Basket.”  Ten years ago, Noelle McDowell left her hometown of Rose, Oregon to go off to college, but secretly vowed never to return.  Noelle loved Thom Sutton, but as high school seniors, he failed to show up when they planned to elope.  She concluded that he wanted to humiliate her as part of the long running feud between their mothers.  The only thing that could bring Noelle back to Rose is her sister's wedding.  When Noelle and Thom meet at the town holiday dance, they realize the attraction remains between them and finally talk about that day.Even as the storyline goes as expected, the reprint of Call Me Mrs. Miracle (made into a movie) remains a lighthearted inspirational Miracle on 34th Street.  The reprint of The Christmas Basket is a warm second chance though the reason the leads failed to meet lacks needed depth.

A few hours after the tweeners were snatched, Rachel is found alive in the nearby woods.  The kidnapper escaped and the other victim Sophie remained missing.For the next three decades Sophie’s depressed mom Yvonne grieved her loss but always prayed for the safe return of her daughter until now when she abruptly commits suicide.  Deeply troubled by Yvonne’s death, Detective Inspector Francis Sadler wants to know what really triggered the mom to kill herself after suffering the loss for thirty years yet never gave up on her dream to hug her daughter.

When the strangled corpse of a teacher who taught at the kidnapped girls’ school in 1978 is uncovered, the cops and Rachel believe the perp is tying up loose ends.This is an exciting British police procedural (and amateur sleuth) starring a solid cast who bring insight into women’s issues in the workforce and in the Peak District three decades apart.

On the way he looks into Lombardi’s Grocery and Produce where his fruitcakes are on sale; only to find none on display.  Angrily he enters the store to confront Lombardi but is greeted by the silence of the storeowner’s corpse.

"Everyone Has Their ReasonsJoseph MatthewsPM Press, Oct 1 2015, $24.95ISBN: 9781629630946In 1936, fifteen years old Polish-German Jew Herschel Grynszpan flees his homeland.  Though the trek was perilous, he makes it to Paris.  In 1938, Grynszpan calmly walks into the German embassy in Paris and assassinates a German consular official, Ernst von Rath.  The Nazi regime appears irate in public while condoning the mass slaughter of Jews in Germany in the infamous Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass response.  As the teen stands “trial” for murder; the Nazi propaganda machine blames Grynszpan and his abomination race for starting the European hostilities.  However, Grynszpan proves much cleverer than thought; forcing the Fuhrer to personally delay the trial until other means of extermination can be executed.Combining the agreed upon (by historiographers) known facts with the protagonist’s fictional “letters” written to his appointed lawyer from his prison cell, this is a powerful historical drama mindful of Harlan Greene’s equally excellent “The German Officer’s Boy” (same lead).  This is a timely tale with immigration and intolerance issues, and wall solutions (reminiscent of the “successes” by the Maginot Line and the Great Wall of China) still in the forefront today.  Aptly titled Everyone Has Their Reasons is a tremendous pre WWII fictional account of a real incident used by propagandists to justify murder, torture, looting and destruction.Harriet Klausner","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16I80649F072D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629630942#wasThisHelpful","R16I80649F072D","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

LAPD Detectives come to Pen’s house to question her as to her relationship with Celia Sims and where she was last night.  Someone murdered Celia on her former boyfriend (and Pen’s current significant other) James Carter’s boat “Alicia C”.  The police arrest James for Celia’s murder though Pen remains a viable suspect.  Threats mount on Pen as she diligently works the prosecution while trying to prove James (and herself) did not kill Celia.The second Pen Wilkinson suspenseful legal thriller (see Downfall) is an exhilarating cautionary drama that builds suspense based on Lord Acton’s late nineteenth century observation ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"".  Pen remains a super lead (even in her few pages as second chair) as she learns first-hand the meaning of President Eisenhower’s Farewell Address warning: “… we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial (and Congressional) complex”.Harriet Klausner","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLYW2AW26C9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=099084613X#wasThisHelpful","RLLYW2AW26C9M","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sagan, Paris 1954Anne Berest; Heather Lloyd (translator)Gallic Books, Sep 15 2015, $14.95ISBN: 9781908313898In 1954, teenage amies Franoise Quoirez and Florence Malreaux enjoy Paris.  Whereas Françoise is a bourgeoisie expelled from several schools, Florence is a drop out.  Françoise admires her BFF who as a Jewish child joined the French Resistance, but is rewarded by society as an outcast reminder of the atrocities that Vichy France prefers to forget.  Ironically Florence respects her BFF for fearlessly questioning French bourgeoisie society for de jure sexism in which women cannot work or own a bank account without male approval (she had to accept cash for winning a literary prize) and not so discrete racism for mistreatment of Jews.To honor his late mom and her astonishing accomplishment on its Diamond Anniversary and her death ten years ago, Denis Westhoff commissions Anne Berest to write a special memoir in spite of the writer nee twenty-five years after the publication of Bonjour Tristesse.  Depressed due to her separation from the father of her child, Anne analyzes data and interviews those who knew Françoise before she became the great “scandalous” author of teen angst alongside of Salinger (The Catcher in the Rye).This is an appealing fictional memoir that focuses on what happened in 1954 to transform bourgeois teen wannabe writer Françoise Quoirez into award winning author Françoise Sagan.  I found Ms. Berest’s personal tsuris and healing interesting but somewhat disruptive of the fascinating look at the metamorphosis of a teen into Sagan.  Still les lecteurs will appreciate this unique glimpse at an eventually influential writer just prior to her fame.Harriet Klausner","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3V4LHU3XNIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908313897#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3V4LHU3XNIJ","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Valley Of DecisionLynn GentrySimon & Schuster/Howard Books, Sep 22 2015, $14.99ISBN: 9781476746418Several years have passed since Dr. Lisbeth Hasting left behind her beloved barrister Cyprianus Thracius in third century Roman controlled Carthage.  Both agreed to the separation to keep their daughter safe since his beloved offspring would be an Achilles’ heel for Cyprianus as the leader of the persecuted (by Rome) Christians.  Though she fiercely misses her mate, Lisbeth raises their child and uses her medical practice to control her sadness.Disappointed with her mom’s lack of effort over the last decade to bring her daddy home; teenage Maggie’s paternal obsession leads her to take a radical course to persuade her father that his family (at least her as she doubts her mom cares) needs him.  In Carthage, Maggie finds her grandmother accused of murder, but her attempts at rescue leads to a riot.  The Proconsul demands the death of the troublemaking teen mastermind and her rebellious family.The third Christian Chronicles of Carthage saga (see Return to Exile and Healer of Carthage) is a complex time travel family drama, but has a “déjà vu all over again” (the late great Yogi Berra) feel to the overarching theme.  Well written climaxing with a terrific unexpected but reasonable late twist, Valley Of Decision is a fine finish to a fabulous trilogy.Harriet Klausner","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24S22540NRSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476746419#wasThisHelpful","R24S22540NRSG","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The other geek Glitter Tie begins to explain to Carter Sloan why he was awakened when they have contemporary superior operatives, but they are easily outed by all their implanted gizmos.  An explosion interrupts them; followed by GT committing suicide.  The jackbooted thugs enter the briefing room led by a frustrated captain who shoots three slugs into GT’s corpse before telling Mr. Sloan they came to rescue him from rebels.Tricking the rebels on Europa with a false success, Empire Internal Security Agent Armand escorts Sloan to their headquarters on Mars after the revived twentieth century man learns earthlings nuked the home planet into oblivion.  Sloan’s mission is to infiltrate the enemy by pretending to be a rebel asset so that he can assassinate the Brass Dragon’s daughter.Over the top of Olympus Mons, Gestapo Mars is a gory science fiction that provides a macabrely absorbing satirical future.  While readers follow the bellicose bloody and sensationally sexual exploits of Sloan, his Nazis handlers are extrapolated caricatures of the 1940s variety (kept expecting them to dance to and sing “Springtime for Hitler” from the Producers).  Once again Victor Gischler authors an outrageously entertaining saga with an intriguing final spin.Harriet Klausner","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C68GG3PTQ78D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783297352#wasThisHelpful","R2C68GG3PTQ78D","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Leo points out to the trespassers that his partner is a cop, which upsets Thomas as he prefers not advertising his badge when on a gay tryst.On the Nipmuc Golf Course’s ninth hole, groundskeeper Cal Jackson finds a female corpse.  Thomas arrives at the scene and immediately sees the incompetence of his staff and the body of Cecilia North containing multiple gunshot holes.  The case turns personal when Thomas realizes the victim is the twentyish woman chased out of the cabin last night.  Fearing outing by either his almost sex partner or Cecilia’s, Thomas gingerly investigates the homicide while trying to remain in the closet.The first solid Lynch police procedural is somewhat linear except for the chief’s desperate tactics to solve the case without being exposed.  Lynch is a unique protagonist whose sex addiction led to his lower head resolving the ticket; while his sexual preference cover-up obfuscates the investigation.  Idyll Threats reminds the audience how far much of society has come to accept LGBT First Amendment rights in less than two decades, but also cautions supporters that the cause is far from over as pockets of resistance remain.Harriet Klausner","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LNGSRFI3TMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880788#wasThisHelpful","R20LNGSRFI3TMM","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Red-Rose ChainSeanan McGuireDAW, Sep 1 2015, $7.99ISBN: 9780756408091Portland, Oregon area Kingdom of Silences King Rhys declares war on the San Francisco based Kingdom of the Mists by claiming the latter committed treacherous acts when Queen Arden took the throne instead of the “rightful” ruler.  Trying to prevent hostilities from heating up, Queen Arden assigns October Daye as a diplomat to negotiate a peaceful solution that may prevent many unnecessary Fae deaths.Knowing there are much better choices at the Mists court than someone like her who shoots first, Toby concludes Arden cleverly selected her because she expected the usual chaotic destruction that Daye brings to wherever she goes.  Thus Toby believes her real mission is to remove Rhys from the throne without causing bloodshed; which is okay by her because the king’s gory viciousness towards her race of changelings is an abomination she cannot accept and besides he allied with the Mists’ deposed, despotic and dead previous monarch.  However, Toby and her retinue including her fiancé Tybalt fail to account for diabolical Rhys’ ability to manipulate his opponents.  He now has her where he wants her because she possesses something he covets that Toby cannot afford to lose.The ninth October Daye urban fantasy (see The Winter Long) is an exhilarating entry in which the heroine tries her best to prevent a Fae Pacific Coast war from occurring.  Toby is awesome in her diplomatic role as she has to control her urge to kick butt while also accepting crap tossed in her face; and at the same time prevent Rhys from usurping a critical part of her.  Series fans will relish this seemingly transitional novel with the overarching twist of October Daye, peace negotiator.Harriet Klausner","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DM2KXHTCQB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756408091#wasThisHelpful","R17DM2KXHTCQB0","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At a time when all Big Apple news including the Mets never changes from the horrific Jeb wants Jason to observe the city’s questionable dealings from the sky.As Jason increases his flying hours, his best friend investigative journalist Adam Shaker looks into a scandal that seemingly includes Mayor Cohen and the Brooklyn borough president.  Soon Jason’s additional “unreported” (to authorities as required) duties takes him to the heart of Adam’s inquiry and both men to History Professor Alison Monroe.This is an excellent look back at NYC during the Mayor Beame deadlock years in which corruption, garbage, traffic, and on the verge of bankruptcy ruled the city.  In spite of the cast especially the thirty-something lead males being very interesting and fully developed and the suspense gripping; the collapsing city steals the show.

In Africa, Cuban mercenaries trap American “soldiers” with no hope of rescue as their CIA leaders write them off as expendable.  Suddenly a flying saucer lands near Captain Rick Galloway.  Accompanied by Corporal Art Mason, Rick meets three aliens, who offer him and his unit escape from certain death.  He and his men enter the ship that takes them to the moon.  Inside the vessel Rick meets Agzaral the human who explains that they have three choices: remain on the moon; become experiments; or accept the positions of alien delegated overseers of another planet’s sentient beings.“Clan and Crown”.  In his castle on Tran, Lord Galloway celebrates as his wife Tylara gives birth to their child Isobel when a caravan arrives.  Drantos Eqeta Ganton and his Companion Marrone greet the American expatriate travelers Ben Murphy and Lafferty Reznick, and their entourage.  Murphy explains that the south is collapsing due to floods, plague and civil war between Caesars Marselius and Flaminius.“Storms of Victory”.  Galloway and Mason overhear a commotion outside among the guards at a time when the human Shalnuksis pilot Les delivers supplies.  As a conference begins to discuss Galactic Confederation geo-politics at a time when a world war seems imminent; Mason and Marrone lead a search of the complex after finding the corpse of a murdered sentry.This omnibus reprints the three sensational Janissaries military-political science fiction thrillers as the overarching theme of transplanted humans from different eras and planets taking control of a backwater orb holds up superbly.

Following an off-planet preliminary analysis, she chooses the United States as her starting point due to this nation being the most technologically advanced on this orb.  Thus she learns English and descends towards the country’s center, Kansas.However, on her first solo mission, Tak miscalculates America’s radar system.  Knowing she has been detected, Tak flees to Poland where she meets international arms merchant Baron Von Limbach.  He mentors her on all things earthling; while she accompanies him on his newest paying (by a wealthy patron encouraged by a true believer East Indian woman) gig: returning the Dalai Lama to Tibet by liberating the nation from the Chinese annexation.  To achieve his objective Von Limbach hires a Kazakhstan scientist to customize Ebola that will only attack Han Chinese.  His efforts convince Tak that this world is ruthlessly deadly while the CIA and DOD plan to capture and question her using enhanced interrogation techniques; unaware that failure of her to return to her space ship means global destruction.Applying to terrorism and war by extrapolating the efforts to DNA-customize medicine yet also mindful of what happened with atomic energy; Brent Ayscough authors a fabulous cautionary science fiction in which the critical storyline comes across very plausible.  Adding depth to the thrilling plot is Tak’s world tour as she tastes, hears and sees some of the pluses on this strange violent planet in which war seems to be the prime conflict resolution technique.Harriet Klausner","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19KUUSGAM2HJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626943222#wasThisHelpful","R19KUUSGAM2HJE","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Twelve kings united and prayed to the Gods to save their urban home.  When these rulers succeeded in turning away the threat, they also became immortal.  Ever since they saved Sharakhai, the twelve, kept safe by chosen Silver Spears and Blade Maidens, have ruled with ruthless domination while living in ultra-posh conditions; at the same time keeping their groveling masses in abject poverty.When Ceda was a child, the monarchs executed her beloved mother by stringing her naked body upside down and carving an odd symbol and accusations on her skin.  Obsessed with revenge, now nineteen years old Ceda has become an accomplished pit gladiator searching for a royal weakness.  Her best friend Emre, also seeking ways to destroy the odious Kings, allies with heartless fanatic Macide who believes innocent blood must fall as collateral damage in order to dethrone the kings.  Emre also befriends fixated with rage Ramahd, who wants to kill Macide for murdering his wife and child in the name of freedom.The first sword and sorcery Song of the Shattered Sands fantasy is a fantastic thriller starring a wonderful avenging female gladiator.  Ceda makes the tale; especially her incredible flashbacks to her beloved mom, her friendship with Emre and a connection to the White Wolf.  The other viewpoint subplots are well-written, but pale next to Ceda.  Although the storyline starts slow as Bradley P. Beaulieu creates Sharakhai and introduces its key cast particularly the heroine, the various Kings, and the monarchs’ opponents (afraid to even whisper rebellion); but once set the novel accelerates into an action-packed opening epic.Harriet Klausner","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NW1A3MEE8QLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756409721#wasThisHelpful","R2NW1A3MEE8QLM","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, Daniel wants to grow his operation, but as an illegitimate has limited means (except his paternal family who he prefers not to beg for help) to reach the top social tier he needs to support his expansion.His diligent assistant Megan Talbot informs him that she must quit after only a few months on a job she loves due to her demanding father threatening to sell her horses if she fails to return to California and marry a man of their choice.  Daniel suggests a marriage of convenience that will give him a ticket to the elite through his wife and Megan a husband so that her parents cannot choose her mate in a forced marriage.  Although attracted to each other and share a common interest in horses, neither expected to fall in love; nor he risking his life to keep his wife safe from an assailant trying to kill her.The fourth Coltons of Oklahoma (see The Temptation of Dr. Colton by Karen Whiddon) is an engaging fresh contemporary that deftly uses the marriage of convenience theme between amiable protagonists though this premise typically is found in historical romances.  Although the viable death threat adds exhilarating suspense, the subplot feels unnecessary as the delightful love story of Daniel and Megan is what makes this a marvelous read.Harriet Klausner","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4YCO4QU7GIX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373279337#wasThisHelpful","R4YCO4QU7GIX2","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Thus when the final days can be counted on fingers, he leads what is left of the military and other loyal supporters to the German Alps to establish Germanica there.General Eisenhower and other ally leaders fear a Nazi retreat state that would begin efforts to form a Fourth Reich in an area as difficult to mount an attack as Switzerland is.  Meanwhile American military officer Scott Tanner, Czech refugee Lena Bobekova, and OSS operative Ernie Janek head to Germanica with a counter-scheme to destroy the last vestige of the Nazis before this evil can gain a foothold, fester and renew the war driven vision.This is an intriguing alternate historical that provides a mesmerizing look at the Nazi National Redoubt fallback position to establish a holding pattern nation similar geographically to neighboring Switzerland.

As Ryan’s soul heals, the Texas rancher and the Indiana nurse fall in love, but her stay is not Forever unless Jackson can persuade her otherwise.The latest Forever, Texas romance (see the Murphy brothers in Her Forever Cowboy and Cowboy For Hire) is a wonderful contemporary starring two amiable leads and a troubled, somewhat naive but healing “matchmaker”.  Although resentful John feels unnecessary to the plot except adding stress to already stressed out Debi, and Ryan’s emotional healing seems relatively too easy even with setbacks; readers will root for his continual improving mental health, and for The Cowboy and The Lady to make it forever.Harriet Klausner","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q0K1UQPEPUKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037375583X#wasThisHelpful","R2Q0K1UQPEPUKU","AFVQZQ8PW0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVQZQ8PW0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On the eve of World War II, the little known Battle of Khalkan Gol between the Soviet Union and the Imperial Empire of Japan was fought to a climax on August 20-31, 1939. Suffice to say the Japanese Army in Mongolia was decisively defeated by elite Siberian Soviet army units at Khalkan Gol and Lake Khasan led by Marshall Sergei Zhukov, later a Hero of the Soviet Union. This almost secret encounter involved a million soldiers and was kept quiet by both Russia and Japan. I have come to believe that more than likely this drubbing of the Japanese helped convince them to proceed with the Tanaka Plan or the Southern strategy for the conquest of the Far East and the Pacific, rather than the invasion of Siberia, where the Soviets still kept their best troops.After this defeat in Mongolia and other concerns -- among them, the needed vast supplies of oil and raw materials available in Southeast Asia, it stands to reason the Japanese Navy's arguments for the Southern naval strategy had prevailed over the Army's Northern Siberian military strategy. This explains why the Japanese chose to attack Pearl Harbor and invaded Southeast Asia, instead of attacking Siberia and the USSR, as Hitler and the German High Command urged them. Had the Japanese done this, they could have crushed the Russians between two fronts in 1941, avoiding the attack on Pearl Harbor, entrance of the U.S. into the War would have been delayed, or possibly, the U.S would have staid out of the conflict, increasing the chances of Axis Powers victory.But the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor. Now we know there were other factors, namely the Soviet spy and agent of influence, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Harry Dexter White, who was doing the bidding for Stalin and the Soviets, a traitor in the FDR administration.. To protect the Soviet Union from attack and divert the Japanese attack against the U.S. Harry Dexter White pushed the Japanese into a corner:  Japan, deficient and desperately needing raw materials and oil, resources crucial to its survival, was deliberately blocked access to them by the FDR administration ""war hawks,"" led by Harry Dexter White. In 1941 deprived of oil and vital resources, Japan was forced to go to war and manipulated to attack, not the Soviet Union but the U.S., preventing the USSR from being attacked and crushed on two fronts.This book is momentous and together with M.Stanton Evan's and Herbert Romerstein's bookStalin's Secret Agents: The Subversion of Roosevelt's Government fills a serious gap in historical knowledge that needed filling as to the events leading to World War II and the Cold War.  This book is essential reading and should be available in public libraries and institutions, as well as the personal library of historians of the Cold War, non-fiction espionage aficionados, and those who want to set the record straight about the FDR administration and the Cold War.

"This book was written by two experienced authors and recognized authorities on the Cold War. Evans is a veteran journalist and former broadcaster, as well as the author of Blacklisted by History , a biography of Senator Joseph McCarthy (2009), and other momentous books. Romerstein was the former head of the Office to Counter Soviet Disinformation at the U.S. Information Agency and Congressional staffer of the House Intelligence Committee. These two men have collaborated in writing a magnificent and shocking exposé that have been crying out for exposure — to inform, as well as to correct and augment the incomplete and distorted historic record, not to mention reveal the true moral standing of a number of Americans who betrayed the nation for a perverted and venal ideology based on lies.The importance of this book is that it not only exposes and documents the penetration of the government by full-fledged Soviet spies but also the subversion, high up in the FDR administration, of communist ""agents of influence"" subservient to Stalin and the USSR. This is a inimical tale of repeated betrayals that needed to be told well, and the authors of this book have done a magnificent job in telling it, writing in an enthralling narrative with crisp and succinct prose. Evans and Romerstein document how these ""agent of influence,"" which the West have always considered innocent ""idealists"" (although not so by the KGB, which knew them for what they were, valuable Soviet agents). These government officials did as much, if not more damage than full-fledged foreign spies, by overtly or covertly, influencing government policy from the highest levels of government. In the case of FDR, they were, as the book documents, operating under the aegis of the President himself. Indeed, FDR had surrounded himself and suffused the executive branch of government with communists, Soviet agents, and ""fellow travelers,"" who did untold damage to the nation and the world.Perhaps foremost among these Soviet agents was Presidential aide and FDR's friend and alter ego, Harry Hopkins, who given the enormity of his influence and power, have been glossed over as a Soviet agent and only reluctantly described heretofore as an ""unconscious agent.""(1)(2) Ideological and moral excuses have been concocted for Hopkins to be described as an ""unconscious agent [of Soviet influence],"" as not to tarnish the image of FDR, a four time, popular American president, who presided over World War II and the early signs of recovery from the Great Depression.The book delves in detail cataloging also the treasonous activities of Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Harry Dexter White; Executive Assistant to the President Lauchlin Currie; influential member of the Institute for Pacific Relations (IPR) Owen Lattimore; Treasury official Solomon Adler; State Department official Alger Hiss, Duncan Lee a Soviet spy in the Office of Strategic Services OSS (the precursor to the CIA during the War, which became ridden with communists and severely penetrated), and many others who did the bidding on behalf of Stalin and the Kremlin at the expense of their own country. For the most part these ""agents of influence"" were not publicly exposed or punished for their betrayal, some fled the country, others remain at their posts for years. Yet the mounting evidence of these men's treason has not been properly archived or published in history textbooks resulting in incomplete, distorted, and perverted history.It should be noted that the shocking revelations documented by Evans and Romerstein are consistent with the intelligence provided by Soviet defectors; disclosed in the Vassiliev papers and the Mitrokhin Archives; substantiated by the decrypted Venona transcripts; and much of it corroborated by citations in Congressional Committees.  Among the revelations in Stalin's Secret Agents I found most interesting were the following:1) How Japan, deficient and desperately needing raw materials and oil, resources crucial to its survival, was deliberately blocked access to them by the FDR administration ""war hawks,"" among them Harry Dexter White. In 1941 deprived of oil and vital resources, Japan was forced to go to war and manipulated to attack, not the Soviet Union but the U.S., preventing the USSR from being attacked and crushed on two fronts. Instead, the Imperial Empire of Japan massed and marched its armies southward into Southeast Asia and its air force against the U.S. and Pearl Harbor, sparing the Soviet Union and propelling America into war against the Axis Powers.2) How some of these agents of influence in the White House, State, and Treasury Departments in the FDR administration, including such notables as Harry Hopkins, Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, and others militated to successfully allow Stalin to seize and enslave parts of Central Europe and all of the people of Eastern Europe,  among them Czechoslovakia and Poland, the very same countries for which France and England had gone to war against Nazi Germany, starting World War II. These same agents of influence, for extra measure, doomed efforts of anti-communist underground forces, not only in Poland but also in Yugoslavia, where anticommunist leader Draga Mihailovich was betrayed to the communists forced headed by Tito and shamefully executed.3) How during World War II, the U.S policy toward Stalin and the USSR was dictated by Harry Hopkins, who reminiscent of the relationship of Woodrow Wilson and Colonel Mandell House during World War I, lived in the White House during 1941-1944, as if he were a member of the Roosevelt family. Unfortunately, Harry Hopkins summed up the policy toward the Soviet Union as ""Russia... must be given every assistance and every effort must be made to obtain her friendship.""(3) This was seconded by FDR, ""I think that if I give him [Stalin] everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, nobles oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work for world democracy and peace.""(4) To make himself more appealing to Stalin, FDR even began to distance himself from Winston Churchill, even making tasteless jokes at Churchill's expense and making common cause with Stalin at every turn, the fate of million of people depending on this death serious farce.4) How Nationalist leader Shang Kai-shek was deliberately calumniated, abandoned, and betrayed, and China was turned over to the communist and Mao Tse-tung by the agents of influence, particularly Owen Lattimore, Solomon Adler, Harry Dexter White, and the diplomat and fellow traveler John Stewart Service. These men spread disinformation about alleged venal conditions in the Nationalist government, calumniated Chiang Kai-Shek, and praised Mao-Tse tung. Information from defectors and the Venona files verifies what Evans and Romerstein  document, namely that a concerted campaign of disinformation was created and propagated by these agents of influence to tilt American opinion away from Chiang and the American government from rendering the needed assistance to the Nationalists, while helping Mao seize control of China.These are but four among many other interesting revelations that await the interested reader. I categorically recommend this fascinating book but warn those who deeply care about this nation that if they are hypertensive, Stalin's Secret Agents may not be salubrious to their blood pressure. This book is essential reading and should be available in public libraries and institutions, as well as the personal library of historians of the Cold War, non-fiction espionage aficionados, and those who want to set the record straight about the FDR administration and the Cold War.

"John Quincy Adams (2012) by Harlow Giles Unger is a well written and well-researched book that brings to light the sixth president of the United States, and the only son of a Founding Father to become president — John Quincy Adams. The Adams family was not only to give birth to several American statesmen, but also men of letters, diplomats, politicians, historians, and famous Americans — among them the Harvard educator Charles Francis Adams (1807-1886) and his sons, the novelist Henry Adams (1838-1918), and the historian Charles Francis Adams II (1835-1915).After reading Unger's previously published book about James Monroe (2009), I reset Monroe in a higher pedestal from that in which I had previously placed him, from my knowledge of his life and American history, and from having read W.P. Creeson's  masterpiece, ""James Monroe"" (1946). I was disposed to believe the same about ""John Quincy Adams."" But that was not to be the case. This was not due to the author's abilities as a writer or historian; Unger did a magnificent job as a biographer in this book. The problem was I learned more about John Quincy Adams that I previously did not know, and this knowledge, regrettably, has made me remove him from the pedestal in which he had rested in my cerebral repository. Unger admires John Quincy very much and this comes through the pages of his book, but in my case it had the opposite effect from what the author intended.I knew John Quincy was a child prodigy, who became a master diplomat, a great intellectual, a famous scholar, while always remaining a highly religious man and a dutiful son. I knew he had followed his father's footsteps in politics becoming a devote public servant, serving as skilled translator and diplomat in Russia and the rest of Europe, as early as a teenager, in the successive administrations of Presidents George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. I was cognizant of his role in helping negotiate and draft the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812, as the leading U.S. representative in the diplomatic mission. I was aware of his fabulously successful ministration of foreign affairs as Secretary of State for President James Monroe; his assistance in the formulation of the Monroe Doctrine and in negotiating the borders of the U.S.-Canadian frontier with the British. I was aware of his reaching the U.S presidency in 1824, with great gratification for his father, one of the nation's most esteemed founder, who was still alive at the time.  I also knew John Quincy was not an effective president, and had been defeated on his re-election bid in 1828 by Andrew Jackson, ""Old Hickory"" and the hero of New Orleans in the War of 1812. Jackson defeated by John Quincy in the House of Representatives at his first bid for the presidency had created a new opposition, the Democratic Party. I also knew that in his old age, as a dedicated and principled constitutionalist, John Quincy had successfully defended the band of 36 African slaves, who had been kidnapped by slave traders in the ship Amistad; they had mutinied and killed their oppressors, and had thus been put on trial in the U.S., where they had landed; their case had gone all the way to the Supreme Court, and they had been acquitted by the pleading and eloquent oratory of John Quincy, their savior.This book confirms my recollections and elaborates on this knowledge with engaging prose and much enthusiasm, as Unger describes the ascending and long career of John Quincy Adams in public service. What I did not know was the extent to which John Quincy Adams had contributed to the acrimony between North and South on the issue of the protective tariffs, sectionalism, and slavery; and how he had helped push the country to civil war in the two preceding decades, despite his contention he was a representative of the entire nation and not a political party. These are not points Unger points out or emphasizes to his readers, or that he uses to criticize his hero;  they are simply facts that jump out at the reader from the engaging narrative, as divisions between North and South developed in the new nation.We must note that abolition of slavery was not an issue John Quincy tackled as U.S. President, but that he promoted only after he left the presidency and was elected U.S. Representative from Quincy, Massachusetts, when he could escape responsibility for his divisive and fierce oratory. We all know, as President Harry Truman a century later stressed, that the buck stops with the president. John Quincy's abolitionist spirit, then, only expressed itself when he was a maverick Congressman, but not earlier when he was the Chief Executive. In fact his Presidency was noted for his inactivity, except for his intransigent protective tariffs that promoted Northern manufacturing interest and hurt the agricultural, cotton-producing South, and his frequent nude swimming in the Potomac, one day nearly drowning to his chagrin and embarrassment.Creating divisiveness and sectionalism because of John Quincy's newly espoused hatred of slavery and abolitionism is in extreme contrast to the stance of other American patriots who loved the Union enough to attempt to preserve it at the expense of their personal beliefs or party affiliations. I refer to Henry Clay (1777-1852, ""The Great Compromiser,"" despite holding contradictory views on slavery), Daniel Webster (1782-1852; who hated and fought against slavery), and Stephen A. Douglas (1813-1861; ""The Little Giant,"" who dies untimely of typhoid fever on the eve of the war) — all of whom did everything within their political power to avoid the bloody civil war that arouse out of the contentious issues of high protective tariffs, slavery, and the right to secede. In the service of their country and seeking conciliation and avoiding civil war, Henry Clay authored the compromise of 1850; followed by Stephen Douglas drafting the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. For these men loyalty to the Union and compromise transcended personal beliefs and ideals, but not for the militant abolitionist, ""the Sage of Quincy,"" as he was referred by his Northern admirers.High tariffs, the call for immediate abolition of slavery, and the right of secession were the same tinder box issues that produced the intense divisiveness and acrimony promoted by John Quincy in his incendiary speeches in the House and that plunged the nation a few years later into the bloody Civil War. In his fratricidal and regional conflict 750,000 young soldiers would later perish (the historian John Huddleston estimation is ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40), as well as an undetermined number of civilians. The Civil War exacted the bloodiest and greatest toll of American lives in U.S. history. (Unger is way off the mark in this book, citing an incredibly low and misleading figure of ""more than 250,000.""(1)For a man who repeatedly stated he represented the whole nation and not a section of the country and wanted the preservation of the Union, we find the following puzzling contradictions. On his first day in the House of Representative, John Quincy, started the divisive debate on slavery, knowing as he predicted, that slavery, piled upon the related issues of high protective tariffs and secession, would lead to bitter acrimony and eventually bloody Civil War.(2)John Quincy fought against and blocked appeals of Texas to join the United States because of his determination not to permit slave or possible slave states into the Union, although he had favored Manifest Destiny and Western expansion with extensive ""internal improvements"" throughout the nation only a few years earlier.John Quincy, as representative from Massachusetts, had supported the Andrew Jackson administration and the Democrats in their opposition to South Carolina's Nullification Ordinance, but he immediately turned around and opposed reconciliation when the Jacksonian Democrats offered an olive branch to the southern agricultural states by eliminating the economically crushing high protective tariffs.(3)John Quincy opposed the South Carolina's right to Secede resolutions, and he went on to support Jackson, ""the barbarian,"" when the president told the delegates from South Carolina, ""disunion is treason,"" threatened armed force and enforcement of Jackson's ""Force Bill""(3). Not too long afterward, John Quincy made a convenient political volte face to read and support in the floor of the House, the Haverhill anti-slavery Petition from Massachusetts calling for disunion! When another Congressman, young Thomas Marshall of Kentucky, a nephew of the deceased Chief Justice John Marshall, called John Quincy's reading of the petition ""high treason,"" John Quincy lambasted him, and all but sent the congressman scurrying out of the U.S. House and out of politics altogether!(4)Black Slavery was wrong (equally wrong as the forgotten but generally accepted white [universal] slavery in ancient times) a blot on the United States, but given what we know of history and economics, slavery would have wither in the vine, as it did everywhere else, in Great Britain, Spain, and France and their colonies, Mexico, Brazil, Cuba, Guadeloupe etc. Only in backward Haiti did slavery end in a blood bath in which all whites indiscriminately were massacred. Most of Latin America, former colonies of Spain and Portugal, had black slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries, and not one of those countries required a bloody civil war to end it. Although in Cuba an unsuccessful war for independence had been fought between 1866 and 1876, the island abolished slavery peacefully in 1886. Brazil the largest country in South America with a large black and mixed-race population ended slavery in 1888 — and also without a war.""(5)And yet, John Quincy divining the future affirmed, ""a dissolution of the Union for the cause of slavery would be followed by... a war between the two severed portions of the Union. It seems to me that its result must be the extirpation of slavery from this whole continent and desolating as this course of events must be, so glorious would be its final issue, that, as God should judge me, I dare not say that it is not to be desired.""(6)We can not help liking John Quincy Adams as a child prodigy who traveled around the world, already serving his country in 1781 at the tender age of 15 years, going as far as Saint Petersburg, Russia, as translator and secretary to Francis Dana. We continue to cheer John Quincy, as he ascends the diplomatic, government, and public service ladder, up to the time he enters the White House in 1824, presumably via the ""Corrupt Bargain"" with Henry Clay, as Old Hickory called it. I think this accusation is baseless, and I don't blame him or Clay for aligning with each other; it was an absolutely logical but ultimately disastrous political alliance!But after that the observant reader may begin questioning John Quincy's aloof and out-of-touch, aristocratic manners as U.S. President.  He was understandably defeated for a second term. And then, returning to Washington with a vengeance as U.S. Congressman from Quincy, unprejudiced minds may question his obsessive preoccupation with politics at the expense of his family, particularly his wife Louisa, who without a doubt he neglected, as he did two of his grown but unattended children dying of alcoholism. (Unger blames inheritance from his grandmother's side for the malady; I grant that, but also add the lack of genuine interest in his family, and utter neglect, Unger's assertions notwithstanding.) Although Unger gives short shrift to this, I believe John Quincy's lack of concern and genuine warmth for his wife Louisa is appalling. His father, John Adams (to whom John Quincy was attentive), despite his busy existence and his long absences, remained tender and attentive to Abigail throughout their long lives.For John Quincy, while serving in the House of Representatives in his latter years,  the use of his time in throwing oratorical and incendiary bombs to the hated South in the floor of the capitol was more important. We wonder if his bitter defeat in his re-election Presidential bid in 1828 embittered him politically to foster hatred of that section of the country which had rejected him! And it was not only the slavery issue, but also high tariffs and political intransigence, which he used without mercy against the South to push Southern states over the edge. After reading this biography, I could not help liking John Quincy Adams a bit less than I used to, and considerably less than his father, John Adams, a more towering figure in my judgment. Although far from being stated as such by Unger in this book, John Quincy created as much disharmony between North and South, as John Adams strove to build harmony in creating a new Nation in 1776. It would take a catastrophic civil war to restore the Union and fill the chasm that John Quincy helped to foment in the 1830s and 1840s. This is a book worth reading, as long as we recognize some slight shortcomings, such as the fact that Unger should have pointed out to the reader the less attractive features and shortcomings of his subject, ""warts and all, "" as much as he underscored and applauded the achievements of John Quincy Adams. This book is recommended for those interested in American history and wish to learn more about John Quincy Adams, the only son of a Founding Father to become President of the United States.References1) Unger, WG.

"""The Last Founding Father — James Monroe and a Nation's Call to Greatness"" by Harlow Giles Unger (2009) is a well written and eloquently narrated book that goes a long way to accomplish what it set out to do — to make James Monroe, not only the last Founding Father, but also the greatest of the founders, second only to George Washington.This tome then fulfills in many ways what various eminent authors have set out to do for the most illustrious of the Founding Fathers, to place them on the pedestals where they belong, but from where they have been gradually demoted by the neglect of many academic institutions of higher learning, not to mention, the public education system. I refer to the following masterful biographies: Ralph Ketcham's  ""James Madison"" (1971); Willard Sterne Randall's ""Alexander Hamilton: A Life"" (2003); David McCullough's ""John Adams"" (2001); and the forgotten masterpiece, W.P. Creeson's ""James Monroe"" (1946), among several others. These biographies enshrine the notable careers of the founders, as men of flesh and blood, who without vacillation, pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor for the fledging nation. This book, though, is a bit more elementary and easier to read for the initiate, less detailed, and although certainly more obsequious and idolizing of its subject than the preceding volumes, it is not slavishly to the point of detracting. Unger has certainly fallen in love with James Monroe, singing his praises far and wide, but not to the point of satiety.Unger's James Monroe succeeds in giving credit to James Monroe: In his heroic participation in the American War of Independence under George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette including such battles as Monmouth, Brandywine and Trenton; his trying diplomatic ministerial missions to France and England in negotiating peace with those nations under Presidents George Washington and John Adams; his accomplishing the negotiation of the Louisiana Purchase with Napoleon under President Thomas Jefferson, resulting in the doubling of the size of the United States with the acquisition of another nearly one million square miles of territory at the bargain price of 4 cents an acre (the selling price of the U.S. to settlers being $2 an acre at the time); his assumption of critical leadership during the War of 1812, as Secretary of State and acting Secretary of War under President James Madison; his skilled maneuvering of Spain to cede Florida to the United States, using fine diplomatic verbiage as the carrot and General Andrew Jackson as the stick as the fifth U.S. President; his Chief Executive pronouncement of the Monroe Doctrine, barring the European powers from further colonization in the Western Hemisphere; and his ushering in of a new era of peace and prosperity for the nation, which has been properly entitled, ""The Era of Good Feelings,"" as a  tremendously successful president. We cannot help but to like James Monroe and place him back on his pedestal, although some of us may variously continue to give ""second place"" to other founders, such as Jefferson, Hamilton or Madison. I recommend this book to all readers interested in American history and/or well-researched and written biographies of great Americans of ages past.The reviewer Dr. Miguel Faria is a medical historian, and an Associate Editor in Chief and World Affairs Editor of Surgical Neurology International (SNI).

"The Knight Templar (The Complete Series) is a spectacular epic based on the Crusades trilogy written by Swedish author and journalist, Jan Guillou. It features the fictional character, Arn Magnusson, a young Swedish nobleman, who becomes a Knight Templar as penance for having had a love affair with the maiden Cecilia. Cecilia is in turn sequestered in a monastery for twenty years of long penance, throughout which she remains loyal and devoted to Arn.During this time, Arn becomes a great warrior in the Holy Land, participating in many historical events with true historical characters. The complete series, a 6-part DVD miniseries, is a fabulous, epic saga masterpiece. The time sequence spans approximately the same time as ""The Kingdom of Heaven"" film, which I have also reviewed. This is a tumultuous period after the Second Crusade, encompassing the fall of Jerusalem to the Saracens, and up to the commencement of the Third Crusade.After Arn returns to his homeland in Gotaland, Sweden, he is forced to defend his clan against the contentions of a rival to the Swedish throne, a rival king who is supported by the Danish monarchy. A civil war ensues....The DVD cover describes the plot accurately and succinctly: ""In a land of brave knights, powerful queens and treacherous kings, Arn Magnusson, a skilled swordsman, is sent off to war as a Knight Templar as a penance for his sins. Separated from his love true love by a jealous nobleman, Arn must battle a cruel and violent world to survive."" I recommend this series to adventure as well as  fans of romance with historical inclinations.Miguel A.

"The same magnificent director, Ridley Scott, who gave us Gladiator, has now given us another epic, historic film, ""a thrilling, action packed, epic of honor, passion, and courage."" Orlando Bloom plays the young Crusader, a Christian knight, who fights to preserve the ""kingdom of heaven,"" the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, from the onslaught of the Mamluk and Saracen armies led by the chivalrous Moslem knight, Saladin (1137-1193), Sultan of Egypt.The action in this movie takes place from about 1181-1187 in and around Jerusalem in the perilous period between the Second (1144-1150) and Third (1189-1192) Crusades. The hero of this saga is Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom), a true historic figure. The character of Balian's father, Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), is a composite of Godfrey of Bouillon (1058-1100; leader of the First Crusade and brother of Baldwin I, founder of the dynasty of Latin kings of Jerusalem) and his real father, Barisan of Ibelin. In the earlier part of this movie, the King of Jerusalem is Baldwin IV, a just ruler but a leper who died at the young age of 24. He is succeeded by Guy de Lusignan who is married to Sybilla, the sister of Baldwin IV. All of these characters are true historic figures, who do in the film as they largely did in history. The instigator of much of the trouble in this movie as well as in history is Reynald de Chautillon, a savage knight bent on war for profit and who attacks Moslem caravans with impunity. Reynald's insults and bellicosity become the primary reasons (or pretext) for Saladin to wage total war against the Kingdom of Jerusalem.Good counselors to King Baldwin IV are Balian and Tiberias (Jeremy Irons), who do all they can to prevent war and preserve the ""kingdom of heaven."" The character of Tiberias is based on the historic ruler, Raymond III of Tripoli (and allied Latin kingdom). The Christians are vastly outnumbered and led by a few hundred knights, among them the monastic orders of the Hospitalers and Templars. The Moslem armies number in the thousands and include Saracen warriors as well as the dreaded Mamluks. Following Baldwin IV's death from leprosy, Guy de Lusignan assumes power and leads the Christian armies in the disastrous Battle of Hattin. The fate of the kingdom of heaven is sealed. Nevertheless, in 1187, Balian leads a heroic defense of the holy city of Jerusalem, knighting servants and peasants to increase the morale of the people in the besieged city. He helped man the fortifications and directed the city's defenses.The final battle for Jerusalem is a spellbinding spectacle and is accurately portrayed. Archers on the walls and towers shooting their deadly arrows at the Saracens storming the walls and trying to breach the fortifications; trebuchets launching their flaming missiles; ""Greek fire"" poured down and catapulted from the towers; ""scorpion"" missiles fired to and fro with deadly accuracy; slashing of scimitars and Damascene daggers; are all part of the battlefield extravaganza that is the siege and battle of Jerusalem.Who wins? Who survives? You'll have to watch the movie! Let us just say that as the movie ends, the Third Crusade — led by Richard I, the ""Lion-Heart,"" King of England (1189-1199); Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor; and Philip II, King of France — was in the making.   This epic movie is highly recommended with 5 well-deserved stars!  Dr. Miguel Faria is a medical historian, and an Associate Editor in Chief and a World Affairs Editor of Surgical Neurology International (SNI).

"This is another masterful, epic historic novel by Gore Vidal, taking place about the time the U.S. was becoming a prosperous nation and world power under William McKinley. In this tome, the descendants of Charlie Schuyler of 1876 continue the American saga of expansion and empire-building and the promotion of free-market capitalism, amidst the growth of influential periodicals, as well as tendentious, mass-produced “yellow journalism.” Some of main characters in this novel are historic and they come out vividly alive out of the pages of this novel. Rugged individualism, particularly cultivated in the West, goes hand in glove with American refinement in the East. We meet and are delighted with the dialogue and actions of such historic figures as Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt; William Jennings Bryan and William Randolph Hearst; the mysterious ""Five Hearts"": John Hay and his wife, Henry Adams and his wife, and the strange and elusive geologist Clarence King; and then there is the novelist and intellectual, Henry James, the dear friend of the Five Hearts. Even the Astors and the Vanderbilts come into the picture. The final fictitious but heated, vocal, personal and political exchange between William Randolph Hearst, the inventor of ""yellow journalism,"" and Teddy Roosevelt, the maverick Republican President, is a memorable encounter and probably a fairly accurate representation of what may have transpired (in a conversation that actually took place), as reflected in the characters of two of the men who dominated this exciting era.The reviewer Dr. Miguel Faria is a medical historian, and an Associate Editor in Chief and World Affairs Editor of Surgical Neurology International (SNI).

"This is an absorbing novel with two of the most endearing characters in American fiction, Mr. Charlie Schuyler and his beautiful daughter, Emma. We learn a lot about newspaper editors, publishers, and politicians of the time in this novel. One must keep in mind while most of the episodes relating to historic persons and events are nonfiction, the main characters are not. Moreover, the politics of the time are viewed from the perspective and prism of a very politically liberal writer, who frequently assumes a very controversial persona, and at times Vidal cannot completely keep his politics from influencing the character and coloring the perception of the fascinating history he writes.For example, Vidal views conservative and traditionalist America during this period through his liberal political prism, detecting only corruption and cynicism in American politics and ignoring her greatness. He fails to see a vibrant, expanding nation, the great American Republic that she has become, not only fulfilling the expansion of Manifest Destiny, but also setting ablaze a path for the pursuit of freedom, not only in America but also throughout the globe, even if for the rest of the world, freedom, for a century or longer, would remain only a cherished idea. Vidal’s 1876, nevertheless, is a highly entertaining and captivating read. As a literary piece, this historic novel with its enthralling, even lovable characters, fictional and otherwise, is highly recommended if considered with this friendly caveats.Dr. Miguel Faria the reviewer is a medical historian, and an Associate Editor in Chief and World Affairs Editor of Surgical Neurology International (SNI).

"This is truly a magnificent and priceless leather edition with 22-karat gold embossing of cover and spine, gild edges on all page surfaces and raised spine. As such this tome is immensely fit to contain within its covers a historic novel of epic proportions. This is without a doubt absolutely one of the best books I have ever read and possess in my library. The book is as described by the Franklin Library publishers. As far as the narrative, although categorized properly as a historic novel, this tome is for the most part an accurate portrayal of the life and times of Roman Emperor Julian II, surnamed ""the Apostate"" to some, ""the Philosopher"" to others. A nephew of Constantine the Great, Julian was raised a Christian, but as a philosophy student in Athens, he studied NeoPlatonism and was initiated in the secret rites of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Thus, in religious devotion, Julian gradually reverted to the ancient rites of paganism and rejected Christianity. Emperor Constantius II, needing a loyal general in the Western provinces, Julian was ordered by the Emperor to leave Athens, where he was studying, become a commander, field armies, and secure the frontier against barbarian invaders. Victorious, time and again, and devoted to his legions, Julian was proclaimed ""Imperator"" by his troops, and upon the death of his cousin, Constantius, he assumed the purple.The portrayal of Julian by Vidal is that of a scholarly, serious and studious young man, later a very competent general, and finally a humane and conscientious ruler. As emperor, Julian tried to turn back the clock, debated with theologians, wrote treatises against Christianity, and attempted unsuccessfully to revert the Roman state to paganism. Most dramatic and mesmerizing, though, is Julian's ill-fated invasion of the Sassanian (Persian) Empire against King Shapur II in A.D. 363, a trying and desperate campaign in which Julian lost his life under mysterious circumstances. Controversial is Gore Vidal's thesis that Julian's death was the result of a conspiracy involving his Christian generals, including the future Emperors Jovian and Valentinian I. This novel is recommended to history buffs, scholars of antiquity, as well as to writing initiates and even published authors, as an instructive literary masterpiece.Miguel A.

"The State by Franz Oppenheimer (1864-1943) was recommended to me by libertarian friends years ago, but now I suspect some of them did not actually read the book, but only passages about it.They recommended it to me as a Libertarian classic of political science. But in my opinion, Oppenheimer's book, to my consternation, turned out to be a Hegelian-Marxian treatise on the theoretical formation and development of the State based on the subjugation, conquest, and the endless ""class contest"" of one class of citizens over another.I have read Our Enemy, the State (1935) by ""philosophic anarchist,"" Albert Jay Nock (1870-1945), a true libertarian classic, which was indeed influenced by Oppenheimer's book, and by The Law (1850) by French Republican statesman, Frederic Bastiat (1801-1850), a true classical liberal thinker, who today would be considered, correctly, a conservative. These two latter books are more concise and apropos to the immediate subject under study, namely the State and how it functions today using coercion and monopoly of force to subjugate the individual to the collective. This is not the gist of the political philosophy I found in Oppenheimer's book. To the contrary, let me continue.Oppenheimer's The State (1914), allows us to see the political spectrum, as I and others have described it*, as a horseshoe with a very narrow gap with the extremes almost touching between the anarchistic Right (no government to libertarianism and Ayn Rand's Objectivism) and the collectivist Left (i.e., socialism and fascism to communism and the total state). The little gap is the state of Anarchic-tyranny. Oppenheimer blurs the distinctions in propounding the creation and development of the state based on class warfare (""class contest""), the endless exploitation of one economic class by another using the ""political means"" (robbery), or using Marxian jargon and arguments. We are left with his optimistic forecast that the ""economic means,"" i.e., peaceful exchange of goods and services, will ultimately come to pass when the beneficent State triumphs, conquers all, and ultimately creates a ""freemen's citizenship,"" melting away! With good reason, Oppenheimer did not call himself an anarchist or libertarian, but a liberal-socialist!This is small book, and the first 55 pages are Introductions and the author's Preface. The book itself is 130 pages, plus notes and index. The book, though, presents surreptitiously the dilemma of the German sociologists, anthropologists, and proponents of Hegelian dialectics of the late 19th and early 20th century about the philosophy of history. These scholars seem to want it both ways: They yearn for political and economic freedom, even anarchism,  while at the same time espousing for socialism, wealth redistribution, and equality of outcome. One cannot have it both ways and then called themselves freedom philosophers! Torture the terms and concepts as much as we will, libertarian freedom and economic equality are mutually exclusive terms. Despite a beautiful thesis on the creation and conception of the State, Oppenheimer skirts by this looming contradiction. Even though he wrote this treatise in 1914, he did not even foresee the horrors of World War I or World War II, but presaged only a contradictory economic equality and liberal-social utopia, when in fact war and devastation, not to mention fascism and communism, were just over the horizon!As to the contents of this book, they have been discussed here at length by another reviewer, much more sympathetic, and I have no major disagreements with his summary, only interpretation. So let me conclude by pointing out that Oppenheimer also did not foresee that the upper ""ruling classes"" would not be using the State to rob the middle class of the fruits of their labors in order to dispense those fruits to others, and create a dependent underclass, now the idealized, empowered proletariat, in exchange for the acquisition and consolidation of power, as we have seen not only institutionalized as legal plunder in Western Europe but also in the United States of America.Frederic Bastiat, although writing a half century earlier, foresaw and predicted the triumph of the State if unrestrained by the (natural) Law, that our own Founders crystallized as the rights to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of occupation, health and happiness. I recommend Albert Jay Nock's and Frederic Bastiat's true gems of classic liberalism without any reservation for the popular reader and the initiates. But I reserve Oppenheimer's The State only for those who already have at least some knowledge of political philosophy with the formal acquaintance of the writings of Our Founders as well as the instructive little book The Law of Frederic Bastiat, on the one hand, and Karl Marx's The Communist Manifesto (1848) on the other. This is necessary to prevent the initiate from getting bogged down in the sociological and economic morass of uncertain political philosophy.*see Faria, M, The Political Spectrum (Part I): The Totalitarian Left from Communism to Social Democracy; (Part III): The Extreme Right: Anarchism; haciendapublishing (2011).Miguel A.

"""Reilly: Ace of Spies is the thrilling, suspenseful dramatization of the real-life adventures of Agent ST-1, aka Sidney Reilly, the inspiration behind Ian Fleming's James Bond. Shot in glorious period detail, one heart-pulsing mission after another captures the arc of Reilly's brilliant career. From stealing top-secret Russian oil information to a near overthrow of the Bolshevik Revolution to his final capture by Stalin's forces in 1918, Reilly's exploits are at times so daring and reckless it's hard to believe it's history and not fiction.""I cannot agree more with this tantalizing synopsis printed on the DVD back cover!British author Robin Bruce Lockhart (born 1920), whose book this miniseries is based upon, was the son of the British diplomat and spymaster, Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart (1887-1970), a personal friend of Sidney Reilly and a participant in some of the intrigues and espionage in the Kremlin during the early days of the Russian Revolution. The British agents, Boris Savinkov, Sidney Reilly and Robert Bruce Lockhart, were trying to get Lenin and the Russian government to renounce the humiliating Russian-German peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 3, 1918) and entice the Bolsheviks to rejoin the war against Germany. When this did not happen, they were to attempt to overthrow the Bolsheviks!Robin Bruce Lockhart's book, Ace of Spies, was published in 1967. The television miniseries ""Reilly: Ace of Spies,"" written by Troy Kennedy-Martin and starring the New Zealand superstar, Sam Neill, aired in 1983, recounting the British super-spy Sidney Reilly's saga in graphic, cinematographic detail. Lockhart's book was then republished in 1984 as Reilly: Ace of Spies.In 2005, A&E released the miniseries' 12 original episodes in a 4-disc DVD format (approx. 10 hours, 30 minutes, plus extras). The collector's set includes a documentary, ""Life of Reilly: The Super Spy,"" that narrates the true facts of the case and fills in some biographical and historic gaps. For example, what were the real circumstances surrounding Sidney Reilly's disappearance in Russia in the autumn of 1925, and the extent of his knowledge regarding the Trust organization?Had Reilly gone to Russia to expose the Trust organization as a ""false flag"" operation and to avenge his friend Boris Savinkov? Or like Savinkov, had Reilly fallen into an incredibly unsuspecting trap, under the spell and deception of the infamous false ""monarchist"" Trust operation, which was, in fact, a counter-intelligence organization created by Feliks Dzerzhinsky and the Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka, precisely to lure White Russians and other ""enemies of the revolution"" back to Russia for their arrest and extermination?The informative documentary clarifies any discrepancies in the necessarily dramatized and romanticized miniseries, viz-a-viz the harsh realities of what transpired.The miniseries, ""Reilly: Ace of Spies"" is a superb historic epic to which I ascribe a 5-star rating for its excellent cinematographic adaptation and dramatization of history, so conveniently accompanied by its concluding documentary, as described. I wholeheartedly recommend this collector miniseries for your DVD library!Miguel A.

"I was not going to write a review of this interesting documentary because another reviewer ""Mark"" had already done an excellent review, but seeing that two persons have been so critical of his review, I have decided to enter the fray. I should know something of this topic, not only as an area of my own historic expertise, but also as one my favorite uncles was conscripted in the Cuban army and was a participant in this Cuban adventure, serving honorably in Angola.This documentary should have been entitled Cuba- African adventurism and combat by proxy in the superpower conflict during the cold war.This is a well-done but terribly biased documentary that glorifies communist Cuba and her heroes in the repressive pantheon of the workers' paradise. Part 1 of this documentary relates to the Congo and the war for independence from Belgium. Then it proceeds with the struggle for power between communist Patrice Lumumba, who is idolized, and his successor, Laurent Kabila, against (Joseph) Mobutu Sese Seko (1930-1997), who eventually won and ruled with an iron hand as a socialist dictator.Then Che Guevara enters the picture in this Congolese civil war and despite a hero-worship tribute treatment of this communist icon, the producers are forced to admit that Che's misadventure was a disastrous and colossal failure. We are not told that, if there was a real communist hero, it was General Arnaldo Ochoa, who rescued Che from the claws of his enemies in 1965, when, while in full retreat the Argentinean got lost and nearly perished trying to reach Lake Tanganyika, his desperate escape route. General Ochoa, who later became a potential political opponent of Fidel Castro, was accused of drug smuggling and shot in Cuba as a scapegoat after a kangaroo trial in 1989.Token Americans are used to give the documentary a semblance of balances- namely CIA operatives, such as Larry Devlin, who must admit to his cloak and dagger operations, etc. But the glorification of the war against neocolonialism and the exaltation of communist heroes, both Cuban and African-- not just the big fish like Lumumba and Che Guevara, but also smaller, life-size heroes, such as Victor Dreke and Harry Villegas, assistants to Che Guevara who actually do some of the narration. This communist glorification is all pervasive in the documentary.It is highly ironic (although the producers failed to see the irony) that when the Cuban revolutionaries entered the Congo, Victor Dreke, a black Cuban was given the nom de guerre ""Moya,"" and the Congolese were told that he was the supreme ""Commander of the Congo Mission."" They were astounded and in awe because ""Moya"" was black and ranked higher than the two white Cubans (of course it was a lie, one of the two whites was Che, nom de guerre, ""Tatu""!) After Che's identity was ascertained, the astonishment pass unnoticed. Che was then worshiped as a demigod and they were afraid for his safety and that ""something"" might happened to him. Nothing was said of the brutality of his African comrades, tribal warfare, to the point that Che himself was revolted by their African confreres' barbarism.Part 2 deals Cuba's major involvement in the collapse of the Portuguese African colonies in Angola and Mozambique. Nothing is said of the major role played by the left-wing Portuguese military junta which actually was the biggest player in that collapse. Withdrawal of colonial troops  from the Portuguese colonies by the sympathetic, left-wing junta facilitated the work of the African national liberation movements in Cabo Verde, Mozambique, and Angola in 1975. Selective omissions like this favoring the leftist revisionism, unfortunately haunt this documentary.I also agree with ""Mark"" that in the Angola war, the communist MPLA were treated as heroes, while the U.S.-supported UNITA fighters were insufficiently covered, intimating only that they were U.S. puppets! You would never know that Dr Jonas Savimbi was the greatest guerrilla and military leader in both that war, as well as the war for independence of Angola, nor that he was assassinated in 2002 still fighting!I am also in accord with this reviewer about the venial situation of the Angolan communist regime and Western oil companies propping up the corrupt regime and accepting protection from the Cuban army in the oil fields. This is not discussed, I suppose, because it would taint the revolutionary image of Agostinho Neto, head of the MPLA and later communist dictator of Angola.In short, this documentary was well-researched, had good footage, but it was tremendously one-sided, exalting the heroes of the communist pantheon, at times even omitting inconvenient facts that would oppose the leftist perspective of the producers. Finally the documentary failed to tell the viewers the corruption (Angola), depredation (Mozambique) and even genocidal perversity (Ethiopia, the Derg, and Mengistu Haile Marian) that the Cuban communist troops, the Soviets, and African socialism- left in their wake. You will not see the atrocities of African communists in this documentary only exaltation of Cuba's adventurism in Africa during the cold war. By all means watch it but only after the viewer has done some reading on this topic, so that he or she is prepare to separate the wheat from the chaff.Dr. Miguel A.

"This expose of Cuba's health care system in general and specifically the Dengue Fever epidemic that afflicted Cuba in the late 1990s was written by Dr Mendoza with a feminist writer and cultural critic, Ileana Fuentes, and published by the Center for a Free Cuba in Washington, D.C., ""¡Dengue!"" is a must-read tome, a concise tome and illustrated to boot!We learn from Dr. Mendoza that Cuba's ""free"" socialized system of medical care has been in shambles, a veritable disaster, a disgraceful tragic regression from the once advanced medical care system of the 1950s in the pre-Castro years.The book begins with Dr. Mendoza's dramatic arrest at his home in his native city of Santiago de Cuba, the country's second-largest city, located on the easternmost portion of the island and home of the Sierra Maestra mountains, where Fidel Castro began the Revolution in 1956.Dr. Mendoza's crime was that of investigating, revealing, and forcing the Cuban communist government to admit the existence of a raging epidemic of dengue fever in the spring and summer of 1997. In fact, Dr. Mendoza was on the telephone with a Miami radio station communicating the details of the epidemic to the outside world when the Cuban State Security political police closed in:""There are approximately 13 dead, 2,500 hospitalized patients and 30,000 people afflicted!"" Mendoza frantically declared, warning the interlocutor on the other side of the telephone line that the communication would be cut at any moment, as State Security had surrounded the house and was knocking on the door.The communist regime did not want to reveal to the world the existence of the epidemic because it was a personal embarrassment to Fidel Castro, who had previously declared that the mosquito responsible for dengue, the Aedes aegypti (photo, below), had been eradicated long before  by the long arm of the Revolution!More importantly, such a disclosure endangered the burgeoning Cuban tourist industry, which at the time was in high gear preparing for the Santiago Carnival, the Expo Caribe '97 celebration, the World Youth and Students Festival, and ""a marathon of cultural and propaganda events planned for Santiago de Cuba that year.""Because the Cuban communist authorities in the public health system kept the epidemic hush-hush, calling the disease ""an unspecified virus,"" the people continued to medicate themselves with aspirin for the prodromal (early flu-like) viral symptoms of the disease, tragically worsening the hemorrhagic manifestations of the disease.From there things go from bad to worse. Get and Read this poignant, revealing and disturbing book and learn about free health care in a socialized medical paradise. The facts in this book are still in full force in Cuba!For those who want to read more about this, I recommend my longer articles, ""Socialized Medicine in Cuba (2002): A Poor State of Health"" and ""Other Hidden Faces of Cuban Medicine.""

"This movie is plain magnificent, the cinematography, the script, the acting all superb! Normally, when I watch a movie based on a great book or novel, the question always arises, how does it compare to the book?The book, Atlas Shrugged, is fantastic, but a bit too long toward the end, particularly to the impatient younger generation. The repeated question of ""Who is John Galt?"" becomes a bit old in the book, but not so in the movie.  So the answer- as far as Part 1 concerns us- is  the movie so far.  Why? The writing and the plot for both the book and the movie are a tour de force, but the movie, at a faster pace and with such actors that match the novel's characters so well, ""live and in color"" on the screen- may just tilt the balance!The movie is like the book, a cliffhanger of intrigue and suspense, but it just moves faster- and we want more!  The casting, moreover, is outstanding. Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler give magnificent performances as Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, and so due the rest of the cast in their respective roles.  When Ayn Rand was alive her first pick to play Dagny Taggart was Farrah Fawcett in the 1970s, when Farrah was at her peak, but I don't see how equally beautiful Taylor Schilling could have been beaten!And the parallels with the present could not have been better chosen by Fate herself. The movie takes place in 2016, and America is teetering on the abyss of economic disaster, oil prices climbing out of sight, government collusion with business (who are cooperating with the increasingly socialistic American state) is rampant, regulations mount, economic freedom is being curtailed, individual liberty itself hangs on the balance. The most productive citizens are disappearing, while those who are dependent on the state are multiplying...the country is on the verge of revolution. Everything depends on our rugged individualist heroes (and their Objectivist philosophy), Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, but they are yet to find out ""Who is John Galt?""I give thumbs up to this magnificent movie and can not wait for the next installment!Dr. Miguel A.

"Passport to Assassination: The Never-Before-Told Story of Lee Harvey Oswald by the KGB Colonel Who Knew Him by Oleg Nechiporenko is a disappointing book from an ex-KGB officer for an intriguing subject!This is not one of the most ground-breaking books on Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy assassination. In fact this is a revised book review of this tome because my original years ago was excessively harsh. Nevertheless, another reviewer, a Mr. Hilliard of Toronto, Canada, also wrote a critical review at that time that appeared in Amazon: ""Nechiporenko's book is tedious, dull, and does not reveal anything that we do not already know in the 'facts' department."" This is still largely true.Usually books by former spies reveal information of historical or intelligence interest. This book does not, except for the narrow window of when Oswald visited the Soviet embassy in Mexico. The first part of his book about ""facts"" was written to show the KGB had nothing to do with Lee Harvey Oswald, as the KGB found him unsuitable for intelligence work. Nechiporenko used boring, bureaucratese narrative to reveal and explain archival documents that exonerate the KGB from having had anything to do with President Kennedy's assassination. This denial appears to be truthful according to the available information we have, including the Mitrokhin Archives. In addition, Nechiporenko does describe Oswald truthfully as a fanatic communist determined to go to Cuba. The critical time Oswald spent in the Soviet embassy in Mexico in the weeks prior to the JFK assassination is described convincingly, and I believe Nechiporenko, as an eyewitness and a participant in the affair, is truthful in his account. This information has been fully validated by other sources. Nevertheless, this uncolorful information has not been well received by many of the most dogged conspiracy theorists, but seems to be correct and consistent with the course of events.Unfortunately, Parts 2 and 3 deal with speculative, bizarre, tendentious conspiracy theories, and the book rapidly deteriorates! Col. Oleg Nechiporenko's main source seemed to have been about about right-wing conspiracies: Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor; Jim Marrs' ""Crossfire,"" ""JFK,"" the movie by Oliver Stone, all of whom he quotes in footnotes, but to his credit, he also read the Warren Commission and was aware of Edward J. Epstein's book, Legend.As a ""loyal"" ex-KGB officer, Oleg Nechiporenko wrote the book (with the assistance and permission of Russia's intelligence services), it seems, to squelch any doubts as to the KGB's involvement in the Kennedy's assassination, as well as to point fingers elsewhere: A grand conspiracy of the CIA, FBI, anti-Castro-Cubans, the Military-Industrial complex, using Lee H. Oswald as a ""patsy""... I wasn't sure I would be able to finish Part 3 -- and not finishing a book, once I start is extremely rare for me. I usually plow to the bitter end. But I did finish the book, wrote and revised my review!If you want to more read informative, intriguing, and suspenseful books on this subject, I recommend, 1) Legend: The Secret World of Lee Harvey Oswald by Edward J. Epstein (1978), which as written from the ""right"" side of the political spectrum, and 2) By Norman Mailer: Oswald's Tale:: An American Mystery (1995) by Norman Mailer (from the left side of politics). The most authoritative book is also the most enthralling on the subject: Case Closed by Gerald Posner.  The most recent new material is contained in Castro's Secrets: Cuban Intelligence, the CIA, and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy (2012) by Brian Latell.Nechiporenko's book does have illustrations, particularly of its author and an index, which compensate to some degree for the serious shortcomings in the book as I have already mentioned. Although there is some valid, firsthand information in Part 1, I am not able to recommend this book for general readers because of the extensive, speculative disinformation in Parts 2 and 3, written obviously to pander to the many conspiracy theorists of the left, as well as to further (needlessly) exonerate the Soviets, including Nechiporenko himself by pointing fingers elsewhere, and to serve Nechiporenko's persistently unrepentant, communist ideology.The reviewer Dr. Miguel Faria is a medical historian, and an Associate Editor in Chief and World Affairs Editor of Surgical Neurology International (SNI).

"Beria -- Stalin's First Lieutenant by Amy Knight is a well-written, exemplary biography that attempts to ""challenge some basic assumptions"" about Lavrenti Beria and his role in Stalinism and terror from the time of the October Revolution of 1917 to his execution in 1953.Amy Knight, a Senior Research Analyst at the Library of Congress, has a gift for elegant writing and turning revealing phrases, as well as for having a keen understanding of the psychopathology of Soviet leaders, particularly Nikita Khrushchev, Joseph Stalin, and the subject of this biography, Lavrenti Beria.Stalin surrounded himself with malleable bureaucrats and communist minions to whom he applied the effective strategy of ""divide and conquer,"" so as to threaten their own existence with physical annihilation in a climate of suspicion that deterred disloyalty on the part of his lieutenants.But Lavrenti Beria was not the typical unimaginative follower. As an astute operative and a fellow Georgian steeped in Georgia's ideals of loyalty, betrayal, even fears of death, he quickly divined his compatriot's psychopathology. Beria could penetrate Stalin's mind and by nurturing Stalin's fears and paranoia and his unquenchable need for praise, Beria was able to use that for his own purposes not only to effect his survival but also to accumulate power.Stalin and Beria were both from Georgia, however from different regions of Georgia. Beria was 20 years Stalin's junior. A member of the next generation of Soviet leaders, Beria had no qualms about helping Stalin exterminate the old Bolsheviks who could challenge Stalin's power or his version of Revolutionary history, particularly when ""the Great Leader"" had set out to re-write and correct history, so as to fit with his unfolding, grandiose cult of personality and historical revisionism.During the 1920s and 1930s, Beria was police chief (NKVD) and party leader in Georgia and Transcaucasia. He won Stalin's confidence by enforcing his repressive measures, including the great leader's rapid industrialization of urban areas at the expense of the compulsory requisitioning of crops and foodstuff from the peasantry, while forcing collectivization of their farms (kolkhozes).Beria also promoted and furthered Stalin's personality cult to dizzying heights. Beria managed to survive the ""Yezhevina,"" the Great Terror of 1936-38, even though he came close to becoming one of its victims. In 1938, Nikolai Yezhev (photo, left), NKVD chief in Moscow, ordered the arrest of Beria who was party chief in Georgia, but Georgian NKVD chief Sergei Goglidze, one of Beria's trusted protégés (later dubbed the ""Georgia Gang""), warned him.Beria bid goodbye to his family at the airport, expecting to be arrested and executed; but rather than accepting that fate, upon arrival in Moscow, he convinced Stalin that his life should be spared, reminding the vozhd (""the Great Leader"") what a loyal and useful lieutenant he had been and how exact and efficiently he had carried out party orders in Georgia and Transcaucasia. Shortly thereafter, Yezhev was himself purged and Beria became the new NKVD chief!Beria quickly insinuated himself into Stalin's inner circle and became the most powerful security chief in the Kremlin virtually until his fall in 1953.Timely testing and production of the atomic bomb were Beria's first priorities between 1945 and 1949, and he completed these tasks with incredible success, leaving the West astounded at the Soviet achievement, several years ahead of the time line expected from American intelligence. He achieved full politburo membership in 1946 and was awarded the Order of Lenin for his success in 1949.After the war with Hitler had been won, from 1950 to 1953, Stalin was once again ready to stoke his system of repression and re-implement terror on a grand scale, this time designed to include the repression of Russian Jews, the purging of his security apparatus and even members of his inner circle. Toward this end, Stalin concocted a series of conspiracies; some were even interrelated, and only he, the master conductor, knew as to where they led and his ultimate objective. These concocted plots included the ""Leningrad Affair,"" the anti-Semitic, anti-Cosmopolitan campaign, and ""the Jewish Doctors' Plot"" that enmeshed Jewish intellectuals, communist party members, state security organs, Kremlin doctors, and even his loyal and long-time chief of his personal bodyguards, General N. S. Vlasik.Stalin even began to mistrust Beria, and toward this end, he concocted the so-called ""Mingrelian conspiracy,"" that in Stalin's paranoid mind involved corruption of political leaders in Georgia (allies and protégés of Beria) and a treasonous separatist ""bourgeois nationalist"" movement with ties to Turkey.In his inner circle only Georgi Malenkov and the newer members Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin still enjoyed Stalin's ""confidence,"" but this trust hung capriciously over their heads like the Sword of Damocles. Suspicion had fallen already over his former comrades V. Molotov, K. E. Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, Anastas Mikoyan, and Lavrenti Beria. It seems that the turmoil of the Jewish Doctors' Plot and the Mingrelian affair were the final strokes for Beria, who, perhaps with the connivance of Malenkov and Khrushchev, decided to act to protect their lives.Immediately after Stalin's death on March 5, 1953, Beria moved rapidly to seize power. And almost as suddenly, he became a liberal political reformer. He defended the rights of non-Russian nationalities, such as the Ukrainians and Georgians, vis-à-vis the former Russification policy of Stalin. He admitted that both the Jewish Doctors' Plot and the Mingrelian affair were concocted by Stalin's underlings, and had those involved arrested.Beria then began to decentralize and dismantle the secret police and the Gulag system as part of his broader program of liberalization. He granted amnesty to a large category of Gulag political prisoners. With the repudiation of the Doctors' Plot, the doctors were released from prison, and the campaign of anti-Semitism was ended. Under Beria, de-Stalinization had begun at a faster pace than would be reestablished later under Khrushchev.The crisis in East Germany, though, provided the pretext that Nikita Khrushchev needed to challenge Beria's power in the Kremlin. Malenkov, who had been Beria's ally, was won over by Khrushchev's intrigues, as were some important segments of the Russian military, which had come to resent the prominence of Beria and his secret police.Beria had made a mistake. He had moved too fast in the liberalization of East Germany. The iron-fisted East German Chancellor Walter Ulbricht (photo, left) opposed the reforms, and the contradictory statements confused the issue, creating instability and fueling publicdiscontent. Influenced by Beria's intended reforms, East German protestors, whose objectives now included not only economic liberalization but also the removal of the hard-line, communist Chancellor Ulbricht, took to the streets. By June 17, 1953, Soviet tanks were rolling into East Germany to crush the rebellion.Georgi Malenkov, who now supported Khrushchev, along with Nikolai Bulganin and V. Molotov, blamed Beria for the crisis in East Germany.Amy Knight correctly asserts that ""the East German crisis provided Khrushchev with the pretext for rallying opposition against Beria,"" and that Khrushchev and Molotov would later denounce Beria's program at the July 1953 Central Committee Plenum, ""accusing him of turning against socialism and playing into the hands of the West by trying to create a united, neutral bourgeois Germany.""Perhaps the most intriguing portion of this book is the plot that Khrushchev successfully instigated and how it was carried out against Beria. Stalin's first Lieutenant had greatly underestimated Khrushchev, the former Ukrainian operative who fairly recently had been brought to Moscow by Stalin, and as the current head of the Secretariat had become Beria's chief opponent in the Kremlin power struggle.Khrushchev had persuaded Malenkov, Molotov, and Bulganin to take an active role in the coup, while Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, and Mikoyan assumed more passive roles, believing it to be more politically expedient not to interfere until the coup had been carried out.Beria was arrested by military men at a hastily convened meeting of the Presidium on June 23, 1953, only nine days after the East German insurrection was squelched by Russian troops. Khrushchev had been moving feverishly within the Politburo and the military to undermine and gather forces against Beria. Beria was uncharacteristically caught off guard and entered the Presidium without suspecting the plot and the coup that awaited him. Once inside the Presidium, MVD guards (security apparatus successors to the NKVD) who had been posted outside were dismissed by Defense Minister Bulganin and replaced with military troops loyal to General K. S. Moskalenko (photo, above) and Soviet Marshall Georgi Zhukov (photo, below), who had been brought into the plot. Beria's fate was sealed.The trials of Beria and his lieutenants were conducted in camera, in secret from December 18-23, 1953. To this day, controversy exists as to whether Beria participated in the proceedings or had already been executed along with his comrades by the time of the trial, six months after their arrest. Among the many charges levied against them, they were accused of attempting ""to seize power and liquidate the Soviet worker-peasant system for the purpose of restoring capitalism and the domination of the bourgeoisie.""Beria's life in contrast to Stalin's other sycophantic lieutenants can be summarized by the author's following words: ""If Beria was an exception, it was not because he was amoral, sadistic, and cruel. Rather it was because he was intelligent, astute, and devoted to achieving power. He was also adept at the kind of court politics that prevailed in the Kremlin and below. His deviousness and two-faced behavior was an asset in this environment, particularly in dealing with Stalin.""This book is highly recommended and deserves a 5-star rating.

"This book is a great addition to the story of Soviet communism, a story that is still unfolding, but has not completely been told. This book will remain the authoritative source of the life and times of Nikolai Yezhov, until the Russian Archives are once again fully opened to scholars. In revealing the life of Nikolai Yezhov, this  concise tome also recounts the political times, and more importantly, the moral degeneracy of the Soviet leadership, the communist party, the secret police- the Soviet state itself, rotting from its own evil communist ideology and moral perversion.The Great Terror of 1937-38 was an outstanding period in the chronicles of the USSR because the vast majority of the victims were not only communist, but Stalinists, who allegedly had not been sufficiently vigilant in finding ""enemies of the people"" in their midst. In other words, they had not been vigilant communists, and had not informed and found sufficient innocent victims, purportedly potential opponents to Stalin's supreme authority.Moreover, Stalin had decided to get rid of the old Bolsheviks and Chekists, who he no longer ""trusted"" or stood in the way of his revisionist history of Soviet communism, a history in which only Comrade Stalin stood shoulder to shoulder with the great Lenin.The story of the police state, political assassinations, arrests in the middle of the night, the use of systematic torture and generalized terror,  we must keep in mind, all began with Vladimir Lenin. And we must remember that ""permanent revolution"" was invented by Leon Trotsky; the use of concentration camps, the implementation of ""revolutionary terror,"" the extermination of ""class enemies,"" and the founding of the political police, the legendary, ruthless Cheka, were all instituted by the totalitarian state- not by Stalin or Yezhov- but by the father of the October Revolution, himself, Vladimir I. Lenin. The Red Terror of 1918-1922, in which thousands perished was primarily the work of ""Iron Feliks"" Dzerzhinsky, Red Army Commissar LeonTrotsky, and the Starik of Russian communism, Lenin- not Stalin or Yezhov.By 1936 Stalin needed a younger NKVD chief, who was personally loyal to him and would not hesitate to exterminate what remained of the legendary old Bolsheviks, such as the ""leftist Trotskyites, Kamenev and Zinoviev; the ""party swamp,"" Radek, Pyatakov, and ""their followers""; and the ""rightist bloc,"" Bukharin, Rykov, etc, who, in Stalin's mind still posed a threat to his authority. A younger, loyal, amoral communist comrade, Nikolai Yezhov, was just the man Stalin needed to accomplish such a horrendous task, after the assassination of Leningrad Party chief, Sergey Kirov, in December 1934. For the time being, Yezhov would assist Yagoda in the investigations,interrogations, and the gathering of evidence.Genrikh Yagoda had been a bloody NKVD chief, but he had not acted fast enough during the Great Purge, according to Stalin, in exposing and exterminating the (concocted) Trotskyite-Zinovievite-Bukharinite conspiracy.Using torture and threats, Yezhov extracted the needed confessions from the old Bolsheviks, and pleasing Stalin with his results and methods, soon enough, he would displaced Yagoda as chief of the NKVD. Yezhov performed his bloody symphony of terror satisfactorily and completely as required by Stalin, the great conductor. (Later this period in 1950s would be labeled the ""Yezhovshchina,"" as if to make Yezhov, alone, responsible for the atrocities and ""excesses"" of the great purges.)And when the task was completed (which it was in about 18 months), Stalin knew enough about expediency to get rid of the now completely alcoholic, sexually perverted, and morally degenerate Yezhov. And Stalin need not worry; there was always someone available to pick up the pieces and assume the mantle of NKVD chief. The next NKVD chief, Lavrentii Beria, followed Yezhov; just like Yezhov (1936-1938) had followed in the footsteps of Genrikh Yagoda (1934-1936). As new NKVD chief, Beria rounded up, purged and exterminated all of Yezhov's appointees and brought his ""Georgia Gang"" to power- staying in power with his intelligence, cunning, and loyalty, virtually until Stalin's death in 1953.Yagoda and Yezhov, and much later Beria, would all end up with a bullet to the back of the skull, the standard treatment for Soviet scapegoats as well as ""traitors.""Yezhov fell from power because he was no longer needed; in fact, he had done an excellent job fulfilling and exceeding the quotas of victims set by Stalin in eliminating enemies of the people in all regions of Russia and captive nationalities- from the top of the Soviet hierarchy in the communist party, the security organs (the political police, NKVD), the military, and the regional and district nomemklatura to the lower echelons of Soviet society.Nikolai Yezhov was not created in a vacuum; he was a product of the evil philosophy of communism in the USSR, forced collectivism under Stalin, just like the ""Gang of Four"" was a product of Red Chinese communism under the Cultural Revolution of Mao Zedong, or the mass extermination of his own population by Pol Pot in Cambodia. The book is a portrait of evil, only that it encompasses many faces. I recommend this book to all students of Russian Communist history without reservations. The book also has a good index, notes, and rare illustrations.Miguel A. Faria, Jr., M.D. is the author of Cuba in Revolution: Escape From a Lost Paradise (2002).

"This Encyclopedia is an essential reference book for those interested in researching the history of revolutions and revolutionaries. The main drawback is the liberal, left-of-center academic bias that one has come to expect in most of these types of books. And this occurs in most (but not all) of the entries, probably reflecting the views of the various authors. There are also a few mistakes in dates and facts that may be distracting to scholars and serious researchers.The entry on Ernesto (Che) Guevara is a case in point. Guevara is lionized to the degree that his entry becomes a virtual hagiography of the fallen, flawed and communist revolutionary. For example, Guevara did very little work as a physician contrary to what the authors lead you to believe. The entry also contains a factual error that ""Batista sent a train load of troops to recapture Oriente Province. In a pitch two-hour battle, Guevara captured the train."" In fact, the province and battle took place in Santa Clara in the center of Cuba, not in Oriente Province at the eastern end of the island.The entries on the French Revolution and the Convention are also very tilted toward sympathy for the radical Jacobins. Consider the praise that the authors heap upon the Jacobins:""The Jacobin leaders, ruling by means of the Jacobin Club in Paris which met daily on the Rue Saint Honore and the Convention's Committee of Public Safety sitting in the Tuileries, controlled the two organs of power. They gave France the most effective democratic government it has ever known, enabling it to wage all-out war against most of Europe while at the same time succeeding in crushing the Catholic and Royalist Vendee as well as the federe revolt which the Girondins had been able to keep alive in two-thirds of the French provinces.""Suffice to say, that if this whole statement were true, then it would be an indictment of democracy and self-determination. And, it equates France's ""most effective democratic government"" with dictatorship, militarism, and an utterly repressive regime -- not to mention the Reign of Terror by which it ruled!Yet, Chiang Kai-Shek is treated very fairly, which was pleasantly surprising, for a man who moved from Left to Right in the political spectrum. Surprising too was the description of the Indonesia Coup of 1965.  Despite excellent coverage of this momentous revolution, we find that although President Sukarno has a separate entry later in the book, General Suharto does not!As to the good points, let's reiterate that it's a very comprehensive tome that includes a number of entries, obscure Chinese as well as Arab and Middle Eastern revolutionaries galore. You feel as if no revolutionary has been left out, particularly of the socialist persuasion. No one, from ancient to modern times, seems to have been forgotten. The reader will be delighted to find that anarchists are also well covered. One is also delighted to find this gem, an obscure but instructive entry on the Argos Revolution:""In 370 B.C., civil strife (stasis) broke out in Argos, which had a democratic regime. The masses were instigated by a number of demagogues against the very rich citizens....Thirty of the most distinguished citizens were put to death and their property was confiscated. The demagogues kept on inciting the mob, which condemned to death more than 12,000 rich men, who were then beaten to death. When the demagogues wished to stop the accusations against the well-to-do, the masses turned against them as well and all of them were put to death....""In short, the book is recommended as a useful reference for history scholars as well as reading fans of revolutions and revolutionaries, with the caveat that much of the text is written by scholars, who have slight to moderate bias toward liberal politics and socialism and view these events through the special rose-colored glasses to which they have become accustomed in their academic environments.Miguel A. Faria Jr., M.D. is the author of Cuba in Revolution - Escape from a Lost Paradise (2002) and the essays, ""Stalin's Mysterious Death"" (2011), ""Stalin, Communists and Fatal Statistics (2011), The Political Spectrum: The Totalitarian Left from Communism to Social Democracy to the Extreme Right, Anarchism (2011) and other essays on these topics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG21JKUC1L6Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081603236X#wasThisHelpful","RG21JKUC1L6Y2","A1LKQ81O0BP49Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKQ81O0BP49Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unvanquished---Cuba's Resistance to Fidel Castro is a cliff-hanger non-fiction book that reads like a novel. It's the stupendous work of the serious scholar, Enrique Encinosa, who has  written the definitive works on the guerrilla wars waged by anticommunist Cuban rebels against the repressive, totalitarian regime of Fidel and Raul Castro.  His original masterpiece, Cuba En Guerra: Historia De La Opocision Anticastrista, 1959-1993, has now been updated and abridged for the Anglo-American public and published in English!This book is not for the easily offended or fainthearted. The poignant text, carefully annotated, and the product of meticulous research with a succinctly arranged text, is accompanied by graphic photos of rebel leaders with machine guns and bandoleers, armaments, armed rebel battalions, and also pictures of those who died attempting to bring freedom to Cuba or captured and executed by the communist dictator.Why would campesinos (peasants), workers, and students pick up arms and lead open revolts in the Escambray Mountains against Castro's ""worker's paradise?"" Why would Cuban exiles living good, comfortable lives in Miami with their families leave to go back to the hell of communist Cuba, breach communist defenses to conduct clandestine operations, infiltration, and uprisings against Fidel Castro's communist government? You must read this book to find out.You will find heroism fighting communist repression in this pages---although most of the time there was little chance of winning. The Castro brothers were bolstered by the Soviets; America and the CIA had ceased helping the rebels long ago.This 229-page book has a complete bibliography, Oral Sources and a written index.  It is illustrated with poignant photography. The book is easy to read and should be displayed prominently in the library of (and after having been read by) all freedom-loving people, those who truly want to know the unvarnished truth about Cuba's communist regime.What was the cause of the unknown war fought in Cuba's Escambray Mountains, 1959-1965, for example? Like the kulaks of the former Soviet Union exterminated by the Soviets under Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and 1930s, the anticommunist rebels called alzados were campesinos (rural people, peasants) who fought heroically the communist invaders, who had taken their land and forced them into collective farms in the name of agrarian reform. I will say here no more. Suffice to say that this is the story of those who have fallen in the effort to liberate Cuba, and their stories have not been told, until now!Encinosa's chronicle should be read by those many who have opined the Cubans have not fought enough to obtain their freedom. This is the story that proves them wrong.  This little tome chronicles the previously unwritten and little-noticed, heroic efforts of those who have tried to bring freedom to Cuba by armed insurrection from inside and outside Cuba,  efforts that have been ignored by the American media.Mr. Encinosa deserves the highest praise for his achievement! I highly recommend this book to all readers interested in the tragic fate of Cuba and want to learn more. You will be rewarded with enlightenment for your well-worth effort at finding the truth.Miguel A.

"Edit note inserted 12/21/2012 - photos are in the picture gallery now.  2 things to note - there is a silver DC label on the back of my product, but not the factory photo, and #2 on the 1/12,000 sec F22 exposure of the leds the yellow surround is the glowing ceramic, the white arracy of 3x3 leds is the actual color - 5000+ K temperature. I took photos of the cable and the positive negative color mapping to the blue and brown wires.  I dismissed some of the EARLY (mayish) reviews on this product that aparently were shipped versions with an AC power supply.  I am just getting to post some pics with the DC ONLY version (and you must never reverse the polarity - brown is positive, blue is neative, the green/yellow wire is cut off - i.e. they used a 110VAC line cord on the DC version - most people expect red/black but red is brown and black is blue and ignore the ground wire - you don't need it for low voltage (anything under 48VDC is technically low voltage, some people argue low voltage is 24VAC and below due to the sinewave peaks on AC).  To date I have placed TWO orders now for 2 each units in each order.  All were shipped fast, and all were identical.  I'm getting my SLR camera out to post high quality pics of the REAL 12V (10-30 is their spec) version. Hint for you EE's out there you may want to insert an IDIOT DIODE (i'm sure its in google if you don't know but its a protective diode) in line so that brown is always positive with respect to blue no matter how they get wired in the field.  A polarity reversal could kill the device and 0.6V drop across the diode forward biased times 1 amp nominal is 0.6 watts - you can afford to loose that due to the tremendous light output and efficiency of the leds.  A 24 volt *AC* supply could easily kill these and alot of alarm circuits use 24VAC as do doorbells etc.Original review below:In my first order I purchased two of these lamps.  At work I do Mil 810 testing (different proceedures for different products - e.g. testing a field radio vs an axel for a 2.5 ton truck)  For and IP65+ rated product we normally do shock/vibe, voltage variation, negative 50 degrees C to positive 50deg C thermal operation, salt spray, and other tests.  I am simply amazed at the QUALITY that went into the construction of these lampholders.  We are starting tests today on a 24 hr run-in test to ensure there is not infant mortality. A full 810 test takes time and I will update as time permits.  I will also get our forensic camera - which is a very precise 1:1 imager, but useless on amazon's rescaled pictures as it takes massive photos that amazon downsizes - my goal is just to take detailed photos that show off the workmanship in the lamp and I will upload a better set of photographs.WHY I bought the 10-30V battery instead of 115 or 230VAC models:  10-30 V is ideal.  it covers a dying 12VDC battery down past 11V AND at the same time it covers 2 ea 12V batteries in series for a 24-28VDC operation.  What is nice about going to 30VDC is that on occasion you need to ""equalize"" lead acid cells - this is easily done by turning the charge voltage up from 13.8 float to 14.5V (for a 12V battery of 6ea. 2V cells) This forces a 24VDC battery system to equalize charge by forcing a current through batteries that are almost full - for a 24VDC system, equalization charging = 29.0VDC, still within the specs of this lamp!  It's like a wide range AC input for DC.In short, it covers all possible battery situations, from a run down 12VDC to a 24VDC on equalization charge, and everything inbetween.  That's amazing.  Few DC products have such a wide range - most are 24-28VDC for mil 810.People had commented that they ordered the 12V and got the 115VAC version instead.  The case/cable is identical for both versions, however labels on the back clearly state the voltage, and another label on the cable clearly states the polarity of the brown and blue wires ( the green/yellow stripe ground lead was cut at the factory for low voltage systems) There is no doubt in looking at the labels that this is a DC product - My hunch is the other reviewers may have been shipped the AC lamp by mistake - its easy to do given they use the same case and cord.One of the first tests I did was to use an agilent variable output supply to go from 10 - 30 volts.  What I noticed is that the higher the voltage, the lower the current - e.g. constant power operation.  This implies some form of dc/dc converter is being used in te unit's brain/ballast section.  It's another positive for the product as if you decide to run a 24-28 VDC solar system with 2 sets of 12V cells in a series/parallel configuration then the light will perform well for you with reduced current.I will say as a nitpick, not a negative, as there is no 100% efficient voltage changer, that to get 10W to the led array it took 14W into the lamp cord.  Now that 4W of inefficiency is including the loss in the 3 feet of cable and the dc/dc converter onboard to handle 10-30V inputs.  I can live with a 4W loss, and I may plot conversion loss over a range of input voltages from 10-30 VDC later in testing to see where the lamp has minimal loss in dc/dc conversion.  I fully expected some different power in for 10w power out the led and that is not a negative about the product in any way shape or form.For now, all I can say is I'm REALLY IMPRESSED, these are going to be part of my emergency lighting system, and only using 0.8 Amps at 13VDC (one testpoint) means a 12vdc, 100AH battery will give many days of night time lighting, even with more than one lamp connected.  That 1A or less switching opens up a vast number of relays that can handle 1A at 12V.  I plan to build a simple emergency light using these indoors and out, an array of batteries, a contactor for the charger, and a 2nd drop out relay that energizes the lights when the AC dissappears.  I will also use a timer in the circuit to ensure the lights are only on during desired times, and perhaps a second timer with an isolation diode to light one lamp just as a low power outdoor light as its often dark when I come home, and these are very weatherproof.14W of electricity is 2x7W night lights.  It's next to nothing.  I could run one of these lamps every night at night or a selected time period of 8 hr or so and not see any increase in my energy bill.  I could even get enough charge from a solar array to power these highly efficient led lamps.Lastly, let me just say - THEY ARE BRIGHT - NEVER look directly at the led emitter without welding goggles.  ONE lamp puts out conservatively the equivalent of a 300W halogen tube.  The light temperature is well over 5000K - probably 6500KFeel free to lookup my email if you have questions, and I will get the forensic 1:1 camera to post some images later today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R296O8Q0PPAUWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MLXAF4#wasThisHelpful","R296O8Q0PPAUWQ","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This puts it in auto mode and the tiny auto/power leds alternate#3 put it somewhere where the dog cant get it but it can hear the dog, and the dog can hear it.#4 in auto mode it listens for your dogs first 'grace' bark#5 if the 'grace' bark is followed by a 2nd bark, it goes into auto correction mode.The dog will soon figure out only 1 bark is allowed, then it drops to zero pretty quick.There is also a training button which is highly effective.  When your dog is chewing on the tv remote, press the correction button and the dog stops.  If your dog won't go to sleep inside press the correction button and it will change its tune and calm down.Overall the clicking is very effective and that surprised me.  Its a non-harmful sound that irritates the dog to stop their action.

"This powder is finely powdered sugar that has aged with pure vanallia beans inside a large lot before being poured into 5 lb,1.25 lb, and smaller sizes.  The little  salt-shaker size that starbuck's puts out for condiments **is** the 1.25 lb, which isalso the 5 lb.  Size has nothing to do with the process.  That's where I discovered vanilla in coffee tastes better to me.As vanillia beans age inside a vat of powdered sugar they leach the vanilla taste into the sugar.  Some people like this on theircoffee.  How I discovered it was by asking the barista at starbucks where they get their vanilla powder from and she showed methe 1.25 lb cooks pure vanilla powder bottle.  I called them and ordered it for home use.  Its also here.Yes, I agree with the other poster if it were made by drying up beans and then grinding the carcases into powder, you would have a brown powder in the bottle, not white.  But vanilla beans are moist.  Dried beans would taste pretty bad ground up.Cooks Vanilla has a patented process to extract the flavor from the bean using sugar instead of conventional alcohol.By aging beans (and there is lot to lot variance BTW) in a vat of simple powder sugar you get this product (and they offer different sizes)Why then is this NOT brown powder, as the bean is brown?  after all, our vanilla syrups (which cooks makes) are brown?The reason is simple - those are an alcohol (smell it) based system.  The pure bean once again is aged in ethanol then put into shotglass size bottles to keep the batf happy.this is a non-alcoholic vanilla flavoring used on waffles, pancackes, coffee, pastries - anything you cook that youwant to flavor vanilla without pouring the brown alcohol base into the mix.  It also allows coffee drinkers to adjustvanilla to taste without putting a shot of vanilla in the coffee :)Technically it should be called vanilla sugar  -  but starbucks likes it and so do I in my coffee.  Its just a matter oftaste and economics for the different prices on the bottle sizes.  you can go to their website and find alcohol / non-alcoholmade flavors in almond, vanilla, and then a bunch of alcohol based flavors.  If you order over a certain amount in dollarsthey ship free - its about equivalent to the prices on amazon at or below 5 lbs.btw - they also have an almond flavor.

"I use a droid bionic - I've bought into the system with 3 small batteries (2 day runtime) and 3 large batteries (4 day runtime) and purchased the laptop keyboard/hd display & charger for mine.  In addition to in house chargers, I put a car holder in my vehicle in the lower left corner of the windshield and hid the cables under a dash mat to the stereo.  The install was fairly simple since I could place the antenna outside and fish the thin cable through the hatchback, then put the flat panel booster behind the phone mount with the amp under a seat.PRO :  comes with all antennas and proper terminationsPRO :  new flat antenna works with phones that no longer have a car adapterPRO :  switch is on the cigarette lighter plug if your lighter is always hot and you need to turn it offNOTE: Phone needs to be secured into a mount, with the antenna close behind.  With the laws being passed about no one handed driving on the cell, most people have migrated to a mount simply to comply - the inside antenna works well in this case.RESULT - installation was simplenitpick - LED for being ""on"" can be hard to see - its visable at night but in full sun hard to tell.  Not an issue since the lighter sockets get turned off when the vehicle is off.nitpick - DOES NOT send 4G LTE signal through (700 mhz) but that signal seems to be stronger than the 3g signal anyways.Verizon has alot of CDMA handoffs that are strictly cell to cell.  CDMA was designed so that a soft handoff could be made using both cells, and a 3rd to ensure no dropped data or calls, but I have not seen that feature used and experienced calls where one side was dead or where alot of cutouts happened in the mountains.  Now I have 4 bars/4 100% of the time - before it would drop to 1, 2, 3, or 4.  My vehicle telematics system is on ATT and shows its signal strength on the display when using it - seldom does att achieve even 2 bars here, and their antenna is external built into the car!  The ATT network has several times been unavailable for car data which seems to correspond to people who have iphones on verizon vs ATT - same phone, but terrible experiences w/ ATT.  It is unfortunate you do not have 2 real options with att and verizon due to ATT's weaker signal.  When cellular was first planned it was a duopoly with 2 options.  Now with PCS competition and confusion as to roaming on pcs you end up with one strong carrier nationwide.  Original analog cellular phones could be moved between carriers but today the phone is almost disposable since verizon and att chose incompatible digital systems.I have used wilson equipment since the analog days - on an offroad trip years ago to the middle of Nevada with no service, I was able to stop and make a call using the wilson amplifier and a high gain directional antenna to a cell site 83 miles away in Bishop, CA.  I dialed *611 and asked the technician what city I was in - not the usual call - he told me I was in Bishop, CA and I explained I was dialing from the middle of nowhere, NV 83 miles east of Bishop (their cell site was high up in the mountains and we were in the flatland - combined with the amplifier and high gain antenna I had full service camping at night)I have found wilson to be a quality brand that stands the test of time and recommend them to friends who live way out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBV97WKE0UGAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011GI94Q#wasThisHelpful","RBV97WKE0UGAF","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally I dont consider made in china worth 5 stars, but this product was built for long term reliable use and the craftmanship is excellent. Made in china can mean junk or precision machined parts like this one.  This is the right construction material (stainless steel) quartz sleeve, (replacable easy to find bulb -- keep in mind it must be done yearly because inexpensive (<$100) stainless steel UV filters are designed to last years, not just one year like the  units that ship with the UV RO systems- mine came with a plastic UV filter that lasted 1 year making me replace it with this one.Also its sized for 1gpm -- about what a RO faucet puts out - we don't need 20 gpm whole house sterilizers when the drinking (and maybe ice cube) water is all we want to sterilize.  Whole house water sterilizers are 2-4 feet long and 20-40 watts for 5 GPM and cost $300 and up.  This unit is rightsized for the application of RO  water.The fittings included are designed for a compression fit on 1/4"" pvc tubing commonly used in ro systems.  They are different than the cheap pushin connectors - they have threaded nuts  that put a compression on the pipe as they are tightened down.  This makes changes easy - if you have ever tried to get a hose out of the press-fit connectors, you find that they go in much easier than they come out even with all the right pliers!  I prefer the design of these connectors - they do not leak!The price, if kept under a benjamin, is right too - no more paying more for the UV tube than for the whole filter.  since they use a standard lamp, yearly changeouts are easy.  You do not need to open the quartz tube that keeps the HV electric away from the waer.  It is a smart design to use a standard lamp in a stainless case.  I like to change filters on a 6 mo interval, and the taste filter and UV tube on a yearly basis.  It's been a year now, so time to replace filters has come and gone - new ones are on order - and my stock is fine except for the UV system which puts out 30ppm water for a while (and heats up) until its been flushed good - then the real sterile water comes out at 3 ppm (obviously the 3ppm RO water is picking up something from the UV filter right now (a plastic POS that came with the unit for 269 usd. complete)  At that price they can't have spent much on the UV section and they did not.  The parts are UV proof, yet the light stays on all year long.Now it's time for a new sterilizer.  I picked this one for its tubing connectors, size, easy to change bulb, and 1gpm flow rate (believe me it takes 1 min to fill a gallon jug!)  It arrived in a custom molded styrofoam package, not the usual china paperboard box.  This is better packaging that most stuff from amazon.  Everything worked on the first startup!I think it will be a keeper - if not I will update you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AJWR9LVZJ1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PH6YYS#wasThisHelpful","R26AJWR9LVZJ1Y","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PRO - 10 inch filters designed around STANDARD 10 inch tall filter holders - not for customsPRO - each sub filter in the pack is individually wrapped to keep them clean - good ideaPRO - while the spun 5 and 1 micron filters make a seal by compression in the chamber, the carbon block filter has a rubber seal on top and bottom to ensure water must go through it.comment - filters always filter from OUT to IN - dirty water comes in the outside of the filter then travels through it to a hollow core and exits the top and is piped to the next filter holder's outside surface.  Again it goes outside to inside.  This is the standard.TIP - when purchasing new RO systems, look for standard 10"" filter systems and changeswill be cheap and easy because there are 2 standards - 10"" and commercial 20"" filters.AVOID custom 1/4 turn or custom steel filters - you can buy systems with clear or opaque filter chambers - clear chambers have pros and cons - you can see the contamination, but they let light in which promotes algee growth.A typical RO system has 3 prefilters -  First a 5 micron sediment, then carbon block, then 1 micron in that order before the water even gets to the RO membrane (I use a waste water pressure booster to double my pressure going to the membrane by using twice the volume of wastewater, which RO aways has plenty of to boost input pressure by 2x to 80psi.  I get 40 psi from the city water, and my tank goes to 80 psi.Keeping your RO membrane clean is imperitive to the proper function of the total unit giving clean, potable water with almost no total dissolved solids (they get flushed out the wastewater) and also gives sterile water w/ UV sterilizer in series (replace bulb yearly) and a standard refrigerator taste filter on the output line to drink for good tasting water.  I measure 3ppm TDS on my output.  Distilled water is 1.0 ppm for battery maintenance.  That is very low dissolved solids from 500 ppm at the street!On my system I T'ed off the 14 gallon oversized storage tank and ran that water, which avoids the UV lamp and the refrigerator filter, to a 25 foot long piece of tubing that terminates in female hose fitting (backwards i know - you want male hose fitting but I fixed it with a shutoff valve that was male-male) - so on the end I paid 8 bucks for 3 pvc fittings including a ball valve - I go hose to 3/4 pipe thread, rinto the 1/4 turn ball valve, then back to 3/4 pipe fitting to male hose thread.  All pipe fittings are teflon taped and the hose fittings have washers for zero leaks.  There is also a 1/4 turn 1/4"" tube shutoff valve on the T off fitting which allows me to fill the dog water dish (1 gallon) or connect a hose to my pressure washer and wash the car with 10 gal and no residue, no spots afterwards - very nice to have!  When I'm done I close the 1/4 turn valve at the tank (14 gallon extra large tank from amazon Reverse Osmosis Storage Tank 14 Gallon WhiteThis use (me, my dog, my car) keeps my RO flushing quite a bit per day - and that is good because the membrane is kept clean by flushing.  But it also means my prefilters need to be changed on a strict 6 month schedule since they filter 6 times the amount of RO water you get.  The last filter is the same as refrigerator filter.  In fact my fridge filter just counts 6 months then turns purple (blue+red means time to order filters) at 5 mo. and turns off the blue for red only at 6 mo - time to change filter now!  (when you press the reset button the 6 mo cycle starts over - don't do it unless you really changed the filter because after 6mo bacteria begins to grow on the filter media and water taste is bad)Just FYI - I live in a VERY hard water area with no chlorine from a well and pump at the end of the street - low pressure, high content of dissolved solids, hard (12.2 grains/gallon) water is what I get from the city.  I use a whirlpool salt ion exchange water softener to help cut down the solids but it only EXCHANGES the calcium and magnesium for Sodium - does not make spots as bad, but its still in the water.

"Each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply.  Want a 5 channel system - buy 5 speakers and run xlr audio to each one.  No noise or hum.  Has both trs and xlr inputs - has a knob for gain control on back.  Most importantly each speaker has an IEC connector for power to JUST that speaker.  Mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using TRS outputs which copy the XLRs - those go to my Marantz PMD 580 digital recorder w/ 32 GB of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters.  Speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces.  There is, however, no mounting point - no captive nuts or such.You'll need to adopt a philosophy on gain.  You can crank the speaker gain to 100% and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the -15 to -6 dB0 range.  It may be a tad loud - in that case you may want to set both speakers to their 12 oclock position which is 50% power approximately.You could alternately use the mixer to run near 0 dB and turn it way down on the speakers.  I like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so I turn the volume way down but drive them with -6 dB0 off the mixer.Having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation.My **FIRST** nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have.  I will have to fabricate some protection.  My second nitpick is i owned the smaller m-audio 4"" monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i.e. not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer.  The speaker w/ 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it.  It was not the power supply as being on made the box warm, but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with -3dB0 into the trs line in.  Thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer!I do like this set of speakers.  From stereo to 5.1 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs.  I may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203V9TXUHIECG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F3H6Q8#wasThisHelpful","R203V9TXUHIECG","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used mobile 1 synthetics in my AM general H1 humvee since 1995 and its still going despite weighing in at 14,000 lbs empty with the accellerator always full throttle when I race UPS trucks (0-60 in 23.5 seconds).  The advantage of mobile 1 synthetic grease is that it can withstand extreme pressure and heat.  I also use it to lubricate a custom 45 winchester magnum pistol (LAR Grizzly) that has a hard chrome finish custom made.  The slide is soo tight that ordinary oils get shot into your face when you squeeze off a 45 win mag.  ONLY the mobile one grease stays in the grove for the slide and doesn't get all over my shooting glasses like oil does.  At the end of the day the mobil 1 grease is still in the groove.Now there are some issues people have mentioned and they are true.  If you use grease on a regular basis then you won't see them much as they take time, but if you store your grease gun for a while you will find that a red fluid comes out of the grease.  This is the oil part - not the grease part and includes the red dye.  I finally put away my power grease gun with a couple paper towells wrapped around it to absorb the oil that comes out.  This problem gets worse with temperature cycles on the unused product.  Really all greases are 2 parts - oil and grease - and will seaparate at some temperature.  You can also collect that red liquid in a syringe and use it as a synthetic oil on fishing gear, guns, etc where you dont need a heavy grease.  Its very slick.Another experiment you can do at home is put a tube of mobile 1 grease and a tube of normal grease in the freezer for 24 hours at -16F.  You will find that the next day you can pop the top on mobile 1 and it is ready to go while other greases will become thick and hard to load into the pump.  It is even more dramatic with oils like 5w20 - mobile 1 synthetic stays the same consistency below freezing while the non synthetic oil turns to a syrup consistency and barely comes out of the container.  That means your engine is starved of oil until it gets hot.  Grease that stays put is better than grease which runs off when hot.  Place some mobile grease on a piece of steel and some normal grease then heat the steel with a flame for a while from the back.  You will see normal grease run off the steel while mobile 1 stays put (most of it does)In short, mobile 1 synthetic is available everywhere from kmart in florida to wallmart in alaska.  You do not want to mix synthetics on your vehicle - it's ok to drain out non synthetic and fill with synthetic, but various synthetic oils have different bases that do not get along, so once you switch to synthetic you need to stay with that brand for the life of the vehicle.I also use this grease on my electric opening fence at home which weighs 4000 lbs suspended on 2 hinges.  About every 3 months I inject new synthetic grease and the gate opens faster without any noise.  You can tell when its time to grease it by the speed and sound.Mobile 1 synthetic will smell funny, leave your hands red if you get it on them, but in the long run it will make your equipment last longer.  If you pay a pretty price for your equipment, paying a little more for good grease is not an issue.  Mobile 1 is available everywhere.  I also use their 75W lube in my differentials (5 of them on the humvee) and that cut the noise of the vehicle going down the road from the gears in the diffs.Best stuff around all factors considered - i realize there are other synthetics that are sold like amway products but if I am in alaska I don't want to have to find the nearest distributor!  Mobile 1 is on the shelf at any auto store which makes it a universal lubricant.BTW - a H1 humvee complete conversion from non synthetic to synthetic in the transmission, diffs (5), engine oil, and grease produces 5 gallons of waste lubes to dispose of so recycle them - we have curbside recycling here of oil waste which is convenient for those of us who do our own changes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N49AS2VJR7E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00085F4JO#wasThisHelpful","R3N49AS2VJR7E7","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The GU10 base bulb is more of a european design bayonet base bulb.  Specifically it has two 5mm mushroom shaped pins that are on 10mm centers - you insert it and rotate about 40 degrees until it locks in place and thats it - no screw action required.I agree with the negative review that while the GE reveal does have excellent spectrum, they never seem to come up to their life expectancy.  A couple things can affect this.1 - if you have say 10 bulbs on a single switch (500w) then if you do not replace them as they die, the voltage gets higher to the last bulb.  ALWAYS replace bulbs asap so that the string voltage stays within the electrician's design specs.2 - I use a lutron dimmer with soft start.  I like this because most bulbs blow when they are turned on or off.  With soft start, the bulb quickly (its programmable in the dimmer) ramps to full output or your last dimmer setting - your choice.  The difference is the filament is not shocked by turning it on and i've seen that the bulbs on lutron dimmers do last longer.  When you are talking a 10 dollar bulb thats important.3 - the GE bulb has a reinforced UV cover to capture any bulb shards - halogen bulbs are presurized with a halogen gas inside the capsule of the bulb itself.  The halogen causes the tungsten to redeposit back on the filament as it wants to boil off.  Normal vacuum bulbs do not have this ""forced redeposit"" feature and the tungsten plates out on the glass envelope.  This is not good.Because the halogen process runs under pressure at high temperatures to get a bright white light, it is subject to explosion of the bulb capsule (a very small point source inside the bulb that actually sits at the focal point).  ALL bulbs should have a glass welded cover over them for UV protection and for debris protection if the capsule explodes.  Cheap overseas bulbs lack this cover and can rain down 4000 deg kelvin glass causing fires.  GE bulbs have a thick cover plate fused to the reflector to catch any debris should the capsule explode that encloses the halogen gas under high pressure and temperature.So in short, GE makes probably the best and most expensive 50w reflector with the bipin base.  I am not sure what base is used overseas, but the insert and rotate is the same motion used to change a bulb on overseas fixtures.  I would recommend these always be used with a softstart device of some form - like the lutron dimmer (mine has an IR window and works with my programmable remote control for the lights)These are nice bulbs at a very reasonable price.  They are 50% more at the homestore nearby me than on amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBF21I7147858/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OXEC3E#wasThisHelpful","RBF21I7147858","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a multistage RO system - the first 3 stages pretreat the water before it hits the RO membrane.  After 6 months, I noted the TDS meter was showing higher readings, indicating poor filtration.  When I opened it up, the cause was obvious so I took a photo.In finding replacement filters, I chose a 4 pack of 1 micron filters for stages 1 and 3 (stage 1 from the factory was a 5 micron which may have contributed to the mess in the photo up above).  As there was no ""kit"" of 3 replacement cartridges I had to search out the best carbon block to use in stage 2 as mine was pretty green.I found this one to be highly recommended either as a single cartridge system or for RO systems - it has rubber seals on the top and bottom which makes it seal well in RO chambers.  It's also rated to 0.5 micron - better than the cheap 1 micron pre and post filters.For more info, look at the photo I posted next to the unit - this shows the factory cartridges which are from left to right, a 5.0 micron, the carbon block which I replaced with this, and a 1 micron before water flows to the RO membrane.Note that the 1 micron filters look longer - they compress when you tighten up the filter housings to seal the top and bottom.  This carbon block has rubber gaskets on the top and bottom to ensure a very good seal.It is a quality product and has already produced better readings on my meter than the water I was getting with the 6 month old filters.  It does show the importance of replacing your filter regularly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YHV2R1QX7QOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000246SMS#wasThisHelpful","R1YHV2R1QX7QOP","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my RO system which has clear containment covers so you can look at your filters and judge the need to swap them.  At this price, having clean water is dirt cheap.Other than the great price, a major pro is that each filter is individually wrapped, then the 4 are re-wrapped keeping things clean.  I'm uploading a picture of the 3 filters I changed in my R.O. system after just 6 months.  That doesn't seem like a long time, but please look at the uploaded photo to see the importance of changing filters regularly, including the 1 micron and the carbon block filters.My only regret is that amazon does not stock a complete 5 micron / 1 micron 4 pack set because most all water filters start with a 5 micron to get rid of the pipe buildup, scale, and the junk the city sends you.  Then they pass through a 1 micron later (along with perhaps a carbon block) to protect the r.o. membrane.  So to do an effective change you really need both 5 micron and 1 micron in the same quantity for any water filter (air filters can also use these on high pressure / flow compressor installations which makes them very flexible as a filter media)At the same time I bought a carbon block for my 3 ""bulk"" filter stages which really do need changing every 6 months.Watts 202000 10-Inch 5-Micron for Multi-Cartridge Whole House Water Filter with Solid Block Activated CarbonA kit with a 5 micron, the carbon block, and a 1 micron would really be nice as it would deal with 90% of the RO systems 6 month change intervals.  My in line TDS meter has gone from 4 ppm output to 14 ppm so I know its time to change numerically also.

Tired of television where magic colored lights make things appear out of nowhere using some UV ink splashed on before filming?  How about the magic Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer which really takes 18 minutes to stretch out a sample, but for our sake the same little bottle gets picked up every episode and out comes a piece of paper with a bunch of lines from which all sorts of conclusions are drawn.  There is no mention of the hydrogen carrier gas that makes it work!

You are shown the real world of MI5 (or as close as you will ever come).  England has two agencies which parallel the FBI and CIA, called MI5 and MI6 respectively.  So you start by forming your british to american english dictionary with MI5-->FBI.  It's a show about spying inside of Britain.  Yes, vocabulary is strictly british english - you must get off the lieu to answer the tele, pull on your trousers and fill your auto with petrol, pop the bonnetA few times MI5 liases with MI6, the CIA from US, The russian federation, and other countries we ignore in our TV programming - even though they exist.  You'll realize that most of the action is filmed in London.  And add to your vocabulary words like the tube, underground, fish and chips, and you're on the way to realizing the accents and language used in London.The CIA has a wall of stars - anonymous people who died in service to the USA.  Don't expect your favorite charactor to be there at the end of the next episode.  Agents encounter lethal problems like bombs, bullets, drowning, toxins, and other spy favorites that come from real spy to spy encounters.  By the end of season 3 all the main characters are gone and season 4 begins with just the head of MI5 in position.  That wall of stars in the CIA lobby did not get there without alot of sacrifices, and MI5 is realistic to that end.You'll learn the skill of the dead drop, that not everyone carrys a gun nor needs to, that psycology can accomplish a mission effectively without firing a shot, but if shots are fired, people blead and sometimes die.  Again, it is realistic.  Cars are right hand drive which works well when you drive on the left side of the two lane road!  CCTV cameras cover nearly all of London central, and all cellular or landline calls are routed through echelon for word detection as part of MI5's intelligence gathering.  Car chases are far less americanized - no big V8 engines and squealing tires. MI5 works in the background using their assortment of tracking devices, Taxis which are run by MI5 with drivers that report back their drop off location, and of course the camera network to get information about a car traveling through london and convey it to the following vehicle.You will find yourself taken to foreign lands by air travel when remote intelligence is involved.  Even the insides of foreign consular offices are decorated with the proper theme of the home country.  Diplomatic pouches are carefully inspected by X-ray to determine if a manual inspection is needed.MI5 does take liberties on occasion - the x-ray machine which can read a stack of pages of paper and ""print"" them all for review later on.  Of course there are 205 Ghz bugs the size of a small thumb tack with tracking capabilities on mobile phones.  Bond's Q would have a field day on some episodes, but they do keep it real - communications don't work underground, in tunnels, and other places where poor reception is found.  cell phones do drop calls, and cell phones never have a dialtone on them.  Of course the network is GSM with SMS, but not every message is readable  - you'll need to pay attention and watch who is contacting who and what is being sent when and how it pertains to the particular episode.Seasons 1-3 are sort of a set but expect a new group of primary actors by season 4 as they die off or retreat into their spy's 2nd identity and are retired (burned) out of MI5.Episodes are generally 59 minutes of program material beginning with an important setup, then the opening credits kept to a minimum, followed by the central office agency action plan as twists develop.  The dead drop is a common means of communication when everyone taps everyone else.  Nothing is secure.  Some carbombs are set off by celllular phone while others a turn of the key.  A season will have a varrying number of episodes.  Seasons 1-3 were smaller as the program grew in popularity - they were exported to the USA on broadcast PAL->NTSC conversion.  As the show's popularity increased so did the number of episodes in a series.MI5 is an acquired taste.  The accents and action are not characteristic of USA primetime, so don't expect a fuzzy store's videotaped surveilance camera from an 80's VHS tapedeck to be suddenly improved at CSI HQ.  Anyone who's played with photoshop knows that you can make a sharp photo fuzzy but making HDTV from a surveilance tape to do facial recognition isn't going to happen in real life.  I think that's the part I like the most about MI5 - they do not insult your intelligence.  Echelon is a real system that does use a computer to monitor calls placed in any language for certain words.  Every consulate's phone lines are tapped and sent to the FBI or CIA without a warrant.  If you say the USA would never do things like this, well there are 20 children who the US DOE fed small doses of plutonium to in their school lunch program to study its effects on the body during the cold war.  The USA tapped russia's undersea fiber optic cable using our submarines and a device known as a quarter wave transformer that allowed coupling of optical energy out of the fiber without cutting it and sounding the alarm at the phone company.  I know because my professor designed that system while working at bell labs in NJ, USA before he became fed up with it and moved to Davis, CA to be my faculty advisor in microwave and fiber optic theory.  MI5 even has an episode about the submarines that tap the undersea fiber optic cables, although their graphics are technically incorrect, their theory has been in practice for decades and represents reality.With only a few unbelievable exceptions, the MI5 tools are appropriate for the time it began (2002).  It ran for 10 seasons.  It's closest counterpart in USA TV would be X-files, but the realism in MI5 is certainly more accurate.  Prime members can watch all but 2 seasons for free - and amazon is missing seasons 9 and 10 which just finished airing on BBC TV.  Watching MI5 will cause you to open your eyes to what really happens in the world of espionage and brings to light the police state that Britian has become.  Occasionally a theme may span 2-3 episodes then a new storyline begins.  Some build on the previous episode for facts you need to know  - it is best watched from season 1 episode 1 through the end of season 8 without gaps.  Some seasons are not free for prime members (I know either season 4 or 5 isn't free) - but true to life, in Britain you PAY to watch over the air TV which is FREE in the USA, so it's jusst added realism.Enjoy MI-5 or ""spooks"" with a fine cup of tea.  With no commercial breaks in the hour program you may need to pause it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KXM7PAZ54E9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CG3WI0#wasThisHelpful","R20KXM7PAZ54E9","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE - JUST A NOTE - normally shipping this quantity of flamable (almost hazmat) material would require an additional $25 DOT safety charge - here you are getting the product for LESS than the price of the DOT safety surcharge on the shipment.  I (6/2012) am ordering a second set of 6 flares after how impressed I was with the first set. The velcro case is rugged, and the orange safety vest included will keep you visable to headlights at night.  I was so impressed with my first order, I ordered a 2nd because **no vehicle** comes with ANY safety flares any more.  These BURN VERY BRIGHT and are exceptionally easy to see at night for a half hour per flare.  These are 5 star rated items.  I will try one flare when the 2nd kit comes and compare it against some standards like a candle, a flashlight, and a portable dewalt flourescent light.  Watch for the photos by 9/2012This is a nice kit with 6ea 30 minute flares - thats 6 flares spaced out 300+ feet behind your vehicle to get cars to slow down, move to the left, and watch out for people.  double up with 2 kits of 6 flares and you can go out 600 feet behind your disabled vehicle for 30 min (enough time for towtruck to arrive)If you are on sceen for over 30 min, you can lay one flare's tip at the end of a burning flare for 1 hour.  While not a timekeeping mechanism, the flares offer you the ability to track half hour approximations.These are far brighter than led products or unlit products e.g. triangles.  Their visability and red color shine for > 1000 feet.In addition to the flares and zipper case a reflective vest is included in the zipper bag free of charge.Finally some construction and delivery notes.Flares are claszified ORM-D which usually tags on a 25 buck hit for hazmat shipping plus ground charges. You will not get them 2 day air or next day - be thankfull you can get the product for less than the typ. ORM-D charge.Finally these are not made like flares from the 60's.  There is no wax coating on them to protect from moisture.  There is no nail in the back to stick in the ground for verticle burning, but flare stands are cheap.  The nice velcro bag is a good plus to keep 6 flares from rolling around in your trunk.Summary: for 3 hours of bright red burn time this is a great price and a deal, as more vehicles come without flares, and the ones in the auto stores are 15 min 3 packs for a higher price.  I would keep a set of matches with the flares - they have a match type strike surface, but a very small red phosphorous cap to strike the flare and start it.  A good trick to get them to light is to put the cap on another flare's NON burning end with the burning end capped and use it to strike the exposed flare you want to light.  I keep a box of matches in the car as they can be used to quickly start a flare once lit.  Ideally you would have 6 inches in which to strike the flare but the cap is only 3/4"" diameter and circular.  Often times this means not enough movement to get the flare to light.  More pressure helps or a 2nd flare to put a stirker cap on and use flare against flare lighting method.  Matches are the best!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XOBWAQZ86CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TLNA94#wasThisHelpful","R1XOBWAQZ86CT","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I keep a few 4GB sticks hanging around for one main reason  - I've gotta move files and I don't want to burn a DVD.  The 4GB size is just about perfect (although dvd-r's are 4.7 gb) for most tasks about the size of a dvd-r.I've used this stick for multiple applications including giving a finished video product to a client I suspected would not return their ""preview"" I gave them to look at on a stick.  Although I lost the stick, they won't be pressing dvd's from it (it's outside their ability set!) so I figure the stick will make it home someday when they want discs.I also use a few 32 GB sticks for large volume work, but with win7 and NTFS becomming picky above 4GB they are still usable.  Yes, you can format a data  device for ntfs - its not fun but it can be done and even made bootable.

"A few years ago it was HDsomethingsomething.  Now HDMI is as common as VGA or yprpb.  I use it everywhere - and its not just for 1080-1920p 30hz video.  I run 1200x1920 @ 60hz on dual displays into my nvidia 590 card with HDMI cables just fine.  With dual displays comes dual cables.  If I want to connect an alternate input from, say, a tv tuner, then I might want a single display with an option to switch to video.As a prime backed product, you are getting two video cables for computer or video (blu ray, dvd, etc) that right now cost less than 8 bucks a piece.

"The OSPHF-ITW delay / sunset light is a highly functional (see the leviton cutsheets) option.  It handles 120-377 volts, which means they have sister products for 24 vac and 480 vac.Nitpick #1 - it would be nice to only have to stock ONE leviton sensor in my stockroom - a 24-480VAC model (or better yet for solar installs which are becomming more common a 12VDC,24VAC-480VAC combination unit).  If you wanted to cover 24VAC, 120-377VAC, and 480 VAC with one product you'd need 3 p/ns to put on your shelf in inventory.  That's 3 times the amount of inventory I'm willing to stock for a well made 1/2"" nipple motion sensor to cut lighting costs.Cutting lighting costs is not an easy task - motion sensors alone don't often handle the whole problem.  What about contribution from natural light during the day?  Leviton did a good job incorporating a photosensor that would look for daytime lighting as well as night so that lights would not activate when ambient lighting was sufficicent and occupancy was there.  The product also does an excellent job of giving you multiple lenses and isleway shades that can be rotated to make circular sensitivity from a roof location, or have 20' x 60' isles.  With the rotation you can get alot of flexibility.Nitpick #2 - on most of my installs I look at the IP number (e.g. IP-65 IP-66 and others.  This would be an ip-00 - it has holes in the plastic case an exposed compoents for the photosensor.  It should only be used on indoor installs, while it's feature set is great for outdoor work.Leviton could have made a more professional device by just adding the outdoor ability.  I would have to enclose this in something to use it outside thus raising my cost and probably making the product not work as designed.In summary it could be improved by incorporating 12-60 VDC and 12-477 VAC as well as making it at least IP-65 or IP-66 rated.For climate controlled indoor lighting with windows its fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XBGRCR7HIFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Y8JL80#wasThisHelpful","R14XBGRCR7HIFV","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those electricians not doing low voltage work and familiar with the leviton decora system, this is their low voltage equivalent.  In fact, they make a quickport plate that will go into a wall box and take up a decore slot allowing you to have power on one side and low voltage on the other (while you could cover this with a 4 opening decora cover, I'd recommend 2 separate boxes inside the wall so that you do not voilate any codes and have inspection problems!)Quickport allows you to stuff a box (literally) as full as you want with phone, ethernet (colored too!), fax (same as phone), antenna (rooftop type 75 ohm), CCTV (BNC barrels - female to female), and now we have the option of HDMI.I did take off one star due to pricepoint.  I bought a female to female HDMI connector here on amazon (even think it was a prime item) for $3.95 - that means the retail price on this has about $11 markup for the quickport compatibility.In the end however, while it adds to the job parts cost, it makes a professional view instead of a ""bunch of cables to wall port"" outlet with everything comming out of one tiny dryer vent looking connection.  If you have to lowbid a job - those parts tend to get used alot with splices like the 3.95 female to female hdmi.  For a multi million dollar home, quickport is the minimum you should use!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36UDMR6JIWWPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZAO9PC#wasThisHelpful","R36UDMR6JIWWPU","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product has some really nice features and has undergone recent redesign which is why I am updating the review.  Note that the included tripod is a promotional item now and not meant for this dolly (when I ordered mine they did not include the free tripod, but I spoke with the manufacturer who said it was a promo item).  Other redesigned features are the multiple leg grips.  The wheels are large and smooth running on flat surfaces, about like medical wheeled carts.  At 39 bucks instead of over a hundred its a great buy.Nice:  Everything is adjustable.Nice:  Wheels are big and smooth - the system folds up 2 of the 3 arms and had locking pegs that snap in/out to keep it that way.  It's as compact as it can get be and comes with a gear bag to fit.Nice:  Adapters to ""grab"" your tripod leg are adjustable in length from center and also in size of the tripod leg tip.Nice:  smooth rolling with the big wheels without setting up track or other professional systems.I was anxious to get it out of the box, which seemed a bit small on the porch, and I found 3 boxes - the amazon brown box with the swosh logo, a white inner box, and then a color printed box inside the white box. It was well protected in shipment at a time when many amazon shipments arrived damaged.  That tripple packaging is nice to see again at this pricepoint so you do not have to re-ship a bent or damaged product.Hope that helps - while it fits most midsize tripods, it is lacking an inch for a fully stabilized Manfrotto 190CXPRO3 3-Section Pro Carbon Fiber Tripod without Head which is called a 3 section tripod, but that means 1 section is permanently part of the tripod and 2 more drop out - that's why I call it a 2 section  - you only have to adjust down 2 quick release pieces.  I don't consider the permanent piece at the top a ""section"" since it sets the fixed angles you can adjust to - all the way down to 90 degree splits if you want, but manfrotto's locked angles are too rigid to use with this dolly.  One size larger would fit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNKULRRDE5B5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YB862E#wasThisHelpful","R3VNKULRRDE5B5","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wrote the review below these 3 nitpicks and one nice feature were discovered in the actual install.  (the review was based on our choice of cameras from all the available models and features, plus compatibility with our NAS and thus was anticipated - what really happened deserves a second mention)  While no major changes, there are a few gotchas we felt worth mentioning after the project was running.  The 3 nitpicks are in ascending order of severity.  I've taken photos of 1 and 2 and can upload them after I finish playing with the new toy.The camera is now running on the public net at camera dot uwave dot com.  If you would like a guest tour, look me up in the reviewers page and email me for a login.Nitpick 1 - the USB jack is designed for their wireless version and while all other connectors go out the ""back"" of the camera, the usb plug has a permanent right angle so it goes ""up"" (if the camera sits on a table, then it is up - on a ceiling it would be down).Nitpick 2 - the cutsheet showed the nice screw connector array that is common on alarm equipment to hookup external alarm inputs and use the units' outputs - we've seen this on alot of products.  Tha actual product used a heavy metal funky connector (that could be a song title for geeks) that you can not find the mate to it anywhere.  I was a tad irritated because our choice of this camera was partiallly based on how easy it would be to add a PIR motion sensor.  The 12VDC, 2A supply does have a 3 pin green connector like I mentioned (if you want to use 24 vac from a transformer, you use the center and opposite unused pin from the 12V DC side - this allows both ac (from a transformer) or dc operation - nicely done and not a real nitpick there but they should have used the same connector for the I/O ability!Nitpick 3 is probably the most serious--------------------------------------They advertise that you will be able to see your images on your iphone or android smartphones.  As I have one I thought this would be great.  Well not quite.Actually you can download the FREE software to make it work.  Inside the carton there is an activation code.  DONT LOOSE IT.  Also, it expires in 12 months from when you activate it.  As we had not planned on using this feature as our NAS does it natively its not a big deal, however I would have liked it if they said ""free 1 year subscription to handheld phone software"" which would have been much more honest.  I may dock them one star for this gimick.  (BTW the boxes come with seals on both edges to make sure they have not been opened and had the license removed - otherwise you gotta buy it)  After evaluating our NAS's viewer and the custom viewer/ptz controller for the camera, it's worth having their custom app for your phone.  I'd like to have it for more than 12 months though.A note on power - this comes in an external power and POE  version with differing prices. For those inquiring minds - I will check pins 4,5 and 7,8 on the connector after it is powered up (we bought the external power supply instead of POE) to see if there is any difference other than the connector.  I seem to recall the POE models cost more and did not come with a poe insterter so you had to have a hub - don't quote me on that as prices vary as to included kit contents.Pleasantry:  They included a 5 foot network cable in the box.  That will get us through testing but is not long enough for final planned installation location.(review below was written from the cut sheet of the product and the plans and approvals of our NAS - a synology DS1511+ Synology DiskStation 5-Bay (Diskless) Scalable Network Attached Storage DS1511+ (Black) which comes with a free POE license.  After the unit finally arrived we got a chance to do the installation.  At least synology's POE camera license is good for 1 unit FOREVER and does not expire in a year!Old CCTV systems usually relied on power line 24VAC - 60 hz power - to synchonize all cameras to the 30 line video siglal(or 25 hz if overseas).  Next came DVRs which used a 1/2 to 1 TB disk to store CIF level images on disk for 4-16 cameras at 30 fps.  Now with just an ethernet cat5e cable and plug you can send hdtv quality digitial images instead of the old signals we've grown accustomed to with interferance and fuzzy resolution.  This model supports IR illumination for 0lux visibility and has multiple internet connectivity (to NAS raid arrays, to a PC with a hard disk array, or to a smart phone / tablet) with the added plus you get notified right away and you can steer the PTZ only when necessary - this also cuts down the wear on the parts compared with the outdated NTSC cameras that did a ""patrol"" watching separate spots for a given time, then moving to the next one in a predictable pattern.  With some of the high MP (5-10 megapixel) cameras and fisheye lenses you can ""patrol"" with zero moving parts just by selecting which pixels get read from the sensor, then correcting for the lens aberation.  Axis makes a sophisticated model that amazon sells with this ability - ptz and no moving parts to wear out.  This model is much less expensive yet still has ptz (pan 340 degrees, tilt, and a small zoom)Compro has brought alot of features to an indoor camera (ptz, IR, alarms, cell phone, etc) at a very low price point.  I'll put some snapshots up after I get it wired into my nas and working.  I use a Synology DiskStation 5-Bay (Diskless) Scalable Network Attached Storage DS1511+ (Black) with 3TB x 5 drives for 15 TB internally.  It also accepts the alarm video feed from the camera and records it to disk with phenominal length of recording depending on how many frames / second you want to capture.  The system even captures sound and can deliver sound with the custom software!Previously with CCTV you had to run a separate coax line for a microphone, and typically the DVR would only accept a line level input so you had to have a mic to line amplifier plus a microphone for every camera.  Doing this digitally accepts a mic level input - but you must put your own speaker on the speaker output 3.5mm plug.  With the configuration software there are virtually an infinate number of configurations of the camera, along with up to 63 more units.  The synology 1511+ Synology DiskStation 5-Bay (Diskless) Scalable Network Attached Storage DS1511+ (Black) will talk to the camera directly without a pc in between running their software which is helpful in environments where you dont want to leave a pc running all the time but want 24x7 camera coverage.On the cons side,The sound quality is not quite as good as the old cctv unit, but it also digitally stored the audio so its really a tradeoff.  One part I did not like is that you get a pink and light green jack for mic/speaker - which means you need an amplified speaker and a microphone with a 3.5 mm jack to use it.You need to decide if you want a wallwart powering your camera, or if you want to power it with POE (different models)The old CCTV systems cameras were generally more vandal resistant than this is but given a big enough baseball bat you'll break either one.On the pros side,The picture size and quality of the digital system is far superior to the old 540 line (best!) CCTV analog system.  You can get 720 lines in one resolution, and some cameras support 1080P full HD.  Anyone with a nice HD TV would really appreciate the HDTV quality.With POE installation there is only one cord - it carries power into the camera and data out of the camera to the monitoring station and storage array. (POE units have a P at the end of the p/n)sound is carried over the data line (but see cons above)with a well engineered configuration all you will need is a camera and an ethernet cable to install it (assuming it is run from a POE hub) saving the extra wiring cost ofsumary:-------Digital surveilance cameras such as the IP540 create sharper end results which have much more detailed results and are easier to install on NAS or PCs/Apples.  As an added benefit, installing a surveilance camera is no more difficult than plugging something into the network (esp if you have a POE network port).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFIDGBVMC4EV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M69IBU#wasThisHelpful","R1QFIDGBVMC4EV","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The decision of a SR90 or SR92 (2200 lm vs 1700 lm  - but 1 emitter vs 3) is tough.The factors I considered before settling on the SR92 versus the SR90 were:1 - failure modes.  If the single emitter in the BEAUTIFULLY focused SR90 were to fail - then thats it - no light at all.  At least a single failure in the 92 gives you 2/3 lights working2 - price.  The 90 is almost $80 more, but MUCH better focused (to the point the air lights up) - the 1700 will do that too, but for people who want a wide beamspread to the side it's the better choice - for people who want one bright spot in the center, then the 90 is the only way to go.They were having a sale at the place I purchased mine for december - buy a light and get as many battery packs (handles) as you want for 30 bucks ea.  That's alot better than $110 which is why I did not purchase it from amazon.  Otherwise there seems to be some price fixing with about 5% leeway.  Had amazon done the 30 buck handle deal I would have bought it here instead.3 - 18650 cell - I've absolutely fallen in love with this battery since it came out in some of the cheap $10 led single light units.  I quickly bought the fenix TK30 Fenix TK30 630 Lumen LED Flashlight which is a pleasure to charge with just 2 18650 cells and runs forever with the ~9-10V output from the 2 18650 cells stacked feeding the digital regulator.  In fact I think the TK30 was the light that finally drove battery mfgrs to make button topped 18650's.  At the same time the 3000 mah (3AH!) 18650 came out from ultrafire which make the tk30 a long time performer.Now O-Light uses 6 ea of the 18650 cells, but instead of the 3000 mah cell they are using the 2200 mah (cheap) cell and housing them in the handle which changes as a single unit.  For $60 I bought TWO extra handles on their december sale, which gives me 3 total with the one that came with the light.  That handle has 6.6 AH at 7.4 Volts, almost 49 watt hours!Basically if you want pros/cons there are plenty of bothPros:the 1700 lm is well distributed across a broad areathe 6 cell 18650 pack is swapped as a single unit saving time (same for 90 and 92)the 92 is a tad smaller giving a more compact unit with no lack of total outputIf one LED fails, 2 of the 3 will still work in ""limp home"" modeWeighs a little less than the 90's huge focusing headConsthe spread out beam is not nearly as concentrated in the center as the -90's tightly focused beambattery packs are the same (a wash) (but the 30 buck sale is just december)it's Just Not the brightest light out there, but still plenty brightEvensBattery packs are the same 90 vs 92digital regulator is the same (pushes to get modes, etc) 90 vs 92Personally, with the drop in the handle price and the less expensive head, it crossed my threshold of buying ANOTHER light, with 2 backup battery packs.  As always personal factors are the most important in buying these things - I like the fact I can charge a handle / battery while off the head and use another one - it's one of olights' neat features I appreciate.

"The Axis Q19 series cameras use an uncooled system of thermal detectors arranged in a 384x288 array.  While this is nowhere near the high resolutions possible with HD POE IP cameras, the picture (black and white) is unaffected by day/night/smoke as it is purely based on thermal data.  This camera should not be thought of as a method of identification (facial, license plates, etc) but rather detecting movement.  All people will appear the same since the human body is roughly the same temperature.  Against a background that is a different temperature, people stand out, as do vehicles with hot exhaust and engines or machinery in operation.In a well designed security system using digital cameras, the Q19 offers the ability to DETECT motion over a wide area while other more conventional IP cameras can be used to identify faces or license plates with high definition optical systems.  In effect, the Q19 is used as a trigger to record the output from multiple other cameras.  In this role, it is best ordered with the 10 degree lens which gives you the widest field of view.  While long distances can be monitored with the 60 degree lens, no identifying features will ever be made out, so the longer telephoto lenses are just giving you the ability to detect movement at 3000 feet, if your job requires it (e.g. boarder patrol systems)Most conventional usage with the 10 degree lens over a wide area would use the reliable thermal images from the Q19 camera to detect motion and start recording data from multiple other conventional IP cams inside its field of view.  This triggering ability can be configured in the IP monitoring and logging software.  Essentially the Q19 is a motion detector covering a large area if equipped with the 10 degree lens option, and the other cameras are positioned within the q19's field of view, up close with higher definitions and color feeds to give identification.  Each motion event from the Q19 can cause 4-6 IP cams to record their sectors during the event giving usable pictures of what happened.Don't expect to identify one person from another with this camera as all people look the same in a thermal image.  Teaming it with a well layed out IP cam system and software will yield at least one IP stream of color HD data that can clearly make out the person or vehicle that entered monitored space.  In designing the Q19's position, it needs to be behind all other cameras that record high quality video when the Q19 senses motion - the 10 degree lens will cover a wide area.  The Q19 is immune to falling leaves, insects, and other moving objects that are at the same temperature as the background - this makes it an ideal camera to reduce the number of false alarms, e.g. from moving tree branches near a roadway.  It will only sense motion on the vehicles or people.Although the Q19 is still an expensive IP camera, it's price and feature set are still far better than previous thermal options only 3 years old, which would run 30K USD or more.  Teamed with the proper software and storage it dramatically reduces the false alarm problems with regular IP camera systems and saves disk space with fewer events recorded in a day.  This is a special purpose product designed to be part of a complete IP camera system (see example images in pictures)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NT2YBJZLIVHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046TDLLG#wasThisHelpful","R1NT2YBJZLIVHC","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Xantrex is most noted for their INVERTERS - changing DC power into AC sine or pseudo-sine wave 110/220 volt output.  Xantrex also makes a nice line of 12/24 volt high amperage chargers for those batteries that need a charge after providing 110VAC for beach parties, portable DJ work, and tailgate use, among other applications like power tool operation etc.Xantrex uses a switch mode charger which is A) efficient, B) Quiet, and C) gets the job done fast with 60 amps of charge current.  Most car batery chargers in this price line are only 7 amps or so and take forever to recharge a deep cycle battery.One note, however,  be sure that you have enough batteries in parallel to split the load amongst them.  If you had for example, a 12V, 80AH, single cell battery - this charger would recharge at a rate of 0.8 C - not healthy for long lasting cells.  If you parallel 10 ea of the same 80 amp hour batteries, you would only deliver 13.3333 Amp to each battery making a twice as fast as the 7 AH charger and maintain the efficiency.  Plus this charger would not boil off the electrolyte - a common problem with wet cell storage.  Besides, 10 x 80 amp hour batteries would make a great ballast for your boat!just dont try to pump 60 amps into a single battery and you'll be fine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GP5HR8R653ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OZ385A#wasThisHelpful","R2GP5HR8R653ZP","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"funny thing about UV light - it breaks down the DNA/RNA in bacteria for sterilization and imparts energy from the light to nullify viruses.  It does the same thing to the surrounding holder - and there isn't a UV-PROOF plastic that can take a year's worth of exposure before breakdown (where water squirts out of the crack in the plastic making a big mess)So if your SYSTEM came with a plastic uv light holder - watch out! someday the plastic will fail and you'll have RO water (at least it is clean) running all over the place.But if your inside of the holder shows signs of yellowing or discoloration at the time of relamping (yearly for most of this size UV system) consider just replacing  your plastic housing, bulb, and ballast that came with the unit with a new one.  They plug right in and you don't need to be a plumber to insert the tubing.Stainless steel is unaffected by uv exposure and should last for years!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTTNRLOA1G7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001768Q5C#wasThisHelpful","RPTTNRLOA1G7Y","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To understand this review you must know a simple thing about injection molded plastic parts.  Virgin plastic pellets are always the best source material, they are heated up to melting then a plunger squirts a needed volume into a mold through a channel while forcing the air out a hole at the back.Knock off the piece of plastic that was the input channel and the whole for air to escape and you have your part.Those wasted pieces go via a vacuum tube off to the regrind system and are chipped up into, well, chips that resemble the virgin pelets used to make the part.  Only these chips are not virgin, they have been melted once. Good mfgrs make the best parts from all virgin material, but that is not cost effective.  NON-OEM (aftermarket) mfrgs take the regrind chips and mix in some percentage of regrind with virgin pelets to make a lower grade of plastic.  In the end it all works, but customers of those products may notice an off-taste to the water through the plastic filter?  Why?  Every time the plastic is melted oils come out to the surface, and eventually they make it into the water - after 20 gallons of washwater the aftermarket will taste the same as the OEM filter does with virgin plastic and just 1/2  - 1 gallon of washwater.Some people can not even detect the taste, so for them aftermarket filters can lead to 40% savings.  Others can taste the difference (even the appearance is visually different from the regrind in plastics)Buying a 2 pack saves some money - not 40% by any means, but since my dad and I use the same filter, and at about the same rate, we buy the factory OEM filters by the 2 pack for savings and good taste.There are many more factors in doing injection molding I've left out - oils, release agents, FDA approved material being chosen overseas, etc - but it all plays into the part price and overall quality in the end.  It's a personal choice one must make.  I hope this helps - google ""injection molding"" regrind for more information about strength and other factors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R176R9HVZK03ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MNO8HC#wasThisHelpful","R176R9HVZK03ZR","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Take the post it restickable adhesive.  It was originally supposed to be a super strong spray adhesive with permanent setup!  Whoops.  Didn't hit the target with that one, but sprayed on a strip of paper and made into a pad it becane the POST IT we know today.Who knows how the command adhesive came about - a puddy based adhesive that allwed you to pull on the strip to remove it and replace it (if you kept it clean of dust where you used it, i.e. wipedown before application will extend the usefullness.I am amazed at the strength that command offers - the harder you pull the stronger it grabs on after an initial setup period.  And If I want to reloacte it - pull slowly on the bottom tab until it releases and its reusable.I may never know if command was an accidental puddy paste designed to stick forever or if they designed it to release ""on command"" - obviously MMM is not going to say ""another screwup that works better doing something else from our clever marketing department!""  I'm betting command was designed for its purpose - it just works too well and holds on too strong.  I seriously doubt it was a mixup - probably designed to work this way from way one.It's great on the front door, in he kithcen , and the bath - just be sure to clean the application location so you can reuse it later and everything will be happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQL658D2OV5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CFLYU#wasThisHelpful","R1TQL658D2OV5E","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used roller cutters and fixed blade cutters before but this one really just worked well.  My wife and I had to make notes for our photos online to include in the thankyou notes that we handwrote to all our guests and I guess there is nothing more fustrating than writing [...] over and over and then telling them to click on the album and choose to download it or use the slideshow builtin.  besides that not everyone had a computer, so it would not be prudent to do it universally by hand.It might be etiquite faux pax but we included a slip of paper with the preprinted instructions to view the WONDERFUl photos we got (all 980 of them) from my on site business server.Making the slips involved cutting a page with the phrase pasted several times across and down into little pieces that could be dropped in to the thankyou note- the swingline smartcut did the job with no complaints even as the paper got 8 sheets thick in places to do the final cut.We also used it on some of the invites and some cards we had to stik into letters that needed a quick trim.Using the product we found that the production rate went up fast with two people using it - one person would lock down the paper and say go, the other person would slide the cutter upon hearing the word go.  We sliced through alot in no time.Overall, I'm very happy with this compared to the smaller 11x8 sizes from xacto that I have bought and used.  Xacto did not use a rotary blade but went with a poker sharp point on both sides - great for the first few usages bit after that  a new blade would sure cut better.  The swingline design is more like scissors with a moving cutting edge, so the wear is distributed over a longer area.

"My only nitpick with these is they are a tad too small, and not being a rubbery foam, they do not conform really on the first insertion, where they take on their shape and size.  I do wish I had longer units to put on to my ear speakers so that they could conform to my ear cannal, but as only the very tip conforms, i was having a hard time re-inserting them.  The problem seemed to be that I did not always insert my speakers the same rotation, and as a result I would crush the charcoal foam a second time rendering it, well, with no memory of the canal size and shape...If they were 3/8"" longer and continued the taper they have today, then the product would really rock.  On first insertion I found they got the seal I wanted but a gentle tug and a haphazard re-insertion meant that they got deformed.These would be ideal for people with latex or foam rubber allergies or for people who prefer the rigid properties of the carbon foam.  I'd be in that group - but want them 3/8"" longer to get my taper of the canal and then I'd be REALLY happy.  As they stand now all 3 sets included in the package are the same size, so its basically 3 chances to get it right and learn that there is not the ""memory"" concept found in other products like this.I may take some of the roll up earplugs from the range next time and carefully drill a 1/8 sound hole through the center, then adhere them to the speakers with some rubber cement and finally squeeze them down, push them in and let them expand.  I dont do this today because my shooting ""ears"" have an electronic impulse noise cutter and an ambient sound amplifier or attenuator that I can use to speak to the person next to me even if large caliber handguns are going off  - you loose a few sylables here and there but you get the message across without loud noises.  It would be relaxing to listen to music on my phone before a contest with ears over the top of these and my ear speakers inside.I think the product has some further development to make it perfect - but overall I liked the material and if made in a longer size i'd buy them for use.  I'd also mark an up orientation bump so I could find out which way is up if they fall out.  That would be easy to do if made longer - just squeze a bump into them.I hope that helps explain why they do not fit my deep ears..  Keep in mind that the sound tube extends 3/16 of an inch into the carbon foam so that part is useless leaving you with only the very end tips with are too small.I plan to add this product to my watched products and see if it changes over the next year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQ929701NS5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DKZP7A#wasThisHelpful","R2OQ929701NS5B","A203OCQQ12MAVT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203OCQQ12MAVT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And what's more is that the fun and excitement didn't really end there.

But what came of the batch was totally gross.  I can't even pretend that it tasted decent, and after we both stared at the kind of goopy mixture, we pretty much dared each other to try it, which...in all honesty...turned into a riot of laughter for both of us, as we ended up getting the whole family involved in drinking the nasty little mixtures!  In the end, we opted to put soft drink and koolaid in the droppers, and she definitely had fun with that!!!

Upon opening the package, you're met with a finely packaged product that really does give off the feeling of a very expensive watch as it's boxed up nicely, and has the majority of all the bells and whistles that make up a good product.  The black color itself is spectacular with a black chain linked band, and so far, even wearing this to work, has proved no scratches yet, which is amazing in itself as my husband manages to get anything scratched in less than a few seconds.  The Invicta watch also came to us with the time set already, so we did not have to fiddle with the buttons on the side; however, it did come with instructions that were very clear on how to get all areas set and ready to go.  I will say the fit leaves a lot to be desired though, and my husband is not a small man in any regard, as he's 6'2 and 245 pounds, but this watch was still way too large for his wrist!  It just dangled all over when completely closed, so we ended up having to get links removed in order for him to fit it correctly.

The colors really pop, and she loves all things pink, so this was perfect.  It comes with the instructions, the cute little butterfly remote control, two off brand batteries, and the vehicle with the pony on it.  We had the batteries in in record time, and as a side note I did purchase name brand batteries that we used instead so she'd have a longer play time with this toy.  She immediately started playing with the horses mane and tail, using her Barbie brush on it, but once we pressed a button and the wheels moved she freaked and attached the remote!  While very young, she definitely got the handle of the three button remote, and next thing we know, we had to be very careful where we stepped due to the little pony zooming around the living room and kitchen followed by a laughing two and a half year old!  Her older sister and cousin couldn't help themselves, and even they wanted to play with it, and started making ""obstacles"" that the little horse had to go around.The My Little Pony Remote Control vehicle was a huge hit with all of my nieces, and it seriously was one of the best toy's she received!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDIJ3MPM1BDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHYFHQE#wasThisHelpful","RHDIJ3MPM1BDQ","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hallmark angel necklace is absolutely beautiful, and truly defines a faith or inspiration piece that anyone would be happy to have in their jewelry collection.  When you receive the package, it's nicely contained in a pretty deep purple box with the Hallmark logo on the front of it, and inside is a small drawstring pouch in off white, with the Hallmark logo on the bag.  Again the presentation of the actual piece is very nice, and speaks of quality.  Once opened the angel necklace is in a small plastic bag, and while not the best for gift giving I still love the fact that this plastic bag keeps the necklace chain tangle free, and also keeps the pendant piece as the first thing seen.The chain itself has a good clasp on it, and I have no fear that it would break or fall apart, and the length is perfect for falling below the collar bone.  The actual pendant itself is very sparkly, with small stones that flow around the outline of the angel.  The gold heart the angel holds is one smooth piece, and flows so well with the silver hue.  I also love that the pendant isn't horribly big, but just the right size to showcase what it is, as well as look amazing with any attire.I highly recommend this angel pendant, and it would seriously make the perfect gift!  I would, personally, take it out of the plastic pouch before gift giving, but again I do love that the first thing they would see when opening it is the angel itself.  It's definitely a beautiful piece of jewelry, and seems like it would keep for a number of years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17AFERN0JQQMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0114KT1F4#wasThisHelpful","R17AFERN0JQQMX","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I searched high and low, and read multiple reviews on car seats before deciding on the Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35.  What I loved about this one is first of all the safety measures, the look, the quality, and the big winner was the fact that it was easy to unlock it from the base and go.  My husband and I already had an expensive name brand travel system given to us very early on by a family member so the thought of getting a new one wasn't in our minds.  However, now that our daughter is almost here we took it out of storage, and much to our horror the beautiful gift turned into a nightmare when we tried putting it together. I won't go into long detail, but let's just say it had a little too many parts, it was very heavy, there was no padding, and we struggled with trying to unlock it from the base as well as connect it to the stroller.  So needless to say we decided to go in a different direction, and that's when I started really hunting down a good car seat.Upon opening the package, I was truly amazed at the quality of the Graco SnugRide.  From looking at the super expensive one to the Graco, I was seriously stunned that this car seat looked that great just out of the box!  You can easily tell this wasn't something thrown together, but thought over, and the end result is something that I am very happy about.  The canopy works easily, just a tug to get it up or down, again great quality, the handle itself has a nice grey rubber grip, and the car seat as a whole feels very sturdy in my grip as well as light.  The boot is a wonderful addition since I'll be having my child during the cold season, and it comes off easily, but stays on perfectly.  The insert is beautiful in appearance, but I could see where I would need a better head support as it's not as fluffy, and I could imagine her little head flopping a little bit.  All the belts were easy to maneuver in and out of the slits provided, and they were also easy for us to unlock.  The big red button on the front of the base is where you can make sure your car seat is level, and I really did appreciate the level indicator as it was on point, precise, and easy to read and understand.  This car seat also includes a silver latch that is used in vehicles to help literally latch it in, and it was a breeze for us to put the base into the vehicle.  Once we got the car seat into the vehicle I pressed the red lever in the back of the car seat, and it popped out just as easily as could be!!!  After fighting with the other car seat, this was such a blessing, and I knew we had made the right choice in our selection.I feel our daughter will be very safe in the Graco SnugRide, and I truly do love the quality of it!  I did purchase the Nyssa color, and there are two warning labels built into the top side of each above her head, but that doesn't distract any from the beauty of the car seat.  And the last thing that I truly love is the fact that this car seat can be combined with any of the Click Connect strollers.  I already have my eye on the Graco Modes Stroller, as I love the fact I can take the whole seat out of it, and click the car seat in it's place.  No need to put the car seat on the stroller tray, and it's all basically as described...just an easy click of a button to pull it out or put it back on as I've already looked at it in store.Again I truly do recommend this car seat, but if you are a new mom, and totally confused by all the choices, just remember one basic tidbit...your child will more than likely outgrow the car seat very quickly.  Some people opt for a larger car seat that goes from infancy to toddler, but I like the fact that I can take the car seat out of my car, click it into the stroller, and not have to disturb her.  I also have an infant to toddler car seat, but again, I like the simplicity of this, and she'll use the bigger car seat later in life.  With how tiny I am, I feel she'll be able to use this for a long while, and after owning two car seats (Graco not included), I still think this one has the best quality, safety, and is the better choice for my little girl.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8JRDQT3TYGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTL0CAS#wasThisHelpful","R1L8JRDQT3TYGZ","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted something simple, and yet something that still invoked little girl for my newborn, and this set was right on target!  As there weren't many reviews I could find on this set, I went ahead and purchased a swatch of the materials, and quickly fell in love.  Upon receiving the set, I did get the three piece which includes a sheet, crib skirt, and the comforter, I was blown away by the sweet simplicity.  I do have a steamer, and managed to use it on the skirt to get the minimal wrinkles out of it, and after having it on her crib the rest of the wrinkles fell out in a short time frame.  As for the sheet itself, I washed it in baby detergent, and it came out fine before I placed it on the crib.  The sheet is very durable, with strong elastic, and while it does have a sheen I was worried about how silky it would be as I am having my child in the cold months.  Luckily the sheet does have a sheen, which makes it so pretty, but it also isn't thin at all.  It's pretty thick, and while it isn't cotton, I don't think I'll have any issues as it wasn't made up fully of true silky material or polyester.  The comforter is truly nice, and again I did pause before I bought this due to the netting that goes over the comforter.  But it's stitched on very well, and, again, looks great.  The underside is made up of a nice slightly fluffy material that shouldn't bother my little one's skin at all.  Currently I'll probably use the comforter more of a decoration than in actual use, as I can imagine cleaning spit up out of netting would be a hindrance, but, again, I don't see any issues with washing it.All that being said, the actual colors of this is not truly pink at all.  If you put a soft pink material up to this you will immediately notice that it's not the same color.  The pink on this three piece set is actually a soft peach color that has just a hint more of pink.  And while the skirting looks white, it completely isn't.  The hue is a soft cream color, not white.  I have a cherry wood crib and furniture, and the colors look great in her room.  I also did not use the curtains that you can purchase with this set, and opted for cream ruffled curtains that I purchased on Amazon, and it turned out beautifully!  I will order the bumper from another site, but in all the set looks beautiful.  I did notice some people commenting that the comforter doesn't feel great on the skin, but like I said, I will more than likely use it as decoration over the glider, or folded around the crib, and even if I would like to use it, I still feel that it would work just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29P47S7WOLKIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0HT6WC#wasThisHelpful","R29P47S7WOLKIW","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even the cover of They All Fall Down looked so creepy that I knew I had to read this book pronto!  Especially after reading the synopsis, and for the most part it did deliver.They All Fall Down starts with our heroine Mackenzie who is just your average type typical girl next door, whose striving to get through school so she can get on to better things, such as college, to where the memory of her beloved brothers death, and split family might be a thing of the past.  But everything turns around when she finds out that she is part of the schools much anticipated ""Hottie List.""  A list that only has ten of the hottest girls in the school, and Kenzie is still struggling to figure out how she managed to land on it...that is until the ultimate hottie himself, Josh, rolls up to her with a wicked smile that melts her brain.  Figuring the list is stupid, but could put her in the vicinity of Mr. Hottie Kenzie just goes along with it.  That is until the girls start having accidents...accidents that can't be explained, and when deaths start to occur rumors fly of a curse on the girls on the hottie list.  And if that isn't unnerving enough to Kenzie the bad boy at school now has his eye on her too, and while her blood may run hot at the thought of Josh, it's absolutely an inferno when Levi looks at her.  But all these thoughts go flying out of her head once the girls numbers start to dissipate, and she realizes she's next.  It's up to her and her loyal friends to help figure this mystery out before her time is up.This book truly had so much going for it!  Great characters that you rallied for, and each supporting character had a great personality that matched their actions, and were totally believable.  The main character was written well, and the plot was very good!  I love a great mystery, and this book really did hold my attention until the end.  The love interest wasn't actually bad at all, and I liked how it was written.  There was no true insta-love here, and I enjoyed that immensely!  I get so sick of that or a total love triangle, but Kenzie knew exactly what she wanted, and wasn't afraid to go for it, and yet, she understood some things needed to wait as the death of the girls on the list was more important, so the author did a great job there giving Kenzie a logical head.  That being said...the ending.  Wow.  I didn't see it going there at all, and it did get cheesy for me.  Totally cheesy.  Was it still a great read? Yes.  It truly was.  It had me on edge trying to see if it was a curse of it someone was behind all these deaths, and then how the other clues could fit in to the rest of it.  And I really did not see this going in the direction it took.  Which were all great things.  However, the end was just way too silly for me, and the author left the end open for a series.  I wont' give the ending away, but if you are expecting ghostly encounters, look elsewhere than They All Fall Down.  With all that being said, I still do recommend reading this book as it did have a lot of the elements I love, with a mystery thrown in, a little romance, adventure, and a girl who will try her hardest to kick butt or think herself out of a situation, plus a great set of characters.  The ending sucked, but it's just because I was waiting for a ghostly ending or someone who wanted revenge.  Even without that element and the weird line it took it was still a great book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23C6BGZW3HN0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCS2GZ8#wasThisHelpful","R23C6BGZW3HN0U","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Wrangler Women's Denim Jacket was exactly as described! This jacket is a darker wash, which I love, and has pockets, something else that I find a lot of other denim jackets do not offer. I'm always carrying something, and pockets are my dear friends, so I'm excited to have that luxury in this jacket.  As for the look, it truly looks great, very stylish with long sleeves, collar, silver buttons, and pretty stitching.  I also adore the fact that this jacket, while it will definitely protect my skin from cooler weather, is still so light!  The weight is barely there, and the jacket itself is so soft that it feels like a blanket for your skin!  It is long sleeves, but again, it's so soft and super light, that it's a breeze to fold up the sleeves to mid length. No issues there at all, and once you do roll the sleeves up, they stay all day!  No slippage at all.  I am a very short and tiny female, so I will say if you are super tiny, think extra small, the small still won't fit as well as it would on someone who is a true small. I'm currently eight months pregnant so it fits fine, but I know that after I have my child it will look a little large on me.  Otherwise, this is a great jacket, super chic, and I highly recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WUC0ECYII5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012TVP72S#wasThisHelpful","R10WUC0ECYII5Y","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Gypsy Ruffled Panel curtains are absolutely stunning!  I was a little cautious after reading some of the reviews, but went ahead and purchased them for our baby's nursery room.  I ordered the cream color, and a lot of people were saying these were more white, and I really needed cream to match her crib skirting, and I was so happy when I got these in!  I ordered two panels to cover her window, and as a side note we do have blinds up as these are sheer, and they worked perfectly!  Not only were they the same color as her crib skirt, again totally cream colored, not white, they were both the same size, with no loose threads or pulled threads.  I immediately put them up as I got home, and used a steamer to get out the wrinkles.  I did purchase the 84 length panels, and they fell to the floor exactly as pictured, and looked just like the picture (again, the picture shows more white than cream, but I assure you my panels were cream colored.)  The only thing I did not know before purchasing is that the material isn't fully smooth.  I don't exactly know how to come out and describe it, but the whole curtain has a texture to it versus a smooth fabric.  It still looks great, and from the short distance from the door to the curtains in her bedroom you honestly can't tell unless you're farther into the room.  I actually like the texture, and everyone who has seen my curtains seriously thought I spent a lot of money on them!  The ruffles are full, perfectly even from one panel to the other, and they have really tied her room together!  They're gorgeous and I totally recommend them!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MMYC8UQEMKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00851A2R2#wasThisHelpful","R39MMYC8UQEMKO","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live out in the country, and have beautiful trees surrounding our home...beautiful trees that love to shed their leaves on the house, in the gravel drive, and basically everywhere.  Raking is almost laughable, and our drive, and pretty much the whole yard is covered in loose crumbled leaves that love to stick to the soles of your shoes.  Which means my house, no matter if all shoes are properly left in the mud room, somehow ends up having little leaf pieces strewn about leaving me with a vacuum that almost always stays out.  I've tried numerous rugs, but even the strong bristled rugs can't seem to manage to keep the leaves on the rug and not on my floor.  It's so bad I have a rug on the outside steps before you walk in, and in the mudroom, still to avail.  So this time around I used the DII Industrial rug, and let me say this rug is very big, which I liked as more people can use it at once, and there's a larger area to stomp or rub your shoes on.  My husband put this outside to see if it would help, and after using it for a few days I've noticed an immense decrease in foliage in my house!!  Finally!!  The rug itself is more a deep blue/grey color with zig zag lines through it, and it's actually soft.  So soft that I scoffed at first that it was going to be one of those useless rugs.  Little did I realize the fibers seem to cling to the leaves on your shoes leaving my house almost fully leaf free!  My husband even moved the rug to the top step as our top step is very wide, and the grip on bottom has proven wonderful as it hasn't moved an inch, even with all the shoe rubbing before entering the house.  My inside rug is now nice and pretty without the additional leaves all over it, and my floors are staying clean for once.  This rug is definitely worth it, and we're already considering buying another one for the front door.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GF1EU0MI0XSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URLLUBK#wasThisHelpful","R1GF1EU0MI0XSD","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is definitely one handy, and beautiful espresso machine!  The red color truly pops in any kitchen, and it's a breeze to use!  Upon opening the package, I found the espresso machine to be fully and well packaged into the box, and there is literally no set up with this!  Everything is already done, and the only thing you would need to do before using is do a dummy batch of water through the system filtering any dirt or debris out of it.  The package also includes a manual, an order form plus shows the various espresso cups they have for purchase, 16 espresso cups, and it's supposed to have a milk frothier. Mine did not have one included at all, and that was a huge disappointment especially considering the cost of such a device.  As for using the espresso machine, again, that is highly easy to do.  Although I will say before use, I did take off the back water area, and washed it before we filled it with water.  Once we filled the tank up we put a large cup down, and I do love that there is a small area for a little cup that can be pushed up so a larger cup can sit on the bottom.  Once our large cup was in place, we easily rotated the silver button to put the max amount of water through it, and we waited a second while for the blinking light to stay on.  Once that was done all you need to do is push the button, and it heats up in seconds!!  I thought it would take a minute or so like our Keurig, but this bad boy was in literal seconds!  And talk about a steaming cup!  Wow!  The espresso is super hot when it's finished!  Once my husband and I finished pushing water through it (we did this three times), we were ready to go and brew our first cup of espresso!  I pulled down the little cup stand, got our cup ready, and pulled the lever up to open a small area on the top of the device where the cup goes in.  Unlike a Keurig the cup goes sideways, and I pressed the lever down, which closes the little area, and I put the silver dial on the setting I wanted, waited for the light to stop blinking, and then pressed the button in the middle of the silver dial.  Viola!  Instant espresso!  I love how it has a draining tray for those just in case spills, and the pure quality of this machine is perfect.  It's heavy, feels highly durable, and the espresso is delicious!  This is definitely a great buy for all those caffeine loving people, and, again, I truly do recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAK02MVYO7E9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2P04HW#wasThisHelpful","RAK02MVYO7E9O","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found that the Pantene Pro-V Weekly Rehab Creme works as it says.  It made my hair super silky, it did feel revitalized, it was definitely smoother than it normally is when I finish blow drying my hair.  In fact, I didn't even have to flat iron my hair it was so super straight.  But let me tell you about my hair before you make a snappy decision.  My hair is definitely long, reaching down to the middle of my back, layered all over from razored bangs to the sides being tapered, and my hair is also crazy straight.  But also crazy frizzy.  This is most likely a lovely combination of my heritage (Spanish, French, etc. so I do have a mix of wiry hair mixed in with super fine strands), the humid weather I live in, and the fact that I have to wash and dry my hair every morning which has damaged it.  Not to mention I do highlight my hair, and that has also helped the damage along.  So I thought I'd give this weekly creme a try to see if it could help my ends any keep my frizz at minimum.  And it actually worked!  After drying my hair it was definitely soft, smooth, and silky.  But unfortunately for me it was also unmanageable, as the creme made it so silky and fine that it didn't want to stay up, curl, or do anything but lay flat.  And I'm one of those people who need volume.  The totally flat look just doesn't do it for me.  I tried sprucing it up some, but my bangs were having none of it, and just fell flatly in my eye's instead of doing a cute swoop.  I eventually had to clip them up on one side to even make it look presentable.  And if you ask me how long does the product work, well let me start by reiterating that I do wash my hair every day, and I'm on day five after using the product, and my hair is still softer than it normally is.  The only thing I need to flat iron at the moment is just my ends. I do believe I will continue to use this product, but only on my ends, and not once a week, but perhaps once every two weeks, as it really does work, and makes my ends softer than they usually are.  However, if you do have fine hair, then I don't truly recommend it unless you have products that really help add volume.  Otherwise you will be left with super flat hair that sticks to your head.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JHWIYL01YBML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM9XTQ0#wasThisHelpful","R2JHWIYL01YBML","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quality of this dress is superb, and even after just a day on a hanger the few wrinkles that were in it fell out with ease.  I'm a 5'2 adult, weighing a whopping 93 pounds, and went with an XS, which is my normal size; however I am three months pregnant.  So I have a small bump, but nothing major.  That being said, yes this dress was too long for me, but most things are, and I just wore four inch wedges, and that did the trick since I got this to wear at work on even flooring.  It does almost drag the floor even with the wedges, but I'll probably hem it later as I have to do with most of my clothes.  As for the fit, it was great, with the crochet area hitting exactly where it should, and it looks amazing.  The slit is pretty high, and I can imagine if someone was the proper height for the dress that it would show a lot of thigh.  As it is, on my short frame, the slit does come up higher than I like,especially for work purposes, about mid thigh, and I'll probably sew a few little threads to get the slit a little shorter.  I can still easily wear a strapless bra with this, and it can't be seen so the arm areas, and around the back are all very secure and not so showy.  I did read other reviewers who said you need to be stick straight to wear this, and this truly is point on.  Yes, I'm pregnant, but I barely have a baby bump, and my hips are still about the same size as before (I wear a 00 in  American Eagle...although I can't button my pants anymore. :0) )  and the dress was just a smidgen snug on my hips.  Once I got the material past my hips it was fine though, and I had excess room to maneuver, and it wasn't tight at all.  Very easy to sit, and move around. The dress also is not see through at all, and has two layers of material, the top layer being the pretty crinkle sheer material, while the material underneath is a smooth black that feels great to the touch.  I truly love this dress as it's easy to wear, looks great no matter the setting, work, party, an outing, beach wear it's highly versatile and comfortable! Due to the hip area being a bit snug, if you are pear shaped, you definitely want to go with a bigger size, but beware the top portion might not fit as designed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J9RO3695Q2TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K72IDV4#wasThisHelpful","R1J9RO3695Q2TQ","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Talk about a shocker when I opened the package!  This beautiful tennis bracelet looked pretty online, but in actually looking at it in person you'll be blown away by it's sparkling gems!!  This tennis bracelet is housed in Amazon's normal packaging, which includes a nicely designed dark blue box that opens with a little blue tab to reveal the actual black box that the bracelet is housed in.  Upon opening this box, you'll find the bracelet nestled within the two grooves that hold it secure.  The bracelet itself is pure stunning as I truly did not expect the opal hearts to glisten like they do!  It's like someone poured glitter in them!  They sparkle and shine in any light!  The actual clasp is one I've always loved, and felt to be highly secure where it locks into place first by pushing one side of the clasp into the other, and then on each side there is a small area that comes down to latch on to a tiny ball.  Again, it is highly secure, and I don't feel like it would accidentally come off.  The silver that encompasses the bracelet is Rhodium plated, which I am very sensitive to nickel, but I haven't found any issues with wearing this bracelet in skin sensitivity.  The only issue I honestly have is I have very skinny wrists so I have to be careful the bracelet doesn't accidentally slip off when my hand is down, but I have this issue with almost every bracelet.  Otherwise this opal tennis bracelet is a stunning gift, and every female at my work has asked where I've gotten it from as they all love the sparkle deep within the opal!  This is definitely one of my go to pieces now!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Y7TONUVI680/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFT81KS#wasThisHelpful","R5Y7TONUVI680","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Avent bottles, as every one I have bought seems to all work as directed, and has helped my child during feedings.  The Philips Avent Classic Plus bottles for babies three months or older is definitely among the best out there for babies in this age range.  For starters these unique bottles have a concentrated air flow valve which helps so much in preventing gas, less burping, and helps to reduce colic.  In using these bottles I have found that my little one has a lot less gas than previously, which is great!  The nipples on this bottle are also designed for babies around the three month age range, and have an awesome little air valve in each one.  When my child is drinking, I find there are no issues at all, and burping afterwards is not the process it once was.  These bottles are also easy to clean, and they truly work great!!  I definitely recommend them as I find they do not spill, close easily, are durable, and work just like it's described!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A37Z8PGBQ7SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF8ACIM#wasThisHelpful","R1A37Z8PGBQ7SR","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Evenflo Convertible Car Seat is definitely made up of great quality material for a low cost, which is something everyone is looking for.  It's a great size, with enough room for small babies to toddlers, and I love the fact that it is fully padded, and seems to be highly comfortable for baby.  It does include an adjustable harness, which is great depending on the height of your child, and even the padding for the head can be lowered and is fully adjustable.  It also comes with a massively padded insert for smaller babies, and works pretty well.  I did find that it is pretty floppy on the sides, and not 100% stable for the babies head.  But it still works as it should.  The only thing I found relatively misleading is that I thought it would be able to recline, but it does not.  Which means it doesn't fully meet my needs yet as my child is still a baby, and it needs to recline.  And don't get me wrong, the car seat can recline up to a point, but not the recline that I thought it would be.  It's more manual in that regard.  And also, if you have an infant, you definitely want a carrier that comes out of the vehicle easily with the baby inside while he or she is still sleeping.  Otherwise you'd have to carry an additional car seat or bassinet style stroller while out and about.  So I would totally give this 3 1/2 stars for an infant to baby use.  Now for a toddler, this is actually quite perfect!  I found the headrest that is already connected in the seat to be great, still a little floppy on the sides, but nothing horrible.  It's durable, cleans easily, and I feel my child is totally safe!  As for moving this car seat around, I am a tiny female, and find that it is a little difficult for me to move it around.  Another feature I love is that the car seat, while it doesn't have a built in drink holder, did come with a little travel cup holder that fold up easily.  This was a cute little feature, although I do wish it had one built into it.  And lastly, I did order the blue color, and wound up with a tan/black color instead.  It still works for my purposes, but I thought that was odd considering there are only two colors on the actual website, blue or red.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231KPQAU4QWZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8RQTW4#wasThisHelpful","R231KPQAU4QWZG","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband is avid into sports, from fishing to hunting, and loves to workout, which means a lot of running outside.  He's been complaining lately though that the sunglasses he currently had kept slipping down on his runs, and ultimately hurt the bridge of his nose after long periods of time.  So when I saw the Under Armour sunglasses, I thought this would be perfect for him, and it truly is!  These glasses, for starters, are the perfect shade for outdoor activities!  Not only do they cut the glare tremendously (I know because I stole them for a little while, while I worked outside in the yard), but they aren't so hideously dark that you can't see where you're going.  They are the perfect color, giving a bit of a yellow cast that still enables a person to see clearly, effectively, and yet helps sensitive eyes out tremendously by cutting glare. There also is no frame under the glasses, which I find helps out on seeing everything clearly also.As for the fit...I have never seen a pair of glasses fit my husband so exquisitely! The description read that it has rubberized grips on the frame area that goes above your ears, and I kept thinking that really rubberized silicone type material, but that is so not the case!  The rubber is rubber, yes, but it doesn't feel rubberized in the lest.  In fact it feels more like a hard plastic, yet has the flexibility of rubber.  There are also little grooves in the rubber like material along the inner sides that would help to conform the glasses to your head as well as provide airflow.  In the inside of the glasses, there is also another square type rubberized piece of material that fits on the bridge of your nose so the glasses do not fit flat on your face.  These ridges help secure the glasses to his face, while also providing a good amount of airflow from between his eye's and the glasses.  Our weather get's highly hot, even around Spring time, and yet he has had no trouble running in these as they do not slip at all, nor has sweating caused an issue with the glasses or his eye's.  And the factor he does love the most is the upside down glasses on the hat.  He wears a hat all the time, and it's very easy for him to place it on his head, so it doesn't accidentally get crumpled in his pocket or hooked on his shirt. We've also found the Under Armour glasses to be pretty darn durable, as he did accidentally drop them (by hooking them in his shirt), onto hard concrete, and there was no damage whatsoever.  And he is a tall man, 6'3, so it definitely fell from a good distance.And lastly, the overall look of these glasses is fantastic, and I found, after a few family members ""had"" to try them on, looked good on everyone!  It's a basic design, but has so much flair that you can tell immediately they are made of great quality material, and will last a good long while.  They're perfect for exercising, and any outdoor sport activity, and I definitely recommend them as well as want a pair of my own!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6FC0JXKTSSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SM2LSQ8#wasThisHelpful","RU6FC0JXKTSSX","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been eyeing Panic for a while now, as I loved Oliver's Delirium series, but kept seeing the reviews that were so/so.  In the end I decided to go for it as I do love her style of writing, and I had a free credit for an audio book.  (FYI, Sarah Drew does fab on narrating if anyone chooses to listen versus read the book.)Panic definitely is something different.  It focuses on Heather, and her small group of friends that mainly consist of her best friend Natalie, a new friend/ally Dodge, and Bishop, her other best friend whom she's also secretly in love with.  Not to mention there are a slew of other characters that help set the tone for the book. But Panic, to Heather and her friends, is a game that is played by Senior's in a series of anonymous texts, calls, and messages for the duration of the summer all for a huge lump sum of money for the winner, or last one left standing.  Heather always thought the games were stupid, but in a sudden rush she joins in alongside Natalie.  And soon it's only will that makes her stay, and the drive to win the money to help her take care of her little sister.  But in order to get to the end Heather will have to learn to rely on her instincts, learn to trust more, and especially to trust in herself.Again, I am glad I did read this book, but the ending!!!  I felt like I waited forever to finally see how it ends, and when it happens it's over and done with in barely a few pages!  Yes, explanations are given all the way around so there is no cliff hanger and everything is nice and neat and tidy, but the fact that the ending was very anticlimactic really put a damper on the book.  The characters were all written well, and I liked how we were able to see Heather grow in maturity, but some of the other characters actually put me off. Natalie was rude a lot of the time, and I didn't like her demeanor at all.  She was very weak, and should never have made it in the games in the first place.  Dodge was even wishy washy as his motives weren't great, and while there was an ending, it just didn't really clear everything out about Dodge.  Did he forgive the guy?  I mean, what happened with that?  I did like Bishop's characters, and of course a few other secondary characters as well, and as for the plot it truly was good. I can even see how a dangerous game would be played, and kept secret from adults, meaning the plot wasn't horribly farfetched. I did enjoy it, I just wish the ending would've answered a few more questions, and perhaps been drawn out a little more than it was.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13NHTB7A2OA50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB3D5NC#wasThisHelpful","R13NHTB7A2OA50","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had some very severe misgivings about this device as I know tons of people who have had something similar, and it didn't get such a great response.  In fact, more of them opted to use a regular curling iron or hair straightner versus a three in one heating tool.  But I love to curl my long board straight hair, and it just takes so long to do it in the mornings that I decided to give it a go.And I am so happy I did!  For starters I have long layered hair that's incredibly oily, which means I wash it every morning before work.  That being said once I finish blow drying my hair does resemble a frizzy poodle (because seriously, who in their right mind has the time to dry section by section salon style?). On top of all this my hair is super baby fine, loves to get tangled, and I mean rat's nest tangled in less than five seconds with minimal head movement, and it's thinish.  Which also means I hate using the tangle free sprays (such as It's a Ten) as it normally makes my hair stick to my face with no volume at all. And let's not forget the fact that I am horrible at fixing hair.  But with this InStyler Max with two way rotating iron, I am seriously the queen of hairstyles right now.The InStyler comes in nice packaging, with everything tidied away in their own little plastic baggies.  It comes with the rotating iron, a plastic barrel guard that easily clicks into place (for all those of us with butterfingers), instruction manual, small heat shielding mat that you can lay the tool on, wide comb with separator on the end for easily separating hair, and a little nib that goes on top of the barrel.  The InStyler tool itself is made up of two parts.  One side features the rotating barrel, and below the barrel towards the bottom is the power button, and above that is an area that glows.  You press the power button once for max heat, and three more times for lower settings.  The next time you press the power button, it turns the device off. That being said the instructions are pure useless.  They show you little diagrams, and I ended up looking online for different uses.  I also followed along with the InStyler off so I could first get a feel of how to curl or straighten my hair.Once that was done, I was ready, and put it on the lowest setting.  In my first try I decided to straighten, and literally had about five minutes before I had to leave for work.  So I quickly grabbed small handfuls of my hair, and slid the device down my length pretty quickly.  And imagine my shock when my very quick straighten session turned my hair into beautiful silk!  It lasted all day, and that includes with humid weather.  Next time I tried this I tried adding volume to just the top of my head and swerve the device under once I get to the bottom of my hair to swing it in.  That was incredibly easy, and again was done in no time at all!!  As for curling, this is where I had the most trouble in learning how to use the device.  I had to wrap my long pieces around the barrel, and close it, which activates the rotary, and then slide it down while continuing to twist my hand around.  I ended up with really cute curls, and for the shorter layers I couldn't twirl them around the barrel, so I ended up wrapping it the best I could, and twirling it like I would a normal curling iron.  The results were fantastic!!I truly love this device, and it is now my one stop shop!  It works very well on my hair, and I could see if working easily on thick hair also.  It'll probably take a lot longer to curl or style than my hair, but I feel it is worth it!  Definitely a keeper!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R172D37QFBYOZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5N5KZO#wasThisHelpful","R172D37QFBYOZC","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a flipping story!  I love all things fantasy with adventure, a speck of romance, danger, and of course witty dialogue, and great characters, and The Girl at Midnight did not disappoint!Our adventure starts off with a young girl named Echo, who is human in every way possible.  Even if that humanity includes living in a secret room in a library, and having friends who definitely couldn't be classified as the human variety with their feathers and plumage.  But Echo never truly felt like she fit in with her friends or the community as her flawless skin betrays her species even though her guardian, the Ala, is like a mother to her.  And when Ala asks her to go on a dangerous quest to find a mystical creature that could put an end to a war that is centuries in the making with their adversaries, Echo doesn't even hesitate.  But little does Echo realize that this journey will be full of danger, deception, and violence, but also peace, unity, and friendship in ways that she could not even attempt to imagine.There's no way that I want to give away the total synopsis of the book, but I will say the characters were written so well, that by the time I reached the final few pages I was at a loss of wanting to know the ending, and yet not wanting the book to end! Again, the characters were wonderful, and I truly empathized with each one of them, and I love the fact that the book goes from one character to another's point of view seamlessly, and it gives the story that much more of a background, and you end up feeling as if you really know the characters.  The plot was superb, even though I did guess the ending, but it was such an adventure getting to the end that you honestly don't care, and can't wait to see it play out.  I also love that the book does end, with no massive cliffhanger, but does leave it open for the next installment nicely.  This is definitely going on my top shelf as one of the best reads this year!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q75VLPVQZL18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574465X#wasThisHelpful","R1Q75VLPVQZL18","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge lover of the AVENT bottles, and have bought these for nieces and nephews, besides my own child, and have always had positive results with them.  These AVENT bottles are truly made up of great quality, and they are the perfect size for either preemies or newborns!  I love that they have measuring marks on each side of the bottle, and it's just the right size so measuring is almost redundant in this cute little bottles.  These do come with tops that have a nice little thumbprint impression on the side, which helps to easily get the top off, and the nipples are great on this!  I have had no issues whatsoever in getting my child to take the bottle, and what I like even more is that this has a slow flow of milk to the baby, which really helps their digestive system and reduces the chance of babies having colic.  I also haven't had any issues of the nipple sinking into the bottle, and these truly are a breeze to clean.  I love these bottles, and will definitely purchase more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DXBOSXH2ATXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF83R8E#wasThisHelpful","R2DXBOSXH2ATXT","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who doesn't love a good suspense story filled with creepy things such as a huge manor house filled with mystery, a cemetery with numerous unmarked graves, and a legend of untold horror surrounding the home?  It's nearly the perfect setting for a great tale, but unfortunately for me, Haunted was so disjointed with a plot seen a mile away, that I was totally bored with this tale.Phoebe is our heroine here, a young girl whose family moved to her stepdads massive estate, because of some horrible deed she did that she just can't seem to remember.  In tow is her young toddler half-sister, Tabby, whom she loves to bits, but also who seemed to steal the spotlight from her.  An avid swimmer, Phoebe is stoked to find out there is a community pool, and immediately goes for a relaxing swim.  That is until she meets a total cutie in the form of Miles, also an avid swimmer who tells her of a legend that surrounds the mansion she now lives in.  In its horrid tale, the mistress of the estate, Madame Arnaud seemingly found the mixture for eternal youth, and ruled over her estate with a tight fist and abject cruelty.  And now with fresh souls in the house, Madame Arnaud is starting to show herself, and it's all Phoebe can do to try to keep those she loves safe.I really, really wanted to like Haunted, but it just wasn't for me.  I did like the characters, and felt they were hashed out pretty well; however, it was the plot that truly left a bad taste in my mouth.  First of all for the villain, you're totally left trying to figure out is it a ghost, still alive, and if so where has it been hiding all this time?  There were a lot of unanswered questions regarding that amid other things.  I truly did dislike the disjointed areas where Phoebe mysteriously started remembering about past things, or managed to wind up somewhere with no recollection of how she got there.  It was very apparent what was going on, but it drove me nuts when the scene just stopped to go to something else.  And the horrible deeds that the villain does just felt like a rip off of a certain figure in history.  As soon as it came out what the person does I immediately thought about that individual, and it seriously made the book take a nose dive into boo land for me.  Seriously, there was no originality here.  And the ending?  Wow.  Talk about anticlimactic.  I was waiting for the villain to pop up again, but nope.  Apparently the weak way the villain bit the dust was it, and the actual ending leaves off with an ending, but there is supposed to be other books in the series.  For me, Haunted was nothing special, with no true suspense, and I rated it a three star basically for the effort of the author.  I would definitely not recommend this unless you want a headache trying to follow Phoebe's memories/reality or don't mind a book that is unoriginal with no scary suspense or mystery really in it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PWSCQE0YNZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617736260#wasThisHelpful","R20PWSCQE0YNZV","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally don't venture too far in my brands, and have always stuck with one in particular for my tampon needs especially, but I always felt that I wasn't getting the right amount of protection, and decided to give the Playtex sport combo pack a try.And I'm so glad I did!  I am very active, always on my feet, and I love to exercise at least three to four times a week, which includes a lot of cardio so the sport theme to this fit my body type perfectly.  The pack itself includes 18 tampons, with eight of them being super, and ten of them being regular, and fourteen pads with wings.  In using the tampons, I always have to pack a super for just the first and second day, and I do like that these are plastic (seriously, THE only way to go), and that the bottom portion of the plastic is ribbed enabling a good grip.  That might sounds silly, but I have butterfingers as it is, and any extra grip is always welcome.  Again, the applicator is great, and these tampons are unscented, which helps if you are sensitive in that area, which I am.  As for the actual pads, I loved these so much!!  I cannot wear a tampon for long periods of time, so during the day it gets plugged, and during the night I switch to pads, and I am seriously in love with these!  They, like normal pads, adhere with adhesive, and are easy to put on, and I swear they do not budge!  The wings go perfectly around my panties with no issues whatsoever, and I love the thin feeling of this pad!  I didn't actually think it would hold much, but let me say that I ended up using these on a lazy Saturday, just to see, and it held up wonderfully! I ended up doing outside work that day, and it never moved or bunched at all, and I stayed nice and dry.  I do love that you can buy one box, and you're set for the month without having to buy boxes of everything.

"My teeth have never been sensitive until recently when ice cream decided to invade the nerves in my tooth causing definite pain.  So I started checking out various toothpastes that provide help for sensitivity, and I came across this unique pen/toothbrush combo.  For starters the toothbrush itself is quite nice, and perfect for those with sensitivity issues as it is labeled extra soft to help with sensitivity while brushing.  The bristles truly are highly soft, but I still feel like I get very clean teeth and gums as, while the bristles are very, very soft, they still manage to get the nasty of my teeth with relative ease.  It also helps that there are plastic pieces in the bristles that help to remove plaque as well.  The opposite side of the brush also has raised rubberized areas that help clean the inside of cheeks too, which is a nice feature.  There is a large blue rubber grip in the middle of the toothbrush, which feels great on the tip of my thumb, and helps provide good a good grip.  The interesting part of this toothbrush is that the bottom is large, and hollowed out.  This allows for the thin Sensitivity Relief Pen to slip inside, in a unique little hideaway.The pen itself is very slender, with a removable plastic cap on one end.  Once the cap is removed, you can easily twist the bottom cap (which also is used as the ""end"" cap of the toothbrush making it look seamless once put together), and after just two twist the sensitivity medication is on the tip.  You simply apply to the area that needs it, and that's about it!  Just slip the pen back into the toothbrush and you're done.  Having used this for about four days I can tell a difference already in cold foods.  I had no issue in hot liquids or hot food on my tooth, just cold things like ice cream, and so far this has worked.  I don't feel the sensitivity like I used to, but keep in mind I have also switched my toothpaste to one that is proven good for sensitive teeth.  But combining both these factors has definitely made my tooth feel like normal again, and I'm no longer afraid to eat cold treats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QJZNM692NGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCW6NR2#wasThisHelpful","R20QJZNM692NGF","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd definitely give this 3 1/2 to 4 stars as it serves the purposes I need it to, which is for holding various reports at work.  I used to have about seven plastic folders scrunched together above my desk to hold all my reports in, but I wanted something that took up less room, looked nice (or business oriented), and still held a fair amount of paper.  And the Fellowes Bankers Box worked perfectly for my needs.I already knew before buying this that it is made up of pure cardboard.  And while some people rate this as heavy duty cardboard, and some say it's lightweight, it's basically the same consistency as a normal box you'd get in the mail from ordering something. Strong enough to hold things, but it is cardboard just the same.  I was very excited when I got this in, and immediately started putting it together, and I swear I can seriously not be the only person who couldn't figure out how to close the back of this.  I got so frustrated I took out some craft duct tape in a nice blue color and attacked the back until I had a nice seal. And this comes from someone who is used to putting together large banker boxes from the same company.  I don't know what went wrong there, but I will say duct tape works nicely, and since my letter sorter is situated with it's back to a wall no one can see it.  As for putting the rest of it together that was a breeze!  Simply fold the inside inserts in half, make sure the side with the majority of white is facing up, push up/down the side areas, and slide it in on the bottom.  Do that with the next two inserts, and your ready to do the same thing (folding in half and folding the up/down tabs in the right direction), to the middle insert.  I did have to work this part in to make it fit, but it still wasn't that difficult.  I folded the sides of the actual box inward on all sides, then attached the plastic bars to the inserts, and that was it!My box is done, and it looks pretty good.  Not fantastic as you can totally tell it's cardboard, but it still looks decent, and, again, serves my purpose.  It does have eight compartments, and it does come with a small thing of labels to write on and stick on the plastic bars.  I choose to print normal size labels, and cut them to fit onto the bar, which just looked more professional to me, especially since my hand writing sucks.As for how much paper this can hold...it holds a pretty good amount!  I managed to put a ream of paper in the bottom area as that totally would have weighed it down, and quite possibly broken it, but I have thick reports in the other's about thirty pages, and that's literally nothing to what it can hold!  So if you are in the market for a sorter or something to help keep you organized, then I do totally recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A36AC622CH5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2LIMKA#wasThisHelpful","R3A36AC622CH5M","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have an XBox One that is stuffed in our entertainment center along with all our other electronics, which includes a dvr, Playstation, Wii, etc., and while we do have vented slots for the devices, it can get pretty warm with them on, especially when two or more devices are running at the same time.  We've actually started putting the XBox on top of the entertainment center, which isn't grand in looks, but it helps with the heating issue.  We finally got the Antec X-1 Cooler for the XBox One, and so far, we are in total love with it!  The design of the cooler is honestly one of my main loves for this device.  The front of an XBox One has a beautiful glossy right side to it, and the Antec cooler not only fits perfectly on top of it, but it literally looks like one device versus two.  It's so seamless in design!  It also spouts a nice temperature digital readout on the very top of the device in blue, which is a nice added feature.  The fan is very quiet also, and we have managed to put the XBox back into our entertainment center, and we have definitely noticed it feels less warm in the inside versus when we didn't have an external fan on it.  The box states that the cooler is supposed to make the heat less by thirty percent, and I honestly feel that is pretty darn accurate.  I'm glad we got this, as it definitely does make the XBox cooler, and it helped us to have it in a place we liked versus sitting out on top of our entertainment center.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8J5PO8LQRDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P45U43O#wasThisHelpful","R3L8J5PO8LQRDS","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adore a good YA mystery that's over flowing with suspense, and The Third Twin just sounded like a massively great story that incorporates tons of toe curling excitement!  And it was...to a point...The Third Twin begins with a, you guessed it, set of twins who look fully identical unless you know them, Ava and Lexi.  Lexi is our heroine here, a senior in high school whose book smart, and has little time for frivolity as she has her eye on a college that her adopted dad went to.  But even Lexi needs to have a little fun every now and then, and that’s when things start to get interesting, as Ava and Lexi felt they needed an escape every now and then from their lives.  So they invented Alicia.  The “third” twin.  This twin is super cool, beautiful, confident, has an don’t-even attitude, and always dates boys that they probably shouldn’t.  It’s all fun and games to them.  Until Lexi is ready to quit as she’s found a boy that she truly likes…but how to come clean about Alicia, and show him her true nerdy self?  And while Lexi is trying to figure that out, the news headline blares on of a horrific murder.  Of a boy that she just went out with as Alicia.  And if that wasn’t enough, detectives are now pounding on the door wanting to talk to Alicia…a person who shouldn’t…doesn’t exist.  And yet…she’s in the police departments records.  With a maddening twist Lexi must quickly find out who the murderer is as the police are looking at her, and Lexi has a bad feeling that the murders aren’t over yet.I went into The Third Twin truly expecting to be biting my nails to the quick in the thick of the suspense, but truly, it wasn’t really all that suspenseful.  There was a certain creep factor, but not enough to fully suck me in.  I did love the characters, as they were portrayed nicely, but I did have one flaw with Lexi, and that was her sheer stupidity.  You ever watch a scary movie, and yell at the tv telling the characters to NOT go in that door??  That was basically like this.  Lexi did things that weren’t that smart, and if there was a murderer on the loose then stay in groups, and do not, for the love of all that is good, go out in a dark alley by yourself!  Sheesh!!!  The plot was pretty good, but again, you could see things coming at Lexi a mile away while she still stumbled through them. If it wasn’t for a good friend, she’d really be in a lot of trouble.  The villain wasn’t someone I thought of, but the author pretty much screams it to Lexi at one point, but Lexi still walks away blindly not realizing it until pages later.  *ugh*  So again, it was a good story, and I’m glad I did read it; however I went into this with way too much expectation.  I do recommend it though as it was a fun, light read, but just know that the suspense and thrill factor are pretty watered down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SO3EPJD6L7VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PCYN2#wasThisHelpful","R1SO3EPJD6L7VQ","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the cutest comforter ever featuring Star Wars characters!  From the actual picture online I was ready for darker hues, and I was totally surprised when I opened it to reveal much more colorful embellishments that I originally thought!The comforter itself is made of a pretty thick polyester material that's very soft to the touch, and highly comfortable against the skin.  I did wash it before putting it on the bed, and I had no issues at all from that department.  It still retained it's shape well, and there was no bleeding of colors or anything like that, but I did wash it in cold water, and also air dried it.  The Star Wars comforter does include two pillow shams, and the comforter itself, and per the tag is for either a twin or full size bed. I actually have this on a full size bed, and to my happy surprise it actually covers the mattress perfectly!  I did put on a grey skirting, and in putting that on it truly set a nice tone for the bed, and dressed it up even more.  As for the color, like I said it was much lighter than the picture truly shows.  The blues pop in color, the gold is more bright yellow, and even the blacks that are in the picture seem to have an overall lighter feel to it.  So be aware that it isn't truly all black as the picture shows.  It's got a definite pop of color all over it and the block design of the characters works well in the overall scheme.  Again, this comforter feels great, and truly does feel durable, is washable, and still retains is shape without having lumpy middles.  That might change after so many washings, but for right now it still looks great and vibrant!  A definite for any Star Wars fan!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EV336T2QPSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4ONER0#wasThisHelpful","R1EV336T2QPSP","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My niece loves crafts of all kinds, and I knew this would be perfect for her as she loves to show off her craft making skills, and what better way than to be able to wear her crafts?!  She immediately delved into this, and started putting pieces together.  The kit does include the necessary items to make five necklaces, which is basically five chains, five pendants, a hand full of caps for the necklace, which was great as they liked to roll away from us, five claps, a bead, and stickers.  I wish they would've included more beads as my niece gave me a look when she saw it, and immediately went to her craft station and pulled out more decorative beads of the same size.  Making the actual necklaces was literally a snap and a two part process.  The first is choosing a sticker for the pendant and putting the pendant together.  The next step is putting it on the chain and attaching the caps and clasp to it.  My niece is eight years old, and while I did ask her if she needed help with the chain, she is persistent enough that she managed to put it together herself after only a few minutes.We both truly enjoyed this craft as I ""helped"" her choose between the various sticker designs, but it was over very quickly!  We actually added beads on a few necklaces, which helped make the project longer, but it was still a pretty short craft project.  But I will say that she absolutely loved it, and couldn't wait to show off her necklaces to her family, and even presented a few members with their very own creations.  The necklace craft also was sealed very nicely so parts didn't fly all over the place once it was opened.Again, this was a short craft, but she still loved putting it all together, and the necklaces do look adorable!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTIVBRCGS8LB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZYQN7A#wasThisHelpful","RTIVBRCGS8LB0","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have always tried to keep an extra cell phone ""floater"" around the house for those emergency issues...like when my husband decided his brand new Iphone's screen was just a little too perfect and accidentally dropped a 90 pound weight on it.  Needless to say, with it being a new phone, the turnaround time to get a new one through insurance was over three weeks.  And that didn't include the days it took just to get the information to the insurance company.So for those purposes I definitely checked out the Blu Android phone, and I have to say, I'm pretty impressed.  The phone itself arrived in a nice little boxed package, and once opened the phone is nice and tidy in its little compartment.  Pulling up the phone, you'll find beneath it earbuds with a small controller on the side of one of the wires, a USB cable, a screen protector, a thin rubberized black case, the wall plug, and a manual.As soon as I unwrapped all the accessories, I immediately put the screen protector on, which has two sides.  Pull off the 1st side just a little bit, and stick this side to the phone, sliding your fingers down the phone to smooth it on.  Then after that's complete, smooth out any bubbles.  This screen protector did not come with a cleaning cloth or a cardboard piece, so I just used the screen protector packaging to get rid of any bubbles. Once that's done, easily pull back the 2nd tab, and your done with that part.The next part of this was inserting my SIM card, which was a breeze.  The back of this phone is so seamless that it took me a second to find where I could pop the back off, which is located on the bottom right.  There is the smallest of depressions in the corner of the case where I had to use my nail to pull up.  The back of the case finally lifted enough where I could easily pull it fully off.  And once off, there are two slots, two for SIM cards, and one for a Micro SD card.  Again, it was easy to slide my SIM card in, and that was it!  The cover snaps back into place with little clicks, and it's back to looking seamless in seconds.  The back cover is also coated in a rubberized material to prevent sliding on smooth surfaces and makes my grip feel very secure.This phone does have a built in battery, so beware of that factor if you're not keen on it.  I don't mind it at all, and I do have to say that even with a built in battery this phone is so very light!!!  It feels like it weighs nothing at all!  The overall design is, again, seamless in appearance, with no apparent buttons anywhere on the front.  The sides and bottom/top of the device has a beautiful silver trim that encompasses the power and volume buttons.  It's so tied into the design that you register the barest ""bump"" of a button.  These buttons are very easy to press and the cell phone responds perfectly with just the barest touch.This phone is an Android, and many people are upset with the whole lollipop factor, but this phone runs smoothly, and I'm one of those people who like to wait anyway to update to new software so the kinks can get worked out. That being said, this phone runs so quietly without any hiccups at all!  In normal Android fashion this phone has all the basic functions already on the home page for you such as the phone, gallery, the play store, google search, messages, contacts, etc.  It also has tons of widgets for customizing screens, and pressing any apps instantly bring it to life within seconds.  There is literally a very low lag time with this phone, which is great! Again, as we are using this phone as a floater, I didn't download much to it, except for basic stuff and a video streaming app.  The screen is massively clear with great quality as I did watch a few videos on youtube as well as watched a series on my video streaming app.  It worked great, and looked fantastic on the five inch screen! The camera works very well and it also has very cool built in photo shopping effects as well as various selections for exposure, quality, etc.  The front facing camera is only a 2MP, so the quality isn't fantastic, but it still works fine.The rubberized case that comes with the phone is very thin, and won't really offer drop protection. This is just for basic wear and tear that comes from sliding it on a desk, or dropping it into a purse.  I would totally recommend getting a new case especially as I don't like the little rubberized raised areas over the power and volume buttons.  It makes them a little hard to operate for me.As for actually sending and receiving calls, our network provider already has good service, and the phone worked as normal with no dropped calls or static over the line.  I could easily hear people on the other line, and they could hear me as well with no issues.I truly like the Blu cellphone, and while this is supposed to be a floater, I've pretty much confiscated it, and am currently using it as my every day cell phone.  The screen is bright, crystal clear, the calls are perfect, and I love the size, and the weight of this device.  It is seriously easy to carry, and works perfectly.  I definitely recommend this phone if you need a floater or want a new cell phone without forking over a kidney.  It definitely carries itself well, and the quality is perfect for the price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAPSIMEKSQGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZEFDH8#wasThisHelpful","R1LAPSIMEKSQGK","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this product for my husband as a birthday present, and he never drives anywhere without it!  This little bad boy is so small that it doesn't get in the way of driving or distract from your view, which is great!  The suction cup adheres to both of our vehicles nicely, with no issues whatsoever.  It's also so easy to use!  Either charge it with the included cables, or use the included cigarette charger with it in the vehicle, and that's it!  It's ready to go!  It's also very user friendly with only four little buttons on the bottom of the large screen that do everything from going through the menu to going back or forwards through the menu selection as well as take pictures, etc.  The Garmin Dash Cam also has a wide viewing angle, which really helps as it clearly takes video of all sides of the road.  We've used this dash cam at night, during the day, and during nasty weather, and it still features such a bright screen that manages to get everything clearly.  I love the fact that it also does audio and that you can turn off audio easily with one click of a button.  You can also change the vast amount of settings from everything to the display brightness to how long you want the display on to sounds, etc.  It does display the battery up top, and also the amount of time it's recording. In the mornings I will plug it up in the vehicle, and it pops on without me having to press the power button.  It also records in four minutes increments, and does detect any accidents with a high pitched beep.  It scared the living mess out of me first as we live down a bumpy road, and it did ""detect"" accidents because of the bumpy ride.  So if you hit a pothole or drive down a bumpy path then it will more than likely detect an accident and save the recording.  It also detects if an accident might be imminent as I had a vehicle pull out in front of me turning in the opposite lane, and it did beep.The recordings that we've had so far are all very clear, and look great, and even the pictures we've taken just to test it out all come back with good quality.I definitely recommend this product if you have a long commute or travel often, and the first day it was installed in my husbands vehicle he actually recorded three almost wrecks from other individuals.  I did buy a 32 GB card to go with this product, and I do recommend it so you have extra room to house videos.  It's definitely been a good product for us!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPQ0PCCNZGHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFMN40O#wasThisHelpful","R2YPQ0PCCNZGHK","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in serious need of a padded bag for my new 13 inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, and didn't want to pay an arm, a leg, and half a kidney for one as all the bags I saw were pretty pricey and overly big. I'm not a student, and don't bring my laptop out much, and when I do there is only minimal stuff I'll bring with it, so, again, I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but yet I still wanted good protection for my device. So when I saw the Uncommon bag I decided to go for it, and I'm quite happy I did.The Uncommon bag is very small (seriously, I had doubts my laptop would fit in there at first), but has loads of zippered pockets all over it, which is something I truly wanted to stash cables, wires, chargers, etc. The inside of the bag features a beautiful bright blue material that has a specified padded area for your laptop to go into, and a black piece of fabric attached to one side of the bag that Velcros to the divider holding your laptop securely in place.  I do have a Speck clear case on my laptop, and it did fit totally fine, but I would watch anything thicker.  I believe you could still put your laptop in a very thin neoprene sleeve, and still be able to stash it in the laptop area of the bag, but watch out for anything thicker as it probably won't fit.  That being said, it again is nicely padded, not thickly so with stiff padding, but enough to make me feel like my laptop is totally protected.  After the divider there is a nice open space for a notebook (in my case the charger), and on the opposite side is pockets for pens and cell phones as well as a pouch area for small items.From there the outside of the bag is full of pure happiness as it's covered in a pretty darn feeling tough material that wipes off easily.  I know this because I went out with my laptop while it was drizzling, and the water was very easy to wipe off, and I had no fear it would get to my laptop through all the padding.One side of the bag features a large full length zippered compartment that's perfect for tons of thin items, or even an Ipad, but I would be very fearful of having such an expensive device in a zippered outside pocket versus inside, but that's just me.  Again it's the full length of the bag and there is plenty of room in it for thin type items.  On front of this pocket is a little slant that houses another open pocket that's pretty long, and is perfect for a small pencil bag, or breath mints, tissues, any small items.  Just keep in mind it is not zippered but an open deep pocket so stuff can fall out if you're not careful.On the other side of the bag is another full length zippered pocket, and I will say even the zippers on this bag were well thought out as the tabs are large and easy to hold.  They're also that same beautiful blue color as the inside of the bag.  The top of the bag is zippered as well, and features two handles for easy carrying.  These handles are regular material that you'd normally see, but they are also infused with extra padded material that, again, feels so strong that I have no fear of loose stitching.  The Uncommon bag does have two small metal tabs on each end, both securely attached to the bag where the long strap can attach to. The strap itself is made up of normal strap material with good stitching, and a padded shoulder area that can be moved to accommodate different heights.  The strap itself is movable for the same reason, and I love the fact that the hooks on each end of the strap feel very sturdy, and they rotate.  So if you grab your bag up quickly there is no need to try to straighten the straps before putting it on as the clasps will rotate easily for easy shifting of the straps.Currently I have my MacBook Pro in there, again, with a Speck case on, as well as the charger, a wireless mouse, and a notebook in the actual bag area.  In the front zippered area I have a cleaning cloth in a pouch for my screen, and a small zippered pencil case.  In the other side I have another small notebook.  What I love is that while small and filled with all those items, there's still room for more stuff.  Albeit, it will have to be thin or small items, but there is still room.  I am a small female, only 5'2, and barley top 100 pounds soaking wet, and this bag looks perfect on me.  My husband who is 6'2 and huge still makes this bag look good, and it doesn't look like a weird little thing next to him, which is great as he carries it a lot for me.  The color is also a very dark navy blue on the front and back with a black top, black handles and strap, as well as a beautiful bright blue inside and accent colors for the zippers and logo.This is seriously the best bag for me, and while small still holds an amazing amount of items!  I love the fact that it didn't cost much, is easy to carry, the strap is very comfortable, and it's a very secure, padded bag, that I feel will last a long time!  Great product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14YUBVJYGI79N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEQ123K#wasThisHelpful","R14YUBVJYGI79N","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I swear A Court of Thorns and Roses was like watching a movie that had a mixture of Beauty and the Beast, Hunger Games, and Lord of the Rings rolled into one.  My brain was seriously doing a happy dance.Feyre is a mortal girl, just nineteen years of age, who has only known pain, suffering, hunger, and resentment for the faerie beings who enslaved their kind years ago, and ultimately put a wall between their people and mere mortals by decree of a peace treaty between the two species.  No one had heard or saw a faerie in years, but still people are wary, and never go near the wall.  But Feyre has a family to feed, a father and two older sisters who rely on her expertise at hunting to keep them alive through the harsh winter months.  So Feyre edges deeper into the forest than she's ever been, and it's here that she makes the mistake that will change her life forever.  For a single arrow loosed into a creature that surely couldn't be fae has sealed her fate.  In a frightful encounter a beast, who has come to demand amends for his friend's life, gives her two choices.  One is to die a quick and bloody death from his razor sharp claws...and the second...is to live in the fae world forever, and never step a foot back onto mortal soil.  With literally no other choice Feyre sets on her journey with the beast, and is in for a massive shock when she realizes the fae world isn't the dark and hideous place she imagined.  And the beast is definitely not what she imagined either as he transforms into the most handsome fae man she has ever seen.  But not all is right in this beautiful fae world, and too soon Feyre realizes that some beauty simply hides pure evil.  And if she is to survive this new world she must gather and use all her wits, learn to trust her own instincts, and most importantly...hide her softening heart.I almost felt slightly biased in writing a review for A Court of Thorns and Roses as I totally adored the Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas, and this has along the same theme.  The characters here were portrayed nicely, and I totally fell in love with the side characters such as Rhys and Lucien.  Seriously, I loved all the characters, and, if I'm being totally honest, my favorite characters were the villains.  I adore a good villain especially when it's those you love to hate, and Maas did a good job writing them. The plot was great, and moved along nicely, but I will totally admit to being completely bored in the middle of the book.  Nothing, and I mean nothing happened versus Feyre getting drunk, making goo-goo eyes at Tamlin, and a few side characters were introduced.  I was seriously getting sick of her mooing over him, and talking about the colors that surrounded her (she likes to paint).  Another thing I didn't truly find to my liking was the fact that she was supposed to be tough from years of hunting, but seriously we don't see her doing much till the end.  If I was in fae land with a warrior with creepy creatures that would like to eat me, I definitely would want to know how to use a knife or a sword.  Just saying. Also Throne of Glass was YA, but this book doesn't fit totally into that category.  Take out the sex, and then you definitely would have a YA novel on your hands, so be forewarned if you're looking into this series for a young teen.  Definitely for older teens and adults.  Again, I did love this book, loved the side characters, and the story line flowed pretty well.  I just got a little bored midway through, and wished Feyre would've shown just a little more gumption.  Luckily the book did pick up big time closer to the end, and while it doesn't leave us with a huge cliffhanger, there was something said that makes you wonder what will happen next.  I still liked this book a lot, even with the few shortcomings I found in Feyre, and I seriously can't wait to see what happens for our heroine in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GR0YG8M3NFM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619634449#wasThisHelpful","R3GR0YG8M3NFM8","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an amazing little five year old niece who attacked this play set like it was her new best friend!  In seconds we had the teacher ""desk,"" and student ""desk"" pulled down, and she was already scribbling away on the wash off boards!  This awesome set is, as many reviewers posted, cardboard.  So don't expect a high dollar play set, but yet, still expect that your kids are going to have a wonderful time playing with it!  The play set does include a small pointer, cool stickers that do not stick to any surfaces but the wash off boards, a neat little timer, a little eraser, dry erase markers, a teacher planner book, shapes, and a few dry erase boards with activities on them.  I did end up buying her extra colorful dry erase markers, and she did like those much better than the ones that came with it. I also printed off a few activity pages for teachers online to give to students, and extra little hall passes, and other teacher related handouts, and I have seriously never seen her so enthralled with a play set before!  Her older cousin came over, and they were both fighting over who got to be the teacher!  This set might be cardboard, and therefore I wouldn't recommend for younger kids who might be rough, but my two nieces had the best time ever with it, and they were still playing with it hours later!  This is definitely a cute play set that does have a handy little handle on the top, and the inside opens easily to place all the items back in for a neat storage solution.

"I have always used Biore Cleansing Pore Strips, and love the fact that they help remove blackheads from my nose area, and when I saw the Charcoal Pore Strips that helped excess oil I knew I had to try them!These nose strips are the polar opposite in looks compared to the normal nose strip as the charcoal laced strip is pure black with the material side still having that same texture, just in a darker hue due to the charcoal.  The reverse side of it that goes on your nose is pure black, but has that same smooth, silky feel as before. I would advise to totally make sure your hands are fully dried before touching this product!  I had a little water on my hands from wetting my nose, and when I touched the charcoal strips smooth side I had charcoal smeared all over my fingers.  It's just like a charcoal drawing pencil, but it does wash off easily.  Applying the nose strips are easy, and same as before, wash face, dry face, wet nose, (I always pull a little on the pre-made slits to open them so they can easily stretch to fit nicely across my nose), peel off the strip, and apply to your wet nose.  If you haven't used the product before, then you definitely want to know to push the material around the curvature of your nostril on both sides to get the material to stick, and work properly.  I find that when I don't do this I don't get near as good results as it doesn't fully adhere to the curve of my nostrils just by patting it on alone.  Normally I do let this dry for a full fifteen minutes before pulling it off, but because of the charcoal factor, I ended up pulling it off in eleven minutes just in case I had a reaction to it.  Needless to say, I found this product to work flawlessly!!  When I did the normal strips, it always left my nose with the nasty residue and made it feel weird.  With these charcoal nose strips, my nose felt very smooth and clean with only a little charcoal left on my nose where I applied it and it slid on my skin when I was pushing it around the curvature of my nose.  It was easily wiped off, but seriously these felt great on my nose, and my nose didn't feel stiff at all afterwards as it normally does with the regular pore strips!  As for the oil, I did this before I went to bed, and I have very oily skin, and I did notice that area wasn't as oily as it normally is, and throughout my day my nose did appear drier.  However, that only lasted a little while before it was back to normal.In all I truly like these nose strips better than the original, and will continue to buy these.  I also like the fact that it's so dark that you can easily see the results once the strip is pulled off.  On the normal ones you always had to look close to see if it even halfway worked, while on these charcoal ones you can definitely see the results.  In that end, I almost felt like these worked better, but, again, I know it's only because I could truly ""see"" the results on the dark material versus the lighter one.

Twylla seemingly has it all, a young peasant girl who was found as the vessel of a goddess as a child, and whisked away to the castle to live in relative peace...that is if you count the role she must play as executioner to traitors.  Because being the embodiment of a goddess also comes with the heavy price of drinking a vial of poison, living because of who you are to the gods, and yet having the poison ooze from your skin, and the slightest contact with a living individual would result in their instant death. Hugs are definitely not coming Twylla's way anytime soon.  So she lives a very solitary life, praying, sewing, killing, and having a so called friend in the only guard that continues to watch over her.  But on a fateful day he is taken ill, and a new guard, with a more than friendly smile, takes his place.  Never has her heart beat so fast from one kind smile from her new guard, but imagine her surprise when the prince returns, and has eyes only for her.  Twylla is in a very dire predicament as one false move could prove deadly in the eyes of the demented queen who rules with an iron fist.  With secrets abounding, and twist and turns at every corner, Twylla soon realizes that in order to have the peace she desires her role of executioner must come to an end.The Sin Eater's Daughter was a very unusual tale, and I will admit to totally being sucked into it from the very beginning.  It was nothing that I've personally read before, and the concepts were highly interesting of how life was lived at this court, and their customs, gods, and other beliefs as well as how the royals ruled.  I loved seeing that aspect, and I truly did love the characters in the book.  They were all well written, including the villain.  There were twist and turns that I totally did not see coming, and that just kept the book entertaining!  It is a short novel, but I do think it was perfectly written in length as adding anymore would more than likely just be extra fluff.  Again I loved the plot, but there was one weird part in how a story was set up that just seemed thrown in versus tied together.  I don't know if a sequel will be made, but it did leave it open in that regard, but there is definitely no cliffhanger here.  I will also say that I did get bored in the romance scenes, and skimmed over them, as I found Twylla to be too star struck, but that's just me.  The Sin Eater's Daughter was truly a good, light, short read, and it was very entertaining.  There are some areas where I found Twylla to be way too nave, but she was stuck in a castle with no friends, so I guess the naivety isn't too far off if in that situation.  Again, it was still a good read, and I do recommend it if you don't mind a tiny love triangle, that was basically one sided, a bit of romance, intrigue, and fantasy all mixed together!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36J8F573PZ69E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545810620#wasThisHelpful","R36J8F573PZ69E","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fun project that was really relaxing to do.  The kit comes with the canvas printed on it in a light color that the paint can overcome, along with paint brushes for detailing areas, the paint itself, a small picture of what the painting is supposed to look like when finished, and a large piece of folded paper that shows the picture with all the numbers on it for reference.  The canvas was folded in half, and then folded again, and I took the initiative from other reviewers on this brand of product, and ironed it gently before I started, which worked very nicely.  It didn't get all the lines out, but as I finished my painting you honestly can't see it any more.  There are some areas, such as areas in the water, and on the houses that aren't marked at all, and have this very light yellowish/khaki color on it.  In the actual picture online it shows the roofs with a mix of black and brown, and also near the waters edge, the colors are slightly different too.  So definitely know there is color variation in this painting, and won't look exactly like the original you see online.  The khaki color on the sides of the tree are also much darker in color.  There are paint pots in the rows with just dots on them, and I did read that these are for more detailing, and I will go back and paint the roofs and play around to get it a little more detail.  I find the boat on mine isn't that distinguishable as a boat, so I'll go back over it and try to even out some lines.  I also did go out and buy some extra tiny brushes, which definitely helped as the ones that come with it have long and thin strands, while I needed a paint brush with short strands for the tiny detail work.  This truly was a great, fun project, and I'm glad I bought it even though the colors weren't as pictured.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R102071KERK9CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQFOH8U#wasThisHelpful","R102071KERK9CJ","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Checking our blood pressure has always been in our routine, especially since both my husbands and my parents have high blood pressure.  And needless to say, we keep check of their blood pressure as well. The only thing I hated was actually having to write down our blood pressure to keep tabs on it.  But with the Omron 7 Series blood pressure monitor, that is now a thing of the past!Upon opening the device, you will find the blood pressure cuff, monitor, batteries for the device, and an instruction manual.  The first thing we did was read quickly through the manual, as they are pretty much all the same in regard to pressing a button to activate the device.  But we did according to the manual, set up the time and date, which was highly easy, and we were ready to go!  All the buttons on this device are definitely friendly as they are pretty large, and easy to press.  There is also a user 1, and a user 2 switch, which really made my day!  Because now we can keep track of his on user 1, and me on user 2.  The switch is easy to push, and easy to read so there is no mistaking which one I have it on.  The cuff itself feels great on my arm, and I am super skinny, but when the air puffs in it works fine, and I also don't feel like my arm is being squeezed off by a cobra.  My husband on the other hand, has very large biceps, and the cuff works perfectly on him too.  It only takes a few seconds for this monitor to get your results, and they are on the display in large clear numbers.  Another of my favorite things about the Omron blood pressure monitor is that you can download the app for it on your cell phone, or other device, and it will save your results!  All you have to do is enter a little information, and if you already took results on the monitor it's totally fine!  Just open the app, it will tell you to turn on your bluetooth, and you'll notice little squares on the display screen of the blood pressure monitor while it's pairing.  As soon as it finds your cell phone, the information syncs to your phone, and that's it!  All information is stored in your phone or other device for easy access!This has been the best blood pressure monitor, and my parents are already asking me for one as it's easy to use, with a clear distinct display, easy buttons to press, and it works great with definite accuracy!  I have another blood pressure monitor, and the results were always the same with perhaps a number or two different.  A definite great buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KLATW6IH3ETD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPQB2L0#wasThisHelpful","R2KLATW6IH3ETD","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very iffy on giving the rating I did simply because it does work as it's designed to; however I felt there were a few flaws.The Rapesco Flat Clinch Top Loading Stapler does the job it was supposed to for starters. It's a decent stapler, with a beautiful design in the dark blue color with grey accents on the bottom, and below the staple cavity.  It's very easy to open the top part for loading staples with no tugging or pulling as seen in other brands.  This is just a clean upward pull, and the top opens easily and smoothly.  Inside the staple cavity you will note that it is pretty small, and doesn't hold that many staples.  As a person who works in an office setting stapling invoices for the better part of the day, that means a lot of reloading, which can get annoying very quickly. When closing the stapler, I found that this is seriously the smoothest closing top half that I've come across.  There is barely a noticeable snick as the top half of the staple cavity clicks into place.  I really like that a lot as it's a smooth transition to close it.The Rapesco stapler's top half can also be pulled up with a much harder pull to allow for stapling on items such as a wall, cork board, etc. As for the bottom of the device, it features a smooth rubber type bottom with ridges to help with sliding on smooth surfaces, and the best feature of all on the bottom is a little window that houses a removable tab.  Once you pop off the tab at the bottom a little white card is available for you to write down your name.  I went ahead and printed my name on a label, and attached it to the white card.  It was easy to pop it back into place, and now no one will steal my stapler!  You may laugh, but I swear I have names on the majority of my office supplies so they don't grow legs and walk away.And lastly, for the actual stapling, it works just as any other stapler, but with staples that instead of curve, produce a nice straight line.  This really does help as I don't get stuck with staples any more.  It is, again, a smooth process of stapling papers with a simple click.  It states that you can do around 20-24 pieces of paper in one stack, and that's truly about right.  I did 22 pages, and while I wasn't bearing all my weight on it by any means, it still took a decent amount of pressure to get the staple through that many pages.  I did try 30 pages, and that was a no go as it only stuck my staple in the first few pages, not all the way through them.  The other issue that I found is that this stapler is larger in height than many normal office staplers, and I find that I have trouble trying to grab it off my desk and get my hand around it at times because of this.  I am a small female, with small hands, and while I can still staple items, it does take a little bit of fumbling for a second or two before I have it firmly grasped.  I also found the staples that came with it, when I tried getting the staple out that it did break in half, so they are pretty weak.  This does take normal staples for a regular stapler, so that's good, but I did have to break a line of staples up into sections as one whole line wouldn't fit in the chamber.  When a staple ended with the last one, and a new ""stack"" slid into place for stapling, it was an easy transition with no staples getting stuck either.The Rapesco Clinch Stapler is a good, small stapler that does come in handy, and I do love the fact that I can grab a stapled stack of invoices without getting stuck by sharp ends.  While it can't hold as many staples, it still holds enough, is light weight, and has that awesome name plate window!  Perhaps I'll get used to the larger grip on this one, but it definitely does replace my old regular stapler!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RFO7YPCSGWOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WNNSWI#wasThisHelpful","R1RFO7YPCSGWOV","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I personally believe you already have to like Ms. Black's style of writing before you even attempt to read her novels as they are not only gorgeously put together, but most times, so dark and twisted, you're not sure which end is up, and more often than not, you're left feeling slightly disturbed.  And The Dark Part of the Forest doesn't disappoint in this highly intoxicating, odd read!Instead of a normal fairytale, where fairies exist as beautiful little winged creatures that alight around you in glee, Black's fairies are more the type that will lull you with their beauty...then eat you in one gulp.  Much like her other tales, The Darkest Part of the Forest is both gritty and exciting, with dark undertones that easily suck a person in!Hazel and her brother Ben live in a town like no other, a town that holds mystery, a sense of other, shadows that seemingly shift before your eyes, and it's very own attraction that tourist flock to.  An attraction that held Hazel and Ben's attention from children to the teenagers they are now as they both still gape any time they are around the glass coffin in the woods that houses the most mysterious and magical creature of all.  A fiercely handsome boy asleep for centuries dressed in clothes of old, with the smoothest, milkiest skin, the darkest of hair, and the curviest horns protruding from his head to curl around his pointed ears.  This fairy boy has been the catalyst for many of their adventures as children, and soon, he will be the catalyst for one more as his glass coffin is found broken, with the fairy boy gone.  And while this information is rattling at the least, Hazel is even more shocked to wake up to find her bedroom window open, her feet covered in mud, and a cryptic message written on her wall.  Hazel's intuition tells her something is coming her way, and with the help of her crush, and Ben's best friend she hopes to unravel it, and it must be done quickly as her time is growing short to save those she holds dear.I adored The Darkest Part of the Forest so much that I have currently started reading it again!  The first time I listened to this story over audio, and the narrator did an amazingly awesome job with the voices! This time around, I'm actually reading the book, and it's just as good the second time!  The plot is spectacular, with both good and evil fighting a battle, and with Black, there's always a lot of gray areas in between those morals that make a person think.  I loved all the characters as each one brought a piece of something different to the tale, that made it that much more enchanting!  This book is also told mostly in Hazel's point of view, but it does switch to Ben a time or two.  Again, this book is definitely one of the best books I've read this year, and I hate that this one does end.  I almost wish it had a cliff hanger so I could read more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HUGXGOLP7B0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QL1804A#wasThisHelpful","R3HUGXGOLP7B0X","A2BYFGD27QAIOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BYFGD27QAIOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"5 Stars!I adore this author and her books. And this book is definitely a top read of 2015. Her books suck you in and take a hold of your heart and soul. I have read quite a few books by her and added more to my TBR and each time I come back, I am reminded why. Not only is this author an amazing writer, she is absolutely adorable and such a good person. This series is shaping up to be her best yet!I loved this book. It was sexy, sweet, fun, suspenseful, intense, passionate, and oh so very hot. This book was so amazing and I devoured it at one time. Adaline is a girl you can relate to and can't help but root for.

I though my kindle was going to catch on fire at times... because holy smoke the steam is intense!This is Emmit and Adaline's story. They were once in love and had it all... or so they thought. But when Adaline leaves Emmit, it not only breaks his heart but hers too. Now years later, they are coming face to face for the first time.

"4.5 Stars!What an amazing and original new series from this author! I fell in love with this author's rock star series so I was super excited to get an erotic novel from her. And book one blew me away, but this book... takes the top in this series. This book was sweet, sexy, naughty, sinfully delicious, quite suspenseful, and had a few twists along the way. I devoured this book in one sitting.This is Cassie and Tate’s story. Cassie and Tate are married and were once very much in love. Now, Tate wants a divorce and Cassie is completely blindsided. She still very much loves Tate but can't understand why he wants to give up what they have. But as she starts to try to get answers from her husband, she uncovers a truth she may not be ready for. Is their love worth fighting for?Enter Tate. Tate loves Cassie... always has and always will but he is keeping a secret from her that he feels could destroy her. So he does what he thinks is best by letting her go, even if it is the last thing he wants to do. But when the truth is revealed, he realizes he may have made a mistake. Is it too late to right his wrongs? Will he lose Cassie forever? Or is their love strong enough to withstand?I loved these two together. Sure, this book was steamy and sexy but it had beautiful message woven in their love story. Cassie and Tate are definitely soul mates and are meant to be but the past and secrets can always rip apart our futures when it has a bad hold over us. I was rooting for these two even when it seemed that they were too late. I am super exited for the next book in this series!I highly recommend this book.Blog Tour---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/11/blog-tour-review-giveaway-union-of-sin.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S9UF0C4H8HGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163Y1SIE#wasThisHelpful","R1S9UF0C4H8HGS","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I jumped head first because of the passion.. the fire.. the intensity... the dueling alpha males... yum! Nicole made me step out of my comfort zone in reading and I am forever thankful for that.This is Cam and Gannon‘s story. I loved their story.

"4 Stars!Sweet romance fans... this book is for you. This story was a great romance that made me swoon, laugh, and totally fall in love.

A second chance at what could be is in the future for Jaime and Emmett. It's been ten years since they crossed paths. It's been ten years that never lessened the chemistry and passion between them.

They were relatable and real, making their story and love just pour off of the pages. Their romance will speak to your soul and tie up your emotions.

"4 Stars!Great debut. I love reading books by first time authors... especially one that I connect with. And this book right here was everything to create a great contemporary romance. The angst was there. The steam was there. The romance was there. The passion was there.  This book intrigued me a lot. It teased my senses, making me glued to the book until I completely devoured it whole.This book was great. It kept me on the edge of my seat, desperately seeking a happy ending. It was intense, complicated, passionate, and had a second chance romance that was years in the making. While this book frustrated me at times, I like that this author was able to pull emotions from me and gave me an epic love story that will definitely be added to my reread pile for the future.This is Dean and Mia's story. Mia and Dean were once together until they were ripped apart. Now, its been ten years since they have seen each other. Mia is making some big changes in her life and when she see Dean again, she doesn't expect the feelings that resurface or resentment he still feels. But he passion between them is still simmering under the surface... threatening to expose.But the road for these two is not going to be easy. They will make you mad... like throw your kindle across the room mad. Is redemption possible when it almost seems impossible? One thing is for sure... hearts will be broken... tears will be shed... souls will be bared... truths will be told. If they want a chance again, they will have to lay the past to rest. Can these two find a happy ending?I recommend this book!Review Post---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/11/review-resentment-by-nicole-london.html","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQJT8WJWNI96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165WFUKG#wasThisHelpful","R2IQJT8WJWNI96","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars!Amazing novel! This book right here... completely rocked my panties off! It was sexy, sweet, fun, daring, intense, passionate, edgy, and completely captivated me from page one. I have read a few books by this author and I am here to say that this book takes the cake. This book is a part of a series but can be read as a complete standalone. I will say that I did not read book one and had no issues with this book though I will definitely be going back. Get ready to swoon and fall hard for Rogan.This book took me on an emotional roller coaster and had such a beautiful love story with such great underlying messages throughout the entire novel. This author did a fantastic job at pulling at my heartstrings while making my panties completely want to fly off. This love story shows the power of healing. This love story shows the strength in love. This love story will speak to your soul. Rogan and Katie will take your heart and completely steal it away, staying with you long after it's over.This is Katie and Rogan's story. When these two meet, it is an instant connection full of passion and fire. Katie is a girl hiding. She is a master at it... always keeping her walls high and never making real connections. But there is something about Keifer Rogan. He is determined... a temptation who knows what he wants... Katie. We all are fighting our own battles. Rogan and Katie each have their own. We all have our own personal demons and scars. Rogan and Katie are no exception to this. With these two, it is not going to be easy and downright hard at times, but it will be so worth it.I highly recommend this book!Review Post---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/11/release-day-blitz-review-tough-enough.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137ZTJ54VW5C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI025ZW#wasThisHelpful","R137ZTJ54VW5C7","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 Stars!I really liked this book. For a debut novel, this book was amazing and kept me on my toes until the very end. This book was quite suspenseful and super steamy at times. Right from the beginning, I was sucked into this story with so many questions swirling around. While at times things might seem confusing, I promise it all comes to head at the end and will leave you with wanting so much more and tons of questions. This book does not end on a cliffhanger but sets up book two nicely.This is Lindsey and Mason's story. Lindsey is a successful woman, in control of her ow universe. From a rough start in life with her sister by her side, she has always walked the rougher side of life even if no one knows it. To the outside, she is a successful business woman but she also has a dark side that comes out. And when she meets cop Mason, he makes her want so much more. But more in Lindsey's life is too much to handle with all the secrets and lies swirling around in her life.Enter Mason. He is the head of the NYPD Organized Crime Control Bureau in Manhattan. He has a sweet daughter that he takes care of and also is serious about his job. When he meets the mysterious Lindsey, he is drawn to her immediately but her walls are up so high he doesn't know if he has a chance to get past them and a shot with her. But when her life is in sudden danger, Mason is there to protect her and slowly break down the steel bars around her heart. And when her secrets comes to light and truths are exposed, will Mason fight for their love or will he turn his back on her?I liked these two. I got frustrated with Lindsey at times. She made me want to smack her with all her contradictions and ""whip lash"" moments but she had her reasons why she was the way she was. And Mason, I swooned hard for him. He was the perfect man and the way he fought for Lindsey spoke to my heart. These two were super hot between the sheets and the chemistry from their first meeting was electric. I was rooting for these two even when it seemed the world was completely working again them. I am super excited for book two because the ending of this book...

The writing is beautiful and quirky all at the same time. The hero is smart, sexy, sweet, and so freaking sincere he will make your heart melt. And the heroine is... well wait until you meet her. She is super fun, sassy, and completely quirky in such a good way that you will totally love her.This is Lovey and Marc’s story. Lovey and Marc meet by chance and through her older brother.

"4 Stars!Sweet and cute! Do you ever find yourself wanting to find a romance novel that just makes you smile and feel good? That is this book. This is a brand new author for me and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked this book. It was a second-chance, friends-to-lovers story. Not over the top and only a bit of angst, this book was like reading a fresh of breath air. While this is the fourth book in a series, it can be read as a standalone but be prepared to want more of this series.This is Maya and Jack's story. Jack has wanted Maya for a long time but he had to step aside when his best friend got her. Now years later, Maya has divorced her cheating ex and is moving on. Enter Jack, her ex's best friend who is back in town. They use to be friends until they weren't. Can Maya and Jack unearth the passion between them? Can these two find a way to open their hearts to love and find a happy ending? Get ready for a sweet ride that will stay with you long after it's over.I really enjoyed these two together and the journey they took. They will make you smile, laugh, giggle, blush and swoon. We all deserve second chances and these two will make you a believer. Sure mistakes were made along the way but I am a big believer in fate and what's meant to be will always be. Maya and Jack were perfect for each other despite it all but they had to find the right time.  I loved watching them fall, working through the obstacles. And the chapter headings... love!I recommend this book.Virtual Tour---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/virtual-tour-review-giveaway-how.html","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ5V4RCWLGJX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEFGTYY#wasThisHelpful","RQ5V4RCWLGJX0","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"5 Stars!EPIC. BRILLIANT. GRITTY. REAL. RAW. SEXY. BEAUTIFUL. DARK. UGLY. SECRETS. LIES. SUSPENSE.This book was amazing. Full of passionate embraces and intense moments, this book knocked me on my butt and pulled me through the emotional ringer good. I laughed in the book. I smiled. I swooned. I got angry. I cried. And I found my heart pumping fast at times. Once this book started with its ominous and totally intense prologue, this book never slowed down until the last word was written.This is book two in the Luminous series and the completion to Bryleigh and Madden's story. This is not a standalone at all and the previous book, Translucent, should be read first. If you were like me, the ending of book one was such a crazy cliffhanger that I was begging for more, wanting answers. And now finally we get all the answers we have been wanting with this release. This book was shorter in length than book one but packed a serious punch and left me breathless by the end.In book one we met Bryleigh, a broken girl who was a shell of the young girl she use to be. She had endured and suffered more than most and now she was finally finding happiness with Madden... only for it all to be ripped away once again. And then there was Madden... her knight and shining armor. A man who knows what he wants and is battling his own demons. He couldn't help but fall fast and hard for the sweet Bryleigh. Just as things were looking up for these two, Bryleigh's past came crashing back in, ruining everything.This book picks up where book one left off. Bryleigh has been taken and Madden will do everything within his power to get her back, including risking his life. While Madden is searching for Bryleigh, other players come in to play that make you question everything you thought you learned in book one. And when a new man enters the picture, he will shake everything up. Who can Bryleigh trust? Will she ever be free of her past? Will she find redemption for past sins committed against her? And will Madden find Bryleigh or will he be too late? Get ready for a twisted ride that will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end but I promise it will all be worth it.I fell hard and fast for Madden in book one. He was sweet, sexy, sincere, compassionate, dominant, and the gentleness he had with Bryleigh spokes volumes to me. In this book, we really see him step up and do everything he can to get her back, including putting himself in danger over and over. We also have a new player in this book who intrigued me immensely. While he was dark and totally bad, he also had a light I could see in him that had me questioning myself sometimes about what I felt for him. And then there is sweet Bryleigh. I loved how her strength shone through in this book. She really stepped up and gave it her all, making me fall in love with her even more. I loved the ending because it was PERFECT in every possible way for this series.I highly recommend this book and series!Review Link---> http://bit.ly/1NFQEEF","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFW6FB9MSCOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VNYOQ6#wasThisHelpful","RZFW6FB9MSCOK","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 Stars!I love this author. Ever since I stumbled upon one of her naughty serial series, I have become addicted. Each time she has a new release, I am first in line to grab and review. Her books are crazy hot, sexy, intense, and always full of suspense. This new series... definitely the BEST of her work by far in her writing career. This is book three... the final one in the series... the last piece of the puzzle.This book rocked it's a$$ off. Full of intensity and passion, this author takes us on a whirlwind ride that will leave you breathless and wanting to throw your kindle. While I write this, I admit I've already read all three books in this series and I promise this is one series you do not want to miss out. Get ready for one crazy ride that will leave you with one happy ending that will have you smiling.This is the third and final installment of Shae's story. Picking up where book two left off, suspicions are high and Shae doesn't know who to trust. While her heart may now belong to Jasper, too many coincidences and questions are swirling around to listen to it. Will Shae be able to finally find out what happened to her husband? Will she finally give Jasper a chance to share what he knows and use him to lean on? Will she get answers to all the questions she has? Will she be able to prove her and Jasper's innocence once and for all? Will her past ever be able to settle down and allow her to once again find her happy ending? This book will leave you on the edge of your seat until the very end.I highly recommend this book.Blog Tour---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/blog-tour-review-wicked-truth-by-ms.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1WUJXQ8ROWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01507U31S#wasThisHelpful","R1F1WUJXQ8ROWL","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 Stars!New author alert... well for me anyway and let me tell you, she is definitely one I will check out in the near future. This book was amazing and captivated me from the first page. There is something about a college romance that just makes me smile and this author did that to me.

This book was sexy, sweet, intense, passionate, angsty, emotional, full of feels, and had a beautiful love story that was never rushed and blossomed over time. I devoured this book in one sitting and wanted more as soon as it ended. This is the first book in a new series and can definitely be read as a standalone.This is Lily and Nikoli's story.

She faced her past and ended up completely making me love her. And Nikoli... you cocky bastard. He made me swoon and fall hard... plus who doesnt love a man with an accent. These two had tons of chemistry and I loved watching them fall.

"5 Stars!I love this series! It has sweet romances that are full of steam and twists along the way. Each book follows a different couple so it can be read as a standalone. I definitely recommend reading in order for maximum enjoyment because characters appear in each book from previous books so slight spoilers may happen if you haven't read. And I promise, one you start... you won't be able to stop.This book was crazy good. It may even be my favorite of the series. It was sweet, sexy, steamy, fun, and had a heartwarming romance that will make you smile. This book grabbed me from the beginning and I devoured it at one time. This is one of my favorite series out there and I promise it is worth the time to read. This was a fast book that is perfect to read on a lazy afternoon.This is Carmen and Will's story. And the last to fall is the sweet and responsible paramedic Will. Will hasn't found that one ye but he has watched his friends and siblings fall in love.. hard. Now, he is facing the situation. He attracted to his boss, the woman who is too uptight and rigid but something about her pulls him to her and he can't stop it. Now he just needs her to take a chance on him.Enter Carmen. She is Will's boss. She knows she isn't liked around her workplace but that is ok with her. She keeps her frigid attitude in place and works means work. She is also a single mom. When she starts to spend time with Will, she can't help but slowly fall for him. Sure it may be against the rules but the temptation is too sweet o t pass. Can they find a happy ending despite the obstacles?I highly recommend this book.Review Post---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/release-day-blitz-review-giveaway-boss.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D8Y7Q7RLWW9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BS3LWE#wasThisHelpful","R2D8Y7Q7RLWW9J","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars!I absolutely adore this author. Every time she has a new book out, I get super excited. She has a serious passion for writing and you can tell when you sit down to read her books... well more life devour them in one breath. Her books flow so well and are written so flawlessly with heroes we swoon for and heroines we can't help but root for. This newest series by her is has become a fast favorite of mine for this year and definitely something I will reread in the near future.This book is probably my favorite one in this series to date. This is the third book in the Burke Brothers series but can be read as a standalone (but why do that when there are more of these men to totally fall in love with before Aidan's story). This book was sexy, sweet, beautiful, and had a perfect love story that will take you through all the emotions but have you totally smiling by the end. It will make you laugh, cry, smile, swoon, fall in love, and want to possibly throw your kindle at times.This is Aidan and Jessie's story. Full of passion and intensity, these two will take you on the ride of your lives. Their story was super intense and kept me on the edge of my seat. Aidan will make you swoon and melt your panties. And Jessie, well she may make you want to shake her a time or two but you can't help but find yourself rooting for her. I loved the chemistry between these two and the fact that they had history. I love me some rockers and Aidan.... no words are really needed for him.I highly recommend this book!Blog Tour---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/blog-tour-review-dirty-lies-by-emma-hart.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QR9PRAYGORX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBQPE0#wasThisHelpful","R2QR9PRAYGORX5","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It got my heart beating a little fast and definitely got my blood pumping.These two authors nailed it in erotic romance and suspense. From the beginning, these two ladies captivated in a story that even I couldn't have predicted the outcome.

These ladies turned up the twists and turns like no other book and gave me a story that was hard to let go.This is Luca also known as Lucia's story. Luca is a successful woman who is all business. But when she finishes at works on Fridays, she become someone else. She becomes Lucia.... her alter ego, one she was introduced in college.

"5 Stars!This book was hauntingly beautiful. While I am not a typical fan of dark romances, I am a fan of this author and with the blurb for this book, I was instantly hooked and knew I would want to read this book. And let me tell you, I am so glad that I stepped out of my normal box in reading and took a chance but holy crap! This book was absolutely brilliantly written.Ms. Wild pushes boundaries in this book. Right or wrong. Pleasure or pain. Dominance or submission. Who is really calling the shots and who is really the master? This book took her writing, in my opinion, to a whole new level. This book was sexy, intense, dark, gritty, passionate and left me breathless at times. This book will make you squirm and possibly need B.O.B. close by!This is Sky and Angel's story. Angel has been taken and forced into submission by a captor who has no intentions of letting her go until she gives him answers. And the serious problem with it all? She feels a pull and connection to him without ever seeing his face. How far would one go to protect their secrets? And what happens when everything you thought you knew is flipped upside down?This book is full of twists and turns like no other book I have ever read. She surprised me many times and had me guessing only to be completely blown out of the water. This author took a leap with this book and she nailed it. I did sense there is a series ahead o this book with someone we meet in here so I am definitely going to be headed back to see what I have missed and play catch up!I highly recommend this book!Review Post---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/release-blitz-review-giveaway-twenty.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4TUB1KHF3TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165XCG8Y#wasThisHelpful","RR4TUB1KHF3TB","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book was super edgy and one that you will have trouble putting down. This is a standalone and cannot wait for more in the future.This is Clare and Rory’s story. Love has a way of sneaking up on us when we least expect it. Sometimes things happen for a reason. Their story is complicated but hauntingly beautiful. Clare and Rory are fighting their own battles.

"5 Stars!This author is new to me and this is the fist book I have read by her. But one thing I did learn, she will definitely be a go to author for the future. I love an author that keeps me guessing and surprises me. I love when authors take chances in their books and step outside the box. This book was all of that. This book had me questioning everything that I read and made me cave book two badly! Just when you think you know the answers, think again because the author has thrown in a new twist.This book was so amazing. Dark, twisted, highly erotic, intense, passionate, edgy, and suspenseful, the book was nothing like I have ever read. It kept me on my toes the entire time I was reading it. Surrounded by tons of questions, this book left me so many thoughts and ideas running through my head. I am curious to see how book two plays out in this series. This book does end on a cliffhanger and I am here to tell you folks now, it is definitely a crazy one that left me breathless.This is Isabelle's story. Isabelle is in a marriage of convenience with little to no love. And when an accident during a hurricane occurs, it throws her life into a spiral. Who is Isabelle? Who is the man she is married too? What dark secrets does he hold? What does Isabelle's past have to do with her future? One thing is for certain, people are not who you think they are. This is a mind bending romance that will leave your heart racing and gasping for breath so get ready for one he!! of a ride.I highly recommend this book!Blog Tour---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/blog-tour-review-giveaway-suit-by.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19GJK4X1QWVMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MJNOG0#wasThisHelpful","R19GJK4X1QWVMO","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 Stars!This is my favorite author of all time. She is absolutely brilliant. Her alphas are swoonworthy and hard not to fall for. Her heroines make you believe in love. When Aurora pens a book, she writes utter brilliance that always leaves a smile on my face. She knows how to make you fall fast and hard. She believes in love. She believes in second chances. She believes in happily ever afters.I loved this book. Like seriously, this book will probably be my top read of 2015. Jax... sigh... he was everything I thought he would be and more. This book was sexy, sweet, suspenseful, fun, passionate, intense, and had the most beautiful love story. This book was full of twists and turns that will leave you on the edge of your seat. I devoured this book whole and it devoured me right back.This is Jax and Ellie's story. Picking up where Until July left off, we now get to see the romance blossom and grow from the beginning. When Jax sees Ellie coming out of that field for the first time, he knows she is him #boom. And Hope, her little girl, that is just a bonus. Now he needs to find the bad men who took Ellie and convince her that he is the one for her. You can't deny the boom.Ellie has had a hard life and losing her brother was the nail in the coffin. Now recovering from being taken by bad men, she is ready for a change. When Jax enters her and Hope's life, she knows that he is different. As she begins to fall for him, she needs to get past her demons in order to find a true happy ending with Jax. Can she heal? Will she give Jax a chance to prove he is all in?I loved these two together. Jax was so perfect. He was a spitting image of Cash and Ellie. He was so loyal, sweet, kind, alpha, dominant, and protective. He knew he wanted Ellie and I loved how he never let her go, always proving what he felt. And Ellie, I was rooting for her hard. She made my heart bleed many times throughout this book. And sweet Hope... she was the icing on the cake.I highly recommend this book!Book Tour---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/book-tour-review-giveaway-until-jax-by.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B8L0F7SEBT35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EPMZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R1B8L0F7SEBT35","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 Stars!I really liked this book. This author is one of my absolutely favorites in the indie world. Not only does she write amazing stories but she is also an incredible person. Her books have a way of pulling you in and not letting you go until the last word. They also linger with you long after you have finished reading. I became a huge fan of her from her first series and the growing she has done in her writing is absolutely phenomenal. I promise this is an author that you want to take a chance on.This book was.... hauntingly beautiful. It was intense, passionate, sweet, edgy, emotional, and so emotionally draining in such a good way that I am not sure still that I can put into words the way this book moved me. This book was so beautiful and so heartbreaking that you start out in tears and end up in tears. This book will move you and speak to your soul... not letting go until it is ready too. I am on pins and needles for book two because that ending..... gah!... completely wrecked me.This is Bayleigh's journey. Facing tragedies are hard and Bayleigh knows that first hand. Her life will never be the same after she faces it and is only going to get more complicated from here. Bayleigh is trying to survive so pushing people away seems like the best decision. But sometimes life has other plans for us and the route we will take. What happens when two men own your heart in a certain way? Can she survive another tragedy she is going to face? Will she be able to find the strength to survive and heal? This is only the beginning and definitely not the end to her story.I highly recommend this book.Review Post--->  http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/release-blitz-review-giveaway-offbeat.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7Q0J696XPXNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01672SOCA#wasThisHelpful","R7Q0J696XPXNC","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 Stars!I loved this book. Every piece of this novel spoke to my soul and by the end, I became a real #TeamRhys member because the man made me fall oh so hard for him. This book right here is the BEST in the series and the author can only go up from this point with this series. Rhys will make you swoon and fall hard.. fast. Tanner will make you believe in fate and happy endings. This book is not a standalone as is each book in this series but a new couple is introduced in each book.This book was amazing. It was intense, passionate, edgy, and kept me on my toes for most of the time, wanting to know what was going to happen next. This book was sexy, sweet, fun, and oh so naughty. I did a quick reread of this series before I read Inflame Me and that is something I highly recommend since each book ends on a PLOT cliffhanger. This book picked up where the last left us hanging and I was so happy to dive back into the lives of the men and women of Ravage MC.This is Rhys and Tanner's story. When Rhys and Tanner meet, their chemistry is undeniable. All it took was one moment and one look to know that these two would never be the same. Rhys is the hardened biker, who swore he would never attach himself to a woman or an old lady. But Tanner is the gam changer for him. And Tanner... she is stuck between a rock and hard place but finds safety in the arms of Rhys. Can these two find love and healing from the past? Can they find the strengthand courage to face the obstacles that lie ahead? Will they come out stronger or crash and burn?After that plot ending cliffhanger (not the couple so no worries!), I am on pins and needles for the next book which is set to release in 2016 so the wait is not crazy long!I highly recommend this book!Review Post---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/release-blitz-review-inflame-me-by-ryan.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AUHGD27BJ4WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145S7I0W#wasThisHelpful","R3AUHGD27BJ4WB","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars!This book was amazing. Sexy, sweet, and fun, this book will definitely be a top read of 2015 for me. From the very first page, I fell in love with everything about this book and before I knew it, I had devoured the entire thing. You will laugh, smile, swoon, and fall in love while reading this book.This is Nathan and Lauren's story. Lauren is in quite a pickle and she isn't exactly sure what to do. She has been given an assignment that will either make or break her entire career. And when she meets Nathan, she realizes he may be the key to exploring her desires and keeping her job.Now, she is on a path of self discovery with a man who makes it his mission to give out as little information as possible. What happens when you realize you may have fallen in love who may not love you back. It is time for her to pony up and lay all her cards out on the table.This book was quite quirky with a storyline that is common but with all the twists she gave us, it was totally unique in its own way. I loved Lauren. She was a total mess until Nathan. And Nathan... he was a hard read because this was told in only Lauren's POV, but by the end, I was good with him.I am excited for the next book in this series!I highly recommend this book.Review Post---> [...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA7O477DQ1VXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011YMYY04#wasThisHelpful","RA7O477DQ1VXT","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 Stars!This author is amazing. I fell in love with her Beneath series and each book she produces in it continues to get better and better. Ms. March has a way of drawing you in and keeping your interest in her stories. Her books are sinfully sexy and oh so delicious. She delivers heroes that makes us swoon and fall hard. She also gives us heroines that we can root for while they fight their own battles because of their strength. I loved this book in this series and cannot wait for more soon!I loved this book. Another great addition to this amazing series and definitely my favorite in this series. This book was super intense, edgy, sexy, sweet, and a touch of suspense along the way. This book is a true standalone though there is a character crossovers so spoilers are ahead if you read this alone. Told in dual POV, get ready to take a sinfully sexy ride with Yve and Lucas. This is the kind of book that will stay with you long after it's over and have you begging for more by the end.This is Yve and Lucas' story. Both have their own scars they wear. Yve is fighting against an abusive past should would love to forget and Lucas is fighting his own demons from his past. Lucas is the man you love to hate. He will push your buttons and your boundaries. Yve is a girl who is only as strong as she can be but still tough as nails. These two have tons of chemistry and whether they are fighting or ripping each other's clothes off, the passion can't be denied. Can Yve be saved when her past comes barreling back in? Can Lucas be the TRUE white knight who can save her?I highly recommend this book.Review Tour---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/review-tour-beneath-these-scars-by.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WHVUYOG2DHVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NAUJNE#wasThisHelpful","R2WHVUYOG2DHVD","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4 Stars!This was such a good book. Very sweet and highly emotional, this author gave us a beautiful romance that was told us a story of two broken people finding healing and love from their pasts. This book will speak deep in your soul and makes you a believer in second chances. This author is new to me and I will definitely be looking forward to the future books in this series. This book is a standalone and offers readers a beautiful happy ending that will leave you smiling big.This is Frankie and Hardy's story. They are both broken. Their pasts have tragedy and heartache that has left both of them just a shell of who they use to be but their stories couldn't be more different. Frankie is on the run, never staying one place to long and Hardy is a widow still grieving. When Frankie and Hardy crash into each other's lives, it gives them a spark of hope and a taste of what could be. Can they take the risk?  And when the past comes barreling back in, will they be able to handle the consequences? Watch this beautiful romance unfold that will leave you in tears.I loved Hardy. He was so sweet and kind. I loved his personality and the tenacity he had when he was pursuing Frankie. I also admired his strength and how he pushed through no matter what. And Frankie.. she was a mess of contradictions at times but her life was hard so I got it. At times I found myself shaking my head and wanting to tell her to give Hardy a chance. This slow build romance made me swoon and fall in love. I cannot wait for more books in this series in the future.I recommend this book.Blog Tour---> http://reneeentress.blogspot.com/2015/10/blog-tour-review-giveaway-ignite-by.html","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5VCO4ZMZRU2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01452VG1U#wasThisHelpful","R5VCO4ZMZRU2W","A1GSAWTS30BV4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GSAWTS30BV4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am so glad that I jumped at reading this book because holy smokes it was amazing. It was sexy, intense, edgy, suspenseful, passionate, and had tons of twists and turns along the way.This is Raylin and Storm's story. Raylin is on the run and in need of shelter. When she stumbles across a beach house, she knows she cant be long. She just needs some sustenance and a few days of rest before she is on the move again. No attachments or meeting people. That is easier said than done until she meets Storm. He makes her wants things she can't have... but a girl could wish.Enter Storm. Storm is a mystery. He is in hiding, living at a beach house and trying to gain his bearings again in his life. When he meets Raylin, he immediately wants her, even if she pushes him away. When danger stats lurking and the past of both of them come back with a vengeance, they will have to decide who they can trust (if even each other) and if their newly found love can last.I loved these two together. I loved everything about Storm... his mysteries and all. He was so sweet, sexy, and when we met the REAL Storm... look out ladies. I also liked Raylin.

"Tommy Flanagan has many fine albums to his credit, but this isn't one of them. Most of the blame can be assigned to bassist Ron Carter, whose overbearing, funk-oriented sound is out of synch with Flanagan. Tony Williams' drum work also lacks subtlety, and while he does less damage than Carter, together they end up sinking what should have been a good session.Those who are new to Tommy Flanagan's work as a leader, or want to add to what they have, would find any of the following discs from later in his career far more satisfying: Beyond the Bluebird, Nights at the Vanguard, Jazz Poet, Sunset & Mockingbird - Birthday Concert, Lady Be Good... For Ella, and Sea Changes. Flanagan recorded a terrific solo album in 1977 (Alone Too Long), and his earlier work also includes a couple of gems: Overseas and Moodsville Vol. 9: The Tommy Flanagan Trio.Two and a half stars may seem a little harsh, but two out of the three players are on such a different wavelength here that this is an album I can barely listen to.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y5H9XLLJTPPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AN024Q#wasThisHelpful","R1Y5H9XLLJTPPQ","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having enjoyed Richard Wyands' ""Half and Half"" (2000) and ""As Long as There's Music"" (2001), I ventured into the slightly earlier ""Get Out of Town"" (1997), which like the later albums also feature Kenny and Peter Washington. This is a top-notch effort all the way. Wyands' choice of material is exceptional, including Thad Jones' ""Mean What You Say,"" Ellington's little-known ""Angelica"" and the rarely heard ""I Don't Want to Cry Anymore"" from Victor Schertzinger. Wyands, a musician of versatility and subtlety, projects ""Angelica"" with just the right bounce, while his ballad work on ""Why Did I Choose You"" reflects a veteran's wisdom where structure and sensitivity go hand in hand. While his treatment of ""I Don't Want to Cry Anymore"" is worlds apart from Ellis Larkin's gorgeous statement (Live at Maybeck Hall Volume 22), after a couple of listens I decided I wouldn't trade one for the other. Wyands' brings plenty of new ideas even to the overfamiliar ""Jitterbug Waltz,"" which departs from the theme after the first few bars; and ""Yardbird Suite"" too benefits from the pianist's lively (but thankfully not overactive) imagination.Kenny and Peter Washington prove to be true partners in the best sense of the word, never overstating anything. Many modern players could learn alot from these guys, who are in complete sympathy with their leader.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GXP7NLXMOHAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003UUW#wasThisHelpful","R1GXP7NLXMOHAT","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set has been around for a long time under the Sony label, thus there are a variety of reviews to sample in that incarnation (Mozart: Piano Sonatas). My own view is that De Larrocha's Mozart, while good, is not on par with her recordings of Spanish music. Her playing offers refinement and clarity, but it often lacks the sparkle that distinguishes her best recordings (Icon: Alicia De Larrocha).,The best Mozart cycle among those I'm familiar with is that of Klara Wurtz, and I would recommend it despite the less than ideal sound (Mozart: Complete Piano Sonatas). Without going into a point by point comparison, I would summarize the differences between the two pianists by saying that Wurtz's Mozart is consistently fresh and inspired where De Larrocha's frequently lapses into routine and, at its worst, sounds polite.Three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H1RNJJT1T8QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZHRGMC#wasThisHelpful","R2H1RNJJT1T8QH","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to acquiring this set I was familiar with perhaps a third of Haydn's keyboard sonatas, so hearing the thirty-odd works that were new to me was a wonderful discovery. (As an aside, I say ""works"" because this cycle, presented in sequential order, follows the Hoboken numbering system under which pieces that were originally published as divertimentos and partitas are counted as sonatas.)  I can't say that everything here is on the same creative level - for example, I pretty much passed over the first disc of early pieces - but Haydn's genius was already in full flower as evidenced by the material on the third disc.Walter Olbertz, although not well known, is a very capable pianist with a modern outlook. His playing is solid as a rock, colorful and idiomatic, and is also appropriately energetic, but not turbocharged like Hamelin's whose Haydn sonatas can be vehicles for gratuitous displays of technique. Olbertz is also not overfast like Jendo, and vastly more poetic. As to a couple of specifics: Olbertz's traversals of the 20th and 38th sonatas, familiar territory to me through recordings by Brendel and Horowitz, compare very well with those of his more famous colleagues. While the 22nd sounds flatfooted beside Richter's (Richter in Spoleto), the 34th is more lively than Brendel's. In fact, all of Olbertz's readings measure up exceptionally well beside Brendel's, whose Haydn recordings I admire (Haydn: Piano Sonatas). Olbertz also matches up very well against Schiff, whose Haydn set I liked in the past (Piano Sonatas).This cycle, recorded between 1973 and 1978, offers very good sound.Solidly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R76D7Y7FMEC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036ULAXC#wasThisHelpful","R3R76D7Y7FMEC2","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Serkin recorded these concertos in 1953 (C minor) and 1954 (C major), a period when he was still very much in his Toscanini mode, which is to say that speed was almost everything. I don't care for the tempo he adopts from the get go of the C minor concerto, and while the execution is faultless, he's just too fast. While the Largo is very pretty, Serkin shifts back into overdrive in the Rondo, although the pace is a bit more measured. The C minor concerto fares somewhat better, but Serkin still favors brilliance over poetry and the music suffers. Again, the first movement is too brisk, almost bloodless, and the Largo is the high point. The Rondo is reasonably balanced, but Serkin seems to want to break out wherever he can. Ormandy does a good job in both concertos, but the soloist is calling the shots.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB8CQJUN38LS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BP18RIA#wasThisHelpful","RB8CQJUN38LS5","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A number of the recordings in this collection served as my introduction to Mozart's piano concertos, and while I have long since moved on to other pastures, listening again after a decades-long interval left me amazed at how well many of these performances have held up. Without offering commentary on each concerto, an unnecessary labor given the token amount being asked for this download, let me just say that the overall quality is high, and that there are a few performances that number among my all time favorites. The Brendel/Klien recording of the two piano concerto is a genuine classic, and listeners would be well rewarded to have paid $2.99 for that alone. The Brendel performances are the real stars of the show here though: they project tons of energy and personality and for the most part supersede the pianist's later recordings with Neville Marriner, most of which are bland by comparison. While Walter Klien is a good Mozartian, his approach in the concertos in which he is featured is often a little too gentle. Klien's rendering of the 17th concerto is exceptional though, and compares well with Anda's famous record. On the other hand his reading of the 21st concerto is disappointingly colorless, probably the low point of this set.For the most part, the orchestras offer spirited support and are a welcome relief from the over-refined Mozart productions that have prevailed since the 1970's.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF6ASEKGOOX1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T2XPC0#wasThisHelpful","RF6ASEKGOOX1X","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My primary interest in buying ""The Liszt Legacy"" was to hear the Arrau and De Larrocha recordings, and my five star rating applies to them alone. I haven't sampled anything else in the set other than the Egon Petri recordings, about which I've commented on below.The pianists included in ""The Liszt Legacy"" are presented in alphabetical order; thus the Arrau recordings, which were made for American Decca in 1954, appear first. This is the first cd release of this material - five Beethoven sonatas and the Chopin Op. 49 Fantasy - and while it should be of particular interest to Arrau collectors, it's also a superb introduction the great pianist's art.The program opens with the late ""Hammerklavier,"" and proceeds with opp. 13, 27 no. 2, 57 and 81a. While I would have programmed the sonatas in a different order, the ""Hammerklavier"" is certainly a stunning opening salvo for anyone delving into this set, especially if they were new to Arrau's work. It's also a perfect example of how the pianist's approach evolved over the years between 1954 and 1963, when Arrau recorded the sonata again for Philips. (Arrau went on to re-record two of the Beethoven sonatas included in this set for EMI, ""Appassionata"" & ""Les Adieux,"" as well as seven others.) The timings of the movements are almost identical, but the placement of emphasis is not. The Decca recording can sound almost matter of fact in certain places compared to the more intense re-make, and while there's nothing that could be described as ordinary about the earlier reading, by the time of the Philips recording the sixty year-old Arrau was reaching for the stars. The footprints of Arrau's approach are the same, having been established well back in time, so the differences between the Decca and Philips ""Hammerklavier"" are matters of subtlety rather than substance. Still, if I were to choose, I would opt for Philips over Decca despite the fugue, which is a real tour de force.There is no question that the rest of the sonatas benefit from Arrau's fresher approach circa 1954, versus the weightier 1960's recordings for Philips. ""Les Adieux"" has just enough of the pathos of the later recording, but it exceeds it in technical brilliance (as does Arrau's 1958 reading for EMI). The ""Moonlight"" and ""Pathetique"" sonatas too are a little tighter with a slightly more natural feel than the Philips remakes. The ""Appassionata,"" one of Arrau's specialties, is magnificent here - architecture, drama, sweep, and propulsive forward momentum without a hint of rushing. All of these sonatas have a slightly heavier feel in the Philips edition, perhaps because Arrau had by then more fully deployed his arm/body weight approach to the keyboard. Even though the timings don't differ much, the Decca recordings sound fleeter and more percussive, which was typical of Arrau's style at the time. In any case, these sonatas are brilliant snapshots of middle period Arrau that I would not want to be without.The two discs of Spanish music from Alicia De Larrocha are a pure delight. All of the selections are first rate, with the Spanish pianist demonstrating unrivalled authority even in these early recordings (1954-56). If anything, her 1955 Goyescas is preferable to her Hispavox recording from 1963, sounding more whimsical and inspired.  (By the way, Claudio Arrau, who rarely commented on other pianists, was an early admirer of De Larrocha, calling her ""a wonderful, sensitive and extremely musical pianist"" and included her Decca recording of ""Los requiebros"" from Goyescas among his 10 desert island selections in a 1960 BBC program.) De Larrocha's traversal of Granados' ""Escenas romanticas"" are moody and atmospheric, as too are her renderings of Frederic Mompou's ""Impresiones Intimas."" This is all great music, and anyone who admires De Larrocha would find the two discs in this collection devoted to her art very rewarding.The Egon Petri disc devoted to Bach was recorded for Westminster in 1956. The only thing I'd heard from this pianist was his Westminster recording of the ""Hammerklavier"" sonata, which I recall as too cool and academic. I was not surprised then to find Petri's Bach a bit dry and pedantic in places. For example, the Toccata and Fugue in C major sound almost curt compared to Horowitz's expansive Carnegie Hall reading; and ditto the Prelude and Fugue in D major when compared with Gilels' majestic reading, also from Carnegie Hall. The Liszt disc, on the other hand, shows the pianist in brilliantly inspired form, sounding as if he were having fun with the music. In fact, the differences between his Liszt and Bach are so significant that in a blindfold test I would never have identified these recordings as the work of the same pianist.While I plan to eventually sample the Lewenthal and Moiseiwitsch material, the Arrau and De Larrocha recordings are by themselves worth the price of this set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJA2LHTVF7ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005B0YURI#wasThisHelpful","R3DJA2LHTVF7ZO","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazingly, this is the first cd release of Lazar Berman's fabulous 1975 recording of Rachmaninoff's ""Moments Musicaux"" (originally coupled with Prokofiev's 8th sonata on a Deutsche Grammophone LP). Berman, who had a rather narrow repertoire, had a perfect grasp of each of the six pieces in this suite. The opening nocturne is beautifully played, with the transitions between the three parts handled masterfully. The scherzo-like second movement is a swirling Russian fantasy in Berman's hands, whereas the more somber third is perfectly paced, never sounding funereal like Horowitz. The fourth movement is a tour de force of pianism, with Berman unleashing controlled waves of energy - watch him playing this in recital on youtube and you'll see how easy he makes this music sound. The fifth movement is pure poetry, and while I've always thought that Rachmaninoff had run out of ideas when he penned the sixth movement, Berman still does the best he can with it.The rest of this disc is taken up with the balance of Berman's solo DG recordings of Rachaminoff, all of which were made in 1980. Of principal interest is his recording of the Corelli Variations, a very fine effort although I prefer Ashkenazy's ethereal 1972 recording for Decca despite the less than optimal sound (Rachmaninov: Music for 2 Pianos - Suites Nos. 1 & 2, Opp.5,17 / Etude-Tableau, Op.33 / Symphonic Dances, Op.45 / Russian Rhapsody / Corelli Variations, Op.42). Berman's renderings of the six preludes included here are quite exceptional. While I could have done without the C sharp minor, a warhorse that the composer himself grew sick and tired of playing, Berman has as much to offer in the rest of this music as Richter and Horowitz. While Berman doesn't work himself up into a frenzy the way Horowitz does in op. 32, no. 12, there's still drama combined with a stateliness to it that's quite appealing. The op. 32 no. 10 prelude which follows is very poetic, and while it can't replace Richter's Carnegie Hall recording (Richter Rediscovered: Carnegie Hall Recital 1960), Berman's conception projects a sort of grandeur that's pure Rachmaninoff. The disc closes with a riveting traversal of op. 23 no. 2, which is every bit as good as Richter's classic 1959 recording for the same label (available on Pianist of the Century ~ Sviatoslav Richter).Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I4HNXETDISD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2XHNRG#wasThisHelpful","R3I4HNXETDISD1","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Melville Goodwin USA"" was not well received by the critics when it was published in 1952, and it turned out to be John Marquand's poorest selling book to date. The reader discovers that there's a plot only after slogging through the first two-thirds of the book, and by that time can't be blamed for caring little about how things turn out. What ""Melville Goodwin"" needed was an editor who could convince the author that there were at least 100 pages that could have been cut from the manuscript.Still, there are rewards for the persevering reader: Marquand's uncanny ability to convey a scene, whether a tract house in suburban Washington or a general's office in the Pentagon, always places you squarely in the picture. And his self-conflicted characters and many wry observations, which ultimately redeem ""Melville Goodwin"" from the tedium of excess, are served up with far more finesse than anything Sinclair Lewis ever wrote. Mostly, what you get from ""Melville Goodwin"" is a good dose of Marquand's cynicism delivered in his typical fashion, with velvet gloves.Three and a half stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14RO9IR3YGRS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CZ39FQ#wasThisHelpful","R14RO9IR3YGRS1","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before Vivaldi composed the great concerto cycles for which he is best remembered today, he wrote a number of works in the concerto a quattro form. Precursors to the concerto for solo instrument and ensemble, concerti a quattro were written for ensembles in which most or all of the instrumental parts were doubled. Michael Talbot writes in his informative liner notes that these concerti ""favored a brilliant, flamboyant style of writing in which the outer parts - first violins and bass instruments - were emphasized at the expense of inner parts. The extraction of one or more solo parts in certain passages was a slightly later development - but one that proved so popular that the so called 'solo' concerto, for violin and another instrument, completely eclipsed the concerto a quattro by about 1710. Indeed, from that time onwards a concerto without a solo instrument has seemed a curiosity requiring special explanation.""Vivaldi wrote at least 40 concerti a quattro, nine of which were selected by I Musici for this recording. While Mr. Talbot, a noted scholar who specializes in Baroque music, writes that Vivaldi's concerti a quattro ""are among the most individually conceived of his works,"" listeners who are expecting them to compare well with the better known concertos are bound to be disappointed. These are far simpler conceptions with none of the grand sweep and wonderful melodies found in many of the concerti within La Cetra, L'estro armanico, La stravaganza etc. The net result is that despite being well played, not much of the music is particularly memorable.Three and a half stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UHTSPW3EDQPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000040VS#wasThisHelpful","R3UHTSPW3EDQPS","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alicia de Larrocha's Hispavox recordings, which I came to know in the 1970's through Musical Heritage Society licensed LP's, were my introduction to the Spanish piano repertoire. And what a fabulous journey of discovery it was. Even though I had heard no other pianist in this repertoire other than Arrau's Iberia and Rubinstein's Navarra, Larrocha's recordings were so captivating I hardly bothered looking elsewhere. As it turned out, critics and colleagues who had heard her early on were aware of her extraordinary way with Spanish music. New York Times music critic Harold Schonberg wrote of the Spanish works in her 1955 Town Hall debut that ""she had a way of idiomatically shaping a musical phrase that cannot be taught -- a sudden dynamic shift, a note instinctively accented, a touch of the pedal, an application of rubato.... Obviously this music is in the pianist's blood. She invested it with a degree of life and imagination that not many pianists before the public today could begin to duplicate."" A few years later Claudio Arrau, who rarely commented publicly on other pianists, called Alicia de Larrocha ""a wonderful, sensitive and extremely musical pianist,"" and included one of her recordings among his desert island recommendations for BBC radio in 1960. Her manager, Herbert Breslin, observed in 1978 that ""There are two kinds of repertory Alicia plays. Things she plays extremely well, and things she plays better than anyone else. But what I think makes her a phenomenon is that she doesn't give the impression of being a great personality. She's cool as a cucumber. Onstage, she doesn't even like to look at the audience. So what the public is responding to is something in the music.""The Hispavox recordings collected in this Icon set are better at projecting that unique ""something"" which Breslin spoke about than most of Larrocha's later recordings for Decca and RCA. While many of those are of a very high caliber, the Hispavox recordings are generally fresher and more inspired. To cite just two examples: the 1964 recording of Granados' op. 37 ""Dances,"" which brims with energy and charisma - a spirit that permeates all of the recordings assembled here - and the 1963 Goyescas which stands above the 1982 Decca remake.Even if you have Alicia de Larrocha's Decca or RCA recordings of these works, I wouldn't let that stop you from acquiring this landmark collection. The liner notes are exceptional, and include a personal tribute from the pianist's daughter, Alicia Torra de Larrocha, as well as an anecdotal essay by Gregor Benko. And while the sonics can be variable, ranging from superb to congested and metallic-sounding, I was surprised to find that some of the older recordings actually sound better than those Larrocha made for Decca. A case in point is the 1964 recording of Granados' Danzas Españolas which is vastly superior to the hard and dim Decca recording from 1982. (As an aside, a number of recordings are listed in the notes with 1992 copyright dates, which are not to be mistaken for recording dates. For example, Albeniz' Cantos De España was recorded in 1959, but since it was first issued on an EMI cd in 1992, that's the date reflected in the notes.)Highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MDYD1O5ZBESN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D0ZNJC#wasThisHelpful","R1MDYD1O5ZBESN","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fourth installment in a series of Ansermet discs issued by Decca in 1992 that focus on the conductor's recordings of French music; but unlike the earlier volumes, it includes less essential repertoire.The star of the program, and the reason why I acquired this disc, is Ansermet's wonderful recording of Debussy's ""La Boite a jouxjoux,"" which dates from near the end of the composer's career. Francois Hudry's liner notes describe the piece as a ""ballet for marionettes set in a toybox.... The touching, if slim, subject matter is a story of a wooden soldier who is wounded and cared for by a doll, who falls in love with him."" Hudry adds that ""Ansermet was particularly fond of this subtle score, which is full of references to the magical world of toys and childhood."" I tend not to think of the program, and instead appreciate the music for the enchanting spell it casts.The rest of the program is almost an afterthought: two movements from La Peri, a ballet score by Paul Dukas from 1912, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice, which benefits from a very colorful but subtle reading.The liner notes are valuable. In addition to some critical observations from Hudry, who writes that Ansermet ""moulded [the Suisse Romande orchestra] in his own image, obliging the players, sometimes inflexibly, to tackle his favorite repertoire"" and calls his reign ""almost despotic,"" the notes also offer interesting photographs of Ansermet, including one of him at the piano in his study with framed photos of Toscanini, Casadesus and Lipatti among others in view, plus a 1917 sketch of the conductor by Picasso.Five stars for La Boite a jouxjoux.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KAGVMLE1NG3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E4YA#wasThisHelpful","R2KAGVMLE1NG3K","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I Musici's Corelli recordings have had a place in my music library for a good many years, as have Neville Marriner's, but I Musici's are the ones to have. The sound of their strings is just fabulous; and while the period instrument folks may be put off, I think Corelli himself would be elated by I Musici's high octane realizations.It's worthwhile sharing Gramophone's 1973 review of one of the original LP's that this set was drawn from:""There is some splendid string playing here: alert, strong, well balanced, and ready to allow an unusual degree of dynamic contrast to the music. Additionally, the number of strings used allows arguably exactly the right degree of contrast between solo and tutti: clearly to be distinguished, yet neither out of scale with the other. The distinction is helped by a contrast in the keyboard element of the continuo: in general, harpsichord for the solo passages, organ for the tuttis. The harpsichord adds little, as it happens; perhaps its backward placing--nothing new with I Musici--discouraged the player from any specially exacting use of the imagination. The organ (a wooden--literally--imitation by Armagni of a baroque model) is more audible, and contributes an effective support to what is already a pretty strong sound.""In total the performances are not only strong but stylish: ornamentation is scattered only thinly, but this could not necessarily be rated a defect in these particular concertos. There is a bravely imaginative reading of the Fourth Concerto's finale, where Corelli's notation of even quavers is read as indicating a triplet crotchet and quaver effect in order to tally with the prevailing triplet rhythm. Reliable authorities have hinted for some time that this was Corelli's intention (and that of other Italian composers of the period); certainly putting the theory into practice does allow the music on this occasion a new vigour. Added to the more general virtues--which include good, clear recording--this final stroke leaves no doubt that this must be a strongly recommended issue.""The sound is incredibly rich, in fact much better than some of the later digital recordings from this ensemble. The cover art, on the other hand, leaves me completely cold - but that's true of most of Philips' Duos releases.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WPDCGAEE0DDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VHPYBC#wasThisHelpful","R2WPDCGAEE0DDS","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These venerable recordings were staples of the music catalog right through the LP era, and while there are now countless options to choose from that cover the same repertoire I still think of Ansermet's records as the gold standard. His Debussy is uniquely authoritative  - to cite just one example, the composer consulted with Ansermet and agreed to make modifications to his Nocturnes in accordance with the conductor's suggestions - and the recordings he made with the Suisse Romande orchestra, which he founded in 1940, reflect a special insight rarely heard elsewhere.Ansermet's association with Images went back to its premiere performance, which he attended (as did Ravel). His approach is atmospheric, colorful, and structurally solid, and as anyone who has heard his classic Falla recordings will know, his grasp of the Spanish idiom was unparalleled (see Falla: Three-Cornered Hat / Ansermet, Berganza). Despite having always admired Argenta's reference recording (España--Chabrier, Granados / Argenta, London Symphony Orchestra), Ansermet's exceeds it.Ansermet's Nocturnes are quite beautiful, however, here the conductor is up against Stokowski's 1957 recording with the London Symphony Orchestra (Debussy: Nocturnes / Iberia / Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun ~ Stokowski), one of the truly great recordings of the 20th century. Ansermet is a very close second; and while he summons up plenty of mystery, he's not quite as ethereal as Stokowski.Printemps, Debussy's first important symphonic work, is sandwiched between Images and the Nocturnes.  That recording dates from 1957, as does Nocturnes, whereas Images comes from 1961. All three offer the superior sound that Decca's engineers were renowned for producing.An assessment from the writer of the liner notes sums up the conductor's work without hyperbole, stating: ""Balance, precision, a beautiful style and a warm interpretation: these are the hallmarks of Ansermet's performances, and the reasons why his art will always be unaffected by fashion and false traditions, and continue to have the power to move the listener.""Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GASN495Z2Z4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E4Y8#wasThisHelpful","R2GASN495Z2Z4O","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Vivaldi collection mostly dates from relatively early in I Musici's recording career, with the first four concertos (tracks1-12) coming from 1960, the concerto for two trumpets from 1965, and the other concerto from 1972. In addition to the trumpet concerto, there are concertos for two violins, flutes, mandolins, oboes and cellos, so there's a lot of variety to the music. The playing is trademark I Musici, which is to say, full, vibrant, modern sounding but idiomatic. The recorded sound is mostly fine, with the exception of some background noise that's noticeable during the solos on the flute concerto.This disc is also available on Decca Eloquence, with new copies readily available for a few dollars at the time of this writing (Concerti).

"While this disc headlines Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" and ""Night on Bald Mountain,"" the jewel here is buried in the last track in the program, Ernest Ansermet's recording of Balakirev's extraordinary tone poem, ""Tamara.""Tamara was based on a ballad by Lermontov, who was himself inspired by an ancient legend he encountered while exiled to the Caucasus. While programatic in nature Balakirev's music transcends the story line, which is about a beautiful (but evil) princess who lures travelers to her enchanted castle in the Caucasus, then murders her guests after a passionate night and dumps their bodies in the river Trek. Not a happy outcome, but the listener is transported on a magic carpet to the inner and outer landscape of Mother Russia. Tamara is wrapped in an Oriental cloud, and while there's a dark moodiness that runs through it, the atmosphere is much more one of mystery than foreboding. You won't hear the sleigh bells of Rachmaninoff, nor the enchantment of Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Christmas Eve,"" but in the midst of swirling rivers of sound are glimpses of snow covered trees silhouetted in darkness. The entire effect is almost mystical, thanks to Ansermet's masterful treatment.I was captivated from the moment I listened to Ansermet's recording on a London Stereo Treasury Series LP I bought back in the early 1970's, and while I've heard other performances of this great, under-appreciated work they don't capture the soul of the music the way this recording does.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P3HLL45ZX5M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CDLAXA#wasThisHelpful","R3P3HLL45ZX5M3","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last year a number of outstanding Arrau performances that had been sitting in various archives around the world have been appearing on cd. Discs such as Claudio Arrau Live at Tanglewood, Claudio Arrau in Recital 1969-1977, Claudio Arrau at Tanglewood and Claudio Arrau and The Romantics - previously unreleased, which have joined others that have been circulating for some time, show a side of the pianist that's quite different from the carefully sculpted studio recordings he made over the last thirty years of his life. While Arrau's solo recordings for Columbia, Brunswick and EMI, which were made between 1946 and 1962, project a good deal of the energy he brought to the stage, the Philips era which ran from 1962 until Arrau's death in 1991, marked a turning point. Then nearly sixty, Arrau was no doubt weighed down by the awareness that he was setting down permanent documents of great works of art. Indeed, in 1972 he told a ""Gramophone"" critic that ""Live performances are, of course, more spontaneous, and they change from day to day. Out of all these experiences you try in the studio to distill the essence and this gives you a great sense of responsibility. Of course, it worries me not having an audience but I like recording none the less. You have to pull yourself together to present something that may be valid for a long time."" There were a number of great records for Philips, including a Beethoven sonata cycle and some remarkable Liszt and Debussy; but there were also many recordings that were far less passionate than the performances of the same works Arrau presented in concert. Clearly he was a far freer, if not occasionally explosive artist in front of an audience, as a number of recently released live recordings now show.The performances in this new ICA release were recorded April 5, 1960 at the Swedish Radio Studios in Stockholm. At fifty-six Arrau was still a virtuoso of the first rank, and while he was already transitioning into the phase of his career where the poet-philosopher was to play more of a dominant role, the emphasis in this all-Beethoven recital was still tilted more toward the virtuoso. Since the interpretive footprints of each sonata were established long before (Arrau had been playing all of the Beethoven sonatas in recital since the early 1930's), there are no new revelations here. But what we do find is a tremendous coalescing of parts into a series of wholes captured at a moment in time when the pianist was in a particularly inspired mood. What we hear in Stockholm is a synthesis of pure poetry, intuitive vision and perfect tension.While Arrau uncovers a mountain of detail, he never gets bogged down in excessive point-making. One example will suffice: listen to the masterful way he launches the trill at the two-minute mark of the final movement of op. 110, making a powerful statement that others minimize or rush through. And there's no hint here of the inevitability or even resignation that accompanies this phrase in the recording Arrau made for Philips in 1965. The final fugue, a series of bass notes rapped out by some hands, is transformed into rolling thunder here. The Appassionata sonata, a long term specialty of Arrau, is nothing short of stunning. While Arrau's Appassionata traversals in the 1970's were remarkable for their depth, drama and technical finish, the Stockholm recital reading is molten rock from beginning to end. (It's perhaps not surprising that Arrau made what many regard as his best recording of this sonata at EMI's Abbey Road studio just a few days later, April 11/12.) The great op. 111 is more energetic than Arrau's Philips recording, which may be too Furtwanglerish for some, but I actually prefer it. Still, no one else I've heard digs into these scores this way; in fact, only one other pianist of the 20th century had the same insight into Beethoven -- Schnabel, who Arrau worshipped.ICA's sonics are not much better than acceptable mono. The volume knob needs to be turned way up to get enough sound mass, and while this brings out some background static it's not at all bothersome.Downloaders who are interested in the liner notes can get them at ICA's website.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28XNZHWEJ2L0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGHGEAI#wasThisHelpful","R28XNZHWEJ2L0U","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Talbot, an English musicologist who specializes in the Italian Baroque school,  observed in his liner notes to a previous edition of this disc that ""Albinoni is a good example of the composer who, having established an original and influential style at the start of his career, lacks the flexibility to keep pace with developments introduced by other composers and before long becomes an arch-conservative."" Talbot goes on to say that Albinoni's later works, op. 7 (1715)  & 9 (1722) ""offer no advance on op. 5  (1707), in terms of structure and instrumental idiom, though the dimensions are larger and one or two oboes appear in a solo role in several concertos.""Talbot, who has written monographs on Vivaldi and Albinoni, adds that ""Perhaps only Op. 5 shows the composer consistently at his best: the technical immaturity of Op. 2 has been overcome, while the facile self-repetition of the later concertos is not yet evident."" This appraisal strikes me as bit harsh, for while it`s true that some of Albinoni's Op. 7 concertos sound almost interchangeable with others, the twelve concerti making up Op. 9 number among the most original and best of the composer's output.To quote Talbot one more time, ""Although the emotional climate of Albinoni's music is normally cooler than that of Vivaldi's - [English musicologist] Arthur Hutchings has said that his music glows where Vivaldi's flames - there are many moments in Op. 5 where melodious urbanity gives way to passionate outbursts.... Repeated hearing will reveal how varied in mood these concertos are, despite their outward similarity."" Indeed, the Op. 5 concertos are filled with inventive, uplifting music, with an abundance of wonderful melodies. The strings of I Musici make the most of these scores, delivering thick waves of plush sound. It is fortunate that Decca Eloquence has reissued this valuable disc for I can't imagine a better recording of this glorious music.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSF4AXFJRHA2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IKTL#wasThisHelpful","RSF4AXFJRHA2F","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this disc duplicates most of the program on the Ansermet Decca ""Legends"" disc of 2002 (Debussy: Prelude a L'apres-Midi D'un Faune, La Mer, Jeux, Khamma), which presumably was meant to be a single disc collection of the best of the conductor's Debussy recordings, the fact is that this 1992 release does the job better. The primary difference is that this disc includes Ansermet's 1964 recording of La Mer, which is both musically and sonically superior to the recording included in the ""Legends"" cd. Interestingly, the 1964 La Mer was originally coupled with the very appealing Clarinette Rapsodie and the rarely heard ""Khamma"" on a London LP which should have been reissued together as it made for an unusual program. In any case, this collection has two out of three of those gems, plus a lovely Claire de Lune, Petite Suite, Prelude à l'aprés~midi d'un faune and Jeux.These are wonderful recordings that are bona-fide classics of the record catalogue.

"These recordings, made between 1987 and 1989, originally appeared on the Philips label and were out of circulation for a good while, so it's nice to have Newton Classics restore them to the catalogue. I Musici delivers what I would call well-rounded modern performances. They have a big, kind of sweeping sound and while some of the Handelian edges are rounded off, their approach still works well, though they're not as characterful as Marriner/ASMF whose 1960's recordings of the Op. 6 Concerti remain my favorites (Handel: Concerti Grossi Op.3 & Op.6).Marriner communicates more of the Baroque pomp running through this music, an aspect that's pushed into the background by I Musici; and there are a number of instances where Marriner captures the contour of the music where I Musici just sails right through with interesting details left behind. One doesn't have to travel farther than the second movement of the first concerto to find the differences between the two -- here I Musici is relatively speedy and somewhat glib compared to the grandeur of Marriner. Perhaps because I Musici approaches these scores first and foremost as a production for strings -- in other words they receive the standard I Musici treatment -- their Op. 6 doesn't have quite the same personality that Marriner's does.While it's pure speculation, I would guess that had I Musici recorded this repertoire fifteen years before, the results would have been entirely different. A routineness had set in by the late 1980's and this along with personnel changes in the ensemble can all be heard in the music. Nevertheless, I Musici is preferable to Hogwood's more austere recording with the Handel and Haydn Society of which I used to be fond (Handel: 6 Concerti Grossi, Op. 3; 12 Concerti Grossi, Op. 6), and certainly better than that of the smaller-scaled Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, which I also used to like but now find much too lightweight (Handel - Concerti Grossi, Op. 6 / Orpheus Chamber Orchestra).Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BPPM1GI8I7XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AB2F80#wasThisHelpful","R1BPPM1GI8I7XP","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The liner notes to this release inform us that ""The oboe, which figure prominently in many of the works recorded here, was a relatively new instrument during Handel's youth. It was developed from the shawm by Lully and other French composers during the last third or so of the seventeenth century and then spread to other countries, notably to England, where it was known for its 'inimitable charming sweetness of sound'...."" Well, sometimes it pays to read the notes because that was something I didn't know.Two of the three oboe concertos from Handel included in this set may not be quite on the same level as the best of Vivaldi's or Albinoni's, but still make for very pleasant if not rewarding listening. The B flat concerto is a real gem though, with a third movement that's a masterpiece and a sprightly allegro winding things up. Heinz Holliger plays beautifully and the English Chamber Orchestra with Raymond Leppard at the helm are first class partners.The rest of the program is very fine -- the third of the op. 3 Concerto Grossi sounds substantial and lively and blends perfectly with the assortment of other pieces in this well-put together album.This is a prime example of Baroque music performed to perfection on modern instruments; and it doesn't hurt that the 1971 sound is demonstration class.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGDVU2BF5LMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O5I6CW#wasThisHelpful","RTGDVU2BF5LMQ","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's not much difference between Brendel-Marriner (1975) and Brendel-Mackerras (2000) in these concertos, except that in the later incarnations Brendel sounds even more deliberate (he takes about three minutes longer with K595) and Mackerras goes right along with him. Brendel-Mackerras tiptoe through the opening movement of K482, sounding almost as if they were walking on eggshells. The whole undertaking is almost lifeless, especially compared to Casadesus-Szell and Geza Anda, two of my favorite readings of this concerto. While Brendel mines extra details from K595, his probing approach is too one-sided when compared with the mixture of animation and poetry that Geza Anda brings to this score (not to mention that Anda's 30 year-old analog recording sounds better than this ultra-soft digital one).Three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M4IUSHGH38ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005IB5W#wasThisHelpful","R3M4IUSHGH38ZA","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the quality of the sound, these are presumably broadcast tapes - the Chopin concerto from March 9, 1960 and the Schumann from May 31, 1962 - and as is typically the case with Arrau, they show him performing more spontaneously than in his studio recordings. The Chopin is not necessarily a concerto that suits Arrau to a tee (unlike Beethoven's, the Brahms B flat major, and both Liszt concertos), however, this performance is far more settled than a hyperactive concert reading from ten years earlier with Fritz Busch and the NY Philharmonic (Arrau Plays Chopin: The Two Concertos). Arrau's whole approach is better judged here, a case where slowing down produced much more satisfying results. While there's still an occasional hint of awkwardness - he doesn't sound quite as comfortable with this work as Rubinstein did -- this is a performance superior to the exciting Busch/NYP concert, and vastly preferable to Arrau's studio recording with Inbal. The Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Italian conductor Massimo Pradella prove to be strong allies too.Arrau's commercial recordings of the Schumann concerto are representative of all that could be wrong with his studio undertakings with orchestras. His 1957 EMI recording with Galliera and the 1963 effort for Philips with Dohnanyi are both mellow to the point of blandness (Grieg: P Cto in a Min / Schumann: P Cto in a Min and Grieg / Schumann: Piano Concertos) -- but send Arrau out in front of an audience, and the results are entirely different.  A 1951 performance with Victor de Sabata and the NY Philharmonic sizzles (De Sabata conducts Schumann and Brahms), and a 1963 TV performance with the London Philharmonic is solid as a rock (Schumann: Piano Concerto in A minor, Carnaval Op. 9 & Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor / Arrau). You can add to the list this newly issued 1962 performance with Rafael Kubelik and the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra, which brings together the best of the two other live recordings. There's a sense of complete authority in this music, absolute control over the keyboard, massive weight and not a moment where Arrau doesn't sound completely dominating. The reflective moments are beautiful, but never dawdled over, and the bravura passages are unleashed with granite-like strength - a perfect combination of drama and poetry.The sound is straightforward mono with ideal balance between piano and orchestra. There's not a hint of audience noise which leads me to wonder whether these recordings were made in empty halls for radio broadcast.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MAPYBE1FH9GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXCREF4#wasThisHelpful","R1MAPYBE1FH9GE","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Luigi Boccherini (1743-1805) and Franz Haydn were virtual contemporaries (1732-1809) who respected each other, and  borrowed musically from each other as well - a practice that was common then - but that Haydn was the superior composer was recognized even in their time. Indeed, Boccherini was referred to as ""the wife of Haydn"" by sharp-tongued contemporaries, and as mean-spirited as that statement may appear to be today, there's still an element of truth to it. That Haydn's symphonies are enduring masterpieces of the repertoire and Boccherini's far more modest symphonic output remains relatively unknown speaks for itself. Boccherini's music is for the most part cheerful and melodic - he had, for example, no Sturm and Drang period such as Haydn's - and while not everything he composed was relentlessly sunny, he didn't explore the tragic to the extent that Haydn did.While Boccherini's op. 12 symphonies are not on the same level as even Haydn's earlier works in this genre, they still offer a variety of moods and occasionally surprising depth. The Fourth symphony, for example, is unusual in form and also quite dramatic; and the Second symphony, which is intelligently programed after the Fourth, is much more dynamic than the music one thinks of as coming from this typically congenial composer. The closing movement is wonderfully bouncy, but the movements preceding this are packed with serious material. This is not just happy music. The Fifth symphony, on the other hand, is routine; and the Sixth, which improves after a bland opening movement, still doesn't approach the inventiveness of the Second and Fourth. The First symphony has some promising moments in the first movement, but Boccherini's reliance on short repeated phrases interrupts the forward momentum and wears thin pretty quickly. But the patient listener is rewarded with a beautiful second movement that seems to come out of nowhere. The same is true of the lovely Andantino of the Third symphony, which follows a rather mundane opening Allegro.This type of creative back and forth is representative of the whole mass of Boccherini's six op. 12 symphonies -- just when you think his music isn't sophisticated or inspiring enough to invest much time in, there's a pleasant surprise that shifts the momentum in the other direction.  Despite this, the satisfying moments are too few and far between to offer more than intermittent listening satisfaction.The playing of the New Philharmonia under the direction of Raymond Leppard is exemplary and the 1972 recorded sound is rich and warm.Three and a half stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMWBWNUWN6B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018OA2V4#wasThisHelpful","R2LMWBWNUWN6B8","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's surprising that this delightful collection of six Vivaldi oboe concerti is no longer available from Philips, nor does it appear to have been reissued on any other label.A couple of the concertos included here, RV 452 and RV 446, were only discovered in the 1960's, and while there is a discussion in the notes about their provenance (they ""differ slightly, in terms of style, from what is generally regarded as undoubtedly authentic Vivaldi""), they have been accepted as having come from the master's pen. In any case, Heinz Holliger and I Musici perform these small masterpieces to perfection. The allegro of RV 463 exemplifies the glorious sound produced by I Musici - big, lush and swinging - and a modern musical approach that now ironically may be somewhat out of fashion, but which I think is classic.The recordings of RV 452, 454, 545 and 446 date from 1981, and RV 463 and 447 from 1975. While I doubt the older recordings qualify as ""Digital Classics"" as the cover states, the sound is excellent across the board.Also highly recommended from Heinz Holliger is The Baroque Oboe, an outstanding collection which includes three choice albums: Bach: 3 Oboe Concertos, Telemann: Concerti for Oboe, Strings and Basso Continuo - in E minor, in D minor, in C minor, in F minor, in D Major - Heinz Holliger, Iona Brown and Concerti per Oboe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H6YNH763V0SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000026KGD#wasThisHelpful","R2H6YNH763V0SY","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The program is rounded out by Stravinsky's Sonata for two pianos. The Debussy and Ravel recordings are of the highest caliber, and were considered reference recordings for many years.

"Claudio Arrau recorded the Diabelli Variations in 1952 during his brief stay with Decca, a period which produced a batch of Chopin, as well as some Beethoven sonatas and the Eroica Variations - invaluable recordings that are scattered aross various discs (Steinway Legends, Liszt Legacy, Ballades / Piano Concerto etc), but should be remastered and collected in one set. In lieu of that, we have this MP3 offering of the Diabelli, the only available source for these recordings that I'm aware of.Unfortunately, the sound is not ideal here: first, the sound on the original Decca LP's was echoey and clattery, a problem which has been carried over to and compounded on the mp3 files which were no doubt transferred from old LP's. While there are no skips or pops, there can be sonic stress when the music gets loud (mostly restricted to the fifth variation) as well as occasional faint clicking and static in the background. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this download as the performance is a gem. Arrau is really on top of this score, delivering lots of muscle and drama along with sensitivity without any of the ultra-rhetorical insertions that started appearing in his recordings in the 1960's. Harris Goldsmith, in his Beethoven bicentennial retrospective for ""High Fidelity,"" observed that ""Arrau's [recording] has a perfection of detail and reserved classicism that in no way diminishes the warmth and humanity of the music. Arrau, in his more detached way, achieves a cumulative, continuous entity similar to both Serkin and Schnabel.""Someone should assemble all of Arrau's Decca/Brunswick recordings, of which this 1952 Diabelli Variations is a crowning achievement, and do a respectable job of reissuing them.

"For several decades beginning in the 1950's I Musici was the leading ensemble specializing in Italian Baroque music, and their performances were standard-setting in their time. Their recordings still hold up exceptionally well even though approaches to early music, driven by the period instrument revolution, have changed somewhat since then.Perhaps the simplest way to define the differences between I Musici and more contemporary ensembles is that I Musici's approach, while spirited and completely authentic, is also refined and elegant if not occasionally extravagent, whereas more modern groups often sound scaled down and a little more earthy. Both have their merits, although I find myself far more attracted to I Musici's grandeur and sweep.Unfortunately, I Musici's recordings have fallen out of favor with the surge of the period instrument movement - a puzzling development given the beauty of the Italian ensemble's sound, not to mention the soundness of their approach. They produced wonderful recordings of Corelli, Geminiani, Bach, Albinoni and of course Vivaldi; and while they're occasionally guilty of romantic indulgences that no doubt drive purists crazy, well, so what? The music they made was lush and rich, not thin and scrawny, and the sound of their massed strings makes for a glorious listening experience, which after all, is what it's all about.This Vivaldi set doesn't collect all of I Musici's recordings of that composer, but is instead a straight reissue of the Philips Vivaldi Edition sets Vivaldi Edition Vol. 1: Op. 1 - 6 including L'Estro Armonico & La Stravaganza and Vivaldi Edition Vol. 2. All of the concertos are first rate, with the exception of the flute concertos which seem to drag in places. The original 1961 recording of ""The Four Seasons"" is also included here - a stately version that's vastly preferable to their sonically thin digital remake of 1981 with Pina Carmirelli. The only material I find of lesser interest are the violin and trio sonatas, and this is so only because they pale in comparison to the enriched majesty of the concertos.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ALMB8X1DF7LI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AB2F8A#wasThisHelpful","R3ALMB8X1DF7LI","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Quartetto Italiano is most famous for their Beethoven quartet cycle, which still occupies an exalted place in the catalogue despite an avalanche of formidable competition over the last 40 years, but their Mozart cycle is also a top choice for those looking to add this music to their libraries.While listeners may not turn all that often to the first disc, which includes Mozart's earliest works in the quartet form, the Italian players still make the most of things turning in performances that are fresh and lively. Mozart seemed to take a quantum leap with the eighth quartet (K168), which is already a fully mature statement, and this is where the Quartetto Italiano shows why they had such a great reputation. They understand the music perfectly, their sound is elegant, but not overly so, and beefy where it needs to be. There's no exaggeration, no unnecessary display nor pyrotechnics anywhere, just idiomatic, balanced playing that's a pleasure to listen to. All of the quartets from K168-K173 are played to perfection.The later quartets are also exceptional, and while the QI's approach may sometimes have a little less oomph and edginess than that of the Alban Berg Quartet, my long-standing favorite in this repertoire (Mozart: String Quartets, Nos. 14 - 23), they are still every bit ABQ's equal.These recordings were made between 1966-1972 and still sound wonderful.Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144ZWZG0FTET7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DD0AFJU#wasThisHelpful","R144ZWZG0FTET7","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Leon Fleisher, one of Artur Schnabel's best-known pupils, summarized his legendary teacher this way: ""Schnabel wasn't a flashy virtuoso. He was simply the greatest musician at the keyboard I've ever heard. His playing had an irresistable elan - what the Germans call Schwung - as if he were grabbing you and twirling you in a dance.... His performances were never about him. They were all about the composer. In an era when the cult of personality was still flourishing, Schnabel was insistent that a performer serve the score. He abhorred any kind of showmanship.... He wanted to penetrate to the heart of a score and understand what the composer really wanted. He was most interested in works that allowed him to keep asking questions, probing, exploring - 'music,' as he used to say, 'that is better than it can be performed.'"" (from ""My Nine Lives: A Memoir of Many Careers in Music,"" 2010)While Schnabel's recordings supposedly don't do him justice -- he was a nervous performer in the studio, feeling rushed when confronted with the time limitations imposed by the shellac recording process -- they are the only way we have of hearing this great pianist. Indeed some of his recordings, particularly of Beethoven and Bach, are a little too fast for my ears; but others are marvels. I may prefer Arrau's more contemplative Beethoven, yet Schnabel was a major influence on Arrau who revered him (he selected Schnabel's recording of Schubert's D.959 sonata as one of ten ""desert island"" recordings for the BBC in 1960 and referred to Schnabel as a pianist ""whom I have worshipped deeply all my life""). And while there are modern recordings of Bach that dig deeper into the music, though perhaps are a little less exciting than those included in this set, the unwavering pulse that animated these readings still makes for rewarding listening.

"Claudio Arrau was no stranger to the Chopin Preludes, having played the cycle since the 1920's and first recorded them for Columbia in 1950. He took the Preludes very seriously, calling them ""a survey of Chopin's cosmos,"" and along with the Etudes were among the best of his Chopin output.If one word could describe Arrau's Preludes, it would be ""big,"" and the attention he lavished on each one brought them to life in a way no other artist has done. His comments about the music provide some insight into his approach: of the first Prelude, for example, he observed that ""it puts one in a certain tense emotional situation. It has something to do with sexual energy.... There's something positively orgasmic about it."" Others were melancholic (no. 4) or enigmatic (no. 14). Arrau observed that starting with the 17th, ""you feel that [Chopin's] fundamental approach to life is tragic. The peaceful, positive preludes become like remembrances of things that make life acceptable."" And of the dramatic 24th, ""you could say that the plunge at the end is like a drowning. Or that it cuts the thread of life - like the Fates in Greek mythology."" These insights informed Arrau's interpretations of the Preludes, three complete cycles of which are documented on disc.While all three of Arrau's Prelude cycles are cut from the same cloth, the earliest, the above-mentioned Columbia cycle from 1950, is the lightest, with the pianist still in his virtuoso phase. No less technically brilliant, but far more weighty (and the best of the bunch) is the 1960 Prague Festival recital presented on this disc. By this time Arrau's playing reflected more of the heft and ""grand manner"" that were hallmarks of his later years. The quieter preludes are played with intimacy whereas the more dramatic ones project form and architectural structure. Arrau brings tremendous technical authority to the etude-like preludes - for example, his fearless attack on the wildly gyrating sixteenth prelude is quite amazing. And who could bring such weight to the seventeenth, eighteenth, twentieth and hair-raising twenty-second preludes? The finale is a series of artillery shots, with the last three chords a hammering doom. This is incredible Chopin playing.The Symphonic Etudes were recorded in 1976, also in Prague. The Etudes have long been favorites of mine (I acquired Arrau's 1970 Philips recording thirty-some years ago), however, this recital performance elevates the music to another level. Arrau, who could be stiff in the studio, was typically far more venturesome in front of an audience and this is clearly the case here. His playing, while structurally monolithic, is supple, colorful, and highly energetic. If you don't know this music, or this great pianist, I can't imagine a better introduction than this thrilling performance.Although the liner notes do not specify the source tapes, I would guess based on the very good sound quality that both recitals were professionally recorded, perhaps for broadcast.Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J259Y2X1P206/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B6AK#wasThisHelpful","R1J259Y2X1P206","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What better way to introduce this wonderful assortment of Erroll Garner tracks than to reproduce the following write-up from his manager, Martha Glaser, who was also the producer of ""The Erroll Garner Collection"":""This album, the second in the series of previously unissued recordings by Erroll Garner, covers a span of output from 1961-65. The rhythm section of Kelly Martin, on drums, and bassist Eddie Calhoun, appears on all of the tracks.""As with 'Easy To Love,' the first album in this collection, the dilemma was one of making choices from the abundant and extraordinary Garner recordings in the vaults, still awaiting their first public exposure. Following the release of 'Easy To Love,' critic Gary Giddins asked me why the recordings weren't issued in the 60's when they were recorded, since they are of such prime quality. A good question. Quite simply, Garner recorded so prolifically that in a standard three hour session, he would play, improvising non-stop (usually one-takes), enough material for several outstanding albums. Sometimes, as Erroll said ""the piano got so good"" to him that he wouldn't let go, or stop. (I still have vivid memories of the engineers frantically trying to change reels as Erroll rolled on, without pause.) Thus, the recordings stockpiled, and there is much glorious material yet to come.""Indeed, this is prime Erroll Garner.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AUB942ZEMFHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000004774#wasThisHelpful","R2AUB942ZEMFHE","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not always that keen on ""best of"" compilations, but this program selected from the two studio sessions The MJQ recorded for Pablo is a qualified exception. It was to The MJQ's credit that after a seven year hiatus during which each of the musicians had gone their own way, they took advantage of their Pablo years to explore new material and didn't just use the opportunity to rehash their greatest hits in up-to-date stereo sound.While the tracks included in this compilation are representative of The MJQ's stay on Pablo, I do question the brevity of the 45 minute program in this era of 80 minute cd's. In that three of the ""Best of"" tracks (Connie's Blues, Echoes and Watergate Blues) were taken from the 46 minute album Together Again and the others from the 43 minute Topsy: This One's for Basie, there's no excuse for the producers of ""The Best of the MJQ"" to have left so many tracks behind. If I didn't already have ""Best of"" in my library, I would opt for the other discs which offer a lot more music for not much more money.

"Although Claudio Arrau had impressive credentials as a Liszt player - his only teacher was Martin Krause, who was a student of Liszt - and he performed many of the composer's works early in his career, he neither exploited this association, nor became known as a Liszt specialist. Perhaps this was because Krause warned him not to become a specialist in the music of any one composer, urging him instead to embrace all music. Consequently, the younger Arrau's repertoire was very large; however, as he grew older he concentrated on fewer composers, moving as it were from the universal to the particular applying almost prophetic insight into certain scores, especially those of Beethoven and Liszt.Arrau didn't begin recording his Liszt series for Philips until he was nearing seventy, not necessarily an auspicious age to be taking on such a technically challenging project, yet the energy and imagination he brought to this music was truly remarkable. To be sure, Arrau the poet-philosopher was ultimately in charge, and it is the mythic/heroic and spiritual aspects of Liszt's music that are most evident in his recordings. Even such obvious examples as the Transcendental Etudes reveal themselves under Arrau's hands as music first and technical exercises second, not because they are toned down, which they aren't, but because the pianist drills into and extracts the musical core. Indeed there are technical miracles all over the place even though many listeners won't necessarily be aware of them (just listen to the magnificent Verdi paraphrases), but displays of raw power was not what Liszt's, or for that matter any composer's music, was all about for Arrau.Virtually every recording in this box set is exceptional - from the Sonata, which was hailed as a classic when it was first released in 1970, to the selections from Annees de Pelerinage. Les jeux d'eaux a la Villa d'Este glitters with an incomparable display of shimmering color while making a profound spiritual impact. And what a gorgeous sound Arrau's piano makes here! Arrau's Sonetto del Petrarca 104 is a superbly judged combination of architecture and poetry, and no. 123 a statement of sublime transcendence. Listening to the rhapsodic Benediction de Dieu dans la solitude unfurl reminded me of the many unforgettable Arrau recitals I attended in the 1970's when the Maestro frequently programmed the Sonata, Ballade and Les jeux d'eaux. Playing like this forces you to rethink what Liszt is all about.All of this is truly desert island Liszt; and given that many of these recordings have long been unavailable, I would urge collectors to acquire this set while they can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQU3Y3M8U2X1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E4TZ#wasThisHelpful","RQU3Y3M8U2X1E","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the extensive introductory material on the founding of the Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Holmby Hills sub-divisions, it's obvious that the author of ""Unreal Estate"" is no Kevin Starr, who tells complex history in a comprehensible way. I ended up skipping scores of pages of disjointed narrative piled up with needless detail and felt I hadn't missed a thing. Once (or if) you get past the introductory chapters, which readers will soon realize are nothing but pretentious window dressing, you'll find that the history of the houses Michael Gross chose to write about, and the families who built and lived in them, reads like a mixture of  ""National Enquirer"" and ""Hollywood Babylon"" with a dash of ""Architectural Digest"" thrown in. Gross occasionally strays from the path of rehashing gossip and innuendo -- there is some interesting material included such as the history of the Boldt-Weber house -- but the focus is mostly on the stories of the owners of the homes, virtually all of which are denigrating.Furthermore, by adopting a chronological approach rather than one by subject, the author didn't make ""Unreal Properties"" easy to follow. The same properties are repeatedly revisited over the course of hundreds of pages by which time the reader has lost track of, not to mention interest in, whose house it was in the first (or second, or third) place. This is exacerbated by the virtual absence of photos, which is a huge flaw; there are only three, one of which, strangely enough, is of Jayne Mansfield with Mickey Hargitay. How can a book on houses have almost no pictures? I felt like I was dropped off in the middle of a forest without a compass.

"Here's another stunning bargain from the same firm that offers the Arrau, Schnabel, and Solomon EMI box sets, among others, in download format. In this case, this download includes all of the contents of Icon: Dinu Lipatti [Box Set], a seven disc collection that captures nearly all of the recordings of the great Romanian pianist.While I have long admired Dinu Lipatti, my music library included only three Columbia Odyssey LP's that I bought around 40 years ago: the Chopin waltzes, op. 58 sonata (along with a few other Chopin pieces), and the Grieg and Schumann concertos, all classic recordings that still deserve that over-used designation. I had never explored the rest of Lipatti's output, so the majority of the things collected in the EMI set were new to me. The things that really impressed me were his Bach, Mozart, Bartok and especially the Enescu sonata. There was a crystalline quality to Lipatti's playing that really comes through in his Bach and Mozart, although the Mozart concerto (K467) comes across in a surprisingly muscular way. There is a Liszt E-flat major concerto from a 1947 concert, unfortunately in pretty bad sound, and a Chopin E minor concerto recorded live three years later in only marginally better sound. The Bach concerto, recorded with Eduard van Beinum in 1947, is very impressive, with Lipatti displaying a rock solid command of the keyboard, a tremendous sense of rhythm and driving forward momentum. Lipatti's reading of Ravel's ""Alborada del gracioso"" just sizzles and his Schubert Impromptus, from his final concert, are anything but lightweight. In fact, based on most of the recordings collected in this anthology, I have to say that the comments chronically repeated by other reviewers about Lipatti's ""angelic"" playing are somewhat off the mark. I would instead say that he was a real dynamo... with wings.The recorded sound is generally very good considering the age of the source material and I would guess that the producers licensed (or appropriated) transfers directly from EMI. Too bad they didn't design better accompanying artwork, but that's easily fixed.Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D2CQZCDC6CQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YAOGYY#wasThisHelpful","R3D2CQZCDC6CQI","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He was simply the greatest musician at the keyboard I've ever heard. His playing had an irresistable elan - what the Germans call Schwung - as if he were grabbing you and twirling you in a dance.... His performances were never about him. They were all about the composer. In an era when the cult of personality was still flourishing, Schnabel was insistent that a performer serve the score. He abhorred any kind of showmanship.... He wanted to penetrate to the heart of a score and understand what the composer really wanted. He was most interested in works that allowed him to keep asking questions, probing, exploring - 'music,' as he used to say, 'that is better than it can be performed.'""

"Claudio Arrau's ultra-rhapsodic approach to the Brahm's D minor concerto is not for all tastes, however, this 1959 concert traversal with Paul Kletzki and the Orchestre National de France is the best of his recordings that I've heard. The first movement, which Arrau stretches to near breaking point in his studio recordings (Giulini, 1961; Haitink, 1969) is somewhat tauter here. The opening minutes, which are meant to lead to a buildup of tension are not as dramatic as they could be, however, there's greater forward momentum than Arrau projects with Giulini or Haitink. The second movement also starts out a little too deliberately and feels excessively solemn. And of all pianists one would think that it would be Arrau who would extract everything from the magnificent plateau reached later in the movement, but it's actually the youthful Leon Fleisher who delivers a statement that's never been equaled (Brahms: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2 / Handel Variations, Op. 24 / Waltzes, Op. 39). The finale finds Arrau much less restrained, making one wish that his vision had been a little less self-willed. Still, this performance explains why so many admired the epic journey Arrau made of this concerto.The B flat major concerto with Markevitch and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra taken from a 1956 concert is another matter. Arrau's vision of this work fits Brahms perfectly - massiveness combined with virtuosity. The footprint is essentially the same as his titanic 1963 concert reading with Alexander Gibson (Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 2; Schubert: Three Piano Pieces, D946), and if I prefer the later reading it's because the work ripened further under Arrau's hands during the intervening years. While the Markevitch reading has a slightly greater sense of urgency about it, the reading with Gibson finds Arrau, no less technically oriented, focusing more attention on detail while building a bigger statement. There's an epic grandeur to it that's irreplaceable, making it my first choice for the B flat major concerto.This two disc set is filled out with a 1959 reading of the Beethoven C minor concerto with Carl Schuricht and the Orchestre National de France. Arrau, a great Beethoven player, delivers an energetic but polished performance that's more in line with his 1958 EMI studio recording with Galliera than the plusher Philips recording with Haitink from 1964.The sonics differ on all three recordings, which I suspect are radio air checks. The first couple of minutes of the D Minor Concerto suffer from intermittent clouds of static which is resolved prior to the entry of the piano. The B flat major offers acceptable sound, whereas the Beethoven concerto is very compressed.3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30DE7QAVDLS8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003HE1GHM#wasThisHelpful","R30DE7QAVDLS8Q","A19T4IHJU5CZOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19T4IHJU5CZOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They match exactly in color and in the size of the chain, and the one that I put onto the necklace is a perfect length.  Now what will I do with the others?  Well, I love wide bracelets, so why not wear six or seven of them at once with my necklace?  It all worked out perfectly.  These are really nice looking bracelets if your taste goes to just one strand, and the lobster claw works beautifully.  It's great as an extension and as a bracelet on its own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R2KQLOKANPY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI8XNG0#wasThisHelpful","R1R2KQLOKANPY8","A31Z48BHHUTB0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31Z48BHHUTB0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just what I expected.  These are perfectly sized Post-its with just the right amount of stickiness on them.  I need them to label about 30 pictures of illustrations for my publisher and couldn't use paper clips; they would ruin the smoothness of the print.  I also couldn't use the extra sticky notes because they would ruin the surface of the picture.

"I have a double use for these dusters.  First, the usual, which is that they help keep my computer clean - laptop and desktop alike.  But also, I'm an artist and I do a lot of pencil work.

"I absolutely LOVE these erasers.  At first I couldn't imagine what in the world I'd bought so many of them for, but then it became obvious.  As each one is used, the corners get rounded, and I like to have some sharp cornered erasers around to erase errors very carefully and without destroying what I want to leave in.  I like precision and these erasers give it to me.  I also use them for special effects, such as drawing clouds when I want a very bright area, and the sun's rays as well.  Aside from that, it's a great eraser for general erasing.  It does leave debris behind and that would affect the subsequent drawing so I always keep a bottle of multipurpose air spray duster (the kind that's used to keep computers clean) around.  That way I don't smudge my drawing by brushing away the eraser debris - I just blow the debris away and it leaves the paper clean.  One added benefit is that I've purchased other gum erasers and they have had an absolutely horrible odor.  These have a most pleasant scent to them, reason enough to purchase them.  They're also the best gum erasers I've ever used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKMUKA3WUI5RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006ZELR2#wasThisHelpful","RKMUKA3WUI5RF","A31Z48BHHUTB0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31Z48BHHUTB0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a bit tricky to put together, mainly because of the directions.  It is doing a good job in my closet where I like to keep my shirts of similar colors together, but there's not enough room in the closet.  Enter this hanging clothes rack, and I doubled my space.  Luckily the carpeted floor of my closet stays nice and clean, because the bottoms of the shirts do touch the floor.  The rack is adjustable, but it needed to be adjusted to its greates length due to the not unusual length of my shirts.

The nail polish really does last for one week solid, but one of the keys to its lasting is to use this top coat when you're finished with the application of the nail polish itself.  It lengthens the staying power of the Vinylux nail polish and it also, somehow, accents and improves the beauty of the polish itself.

I divided one area with a piece of rebar and the other with white aluminum so I could tell the two areas apart in the pictures. The Everydrop was only applied to the LEFT side of both areas.

It rained 5 inches on Nov.16 and several times throughout this trial. On Nov.19 after 21 days total, I took another picture.

Yes, I would recommend this brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0I7LKZBZ0Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFQS19K#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0I7LKZBZ0Y5","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this little dish. I have almost every piece to this set but never ordered these small casserole dishes, thinking they would be too small. Seems most of the collection is pretty big in size so I finally tried this small oval. I am so glad I got it! This is perfect for my baked artichoke dip or serving a veg. but I ended up keeping my Kerry Gold butter in it in the fridge. It is hard to find a butter dish for European butter but this worked great! Now I wish I had at least another for all the other things I used it for so I will be ordering another one, love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EWHAHR9J4X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGUY3CU#wasThisHelpful","R26EWHAHR9J4X7","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have cooked every Asian cuisine except for Japanese and was really interested in learning about it. This is a great educational tour on the subject and I quickly realized this was a subject I knew next to nothing about past sushi and sashimi. This is a large book with great photography for every recipe which is so important with a recipe you are not familiar with. it is also carefully written walking you through each recipe step by step. I was surprised how simple yet complex Japanese cooking was. I think the most difficult thing for me was learning the ingredients and keeping things simple. As much as I am enjoying this book, I think it is important to note though, many of the ingredients are not attainable to everyone. For me that was quite frustrating but no fault of the author or book, just my remote geographic location which is nowhere near an asian market. In any case, even if I could not acquire an ingredient, I still became far more educated on what Japanese food is and even though I strongly improvised far beyond the listed ingredients the end result was still quite enjoyable and inspired me in new directions. This is a beautiful book on the subject that I would recommend. If you are lucky enough to go to Japan you should definitely explore this book before you go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RDXR7ARIOVHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770856064#wasThisHelpful","R3RDXR7ARIOVHM","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic flash drive, it is small and sturdy. It loads lightning fast and holds a lot. I like the design with a hole so you can put it on a key chain or lanyard. I like the solid body especially over the usb connection, it can't bend and does not require a cover like older types. Really nice flash drive, I would buy more of these and I would recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8OL41JXT0UKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CCTJKE#wasThisHelpful","R8OL41JXT0UKX","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have very dry skin so I have to use oil first than sunscreen daily. I was really looking forward to trying this sunscreen oil so I could moisturize and protect my skin in one step. Unfortunately it was not a product I could use, the smell of this is horrible. I am sensitive to strong fragrances and particularly don't like them on my face. This smells like raid bug spray to me. This is a dry type of oil which did not make my skin feel moisturized. I ended up washing it off and going back to my coconut oil and Oil of Olay sensitive skin sunscreen. I did not care for this product at all.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHZILF1XPP9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01648QGZ4#wasThisHelpful","R1GHZILF1XPP9H","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boy is this delicious especially the triple berry which has strawberry,blackberry and blueberry, the blackberry being the standout! I found this on sale locally, just 2.50 from the regular price of 3.50 worth every penny. The ingredients are simple, fruit, honey, pectin and citric acid thats it, just like the spreads I make myself. The berry is hands down the best of the four, but I also love the tropical with mango, peach and passion fruit yum! It is thinner than preserves much like home made. We love this on oatmeal, yogurt, brie cheese, goat cheese or cottage cheese. Great on crepes and cheesecake too or just on a big spoon, you won't be able to resist trust me! I will be buying this again soon. Great job Smucker's, I'll be sharing this for gifts over the holidays along with my fresh baked bread!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JKQYHGOGOMMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014BQ4LZI#wasThisHelpful","R2JKQYHGOGOMMG","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great eye wash that does not sting or burn even a little bit. Great for washing out eyes when you get an eyelash or anything in your eye and it's already irritated this won't further irritate it. I used it when I had pink eye and found it soothed and relieved the itching. I keep this on hand all the time, the eye cup is included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROG29MPO4DP4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000052XC6#wasThisHelpful","ROG29MPO4DP4B","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always have this on hand and I prefer the ""original"" because it does not have lidocaine or any pain killing stuff that can burn your eyes. I have used this around my eyes as well as some of my pets and it does not burn at all. It heals cuts fast. Great for the emergency kit in your home, boat or vehicle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YTA8HJHB521H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014CTZ0E#wasThisHelpful","R2YTA8HJHB521H","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
