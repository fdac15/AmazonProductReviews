"This is the coffee scoop I have been looking for.  My mom has a coffee scoop and makes the most perfect coffee every time.  I always used a table spoon and it never turned out just right.  With this scoop my coffee comes out perfect every time like my momma's and it has a nifty bag clip so I don't have to leave the scoop on my coffee!!  The clip is super durable and dependable.  It is much more than I expected.  I love the colored gems on them.  It looks great on my coffee bag and they come in a variety of colors.  The scoop is equivalent to 1 1/2 tablespoons.  I use 1 scoop to make my individual cup of coffee!!

"I do the saliva test and it seems to be accurate to me.  You are supposed to test 2 hours after you eat.  You can use a spoon and spit on and place 1 test strip on the spoon for 15 seconds for an accurate reading.  There is also a urine test.  I have not tried that one because I prefer the saliva testing.  I would have given the product 5 stars but the case is difficult to open and fits tighter than others I have tested.  Make sure when you first receive the box to open it from the bottom to get the test kit out of the box.  Otherwise you may take the cap off while opening the box and spill the test strips.  Great kit, just needs tweaking on the cap because it fits too tight making it a pain to open and close.  The test strips are jammed in there also and they should have a tiny bit of room to move around freely.  Minor modifications to the packing would make this a 5 star product.* I received this product for quality testing and review. The product itself meets my expectations, minor packaging issues caused 1 star to be deducted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2229DZFFR96CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI6SNKA#wasThisHelpful","R2229DZFFR96CB","A2ODVNRVGYNNKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODVNRVGYNNKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These test strips are super easy to use and give a wealth of information to help your body. My mom has used PH test strips for years to test the pool but I never knew they had test strips for you.I didn't know by testing your saliva it could tell if you are too alkaline or too acidic and there are major complications with being too much of one or the other.  By resting your PH it can help you tweak the foods in your diet for optimum health.  I have liked on a terrible poor diet for several years now and I want to change my eating habits along with exercise to shed some pounds.  Knowing my body's PH can help me keep it in check so I feel good enough to keep a proper diet and exercise regimen.* I received this test kit for quality testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13VDUWQ10HWY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OSJQIO#wasThisHelpful","R13VDUWQ10HWY5","A2ODVNRVGYNNKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODVNRVGYNNKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never heard of a silicone wedding band until after TV host Jimmy Fallon from the Late show had a finger injury, called ring avulsion.  You may not want to google pictures of ring avulsion because I almost got sick glancing at the photos to write my review.  Now I see a lot more people turning to them since he is bringing awareness to his horrifying injury.I have a gorgeous diamond wedding band but my fingers tend to swell and I have to go a few weeks without my wedding ring every so often and that is troublesome to me.  I have been married for over 12 years and I hate to go without my wedding ring because guys always think I am single and ask me out or for my number even when I am with my pre-teen boys.  I don't want to resize my ring because when the swelling in my fingers goes down my ring fits or even twist around on my finger.I think this silicone band is great and is inexpensive compared to my wedding ring.  Not to mention, I like to wear it to the gym or when I am working in my flower garden.I have been wearing the ring for a week and it is super comfortable on my finger and I often forget I am wearing it until I see the pretty Aqua color.  It comes with a 1 year satisfaction guarantee and if it ever breaks they will replace it.  That is my kind of warranty.*  I received this ring for quality testing and review. I am satisfied with the quality of this ring to give it a 5 star rating. I would be happy to answer any questions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAYZ9C5MG0HZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSE7LFY#wasThisHelpful","R3UAYZ9C5MG0HZ","A2ODVNRVGYNNKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODVNRVGYNNKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CLELO Vintage Canvas Leather Schoolbag Laptop Backpack Rucksack - BlackThis is a really well made vintage style canvas with leather accented rucksack.  I have been in love with canvas since I started wearing a hobo bag that was made of a canvas material.  This bag is great for my pre-teen boys to use.  I shoved a ton of clothes in it to take photos of for my review to fill the bag out for the photos.  The zippers are nice and rugged and go well with the bag.  The back is padded and has padded straps for comfort.  The leather straps on the front of the bag are actually a snap closure making it easy to get in and out of your bag quickly.  There are a variety of pockets inside and outside of the backpack and even a zipper enclosure on the backside of the backpack.  My oldest son called using the bag 1st as soon as I got it out of the box.  These bags are a thick canvas material with sturdy stitching.  They come in an array of colors.* I received this bag for quality testing and review and it exceeds my expectations.

"This kit has everything you would need even a few buttons for on the go!  Nice compact zippered case is durable and the accessories are nicely kept inside.  It comes with a bundle of extra safety pins and push pins to fit many needs.  The small pair of scissors are sharp and a great set of standard needles to sew something up quick!This kit is great for anyone especially college students, new families and baby showers for new moms and dads!I love this kit because my boys are always busting the seams of their teddy bears and need me to see them up.  I have a small teddy bear hospital on my sewing table waiting to be serviced.

"This Bamboo pillow cost less than the same type at my local big box store.  My mom just paid over 30 bucks for one like this.  I was wondering what all the hype was about!! What is really so special about this new technology in a pillow?  Well, when I received this pillow in the mail and opened it up I found out exactly what all the hype was about.  It is truly a luxurious hotel quality pillow.  Here is why:  • Luxurious shredded memory foam technology that promotes adequate air circulation, cooling comfort, and temperature regulation in comparison to standard memory foam  (Which is true, because with standard memory foam pillows I get so hot and sweaty, that I can't sleep)  • Durable 40% bamboo and 60% polyester blended fabric cover that can easily be unzipped and machine washed when needed (Hello?!? It comes with its own fabric cover, which is nice and soft)  • Substantial breathability and shapeability that molds and fluffs to YOUR comfort for any type of sleep, including back, stomach, and side sleeping. (which I was happy with because the pillow easily molded to my needs instead of it's own, making it super comfy so I can get a good night sleep)  •  Relief from insomnia, allergies, snoring, migraines, TMJ, neck and back pain, and more!  (I suffer from insomnia, allergies, snoring, TMJ, back pain...well that's terrible to say out loud.  It has helped my insomnia and allowed me to get comfortable faster to get a better night sleep without waking up hot like with other pillows I have tried.  My back pain is gone too.  I am not sure about the snoring or TMJ since nobody has been awake to hear if I am snoring or grinding my teeth.  I have asthma and allergies and I am not sure if the pillow has helped that either, probably depends on what you are allergic to.)If you are not satisfied with your pillow they have a money back guarantee!!  I am 100% satisfied with this shredded memory foam Bamboo pillow and it is definitely worth every penny for a great night sleep!* I received this product at a discount for quality testing and review and it far exceeded my expectations!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2652S16XFZ10K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AVRYUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2652S16XFZ10K","A2ODVNRVGYNNKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODVNRVGYNNKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These trays are so cool!!  Fun and easy to use.  There is a trick to getting the ice out easy. You can either run cold water on the bottom of the tray or just having it out of the freezer for a minute while you pour your tea or drink is usually long enough time for them to become lose enough to slide right out.Made out of a high grade food safe silicone makes them stretchy to twist and turn the tray.  I put tea in my glass and turned the tray over with a plate under it and started by popping 2 middle pieces out.  Then I popped the 2 on the outside of the middle ones that popped out.  Finally, I popped out the other ones from the middle out.  It took me less than 1 minute total from getting it from the freezer to popping it into my iced tea.  I have has lots of practice with other silicone ice trays I have tested.  It takes some practice to get the hang of it.  But once you go the silicone tray route you will never go back to hard trays with small ice cubes!* I received this tray set for quality testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3VKI9P28AV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013K7QRLA#wasThisHelpful","RN3VKI9P28AV0","A2ODVNRVGYNNKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODVNRVGYNNKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the 360 design because when my preteen boys were 1 I gave them baby toothbrushes with 1 side and my youngest son always would turn the brush away from his teeth to brush instead of to his teeth.  This brush is well designed, comes in a variety of fun colors and a ton of microfiber bristles.  Great to use with just water for training or they have Flouride free baby toothpaste you can use too.  Just remember to use a tiny amount for proper tooth brushing.  It has a nice, wide easy to hold handle for small ones and it the perfect step to your children to learn how to brush on their own.  The sooner you teach them the better.  By boys have been successful at being cavity free except for 1 chipped tooth since we started their brushing regimen early.  It makes it second nature to them.  Starting early will help save thousands in costly dental bills in your future.  This is a great 1st step to success.Even great to give as a birthday present or baby shower gift!!I personally will be using it to brush my doggies teeth.  I think it works even better than most dog tooth brushes I have seen at the big box stores.* I received this baby buddy 360 toothbrush for quality testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUDM79BXI14X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6NM1IM#wasThisHelpful","RUDM79BXI14X4","A2ODVNRVGYNNKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODVNRVGYNNKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these nifty TSA Approved locks.  Way better than the lock and key ones because I always loose the keys and my husband has to cut them off.  Not to mention on our last trip from Hawaii to Los Angeles TSA cut the locks off of my Husband's military gear and we still had to travel all the way to SC.  Making it a real inconvenience for our family with dogs in tow.  If we had these locks at the time they could have simply opened them, checked them and locked out expensive military gear back up.  They assured us they would not be checking his bags and to leave the locks locked and not to worry.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  These locks are so important to have. They are so easy to open with the 3 digit combination.  I was able to reset the combination within 30 seconds and my lock was ready to go.Great not only for air travel.  Can be used for your gym locker, backpacks, laptop bags, tool boxes and so much more.  It is a heavy duty lock and well made.  The dials turn easily and the locking mechanism is super strong.

"I don't know about you but safety is a top priority in my home.  We have a fence around our yard, 6 dogs to alert us and cameras surveillance around our property with a large bright pole light that lights up my entire yard.

"I was initially going to give this product 4 stars but decided to give it 5 since on the product page it has full instructions and photos showing you how to use the tools.  Therefore completing what I needed to make it a 5 star set with the correct purchase price.I love how the photos show you how to use the tools because I learn better by visually seeing how something works.  The tools are a great little sturdy set to get the job done.  Perfect for my preteen boys since we have 4 BMX bikes and they are always tinkering on them.

"Professional quality temperature change gel polish!  Easy to apply and only took 1 minute for it to dry for me under my UV flashlight.  I applied 2 coats and dried each under the UV light.  I didn't have any sticky residue with this polish like some other reviewers have mentioned.  If you do have a sticky residue just use a gel cleaner and rub over them and the stickiness goes away.  I didn't have that problem none of the times I have used it so far.  My nails are silky smooth with a high gloss shine.  I love the color change.  They have a variety of beautiful salon quality temperature change gel colors to choose from.  Gel is the way to go because it last longer than regular nail polish.  I used to never paint my nails because I would have to do touch ups every other day.  With this polish it stays on for 2 weeks.  To remove the polish simply soak a cotton ball or cotton round in an acetone nail polish remover and wrap it around your finger for 2-3 minutes then you can easily peel the gel polish off.  It is truly that simply, you just have to be diligent about the process.  You can save hundreds of dollars in a year by doing a salon quality nail manicure and pedicure at home!!

"This nail polish is excellent!!  It dries in a few minutes under a LED light or UV light.  The funny part is that I was sitting under a LED lamp using an UV flashlight to dry my nails.

It is great to have salon quality gel nail polish that last 2 weeks between changes.

"Super strong clamps that hold tight without damaging the garment.  It will not lose its grip and leave you in an embarrassing bind.  Great to wear under military uniforms or suits. You can be active while wearing these and be confident they will not fail.  The clamp is really that strong.  They are adjustable, but show wear over time if you adjust it a lot. Your shirt will stay tucked in and most of the time your shirts are not many different lengths in the first place so that should not become a problem.  The strap material will not rub and irritate your skin either like some other brands I have seen.  Look good and professional in what you wear on the outside by taking care of it on the inside.

However, she said I am obese and need to get my weight under control of I will be looking at serious health issues in the near future.My biggest problem is late night eating with a diet of  potato chips and soda.

"The speakers are a great quality and sounds clear during song play.  But the bluetooth connectivity to my iPhone 6 plus is not perfect.  There is a slight distortion or interference you can hear when you are changing songs.  There is more treble in these headphones than bass.  I am more of a bass person so if you are not a bass fan then these are great for you.  The fit is great once I figured out how to put them in correctly.  I can shake my head like a bobble head doll and they don't fall out.  I could see how they are sweat proof by way they fit in your ear. I like the flat design of the cable and I can barely feel it on my neck.  These would be great for running and sports.*  I received these headphone for quality testing and review.  They pass with a 4 star rating, good quality with a minor bluetooth flaw that can be overlooked.

"I am not a fan of ear hook headphones but these are great.  They are very comfortable to me and adjust easily to fit my needs.  The sound quality of these are excellent.  There is the right amount of bass and treble in these.  I love music blasting in my ears to feel immersed in my music. The sound of the piano, harp, violin, drums and keyboard sound like I am at a live concert.  These are a great set!  I have tested many sets of headphones and these fall among my top 3.  The volume control works great on the headset.  The buttons turn the volume up, down and pause the music.  You have to make sure your volume on your phone is up so you can increase the volume on the control to the max level.  Otherwise you won't get the highest sound available for the headphones.Great fit, quality, design and functionality to fit multiple customers needs.

"This unit has a pet friendly setting that works for my 6 dogs and cat.  It has a nightlight with an on, off or night sensor.Ultrasonic, ionic, and electro-magnetic settings to deter pest.It has deterred pest in my home but not eliminated them all together.  I had one mouse come in and it took me 3 days and setting a mouse trap a dozen times before I caught him with a peanut butter trap.  It would not go near my glue traps and stole the cheese and peanut butter off of other traps so many times.  So it must have been some type of super mouse to get by everything so many times but my persistence paid off.I have seen a decrease in spiders that enter my bathroom.  I had one that I thought was dead but I went to get it out of my bath tub and it was laying on its side and started moving slowly when I touched it.  Maybe the device was causing it to slowly die.  I am not sure.  But I had never seen anything like that before.I would not recommend this as a set it and forget it type of pest control.  I have a few of these in different rooms and have glue traps and mouse traps too.  I dry to keep my home pest free anyway I can.  I think these are helpful but not 100 percent effective.  If it deters 50 percent of the pest then it is worth it to me.

"The red and blue rear tail lights are super bright and have 4 different functions.  On, flash, SOS and off.  Made of an aircraft grade aluminum body, waterproof, batteries included, no tools required, quick release strap and 240° side angle. These rear tail lights have all the bells and whistles. One can be placed on the front of the bicycle and and one to be placed on the rear. These lights are not for illuminating your way but for safety.They are not only for your bicycle they can use for a number of safety reasons. My boys place these on their backpacks and walk to the school bus whenever it's dark outside and passing cars easily see them.These make great gifts or even party favors. You can have a lot of fun with these lights and keep people safe.I almost forgot about the tire wheel valve cap light.  They can be used on a bicycle, motorcycle or car valve stem. It is waterproof and the batteries are included. It is super bright, motion activated, lights up at all speeds and is really cool to see.  You won't be disappointed in the quality and performance.

"This Abco Tech stand is A-A-AMazing!!  It holds my iPhone 6 Plus with Otterbox case so that should tell you how strong it is.  I was highly skeptical at 1st to test it in the clamp, but it didn't waiver.  It is super flexible and can be manipulated in a multitude of ways.  Even from the floor to the bed or floor to my couch.I was awestruck when I saw the photo on the box of the man having it hang around his neck and he seemed to be watching a movie. I am going to do that when I go to the gym.  THAT IS AWESOME!  I can see myself at the gym on the dreadful treadmill watching movies while walking.  Right now I count the seconds until the torture is over on the treadmill.If you register the product you get a free lifetime warranty and that is money you can take to the bank!!

"There are plenty detailed articles and reviews which will go over the cons of this product so I will only add my current experiences. First of all I believe the company packed into too many "" good things"" that they viewed would make the product appear to be BETTER. But things like green tea, papaya  and apple pectin make this tablet more closely related to those all natural diet pills that were so trendy in my 80's teenage years.At this point in my life and after a bleeding ulcer I need real probiotics and Acidophlis of which there is very little of the former ( 233mg of Inulin and a multi-strain (?) probiotic) and none of the later.And while some have reported constipation with use after only one week of use my experiences are those of having taken a Metamucil overload and not wanting to be too far from a bathroom.This product appealed to me for the obvious reasons and I quite like the idea of a single serving pill over the typical 2-3 servings a day many probiotics dictate. But quite frankly I find this mix questionably effective and I think I will go back to my good ol' reliable Sundown Naturals Acidophilus, Ultimate Probiotic Formula with 13.3mg of Lactobacillus Acidophilus.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVM1OZO0IZK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RH5K26I#wasThisHelpful","RVM1OZO0IZK1","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorgeous and comfortable to wear, this is a beautifully simple and elegant watch. slim and light on the wrist it is actually easy to forget that it is even on the wrist. This is a time only piece, there is not calendar, stop watch or other feature it is simply time with four point time markings (3,6,9 and12) and the black face and Diamond accent clearly add to the fact that the design is for looks and basic function.I would argue that the two finest features of this watch is the ability to adjust the wrist band at least three sizes easily with removable links with very secure clips so there is no fear of it coming lose and losing the watch. Arimitron's instructions which are included cover ever model for setting the functions to adjusting the size of all their wrist bands and they are easy to understand.

"Well, I have really been enjoying this Bible and I'm 47 years old.This is really an outstanding study Bible. It might be for kids but it has not been dumbed down at all. It is the Common English Bible, a more modern language slant that the King James version but it is all here, this is not a cliff-note-paraphrased children's bible, every verse is here.What makes it for children aside from the cartoon children (the Deep Blue Crew which are the illustrated guides and despite being modern in nature they are not offensive and delightfully relatable.) but it has these wonderful In-text notes that both highlight certain passages and let a child understand meaning and what they should be looking for in a chapter/book of the Bible. For example the sailboat notes will help you grow stronger with God by pointing out positive traits. Umbrella notes offer help in difficult times, The Light house notes are Faith builders and the Life preserver provides answers to tough questions.There are also ""Did you know?"" notes for historical trivia and interest, Navigation points for verses to remember and I really enjoyed the God's thoughts?My thought's which are devotions that explain how the Bible applies to life today.For as much as this Study Bible has to offer it is wonderful that it is still pretty sleek in design, a nice trade size and light weight that can be handled by small hands, but the content is such that this book might easily be carried on thru their teens to adulthood. Like I said, this is a real Bible and it is designed to be a full-on working study Bible not just a gift Bible. And a must for and Bible school student. This is the Bible I will be giving in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25IACTEYWYYGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261917#wasThisHelpful","R25IACTEYWYYGO","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is a light weight band, easily adjustible with a solid velcro closure and is waterproof in rain and snow but can be washed in cold water and air dry and the plastic shield can be wiped down from water spots with a soft cloth.Has access points for headphone/charger plug ins at both ends, this is definately one of the most versatile for fitting more than one phone and perfect for the larger screen smartphones, as my G4 had room to spare.Very happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8V3QEG8AP5GZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDV5RRG#wasThisHelpful","R8V3QEG8AP5GZ","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The murder of a prostitute in 1919 Cordova in Alaskan territory actually makes for a nice, fun gossipy read tho very predictable, as Charlotte is literally fresh off the boat when the murder occurs, her circle is limited to a handful of suspects. So the reader will be able to pick their way to the conclusion fairly easily but unfortunately that is not the problem.To flesh out the story further Pegau loads the pages with Charlotte's suffragate feminism and past history. In a land where everyone goes to reinvent themselves Charlotte's is the least interesting and quite frankly the more I got to know her I saw her more as an anachronistic selfish, self-important spoilt brat whose ham-handed handling of the investigation actually spurs more crime and nearly gets quite a few other people killed. By the end of the book her solution to the mystery really fell to the luck of having just a few suspects to cull from not because she is particularly bright.I enjoyed the mystery yet disliked the heroine, thankfully this was just a light, breezy read and Charlotte is easily forgettable, but I really am surprised that Pegau plans to create a series around her. The writing is decent, but Charlotte is no Miss Marple - and that is the character Pegau clearly is attempting to emulate.Will not be moving forward with this series but would be intrigued to check out the real case this mystery is based on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9NBBR5XE2O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496700546#wasThisHelpful","R3O9NBBR5XE2O2","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So smooth, silky the nuts and raisins are fresh and chewy, and this includes two heavy duty chocolate bars at 6.9 ounces these are generous portions and I want to add that the quality of this chocolate makes it ideal for gifts and special occasions. I'm also impressed with how well this was enhanced with a nice glass of red wine ( Root 1 Cabernet Sauvignon and Red Rock Red blend).

"This is actually a very good muffin mix, the flavor is decent and it is fairly moist and not too crumbly like most gluten free mixes are.I was intrigued to try this as it is also my first outing with Millet flour which is the primary grain with teff and I will say this is the difference. Most gluten free baking mixes are made with soy and bean flour which is dry and bitter to the taste and lets not forget that for many celiacs soy is just as toxic to their system as wheat can be.This mix bakes up fluffy and browns just like regular muffins and pastries without the glossy, sticky finish that is common in some mixes. I will admit that as flavor goes this is second only to Udi's muffins. If I made any adjustments to this recipe it might be to add almond flour to add a bit more sweetness and moisture. The mix also relies heavily on additions (fruit, veg, nuts) for added moistness. I added one cup of frozen unsweetened blueberries and I'm pleased with the results. It was moist out of the oven and they were still moist after they cooled and spent 8 hours in the refrigerator.Also the package suggests baking at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes. That might work in Texas (where the Bona Dea company is located) but I live at 7000 feet in the Rockies and had to bake it for 35 minutes before it was done.But this is a good product and I will buy it again as well as try out their other mixes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQ9IXENX4UR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LOWUUG#wasThisHelpful","RRQ9IXENX4UR9","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I must say this is quite possibly one of the nicest things I own.I was reluctant to get this as I apparently kill watches. I am one of those people that has to wear digital (which I hate! After all the trouble I went thru to learn how to tell time when I was a child, wearing a real watch is a badge of honor.) a typical watch will stop within a day or two, but resume on someone else's wrist. I can wear a Timex and slow it down so that within a week I will have lost 45 minutes, so my reserve with a watch this nice and of this value is entirely understandable.However, I have been wearing it for two weeks now and it runs like a charm and has not lost a second. I am truly delighted by this!This is a beautiful womens watch and as you can see in my pictures it has a 1.5 inch diameter which provides a very easy to read clock face, the watch and band is stainless steel and very durable and is very easy to set. The band itself is actually very large and I will need to take it in to a jeweler to have the band adjusted. The band sections are spring loaded so perhaps a handier person could pop out the extra panels and adjust it yourself.As I said I stop/slow watches and I have only had this a couple of weeks. You can be assured that if there is any change I will be posting an update in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N72U9OVKN03Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXI5CY#wasThisHelpful","R2N72U9OVKN03Q","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't let the humor used in retailing this product detract you, in fact just consider it a bonus. The product itself absolutely, 100% works and when I looked into it the science of using essential oils in the commode has been around for quite a while, so I suppose the only reason it has not been a steadfastly used in the battle with bathroom odors is because essential oils, which is what Poo-Pourri is made of is actually pretty pricey (hence the retail cost) over the fake chemicals that the aerosprays use.What I found intriguing is how the scent really is activated after you go. I went ahead and experimented and spritzed the toilet in advance in the hopes that the scent would give the bathroom a lovely smell even tho it was not particularly needed at the time. The Vanilla mint is a surprisingly wonderful scent, I'm not usually a fan of vanilla, but this smells fresh like real vanilla and the mint really has an energizing effect. Back to my experiment: in the bowl as is I did detect light, pleasant scent in the room. However, it is when it is used with the proverbial number two that the scent really implodes so to speak and there really is no feces undertones.And since you only need 3-5 spritz for every use a 4 ounce bottle will go a long way so I consider the price to be justified.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G37O8EIHPQ92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW25UJK#wasThisHelpful","R2G37O8EIHPQ92","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really decent rug cleaner that actually got an old tar stain out of my truck floor, but then again Oxy really does work.

"Sweet little plush doll that will double as a stuffed animal or security blanket. She is VERY well made and the details sculpted into the fabric like her toes, fingers and little butt cheeks is adorable. Her clothes are a soft knit that are held on with velcro making it easy for little fingers to dress and undress her. She is machine washable and the magnet in the pacifier and her face are barely noticable. Despite being recommended for 12 months and older I believe this is a doll that can safely be given to an infant to cuddle with. These are the kind of toys that will have longevity in a child's life and not just a passing fad since it is clearly designed to bring comfort.I also think this would be a great toy for anyone doing the Operation Christmas Child boxes for Samaritans Purse!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F5RDMV7BQFF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLAZFKA#wasThisHelpful","R3F5RDMV7BQFF2","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my entire life I had never participated in a Bible study group that centered entirely on women, so I was naturally intrigued to see what this book was about.I found the format to be basic and easy to follow, tho I did not have access to the accompanying videos that Ms. LaGrone has made to go along with each section which covers a five week period and the questions fairly rudimentary and maybe that was why I was not completely comfortable with it. As I said I have never been in a Bible Study course designed just for women and I found it to be unnecessary and by catering to women I felt there was a certain coyness, rather an attempt to seduce women into consecrating themselves to God by feel royal and special which felt a bit underestimating to the personal challenges and the actual discipline of commiting yourself to God. I felt more like I was sitting in on a Junior League meeting.This did make me interested in Jessica LaGore, I wanted to know more about her and her ministry and what her denomination might be since, it is off from everything I had grown up with (Lutheran/Episcopalian) other than her blog, which I did not find particularly informative I found her to be a listed Dean at Asbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky (Does explain the overwhelming sense of ""Southern Woman"" I was picking up from her writing.) which is an evangelical & multi-denominational college & that she did a stint with a Methodist church. I just really hoped to find out more about her than the echoes from her book blurb. I like to have a better ""connection"" with my ""mentors"".While her faith and enthusiasm may be sound, I just don't want my relationship to God to feel like I'm being inducted in to a special club.

"After having read Rebecca Alexander's first book, ""The Secrets of Life and Death"" I felt that she was an author with a lot of promise but still had a ways to go so I was willing to hang in there for her. Sadly her second outing is actually worse than the first and by this I mean her writing needs some serious reworking, she needs an editor with a deft hand that can help her to pull her ideas together and give her storylines a better cohesiveness. As is her writing is a frustrating affair to get thru. Her imagination and even her research seems sound, but she really has difficulty with her characters, pacing and general plotting of format.For example Edward Kelley once again is her predominate secondary character but he is so weak and dislikable that it is difficult to want to read his sections. Coupled with Alexander's disjointed writing does not help. Her other dominate male character, Felix also returns as a possible love interest and researching partner for Jack, but his sections once again are not only fruitless, but he exhibits and ignorance that is frustrating in that he is clearly on a loose end and is more of a hinderance rather than a help when dealing with Jack and Sadie's condition as ""borrowed timers"".And rather than deal with the situation of being a ""Borrowed Timer"" which seemed to be the evolution of the plot from the first novel, Alexander has chosen to embed her second outing with her take on the werewolf mythos which despite what the reader might think has absolutely nothing to do with Jack and Sadie's situation and feels more like a red herring rather than a primary story line to drag this out for a third outing.Problem is, Alexander needs so much help with her writing and story plotting that despite the glimpses of promise she has given us I am perfectly willing to drop her right now.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSURPKH1PVTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140707#wasThisHelpful","R1DSURPKH1PVTL","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have yet to try a product from the Ahava skincare line that disappoints so far Ahava is perfectly designed for sensitive skin, which I will presume to mean that it is ideal for all skin types.This mud mask in particular is a revelation: it does not need to be pasted on as thick as typical mud masks, it dries clear and needs to be on no longer than two minutes before rinsing. It is not tight or uncomfortable when it dries either, so I did not feel the need to hurry and scrub it off like so many other masks I 've tried. And the light scent is fresh and unoffensive and of course my skin was left feeling soothed with no foul side-effects or reactions. Most masks are recommended for once or twice a week use only, but this mask is so easy on the skin and senses that a person could use it daily if they were so inclined without harsh drying.Just one more Ahava product to love and yes I highly recommend this to absolutely everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V1NLVFTPT5AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TMRV8Y#wasThisHelpful","R1V1NLVFTPT5AH","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit, after pulling this from the fridge and rolling it all over my face (I opted for the use as a  mask option) it was very soothing and I also enjoyed that when it dried it did not leave a tight feeling film on my face.I suppose my biggest reservation is the price for this item, particularly since it is more or less an additional item for your overall skincare treatment that isn't really necessary, particularly for the elimination of acne. I can't exactly condone it's use when the money can be more aptly spent on a product that will actually work towards clearing up acne rather than offering minor relief.

"I'm actually pretty impressed with this little soap making kit. The instruction manual is a gem unto itself, not only does it have a very nice selection of recipes it makes note of additions and explains why, for example adding oatmeal (soothing to skin) and honey (a natural anti-bacterial) will accomplish. The entire premise is based on the science and history of soap - how it is made, why we use it and how it achieves effectiveness rather than simply focus on pretty colors, pretty scents and just being pretty. Also includes great direction in not only mixing in additives such as oils and scents but also in how to combine colors for both sheer and opaque soaps as well. This kit is for the child with more scientific inclinations and is a great and very satisfying start for functional creativity and learning.Despite being recommended for children 8+ I gave this to my niece for her sixth birthday, she has been helping in the kitchen since she was a toddler and able to successfully crack eggs without shell flecks since she was three so I figured she could handle this. And she is nailing it! The great part about the book is that it also has a nifty ""how to fix it"" guide in case things don't quite turn out as expected or a complete do over is needed. Which is great because then it teaches a child that mistakes can be fixed or upgraded to a wonderful accident.The kit comes with just basics: 5.28 oz of clear glycerin base, 5.28 oz of white glycerin base, 3 .53 oz pigments for color, 3 sets of molds, two measuring spoons and 5 gift boxes. This is really a perfect amount to get started, all additional ingredients are simple items that can be found at home, and if the child really gets into it these are items that can be bought elsewhere quire easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRKQG4XKARX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGM5O3I#wasThisHelpful","RMRKQG4XKARX5","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was my first Ace Collins book and I was actually taken aback by what a talented writer he is, with over 60 books out I feel really behind that I have not heard of him before. Particularly since I wade through a lot of dreck that should never have wasted the paper it gets published on I am truly astonished that I am just now being introduced to this very fine and extremely capable writer.But I digress, as for the topic at hand: Hollywood Lost, I was pleased with the writing style as Mr. Collins did a great job of emmulating the old noir style writing and often had me reflecting on Elmore Leonard (tho' without the odd ball humor) I really felt as tho I had been transported back to Dust bowl 30's and Hollywood just hitting its star-making stride. Despite name-dropping actual actors (William Powell, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, etc.) The primary characters are fictional, tho the two male leads, Flynn Sparks and Dalton Andrews are so well fleshed out that the real actors they are clearly based on are obvious. As Ace Collines is a Christian writer his primary character, Shelby Beckett is clearly a protagonist with rock-solid morals and by placing her on a Hollywood movie lot where raft and corruption is the name of the game part of the suspense is in weather Shelby can be tricked into temptation. This is clearly the plot point that gets the most development as many readers point out there is otherwise a great deal of predictability to this whodunnit (which is quite frankly also a common plot device in the old Hollywood noirs - it was more about sensationalism and setting the scene rather than a complex mystery.) which will feel rather frustrating to many readers, but thankfully Ace Collins is a deft and intelligent writer and quite frankly the ""Big Reveal"" is absolutely worth the read. In fact it was so good it more than makes up for the chapter 2/3 of the way in that have you wondering if everyone was lobotomized.I'm also impressed that Mr. Collins can write Faith based books that are neither saccharine nor preachy. He delivers a great story without obscenities, nor crass hook lines that aim for shock value. This is a great book that can be appreciated by anyone either on faith or secular level.I will be looking into his other titles for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SXPC681G9HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426771886#wasThisHelpful","R31SXPC681G9HD","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the storyline in the book that accompanies this aircraft model set might be a bit tenuous the instructions are visually very clear so a non-reading child will have no difficulty in figuring out how to put together any one of the 10 models featured here.vOf course once they get started with the basic 10 they will most certainly branch off and begin inventing their own.There are 73 pieces here, a few of them are fairly small and most could be a choking hazard, but I really think the age 3 is a perfectly safe beginning point for this set. There are enough pieces to build each model, but just enough to build one model at a time, since this is a learning toy it is meant to be taken apart and put back together unlike many model toy sets which only produce one thing. The parts easily fit together and come apart, but are sturdy enough they will not be loose and a child can play with what he/she builds. They are also solid and sturdy with mostly curved edges so no nicks or sharp parts.As a beginner engineering kit, I think it is brilliant and my little nephew fell right into it for hours - even his big sister tried to horn in on the action. And I really felt that it is proof that this is a thinking child's toy because unlike a lot of toys in this genre this comes with a nice sturdy plastic tote with an enter-locking lid for storage and organization.

"I picked this tile set up for my dad and I will admit we were a bit put off when we first opened the box and saw that the tiles appear to be just molded plastic and despite the raised pattern, pretty slippery.Thankfully, despite the hard, molded plastic these are not slick and as you can see from my photos even with saw dust scattered on them they are stable and easy to walk on.This set comes with 32 12x12in squares with a 1in lift that can be arranged in any pattern (half the tiles are silver, half black so you can even play with the design.) thanks to the interlocking loops underneath. They snap together much like legos, and the trim edge pieces give it a nice clean finish so you won't trip stepping up on them. These are designed for mechanics and garages, but as you can see my Father needed them for the flooring in his work trailer. We were both really impressed with not only how quickly and adaptable these tiles laid out but when it came to fitting a tile to an edge they cut very easily as well giving a beautiful custom fit.They sweep and mop up well without gathering grit in the seams because that's how well fitted they are, they are not slippery and that 1in of raised space is a nice insulator for keeping my Father's feet warm while he works inside the trailer.

"When I first fell into this novel, I was actually swept away. The dialogue and the action actually picks up on momentum as this is clearly an action paced book. Robert Brockway actually has some pretty snappy repertoire and I didn't have a problem with his characters, maybe it's my age but I actually preferred 1977 NYC punk Carey to 2013 LA Stunt woman Kaitlyn, who quite frankly picks up a rather masculine tone by the end of the book. I guess Brockway was writing so fast his characters lives not only overlap so do their personalities.There really isn't much for conversation, in fact it becomes clear early on that Brockway is all about the snappy one liner, the zinging retort which unfortunately does not add up to any conclusive story-telling. In fact about halfway through his story line is heavily sandwiched between loads of graphic violence. Really everything splats, snaps, scrapes, breaks, oozes, splatters and drips with a zippy retort, usually from Carey in the midst of it all. And that was when the book starts to drag because I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one out there that actually began to get bored from uber-violence and I kept thinking, ""Robert Brockway really LOVED Chuck Palahniuk's books, especially Fight Club.And then this was no longer a unique read to me but rather one authors gushing (literally this book should be dripping blood.) tribute to another in the same off-beat, violent genre. So it was okay, but really lost it's uniqueness along the way which was too bad because I started out liking this book so much and by it's strangely inconclusive end I just felt ""meh"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PXOENYYYM0BF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076537966X#wasThisHelpful","R3PXOENYYYM0BF","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That's right, for those of us Gals that don't blow our savings on bikini waxes we invest in beard trimmers for men and take matters into our own hands.As advertised this is in fact a waterproof body groomer and it is ideal for the shower, as many of us know most beard trimmers are designed for dry use over a sink. (yeah, right.) So I must say that to finally have a battery operated trimmer that works in the shower and at such an affordable price this is a lucky find indeed.The groomer comes with two different trimming combs a 1/8 (3mm) one which is great for maintaining the bush (no pun intended, but here it is.) and a 1/32 (0.5) for fine tuning the hedge. Both of these can be removed so that the trimming head can be used directly on the skin for a full and comfortable clean up without pinching or nicks. At 1.5 inches across this is a quarter inch wider than your basic beard trimmer so it will trim a wider swath but will need a little more attention to fine tuning smaller areas.I liked that I can use this in the shower, I also liked that it can be used on damp of wet hair. It takes a little longer but being in the shower keeps clean up to a minimum. It is also a nice compact 6.5 inches long making it perfect for travel or just tossing in the gym bag and the silicone handle offers a third hand by allowing you to hang it on a shower heard or bar.So far I am very happy with this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ITDV321S1E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010XIGBUQ#wasThisHelpful","R15ITDV321S1E8","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm really amazed with this product, as I am trying it out in a pinch.Normally the only Conditioner I use is Biolage Ultra Hydrating conditioning balm, as I have medium to fine hair and Biolage is the only conditioner I have ever used that seems to rinse clean and actually offer some moisturizing protection to my hair. Most conditioners weigh down my hair or make it greasy either right after I use it or by the end of the day my hair had collected enough grit to seem so.Just for Me Hair Milk has shea butter, soymilk  which had me concerned about not rinsing out well and making my hair oily and honey. So I'm really surprised and quite happy that the product does what it says: it moisturizes my hair, makes it very soft and smooth and more importantly it washes out well and does not grease up my hair and I have been using this for a week now.

"Okay, so I'm only with holding a star because I have not had a chance to try this out in cold weather yet, but I took it out this weekend while our day time temps were in the around 70 and 82 degrees with the night time temps dropping to 44 degrees the first night and 38 degrees the second night (I live in Wyoming). And I must say I had a very comfortable weekend, the first night I laid on top of the wrap around insert for the minimum coverage, if anything it was a warm enough night I worried that I might get too warm and the nylon shell might wind up sticking to me, thankfully this did not happen. The second night the wind picked up and put a bit more chill into the air so I wound up burrowing down under the insert and stayed comfortably warm all night.Since it is summer I did not cinch in the hood but went a head and left it on as extra cushioning for my pillow, but the hood does come with a draw string cord to be cinched in as needed, it will also zip apart. In fact the insert will also zip out, and for anyone who can't sleep with bunchy covers they will appreciate this. The entire sleeping bag will also unzip to be used as a comforter or can even be zipped together with another bag to create an extended bag. the best part about the zips is that they connect easily and taking this bag apart and zipping it back together is easy and there is no struggling to get the zips to connect.Anyway, another nice thing about this bag is that it is very light weight, kind of like a down vest, only with a synthetic filling and it washes up beautifully. By instruction it can be machine washed and dried if necessary but recommends hang drying and quite frankly this is really all you need to do. I threw this in the washer this morning and most of the water was spun out of it on the last cycle, I hung it up to dry out side and it was mostly dry within an hour.So far I am very pleased with this bag and look forward to trying it out this fall in cooler temps to see if it gets a full five star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMKDRUZ29ZDOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOYKVSK#wasThisHelpful","RMKDRUZ29ZDOJ","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love, love, love this pan and for the quality I can not believe it retails for under $30 bucks.I normally cook with cast iron, but I have been coveting a decent ceramic pan just to have a really decent non-stick pan (Teflon sucks!) which can be pretty pricey. This is so strong and so beautifully made and the ceramic coat is lovely and trust me nothing sticks and you really don't need anything more than a wooden spoon to stir and flip - nothing sticks and the entire pan heats up evenly which mean this pan, while dish washer safe can be cleaned up with a sponge or dishrag there is no scouring needed to clean this pan.Of course I also marvel over the fact that while the pan heats up the handle does not and I was able to handle it while it maintained a room temperature. I am going to get at least two more of these pans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SWGW4BQUBTVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X16TPMY#wasThisHelpful","R3SWGW4BQUBTVL","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! I can not believe what I got in this backpack.I repacked the entire contents of what I took on a month long trip to Europe from a few years before into this bag (3 t-shirts, sweat shirt, jacket, 1 pair of jeans, 2 pairs of shorts, 3 bras, 30 pairs of underpants, sandals, 6 pairs of socks and my 12x6x12 cosmetic bag and a bottle each of shampoo, conditioner and body wash) and I had at least another 8 inches to the top of this bag to spare. And this did not include the outside pockets and straps that will also hold water bottles and extras, I can't get over the room in this pack and the innovative inner pockets which are great for organizing and accessibility.I am 6 foot tall and I am really happy with how this bag fits me. The design and make of this pack is also high quality with re-enforced seams and zippers and the real treat to this bag is the light weight aluminum support rack and the mesh encased padding that holds the weight away from your back allowing airway to keep cool while also alleviating the weight of the pack making this perfect for carrying 12+ hours while trekking. The belt is adjustable and also padded for comfort, and the color is actually a deeper blue than as photographed and I can see a guy using this without fear of feminine connotations.I love and highly recommend this pack for anyone who hikes, travels or is looking for a decent sized, sturdy pack to use as a bug-out bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUXQNQUGPF1F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCF2F8#wasThisHelpful","RUXQNQUGPF1F2","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well here is what I liked about this bag is that it is light weight, sturdy, well made and the padding actually made it more comfortable and the cushion creates an airway so the pack is not plastered right up against your back. The straps are adjustable and for a short hike or a daypack you can carry just a few things in a fairly organized manner. There are three small mesh pockets inside right at the top so that a phone, keys or wallet can be easily grabbed. On the outside there is a single zippered compartment which is big enough for a smartphone (more on this later). Two other big pluses are the outside adjustable flap which is perfect for holding a bike helmet, or in my case a rolled up sweat shirt or jacket making it extremely easy to get to. and also as you can see in my 3rd photo is the water bottle pocket along the bottom making it very easy to get to your water while securely holding it in place, there is no chance for it to just slip out.The strap system is a bit convoluted but I did like the elastic band roll system that holds the adjustments in place, they are very effective.What I didn't like about the bag: The Action pocket sleeve is a waste, My Galaxy S4 was to big too fit in it and the S4 isn't even the biggest phone out there so I tossed it, I don't care for the two skinny cross straps at the top that hold the action pocket in place, as you can see I am a curvey woman and those straps, while adjustable are uncomfortable and dig in - hate them and do not use them. The zipper pulls are also a nightmare, as you can see in my second photo they are bits of elastic string that will stretch without pulling, I will be replacing those ASAP. Also the opening to the main compartment is a little narrow, the bag itself will expand to hold quite a bit but the mouth of the bag is maybe 18 inches, so if a person wanted to carry electronics a full sized laptop is a no go event tho the pack itself has room for it. Also on the straps themselves there are two small mesh pockets that are kind of a why bother, they are narrow enough that you could get a pocket knife or chapstick in there, but deep enough that you would have to work at it to fish them out.In a way I feel that less is more with this bag, all of the cute little additions are either unnecessary or do not work and create complications rather than solve them. However cute stuff aside, the depth and volume of this bag is very nice and probably most importantly carries very comfortably for several hours.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OJQE4EHM8EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCF59Q#wasThisHelpful","R5OJQE4EHM8EP","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been wearing Bali Passion for Comfort bras for years now, they are the ultimate t-shirt bras, light weight, wear like iron and hold their shape. A great bra for a full figured gal. So I was actually expecting that same bra only with a front close option.Well this is certainly a variation of the Passion for comfort bra: still runs with the same smooth lines, sturdy build, will hold you up all day long, washes well, and the front clasp is a nifty turn and lock clasp that will not come undone no matter how much you shift around.Only one down side, this has a padded molded cup that is considerably more than ""lightly lined"". The Passion for comfort bra is lightly lined with no unnecessary padding. Now while this padding might be great for winter and no show-thru for anyone over a B cup the padding is not only unnecessary but unwanted.

"For an over the counter acne treatment, this is perfectly suitable for the odd mild yet inconvenient case of acne,i.e. the odd blackhead spot patch around the usual t-zone areas or the occasional whtehead that needs dried out and if I only use it in those areas I can avoid drying my skin out. I do have sensitive skin and I have observed in previous reviews complaints that users skin was drying out and painful. This can happen particularly if a person smears it over their entire face and they may only need it on their chin, nose or forehead. So please use only on affected areas as directed.Otherwise an individual may be in the market for RetinA .05% cream, which is more helpful for more severe cases of acne, and I most definately encourage anyone to see a dermatologist before they invest in any product. Tackling acne is unfortunately not cheap and before taking a chance on anything please visit a specialist to see where you are at. There is a very good chance that the Proactive Line is all you need, but I will also point out that RetinA and other prescription meds cost the same, so you might want to get it right the first time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDF5RVE57O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7P7FO2#wasThisHelpful","R2GDF5RVE57O9","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first time out will Paul Asay and quite frankly I am unimpressed. As a Christian movie reviewer, I found him to be just a little to eager to find a bright spot in some really questionable shows and I did not find myself swayed. I am also disturbed that he seemed to expend more energy into being cool and entertained by these shows and that the case for God and the Christian message was tenuous and not strongly argued.The writing style is suitable for the 12- 14 age group but none of the movies and shows he reviews, and yes these chapters are movie reviews, are shows I would want a kid to watch. Example: True Detective, 2012, Friday the 13th, anything with zombies in it etc. His banter bordered on the hipster doofus, and yes, at least once in every chapter he makes a reference to hipsters. Yet by the same token, despite his best efforts to appear hip and blithe in his writing he illustrates just how far out of touch he is by reviewing the latest movie version of superman and attempting to discuss X-men, the Avengers, etc. when he has clearly NEVER read any of the comic books these movies are based on and his targeted audience will know him to be false! I don't think he has ever read a comic book of any kind  otherwise he would be well aware of the rather intense and dense mythologies of each and every Superhero. Then Asay would realize that movies, at best are cliff notes to these characters. His ""I wonder what will happen next with Hell-boy"" commentary is especially cringe-worthy and had any real back ground right there he could have had an excellent thought provoking treatise on free-will, the influence of God and the awareness between right and wrong and not just a paragraph. As an adult I was put off by his writing it felt forced, as though he put more effort into being clever rather than presenting a truly intellectual dissertation arguing the elements of God and his message in modern media outlets. Sure he throws in the odd quote from C.K. Chesterson and C.S. Lewis, and miscellaneous Bible verses to show us all that at some point in his life he has picked up a book. However when he goes off on the Hobbit and the Lord of the rings he appears completely oblivious to the fact that these were originally books written by J.R.R Tolkein, who like C.S. Lewis created the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit as fantasy centered on Christian theology. Wow, but it's nice that Asay kinda picked up on it in the movies and felt that he was on to something. Seriously, even wikipedia could have done this guy some favors had he decided to add a little research to his general movie-viewing assessments.I could really go on, but in a nutshell the book felt light-weight and out of touch and that there was no research done. Asay's comparisons and arguments felt secondary, rather than primary and as a Christian, I felt both spiritually and intellectually slighted.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DKQY0SODA8JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426787413#wasThisHelpful","R1DKQY0SODA8JN","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, This isn't a bad book really. I don't know if I would call it a cleanse since this is not the typical liquid only cleanse that typically defines a ""cleanse"" this is actually a four day vegetarian diet, complete with soups and salads that include nuts and tofu. So calling this the ""Four day Cleanse"" is just pretty language for what is actually the ""Four day enema"" since cleaning out the bowls is the real end here.I actually picked this book up for other reasons, I wanted to snag all of her juicing recipes. I am terrible at eating my veggies and I do buy into the idea that you get more nutrients from them raw than cooked. Interestingly enough I love her fruit and veg ideas but I am loathe to just juice them as it is a loss of fiber which is really the point of the four day cleanse, really and a loss of crucial vitamins. So I forgo the juicer and I actually use my Ninja to whip everything into a very satisfying smoothie. And rather than enjoy them for four days I try to drink two or three of them a day with my normal diet which also includes dairy and meat. And yes, I do feel better for finally eating more veg and throwing fruit in will even make a turnip tolerable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E00FQZN9KFR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631060325#wasThisHelpful","R1E00FQZN9KFR5","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel like I'm being really generous here with three stars, but I'm kind of torn.First of all, I really enjoyed Paula Brackston's writing. This is the first novel of hers that I have read and I do believe I will go ahead and check out some of her other books. I was completely wrapped up in the side-by-side past/present story telling, it really kept me going tho I admit that I preferred the Megan/Merlin storyline to the Laura/Rhys storyline. Of course the common thread throughout the novel is Merlin, but I felt that Brackston had difficulty fleshing him out like she wanted too.Really the two lead female characters get the best descriptive development. Megan is especially well done and I truly liked her. She is actually a very strong, brave and noble young woman and it really is Megan who drew me in. I was on pins and needles with concern as she manueveres her way thru castle intrigue under the vile Lord Geraint and his trashy wife.Unfortunately, and this is where I am torn with my rating. I really disliked Laura. Where Megan was every possible positive a reader would want in their heroine, Laura is the exact opposite. Laura is selfish, self-involved, whiney, remarkably stupid and a terrible wife and friend. In fact she blindly puts the lives of her husband and friends in needless danger merely because she needs a shag with a clearly scary stranger just to feel better about herself. I almost put the book down, but her best friend, Steph gives her the lecture we all want her to have so that showed me that the author was not particularly fond of her, herself so I plugged along to see where it would go.By the end I was a bit stunned and really dissatisfied because, Merlin is supposed to be a wise and talented wizard who can see the future, yet he plunges Megan into the worst possible scenario, much like Laura, out of pure idiocy and selfishness and there is no clear reason why he should be so found of Laura. Frankly there is no reason for anyone to be fond of Laura. The Anwen character is the true wise mystic in this tale - whoever the heck she is? Seriously, I want to see Anwen again, she is the perfect character to drift through many a novel.But what really upset me, was that like most novels in this genre it all appeared to be going in the direction of Laura facing her consequences and the tragedies they reaped. Instead, Brackston got lazy and decided to quickly wrap things up with a rescue and a reward. whf? If this were a real fairy tale the point would be that being good has no reward, but being useless and dangerous gets the big prize.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3INRHTKQESVA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250069688#wasThisHelpful","R3INRHTKQESVA9","A1I477ADGMLVJM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I477ADGMLVJM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was thrilled to learn of non-toxic chalk markers because as a chemically sensitive person I can't use Sharpies or dry erase markers. These have a small smell of what I guess is alcohol but it doesn't make me ill.The markers are fine and work like the other reviews state. The colors are nice but I would have liked a bright blue. This is more like blue mixed with white. My concern was the lids are inconsistent. Some fit snugly , others loosely. Only one fit well on both ends. They all snapped closed but in different ways. When you were using a pen and put the cap on the other end, 2 of them wouldn't snap in at all and others barely did and if bumped could be dislodged. My biggest concern was that they might loosen more with use and not snap on at all. The package is cheap and is held together with a flap that will likely break with time. They don't list the country that these are manufactured in.Chalk markers are lots of fun and now that I have tried them I never want to be without them. They even work on balloons unless I make it too thick or wide (I am a balloon artist). I returned these pens and have ordered another brand. Perhaps this was just a bad batch. You can feel safe trying them because if they are defective Amazon is wonderful about refunds.I went to the companies website  and asked if there are any solvents and a week later they sent this answer:  The components of markers are: titanium dioxide that is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium. isopropyl alcohol that is secondary alcohol, Daylight Fluorescent Pigment, dispersing agents and waterI noticed they didn't identify the dispersing agents, which to the best of my knowledge is some type of solvent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1366KCN2ZWFYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3BMTRA#wasThisHelpful","R1366KCN2ZWFYZ","A338NGK967YAUA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A338NGK967YAUA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted this to work. My sink had clogged and the plumber found bits of scrubbers (the cheap kind you buy at the store) had created the jam. I searched Amazon for something better. All the other chain-mail scrubbers had poor ratings but this one had good reviews including a video by a top 100 reviewer. I was jazzed.Imagine my disappointment when it barely worked. I cook eggs in a cast iron pan regularly. It only took off about 10% of the egg. The problem is the diameter of the chain-mail. It needs to be about one tenth the size. You might as well try cleaning your pan with a your snow chains (a silly extreme example to demonstrate a point.) I gave it 2 stars instead of one due to the quality of the chain.No worries if you want to try it.

"I do like that this product doesn't defat the coconut it uses in its flour. However, this product is not raw. I contacted the company and asked about the temperature of the processing. They said it was 70 degrees Centigrade which is158 degrees Fahrenheit. There are brands that produce actual raw coconut flour where the temperature is quite low.Perhaps the company is going with a government standard of what can be called raw.

"I have used this product for about 20 years. Up till about 2 years ago I was very happy and would have given 5 stars. The brushes lasted well and so did the unit. The pointed head is just what I need to clean between my crooked teeth and really get the gum line clean.But recently, the brushes started having problems, some from the start, the other after different lengths of time. They are expensive and are supposed to last 3 months. I called customer service at Zila about 9 months ago to see if they had changed where the brushes were made. I spoke to a caring lady who really listened. She ended up replacing 2 brush heads and taught me what to do in the future. There is a tiny serial number on each brush. You just call and give them the number she said, no problem. It had to be within a certain time frame of course. I usually buy 6 at a time. At 3 months each, the total time I have to call and report them would be 18 months. At the end of the call I was very happy and felt like this was a good company that cared about their customers.About 7 months later another one was bad, right from the start. I swapped it out and put off calling since I had plenty of time. I called about 6 weeks later and got a very different customer service rep. She was not caring and didn't care to listen much. She just wanted my information so she could look it up on her computer. She found they were ordered 9 months ago. She stated that I only had 3 months to let them know not 3 months per head. She just wanted to move on to the next customer. I asked when the policy had changed. She said that had always been their policy. I tried to tell her about my previous experience but she had little interest. I felt very unimportant to her. I mentioned that if you buy 6 at a time, and they last 3 months, how will you know if the others are bad. She suggested I open all of them when I receive them and test them. That is an irritating solution but I guess I will have to do it. However, that won't help with the ones that die well before their time.I'm going to send a copy of this review to the company. Let's see if they care at all. I will update you.UPDATE: I emailed a copy of this review to Zila on March 1st. Weeks went by with no response and I had given up on hearing back from them. Finally, on March 18th they  replied with the following:""I apologize for the lack of empathy.The person you spoke to is new and the rules in place for her have always been the way they are today.We have been handed some pretty tough directives in our warranty with no wiggle room.The policies that we used to take as suggestions have now been locked and set in stone.Again, I apologize for your situation and the aggravation that it is causing you.Thank you,Kathryn RogersZila/a Tolmar CompanyOrder Entry SupervisorWeb Support""So essentially, we are stuck with a poorer quality product that they backup very little.

"I read or scanned through most of the reviews as part of my research. I have used this product off and on for years but it seemed to have changed. Some reviewers thought the same, and made conjectures and conclusions. I will break my review into 4 parts so you can easily scan through to the data you need: Current facts, tips to save your enamel, and general health benefits and hot ACV baths.1. BRAGG'S CURRENT FACTS:  Like other reviewers, I was dismayed that my beloved Bragg's vinegar seemed to have changed. It was pale and I didn't see much ""mother"". After doing research on the net I called Bragg's. Here are the facts:Has Bragg's lowered their standards? Happily the answer is no. I spoke with their representative about the paleness of their current vinegar and more. No, they have not changed the dilution, it is still diluted to 5% acidity like always. The vinegar is lighter due to using apples with lighter skins. No, they haven't changed the aging. They wouldn't disclose how long they age it but the period of time is unchanged. The ""mother"" is invisible at first but the longer it ages the more you can see it. Also the stands become longer and the vinegar will darken. The vinegar used to sit on the shelf longer. Since the standards for ""organic"" have been lowered, does the company buy apples where the growers use antibiotics? No! Has the Bragg's company been sold? No, Patricia Bragg is still the sole owner. The only change that I found was that the vinegar is no longer aged in wood casks. It is a health regulation that stainless steel tanks be used. All the other companies are required to use them as well.2.TEETH EROSION: The reason I didn't consistently take ACV the last 30 years is I was concerned about my teeth. Now I don't have that worry anymore. Vinegar contains malic acid. It is wonderful for health as I will cover in part 3 but not wonderful for your teeth, especially if used on a daily basis. There are several things you can do to help with this. Bragg's suggests 2 tsp to 8 ounces of water. You could of course add more water. Some drink it using a straw. But the best way to neutralize an acid is with a base, such as baking soda. I drink it quickly and then rinse with a baking soda/water solution and then water. You will have to experiment with how much baking soda to use, there are different opinions on the net.3. HEALTH BENEFITS: After over 30 years of research and experimentation I can say that raw vinegar is the easiest, least expensive, and most systemic health remedy and preventative that I have found. I am not alone. Most health books and websites expound the benefits. The malic acid breaks down clogs. Clogged arteries, lymphatic tissues, organ tissue, and stones in the kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and bladder to name a few. It handles acid reflux, skin problems, helps diabetes and much more. It increases energy and fights infections, flus and fungus. Amazingly it handles diarrhea (if it is caused by germs). It breaks down toxins so be sure to drink plenty of good fluids all day.  All plants and animals need a certain ph balance. ACV has an alkaline reaction in the body which is perfect since almost everyone is too acid. It will help every part and system of your body. Do your own research and you will find many other conditions ACV helps.4. HOT BATHS:  Although many people use it on their skin for acne or to put into a poultice, most never try putting raw ACV in hot baths. It is a wonderful and  inexpensive way to get it into your body. I tried starting at a cup but it was too much and I had a strong detox reaction. Start lower and work up to a cup. I use it along with clay and sea salt. The water shouldn't be over 105 degrees. I also put in 1/4 tsp vitamin C which neutralizes the chlorine and chloramines. Be sure to put the clay and water mixture through the blender first or you can clog the drain. Your skin will become soft and have less cellulite. This is because the clay and salt draw out toxins. Hot baths are an aged old remedy and really do heal.If you found this review helpful please click ""yes"" to increase it's ranking so as many people as possible get this helpful information. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGN1QI9NLHK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CHQ1SM#wasThisHelpful","RBGN1QI9NLHK8","A338NGK967YAUA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A338NGK967YAUA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I gave 3 stars because the machine does function. It takes off mold and cleans which is why I purchased it. However for the chemically sensitive person it has one aspect that I didn't count on. Along with the water vapor comes strong plastic vapor, perhaps PVC vapor, from the plastic tubing. It really bothered my lungs.The whole idea was for me to be able to clean in a non-toxic way. Perhaps the smell would go away with time. I didn't wait to find out. I returned it to Amazon.

"This is an excellent starting book for a child or an adult. I wanted to make balloons for my students. The book has excellent step by step instructions with wonderful illustrations. I have not had any problem making any of the sculptures including the bike. There are not any animals but kids do love these and it is a good foundation to move onto other books or YouTube videos.Some reviews said there pump broke. I guess I got lucky. I bought this kit a year ago and have blown up hundreds of balloons with it. In fact, I like it so much, that I contacted Klutz and tried to buy another. The small volume of air in the narrow cylinder makes the pumping easy for kids. They have trouble with regular pumps.The only trouble I had was with the balloons. They don't put powder inside the balloon like most manufacturers. Powder helps the balloon but not the kid who breaths it in. Mine were bad so I contacted the Klutz company about this and received excellent customer service. They cheerfully sent me replacement balloons in a timely manner at no cost to me. Even fresh one pop more than Qualatex balloons. They are also less flexible and have a much shorter life. I use Klutz's only on the shapes with little or no twists like flower centers and the snake's tongue.I learned about Qualatex balloons through YouTube balloon twisting videos. Yes, I have caught the bug and now have a balloon habit! Beware- balloon twisting can be addictive. :)I recommend this kit but also recommend that you buy a bag of Qualatex 260 balloons to go with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PT8LK5UNYRV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591746744#wasThisHelpful","R3PT8LK5UNYRV5","A338NGK967YAUA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A338NGK967YAUA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I highly recommend this small pump. It is 9 inches long and an inch in diameter. It's design is well thought out, unlike other pumps I have tried.I like to make balloon sculptures for my students. Of course, they want to try to make them. Regular pumps are often too hard for them. This one is perfect. Additionally, if you are into balloon twisting, there is a thin balloon called a 160Q. It is hard to blow up by mouth or fit onto most pumps but this one is perfect for the job.It is a double action pump, meaning it pumps in air both ways as you pump up and down so the balloon fills with air faster. That's a good thing because with this small of a pump you have to pump many more times than with a regular pump.*The shipping weight is an error. It says pounds, but it should say ounces. The pump weighs less than 2 ounces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UY9KXSMEVPIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BR0LI2#wasThisHelpful","R3UY9KXSMEVPIM","A338NGK967YAUA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A338NGK967YAUA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This DVD kit is a good deal, however if Will would have added a little more personality and smiled like he enjoyed making balloons and teaching, I would have given it 5 stars.The pump is just OK but the balloons are high quality and you get 48.

My students are eagerly anticipating pirate swords which I will learn next. The giraffes are popular and the girls love hearts the best.I must say that I am having so much FUN that I will continue on after I finish this DVD and buy other DVD's and books.

"I chose these because of their non-toxic glaze. Unfortunately quality is not a big concern of the manufacturer. The way these are packed they are likely to be broken. Since one was not broken I examined it. The quality looked ok, not great. Then I tried on the lid, then the other. Neither lid fit because the pot was a little oval shaped while the lids were round. I returned them.I ended up getting 4 pots, without lids, from a restaurant supply company online. They are sturdy, stack and have a larger capacity. This is also a more economical  way to go if you want a larger quantity.  Also they are white so there is no worry about lead or cadmium in the glaze.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AEILCK3Q03P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UVZ372#wasThisHelpful","R3AEILCK3Q03P3","A338NGK967YAUA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A338NGK967YAUA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I searched the internet for the least toxic and lowest odor ball possible. I was excited to find this ball. However, the excitment was over when the ball arrived; it is neither no-odor nor non-toxic as the company promotes. Its odor does not make me feel as ill as ones made with phthalates, but I still felt a little ill. It has been offgassing for a week now. It is much better but still has a ways to go.Some reviewers mentioned a problem with the color. I had the same problem. I was sent a dark gray ball even though the picture shows a blue ball. When I complained Amazon quickly tried to remedy the situation and sent me another ball. Unfortuanately, it was the same color. I checked on the Natural Fitness site and the grey ball is the color of their 75 cm pro ball. Amazon has the name right, but thier picture is incorrect. So if you don't want a gray ball, don't get this ball. I did notify Amazon and hopefully they will change their picture.You may want to order a size larger than you need. I ordered this ball and have it inflated to 64 cm. At 75 cm it is very hard. I am 5' 5"" and 64 cm is just right to use the ball as a chair (but I need a smaller one for exercise). My chiropractor says my legs should not be parallel to the floor while sitting. My butt should be higher than my knees. I am temporarily using another ball that has already offgassed for a chair and it really helps my back.A reviewer mentioned there were no instructions. Instructions are included- they are just in an unexpected place. They are on the back of the fitness chart.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R370S1GA8E5ORG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZSBW04#wasThisHelpful","R370S1GA8E5ORG","A338NGK967YAUA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A338NGK967YAUA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife bought these and she is going to return them. She wears a size 9 and these were a little big. Perhaps that is so you can wear thick, fluffy socks with them. If they would have padded the sides and sole with fluffy, comfy wool she would have kept them. All the other wool slippers she has tried or bought always had this feature.Pros: High quality materials.  Light flexible sole.  Your heel doesn't come up from the slipper while walking.  Don't smell like solvents like other slippers she tried.  They appear to be very durable.Cons: There is an uncomfortable seam down the center.  There is no soft, fluffy wool on the inside anywhere.  The inside is scratchy.  There is very little insole padding.

Updates incapacitate my laptops for hours on end in an endless cycle of freezing, buffering, restarting, resetting. Literally.When it came time to get a ""new"" computer, I went for an older one that had Windows 7 on it so I wouldn't have to deal with Windows 8.

I bought this refurbished for $100 off of Woot and gave it to them. Well, I kept telling them to use this and it took them a week to warm up to the idea but after that, everyone uses it.We cook pizzas, garlic bread, broiled chicken quarters, etc.  I put raw chicken into this in water and olive oil on 350 and in 75 minutes, comes out perfectly.My mom is on a low sodium, diabetic diet and she is in Stage 4 kidney failure. This is PERFECT for making her personal meals, especially the broiled chicken which I can then make chicken salad with.I just LOVE this. We have used it heavily for a month and it shows no signs of breaking down--a generic toaster oven definitely would be breaking down by now.

"I wouldn't buy this again. Doesn't live up to my expectations after reading the reviews. I like the small size but it isn't powerful enough. Not that I'm shaving through a jungle of bush or anything! It's just cheaply made. Gets the job done but it's just kind of clunky to use.I like the small size. Easy to store and would be easy to travel with. It's just average. When I'm trimming down there, I want to be using the best and this isn't it. I bought other trimmers after this trying to find a better one. This will just sit in my bathroom and collect dust. I will only use this if I am travelling to slip into my luggage.Not powerful enough at all. You will not get a quick, easy once-over trim with this.By the way, the third party prices for this of $80, at the moment, are JACKED UP! I paid $20 or 25 for this when I bought it from Amazon.

"WOW so glad I bought this game on a whim when it was on sale on Xbox Live during Black Friday! The first time I played it, I played a couple hours. The second time, I played for 6 hours and I am NOT one to sit and play games for that long.I usually jump from game-to-game because I get bored easily but the story line and random story lines, quests, missions along the way are compelling. There is plenty to keep you busy. You have multiple quests at a time to work on and even during quests, you will get other quests to do. It can get messy keeping track of the quests but if you use your map and quest log, it gets easier as you go along.The characters are very in depth, you really get to know them and their various stories. You have a nice mix of heroes and good guys but you will also befriend rogues and villains which keeps things interesting. It's like a choose your own adventure book because every decision you make has cause and effect so you are controlling your destiny in the games. It's not just go from point A to point B, go here, go there. It's a really complex game.I love this game. The reason I looked on Amazon reviews was because I got on here to see if it had a sequel or related games. I see this is the first game from this studio. I would totally buy the sequel or the next offering from this studio. It kind of reminds me of old school Zelda on NES.Anyway, yes I recommend this if you're looking for a game with something more to it, some more depth than most video games.

I can say that this is better than the cheap plastic ones banks will give you but other than that, there isn't much good to say about it.This will not stay shut even after putting some wear on it.

The holster totally covers the screen when both pieces are on.I think this is an excellent value. I read over reviews that say it's cheap plastic but, for me, it was much better quality than I expected and I am very happy with it. The case is thin so it doesn't add much more bulk to this already bulky phone.I have an Otterbox for my Kindle Fire and I wish there was an Otterbox case available for the Intuition because they typically offer the best protection for the phones and tablets that I have had.I dropped it today from my pants pocket which was over a 3 foot drop onto hardwood floor and the case wasn't scratched and the phone wasn't damaged. This was with the phone case only-- the holster part was not attached.

"First off, this says 8.5 inches but that's total inches including the handle part. In actuality, the usable length is only about 5 inches and the girth is about like a quarter. It's very small and I was disappointed in the size when I opened it based on curb appeal alone. However, once we tried it out, this became, hands down, my favorite ever!The material is very soft and comfortable--love it. The handle provides a great grip for whatever your purpose is, alone or with a friend. Strong vibrator. Nice battery life. This is almost perfect.

"This isn't something I could ever imagine us using regularly but it's nice to have this big boy in the collection. It's stimulating to look at and the size of it turns me on. I can't imagine many women/men could truly take this comfortably even with lubrication but it's still fun to play with.I am not deducting stars for the size. Anyone who purchases this and then complains about the size is being unfair especially after seeing the multiple reviews about how extremely large it is. The dimensions are there in black and white.I'm giving it just an OK rating because the material is unyielding and hard (no pun intended). It's just not workable. I think if it was made of a softer, higher quality material, then it would be much easier to work with and people would get a much more satisfying experience from it.As it stands (no pun intended), this is more for visual appeal than anything else.

"These work great on my Chihuahuas (3-6lb dogs). For some reason, these are less intimidating to them than fingernail clippers which is what I normally use.Fingernail clippers work fine since their paws are so small but they are difficult to keep a good grip on while you are maneuvering them and making sure you don't clip too far down which causes bleeding. The guard on these works great and they have a nice grip. All in all, using these makes the job much quicker and easier.These are well made and I suspect that they will last for years to come. I recommend them especially for small dogs. You can get cheaper ones, sure, but they won't last as long and the generics I've bought in the past are made for larger dogs. These are just right for my Chihuahuas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1YQJGRUMVOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002RJM8C#wasThisHelpful","RB1YQJGRUMVOX","A3B1360JOYS0GJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B1360JOYS0GJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past, I had the Droid 2 Global and Droid 2 and I loved both of them. This phone is the younger brother of those 2 phones. Amazing keyboard, big screen, apps play wonderfully on it. Besides being very heavy, this would be a 4 or 5 star phone. However...The battery life on the Droid 4 is so terrible that I have to carry around an external battery to keep this phone charged throughout the day. Even right out of the box, the battery functioned like a phone that I had been using a year. I have only had this phone 2 months or less.I have owned the Droid X, Droid X2, Droid 2 and Droid 2 Global...so I am familiar with how terrible smartphone batteries are. The battery on this phone is the worst by far. Are you kidding me, Motorola???I was doubtful purchasing any phone with a battery that cannot be replaced. All my other smartphones, I have purchased as extended battery which increased size and weight but was worth it for better battery life. With my other phones, I didn't have to buy an extended battery until 6 months or a year of heavy use.I'm telling you, within the first week I had to look for something to keep this phone charged which is when I bought a portable battery bank that adds so much bulk that I feel like I'm using one of the Zak Morris cellphones from Saved by the Bell. Not only am I using the portable battery pack but also a task killer to kill apps not currently in use.No, I do not recommend this phone. Trust me, 1 star is totally warranted and if you don't heed my advice and stay away from this phone, you will regret it. I am hearing great things about the Droid Razr Maxxx and their amazing battery life. I would urge you to try that phone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3EPRV4H8ECX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NA9WXG#wasThisHelpful","RN3EPRV4H8ECX","A3B1360JOYS0GJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B1360JOYS0GJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally prefer crunchy peanut butter but this stuff is tops. My favorite PB ever.My mom bought this and since I always swing by and eat all of her food, I was able to try this out. I ate the whole jar in 2 or 3 days and then ordered my own off Amazon (and replaced mom's jar).I have a major sweet tooth and this is perfect. You can definitely taste the honey but it's not so strong that it drowns out the taste of the PB. I have also noticed that this goes on smoother than regular smooth style peanut butter because of the honey mixed in.I have eaten it on bagels as well as bread and it's so good I can eat it with a spoon. I have also found a couple tiny pieces of honeycomb in this which enhanced the flavor (I knew that's what it was because I've eaten fresh honey before and eaten the honeycomb).The jars I received from Amazon were very fresh with an expiration date of 6/14 so I will definitely order this from Amazon again.

"I had never heard of this lady before. I was casually browsing the best selling MP3 albums on Amazon and just happened to listen to some samples of Kacey's songs. I was so curious and impressed that I downloaded the album immediately. I'm so glad that I did. I must say that I'm very impressed and can't wait to hear more from her in years to come. I think she will be winning a lot of awards next year. Along with country music awards, I think this is for sure Grammy calibre.Her songs have excellent, clever lyrics that are unique to her. I'm one of those people who pays attention to the lyrics more than the actual music itself and the lyrics on this album would be impressive for a veteran to write, let alone a rookie who just released her first album.I'm a very liberal person and when it comes to country music, I really feel alienated and unwelcome to the genre in general. I enjoy the country style of music but at the same time, I don't feel wanted as a fan. The genre has come a long way for sure but still I feel there is a lot of sexism, racism, and just a general conservativeness that doesn't leave much room for crowds with more liberal, open minded values.She broaches subjects that are generally off limits in country music and I love that. It really opens up the doors for a broader audience of music fans. It's great that she's a strong woman who doesn't mind leading and being in control. Her music has grittiness to it. This album has a couple love-type songs on it but I don't feel like they're ""Oh, my boyfriend broke up with me, my world is shattered, and how will I ever get through life without my man????""I respect that she is able to do this while still being an obviously country artist. Take Taylor Swift, for example. I like her music but when you hear her on the radio, one would assume it is general pop music instead of straight edge country music. Swift gets played on the local pop radio station many, many times more than I ever hear her on the local country stations based on my listening experience. Musgraves has music that people who aren't traditional country music fans can enjoy while still able to maintain a traditionally country sound.While listening to this album, Musgraves reminded me of Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette, both of whom I grew up listening to and while I enjoyed them, I also felt alienated by their music. For example, liking a style of car but in a color you would never buy.When I saw this album had less than 50 reviews, it made me want to add my 2 cents. I've written many reviews on Amazon but this is the first album review I have ever written. I just wanted to give this new artist some props. I think almost anyone could enjoy this, especially someone who is looking for some country music that you can not only enjoy the sound of but also relate to and feel embraced by. Everyone is welcome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137GXTGY8LHEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPLG8MM#wasThisHelpful","R137GXTGY8LHEP","A3B1360JOYS0GJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B1360JOYS0GJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mother is disabled so I do all of her shopping and carry all of her credit cards, IDs, etc. My old trifold wallet held all of my stuff but couldn't hold mine and hers together. I decided to upgrade so I could carry everything together.Other reviews state that this is too large for daily use. I disagree. It's about 1.5 times bigger and thicker than my old wallet but holds 2 or 3 times the amount of stuff. I love the black color and the fact that it velcros shut. It has a zippered change pocket on the outside where I store a couple spare keys in.The inside has at least 6 slots for credit cards. I put my mom's stuff on one side and mine on the other side to keep it separate. All of the cards fit with room to spare. There is enough space that the cards slide easily in and out. In my old wallet, my cards fit so tightly that they were difficult to get out.This is very well made. One of my requirements was that it had to have a chain because it keeps me from losing my wallet. The only complaint I have about this wallet is that the clasp is cheap and isn't as secure as my old chain. It is so narrow that I can barely snap it onto my wasteband but it still works. I can replace the chain and it doesn't bother me enough to deduct a star for it.I love this and would totally recommend it if you need more room than a standard wallet. I may buy a different color, too, and am going to purchase more from the Pacsafe brand to hold my checkbook, passport, etc. I think this would be great to travel with but I would definitely get a more secure chain if I was going on a long trip or overseas (if the airport security would even allow the chain...).

"This is ultra thin--as in you could snap it in half effortlessly. And, yes, it does snap on perfectly. However, the claims that it's durable and impact resistant are ridiculous. If you dropped your Kindle Fire using only this case, it would not protect it whatsoever--it'd be like having no case on it at all.I wouldn't consider this a case. It's more like a skin. This offers minimum scratch protection. I keep my Fire on my bedstand and it never leaves my room. If I had kids or planned on traveling with it than in no way would I use this case. This will protect it from scratching when moving around on the bedstand or piece of furniture but that's it.I do not recommend this unless you do not plan on travelling or even moving around your house with it.

"I bought this for my mother who is almost blind from diabetes and glaucoma. She likes to help her grandson with his homework which was nearly impossible before she got this light, especially in the evening in lowlight environments. She is so impressed with it.I think this is a perfect gift for anyone on your list who has vision troubles. Once they actually start using it and realize how much it helps them, they will love it. The first one I bought her she keeps by her bedside. I recently bought her another for in the living room and she actually came to me asking me to get her another one so I did. That said a lot to me because she never asks for anything.I give it 5 stars for how much it helps my mother. However, I have a couple issues with the build quality. The light and magnifier part is built well but the base needs to be heavier. It has a cheap feel to it and, depending on how low you adjust the arm, it can tip over which has happened a couple times.My biggest complaint is that the pole is not attached to the base so if you try to pick it up and move it, the base falls from the pole. I think the pole needs to screw into the base. For this reason, it's not easily portable so you may end up having to purchase multiples. If you were to drop it onto a hard surface it could easily damage it.Overall, I highly, highly recommend this. It has genuinely enriched my mother's life and she is able to read, write and do things that she hasn't been able to do for years. It's amazing how this one simple item can help her so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BD1BWC41S1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00198RKF0#wasThisHelpful","R8BD1BWC41S1G","A3B1360JOYS0GJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B1360JOYS0GJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the past, I've used a needle for ingrown hairs or regular tweezers. I thought these tweezers would work better but they don't. These are actually less effective and cause more damage. Because of their thickness, it rips the skin around the hair which can cause scarring more so than a needle and regular tweezers. It's basically like using a thin nail to dig the hair out or at least that's what it felt like using them.

"The three biggest problems:1. Extension handset bases are hardwired to the power adapter/transformers. … You might not be able to fit these where you want them. See attached picture. The old phones used the cord on the left while the new phones, on the right, are hardwired. I.e. You can no longer fish the small end of a cord through a small hole or between an item of furniture and the wall. … You have to squeeze the entire plug through any opening.2. The processor/CPU on these new phones is underpowered. While not unbearable, the wait between some menu operations is significantly longer than previous models. The more I use them, the more annoying I find this shortcoming.3. Only one redial. Previous models allowed you to press redial repeatedly to scroll through the last five outgoing calls. I really miss that feature.The only improvement I appreciate on this model is the dedicated volume control on the side of the phones.I also like that these come with belt clips for true hands-free use with a wired headset.I don't know if there's a better cordless phone out there.

"Jennifer Weiner is one of my go-to authors.  I find her incredibly entertaining, but not fluffy.  She is amusing without being comic and touching without being maudlin.  Mostly, I enjoy her take on modern women's lives.  This particular book has a special bit of notoriety in my reading life:  it is the title that drew me out of the worst reading slump I've ever encountered.On the whole, I enjoyed this book  However, I can't say that I enjoyed all of it. The love story is pretty straightforward, but I never felt that in lacked in complexity.  While I didn't find it to be one of those love stories that just knocked the breath out of me, it was an entertaining one to read  I enjoyed how Andy's character developed.  He's quite different from other characters that Weiner has created and I found his growth both natural and surprising.  I understood his emotions as portrayed in the book and his actions made sense (even if they sometimes made me furious).Rachel was a different story for me.  Frankly, she's a mess.  I don't mean she's an emotional mess (or a slob), but she is messily constructed.  She is initially presented as being defined by her heart condition and I found that interesting.  However, that is dropped completely as she grows older.  I understand that her condition is under control, but it was such a formative influence on her early life and then it was just sort of erased from her character.  I also found the trajectory of her character frustrating.  She starts as a young girl with a heart condition, then she is a teenager looking for love.  Once she goes to college, she becomes a shallow sorority sister who doesn't seem to be at all connected to her childhood.  Then, the next time she appears, she's the complete opposite of what she was as she becomes a social worker working with families in need.  Finally, she becomes, well, a character I know I've read in other books by Jennifer Weiner--the unsatisfied Jewish woman who, in her mind, is just not good enough.  That on its own is fine, except that Weiner has used that trope a bit too frequently in her books.  At the end of it all, I was never able to form any kind of connection with Rachel and I wished that the book had been Andy's story, with Rachel as a supporting character.The book is told from Andy's and Rachel's viewpoints in alternating chapters.  This in itself is fine--and probably necessary for the way Weiner had constructed the book.  But I found it disconcerting  that Andy's chapters were in 3rd person and Rachel's were in 1st person.  I can't say I have a preference of one viewpoint over the other, but constantly switching between the two created what I considered an unnecessary challenge for the reader.Weiner includes a lot of cultural detail in this book.  At first, I loved it--these characters are about my age and, when I was reading their stories in their younger years, I became very nostalgic.  As the story--and time in the story--progressed, however, it began to just be gimmicky to me.  Andy and Rachel found themselves in the midst of several ""generation defining"" events, the two most notable being 9/11 and the athletic doping scandals.  The latter was necessary for the story, but the former seemed a little too, well, Forrest Gump-ish to me.But, as I said, I did enjoy this book--enough that it pulled me out of my slump (and, trust me, that is quite an accomplishment).  Do I think it was Weiner's best work?  No.  (I'd still go to In Her Shoes for that....), but it certainly wasn't her worst. If you are looking for a not-so-fluffy love story and are willing to overlook a few flaws, Who Do You Love might be for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SE4VKTKIF827/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145161781X#wasThisHelpful","R1SE4VKTKIF827","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"hink everyone just needs to agree with this fact: you can never have too much WWII Historical Fiction.  I'm sure that there are readers, somewhere, who reading nothing but WWII Historical Fiction and they are never lacking for material.  Even if you aren't one of those readers, this is definitely a book to consider.This is a fast paced book--although one could probably guess that just from the title.  The plot is constantly moving as the action moves through Europe.  Yet, among all this, Clayton is still able to successfully develop the three main characters.  The story is told in first person, from Jane's point of view, which I found interesting choice given the circumstance.  While she tells the story, she more of an observer than an active participant.  Liv is clearly the center of this book.  She is the one who wants to make it to Paris and she is the one who has the most to prove by doing so.  Jane and Fletcher tend to orbit Jane.  I really enjoyed how Clayton explored the relationship between Liv, Fletcher, and Jane.  It's a difficult dynamic and she doesn't shy away from it.I loved all the historical detail in this book and it is rare that I feel that I learned anything new when reading historical fiction (I read quite a bit of it and I have a degree in History, so I go into these books with my feet already wet).  I had yet to read an account of this period of World War II from a journalistic point of view, so that was a nice change for me.I do feel that I have to put this out there, though. This book is what I would consider ""heavy"" on the history--there are a lot of details and, even though Clayton expertly weaves them into the narrative, some readers might find this book to be bogged down by them all.  I would not necessarily call this a strike against the book, but I would take it into consideration when recommending it to someone.  I think you really need to be into the history to truly enjoy this book.I had one gripe about this book--it wasn't especially major, but it was big enough that it did impact my enjoyment of the overall book.  As I said, the book is told in first person from Jane's point of view.  I have no problems with the first person point of view, but there are some pitfalls with it--and Clayton falls into one.  There are passages scattered throughout the book where Jane relates scenes she is not a part of and is able to tell what is going on inside someone else's head.  There are boundaries with any point of view, and probably more with the first person than any other, and Clayton sometimes steps over those boundaries.This was an exciting and action-packed, yet not flawless, read.  I enjoyed my experience reading it and  I would recommend it to other fans of serious Historical Fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWPC9Y0U9YNNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062354639#wasThisHelpful","RWPC9Y0U9YNNC","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really don't know if there is a book out there that is more suited to my tastes than this one. I love food and cooking (well, I don't always love cooking--but I love the idea of cooking), I love short story collections (this is a short story collection in novel form, if that makes any sense), and I love the Midwest.  So, you know, sign me up.This book lived up to all of my expectations and then some.  The mechanics of this book are unique, which is something I don't come across too often.  As I said, it is a short story collection in novel form.  By that, I mean that each chapter is a distinct chapter, but they are all tied together through the character of Eva Thorvald.  So, is Eva the main character?  Well, yes and no.  She is definitely the axis around which this book turns, but she appears less and less in the book as it progresses.  In turn, other characters take center stage as their lives are touched in surprising ways by Eva.  Honestly, if someone told me this was how it went, I never would have thought it would work  But it does--marvelously.At its heart, this is a story of parents and children, specifically mothers and daughters--but you don't see that until you've read the last word.  Stradal is not overbearing with his theme and lets it develop organically over all the stories he includes.  I appreciated that I wasn't hit over the head with THIS IS WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT and that Stradal let me discover it on my own.And the food!  Yes, there are recipes and I have a mostly love, but a little hate relationship with recipes in novels.  I appreciate them but, unless they are collected at the end of the book, I find that they sometimes break up the flow of the narrative.  Stradal not only doesn't save the recipes for the end, he puts them right smack dab in the middle of the narrative.  Again, this should irritate the heck out of me, but he does it in a way that actually works.  This is partly because there aren't that many recipes and also because, when he does include them, it is part of the action of the plot.  Oh, and you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be making Pat Prager's Peanut Butter Bars in the very near future!Let me close with this, several people that I know will most likely receive copies of this book for Christmas.

"When I said that I was reading this book, a number of people told me how much they loved Pam Jenoff's books.  I was a little ashamed to admit that this is the first of her novels that I've read.  But, I can say now, that it definitely won't be the last.This book had a lot going for it with me from the get go.  I love immigrant stories and World War II historical fiction.  Addie is a strong female character who is working to make it on her own but is enamored by the big Irish family next door (at least during the summer).  Jenoff delivers on all these points and then some.I really enjoyed Jenoff's voice.  The story is told from Addie's point of view and she sounds like, well, like a young woman in the early 40's--not like an author from the early 21st century.  I also really appreciated that Addie faced not only the obvious challenges like, oh, World War II but also some more subtle ones, such as gender equality in relationships.This book is all over the place, but I mean that in a good way.  Addie travels from Italy to the United States and then to England and back, but the action of the only spans 4 years.  I found it fascinating how much Addie's world changed in such a short time, but I did question how easily she was able to travel across the Atlantic at pretty much the spur of the moment during wartime.It shouldn't be a surprise that Addie is the most developed character, but Jenoff keeps the supporting cast from becoming to static.  Each of the Connally brothers has a distinct personality, which helps to keep them straight at times.  I also liked how Jenoff drew Addie's Aunt Bess.  The impression the reader has of her is clearer (and fairer) than the one that Addie gives us.This was a perfect read at the perfect time for me.  It was an intriguing read that kept my attention with a fast plot and tight writing, but it wasn't so heavy that it became a chore.  I would definitely recommend this book and I know I'll be reading more by Pam Jenoff in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2TA01FLM90K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317544#wasThisHelpful","R2E2TA01FLM90K","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no secret that I, like so many others, loved Christina Baker Kline's Orphan Train, which was her most recent novel.  Sweet Water was her first novel, and it shows how much she's grown as a writer.That's a polite way of saying this book is downright painful.First off, a warning...I will probably tiptoe into spoiler territory.  I try to avoid that when I write reviews, but I'm kind of in the ""why bother"" mode in this one.  So, if you still want to read this book at this point, you may want to tune out now.I will say that Kline's writing talent is evident here.  Her prose is readable and mature, but not heavy-handed.  The problem with this book is not in the writing, it is in the construction.  The plot is barely there and ill-defined.  Is it about Cassie trying to ""find what she's looking for"" with her mother's family?  Is it about Cassie's Grandmother's secret? Is it about Cassie's quest to find out what happened to her mother?  The answer to all those is this: um, kinda, sorta?  I don't think Kline ever had a clear idea of what this book was about and the reader certainly doesn't as they make their way through the story.Then there are the stereotypes of southerners.  Let's see...we have the catty frenemies, the holier than thou preacher's wife, the wild child (there are a couple of those), the old drunk, and the town gossip.  All of these characters have shown up in any number of superficial Southern novels, movies, or TV shows.  And, if that wasn't enough, there is probably one of the most offensive (and, really, inaccurate) Southern stereotypes out there.  I'll give you a second....yep.  We have a fair dose of explicit cousin on cousin action.  Now, Kline does try to diffuse the situation by stating that they aren't ""real cousins"" because one of them is adopted.  But, then she includes a few post-coital observations about how much the two look alike--very pointed observations (which are both yucky and annoying because she never closes that loop...).Yes, I know...you need a shower now.As I said, the one positive aspect was Kline's language.  It was the one thing--well, that and the fact that I knew what she could do in Orphan Train that kept me going.  However, I'm not going to let this book turn me off Kline's writing.  As I said, this was her first novel and, when you compare it to her latest, you can see how much she has grown.  If anything, it makes me more likely to read her next book.  But, save yourself from the experience of this book and just take my word on it, okay?","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36O3SQZFC2M6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003P2W1JI#wasThisHelpful","R36O3SQZFC2M6C","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was one of those books that was....exactly what you would think it would be.  That isn't a bad thing...it just is what it is.  I think the first issue that I should address is the similarity between this book and A.J. Jacob's The Year of Living Biblically.  Yes, they are similar--and Evans even mentions that in one point.  However, I really feel that Evans has the upper hand in this face off.  For one thing, this book has a better focus than A.J. Jacobs' work.  While Jacobs seems to come from the viewpoint of, ""Hey, let's try to be religious,"" Evans goes into her project to explore an issue--Biblical Womanhood--that she encounters in her own life.I will admit I had a little trouble categorizing this book in my mind.  On one hand, there is a definitely ""Christian Living"" element to that.  However, while Evans does talk about her own faith, the book itself is more of a cross between a memoir and historical research.  This isn't a book I would say is JUST for Christians.  It doesn't come across as preachy at all and non-Christian readers, provided they are tolerant of others' beliefs, would probably enjoy it as well,  In fact, if there was a group who would be more likely to be offended by this book, it would be Conservative Evangelical Christians.I really enjoyed Evans's writing.  It was casual and conversational, but not at all glib.  She is very respectful of beliefs that don't match her own--and my favorite parts were when she referred to Orthodox Judaism and her virtual friend who was serving as her expert. She also includes some of her husband's diary entries, which adds a nice dimension to her narrative.She did visit some communities and people who were on the more extreme ends of the spectrum--the Amish, a polygamist, a quiverfull follower.  I will say that, while these episodes were interesting, they didn't stick with me as much as other parts of the books.  Mostly, I remember reading Evans' mishaps as she tried to adopt some extreme behaviors.All in all, it was a readable, if not exactly surprising, book.  I would recommend it to most anyone, and would definitely recommend it over other similar books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8KI5LJWD1LNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078FA8TS#wasThisHelpful","R8KI5LJWD1LNK","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here we have a book featuring a baker and, honestly, I felt like it was baked in a microwave.  Some parts were perfect, some parts were overdone and tough, and some parts were raw and undeveloped.  I'm left feeling deflated because, what I liked about this book, I really, really liked.Ramona is a fantastic character.  She has a history--she was an unwed teen mother who recently broke with her family and started her own business.  She's guarded, as one might expect, but still yearning for companionship.  I appreciated that she was human, not perfect.  While I rooted for her without, I could still she that she had her own flaws.O'Neal presents four major plots here (and four, for a book like this, is just too many).  Ramona is struggling in her business and wondering what her next steps are.  Her very pregnant daughter's husband was critically wounded and must go to him, which understandably causes Ramona worry and stress.  Ramona is also needed to become the guardian to her tween step-granddaughter.  And, to top all this off, there is a romantic element when ""a man from her past"" comes back on the scene.I know that it is the romance that is the selling point of this book, but I felt that this was the least necessary (and least interesting) aspect of the book.  Honestly, O'Neal could have lifted that entire plot and its character out of the book and still have enough for a good novel.  Or, if this book really was meant to be a ""romance,"" one or two of the other plots should have been left out.I did think that O'Neal's writing was tight and readable, but I did have one complaint.  I'm not a prude, but detailed sex scenes (or, as my mother calls them, ""biology lessons"") are rather annoying, especially if they don't fit in with the fabric of the book.  The more intimate scenes just didn't fit with the narrative style of the rest of the book (but, as I said before, that whole plot didn't really fit).  At times, I felt almost as if she had outsourced those pages while she wrote the rest of the book.Another thing that bugged me...there is a supernatural element in this book.  I have nothing against supernatural elements, but I feel that they have to be handled with care.  I wouldn't say that O'Neal isn't committed to this element--she follows it throughout the book--but I really felt that she should have handled it differently.  How, exactly, I'm not sure.  Perhaps she should have made it a larger part of the whole story...I don't know.  What I do know is that it just didn't quite jive here.I don't want to give the impression that I hated this book.  As I said, I really enjoyed the main character.  The plot(s) also kept me going until the end, even if they sometimes left me scratching my head.  This is a lighter read and problems in books like that are easier to forgive.  In the end, it was still an entertaining read and is great when you just need something lighter to read when you have a few minutes here and there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IXQH54R4KM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553386778#wasThisHelpful","R1IXQH54R4KM5","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As anyone who has had any contact with me while I was reading this, they already know that I did not enjoy this book.  In fact, I've said--and I stand by he sentiment--that if I, myself, had not been the one to recommend this to my book club, I would have DNF'd it.I know, what a way to start out a review...but stick with me hereThere were two things that really bothered me about this book.  First of all, I'm just tired of books about the intelligentsia of New York.  I don't mean the actors, writers, etc of New York, but the rich folk whose talent seems to be more due to their birth and trust funds than any skills they develop.  Secondly, the sort of turning point plot line hit a bit too close to home for me as it was very reminiscent of some things going on with people close to me,But, you see, while those are valid reasons for me not to like this book, I will admit that they are very subjective reasons.  Because of that, I can't base on whether or not I would recommend this book on how I felt about it.  So, let me try to take my feelings out of this and look at the mechanics of the book.There were things that I did like this book, and things that I found problematic.  I enjoyed Woltizer's writing--it kept me engaged, which is saying a lot since I didn't actually like the book.  She does an impressive job of placing the narrative in time.  This story spans from the early 70's to the current day and the reader always feels like they are in the same time as the characters.  One of  my favorite scenes was near the end (not a spoiler!) where the two elderly owners of the camp are reminiscing about the camp's glory days--I was immediately transported to the scene in Dirty Dancing where Max Kellerman and Tito Suarez are talking about how things are not like they used to be in the Catskills (and it is always a good thing when a book evokes Dirty Dancing!).I felt the characters well-rounded, but I can't say that I liked any of them.  In fact, the only character I did like was the tertiary Rory, who is fun and wild and doesn't fit at all with the her family and the other characters in the book.  Then there is the issue of Jonah.  There is nothing wrong with the character of Jonah--except the fact that he is completely superfluous to this book.  He could be completely lifted out of the narrative and it would have no impact on the story whatsoever.  In fact, there were times when I completely forgot about him--only to have him turn up and have 100 pages devoted to him.Ultimately, if I take my own personal feelings out of this book, I will admit that there were some great things about it and some things that just did not work.  Would I recommend it?  Well, I probably wouldn't offer up this title as a recommendation, but if someone asked if they should read it, I'd tell them to go ahead.  They might like it.

"Some books are just more ""bookish"" than others.  I know that sounds crazy--how can books be more or less bookish?--but it is true.  This is a book for people who love books, and who understand the power of literature.A.J. Fikry is a prickly fellow when we first meet him, still reeling from the death of his wife several years earlier, and determined to drink himself to death.  Then, things change and, due to circumstance, he begins to let a few more people into his life.  I liked that A.J. was rather prickly when we first met him and, even though his life circumstances change dramatically, he still maintains a bit of that prickliness.  Too often, characters make an unrealistic transformations where they go from angry, bitter, what have you to bundles of joy and rainbows.  A.J. is not like that....he is who he is.I loved the fictional island of Alice.  Zevin created a quaint town and brought it to life without going all Lake Wobegon on it (Lake Wobegon is great, but a town as ""full"" of that would not have worked there). There were a few ""townsfolk"" who were brought into the main narrative, which was just enough for a novel of this scope.I was immediately sucked into the narrative in a way where I was happy to just go along with what has happening,so I didn't think too much about what was coming next in the plot.  Because of that, I personally didn't find the plot predictable, but I can't speak for others.There were a couple minor things that bugged me.  Some of the time jumps were just a bit too long for my tastes.  I would have preferred more time jumps of less time that less time jumps of greater time.  There was also a character, who was set up to be a major player, that was cut out of the plot rather abruptly and, in my opinion, in a clumsy manner.Still, these complaints are minor and they don't change the fact that this is one of the most enjoyable books I've read all year.  I would recommend it to any reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZR6LDWVLXNBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616204516#wasThisHelpful","R1ZR6LDWVLXNBZ","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those cases where, even though I have some real concrete complaints about this book--and complaints that would lead me to DNF another book--I just could not stop reading this and, as much as I hate to admit this, I enjoyed the experience, even if I can't say that I enjoyed the book.I had heard quite a bit about this book in the months since it had been published, but much of what I heard was mixed, so the bar was--well, there was no bar for my expectations going into the reading.  This is not a Cozy Mystery, but it definitely has some of the hallmarks of that sub-genre:  The somewhat of a buttinsky main character who becomes an amateur detective, a close-knit society (in this case, the LDS ward), and the relatively clean storytelling.  However, it is much darker than a cozy mystery and lacks any of the (intentional) quirkiness that one would find in those books.  The fact that this book was somewhere between a Cozy Mystery and a Thriller might have been what sucked me in.I am not a Mormon, although I grew up in an area with a large LDS population, so I know maybe just a tad more than the basics about the religion, but I can't say I have any first-hand experience.  I did notice from other reviews that people are split as to whether this book is an accurate description of the Mormons or not.  I don't know, but I will say that the details were at least interesting, but my views of the LDS remain unchanged.I can't say that I found the characters to be especially dynamic--Linda, as the main character, was the most developed, but I didn't really feel that she grew as a person as the book progressed.  The other characters all seemed pretty one-dimensional, which I can mostly overlook.  I did wish that she had given Linda's husband, Kurt, more personality.  I also felt that she left a couple character points unfinished--specifically with two of her sons.  It felt like she was going to explore something with them, but it never happened.There are actually two mysteries in this book that are related thematically, although they are separate in the plot.  Strangely, it works here and Harrison handles juggling these two plots well.  Harrison's writing style isn't particularly memorable, but I didn't feel like I was tripping over her prose. I did wish, however, that she infused more emotion into her words.Plot-wise, this book moved at a good clip.  There were plenty of twists and turns so that I stayed interested, but things did get melodramatic at the end, which was a letdown for me.  But, my biggest problem with this book was something else: victim shaming.There was a character in this book who does a fair amount of victim shaming--I'm not saying that victim shaming is ever acceptable, but it was done as part of his character so it isn't anything I can hold against Harrison or this book.  Yet, as the story progressed--probably the last 3rd of the book or so--I would say that Harrison herself does a fair amount of victim shaming with the choices she makes about a character and their actions.  It didn't really fit with what was going on and, frankly, had it come up earlier in the book, it may have led me to DNF the whole thing.Frankly, I'm not really sure what to say about this book.  It has problems--some I can overlook and some I can't.  The experience of reading this book was an enjoyable one, even if I can't say that I enjoyed the book once I was finished with it.  I may still recommend it, though, depending on the reader and what they are looking for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDKA9NR5APHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954760#wasThisHelpful","R2LDKA9NR5APHL","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Humorous Memoir genre is my favorite when it comes to audio books and I have almost universal good luck with them.  So, I went into No Land's Man expecting to really enjoy it.  After all, it promised to be funny and I've always enjoyed Aasif Mandvi on The Daily Show (for the record, Mandvi was my vote to replace Jon Stewart).What I didn't expect is how profound this book could be.  Yes, there are some purely fun moments and it dips now and then into potty humor (which I am not against!), but there are also essays on identity and belonging and family that are far more deeply written than anything I have ever read in other (more highly-hyped) books in this vein.This book is not just a collection of funny stories--it is Mandvi's quest to define himself. He doesn't fit into any of the niches we have - he was born in India, but isn't ""Indian"" as we know it; he was raised in England, but doesn't look English; he was raised Muslim, but doesn't act like any Muslim most Americans would recognize.  He battles the expectations put on him by his family and by society and, in the midst of this, blazes his own trail.This memoir differs from other such memoirs (for example, Yes, Please and Bossypants) because very little of it deals with his life once he ""makes it."" He doesn't talk about The Daily Show until the last chapter of the book.  There are a few chapters talking about his days before making it big, but most of the book is about his experiences growing up as an East Asian immigrant, first in the north of England and then in Tampa, Florida.I will say this is probably the best written book in this genre that I've read.  His essay dealing with profanity is one of the best I've read on the subject (strangely, I have read more than a few essays on profanity).  There is also an essay in the middle of the book--because I listened to this book, I can't go back and find the title--that is just beautiful.  It talks about his parents coming to Bradford and settling--both with each other and in this new land.  If I had any complaints about this book, it would only be that that this particular essay would have been more effective as a closing essay than buried in the middle of the book.I really can't recommend this book highly enough.  I could barely stop listening to it (which meant that I was hitting the gym whenever possible--that alone is pretty impressing) and it made me both laugh and think.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6P9JNZGXCB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452107912#wasThisHelpful","R1S6P9JNZGXCB2","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I heard that Laura Andersen was coming out with a new trilogy, I jumped at it.  I loved her Boleyn Trilogy (The Boleyn King, The Boleyn Deceit, and The Boleyn Reckoning) and couldn't wait to see what she had in store next.  The answer: more of the same.Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing--after all, I truly enjoyed her first trilogy.  However, this book is like the 4th book in a trilogy.  The 3 books of the Boleyn Trilogy read like a trilogy--they worked together as a whole and came to a satisfying ending.  Now, we have a continuation of the story with Dominic and Minuette's children and Elizabeth's daughter (in Andersen's alternate universe, Elizabeth was married to Philip of Spain).  Is this a problem?  Not really, except that you really need to read the original trilogy before starting this book.  Seriously.  I can't see how anyone who had not read the first 3 books would have any clue what is going on here.On a petty side note, I feel like I have to mention the cover art.  The first three books had very nicely designed covers and I wish the designers had carried that through to this book.  Frankly, I find the cover of this book a bit tawdry.Okay, back to the bones.  So, this book is called The Virgin's Daughter but, it isn't about Elizabeth's daughter.  Princess Anne Isabel (called Anabel), who is the daughter of Elizabeth and Philip of Spain, is a character in the book, but she is secondary at best. Instead, this book is about the oldest daughter of Dominic and Minuette, Lucette, who was born in the last book of the previous trilogy.Lucette was a fun, if not realistic, character.  Elizabeth basically uses her as a spy, which would never have happened in the ""real"" Elizabethan England, but in this one--sure, why not?  Lucette is, of course, smart and beautiful--but not too smart, and I think that is what I liked most about her.  She made mistakes and she misread things.  Basically, she wasn't perfect.  She is sent to visit (er, spy) the home of her family's friend, Renaud LeClerc (a character in the first trilogy) to sniff out a possible conspiracy to assassinate Queen Elizabeth.  There she meets up with the two LeClerc brothers, who themselves are estranged.There are a cast of supporting characters, both historical and fictional.  In this book, Andersen uses more fictional than historical characters, which is change from her first trilogy.  Among the ""real"" people, we have Elizabeth I, Philip of Spain, Sir Francis Walsingham, Dr. John Dee, and Mary, Queen of Scots.  The rest of the characters are of Andersen's creation, which makes this one more step removed from fact.  I say this only because some people (okay, I am one of them) are sort of sticklers for historical accuracy, so they need to keep in the forefront of their mind that this is ""alternate"" history.I hope that the next two books more deeply explore the younger set in these books.  This is Lucette's book, but will the next be Anabel's or Pippa's (Lucette's younger sister, who I found very interesting)? We can only wait and see, but Andersen has set up some interesting possibilities for the coming books.I found the plot of this book to be fast moving and fun, but Andersen's writing didn't seem quite as tight as it did in her first trilogy.  I'm willing to forgive that because I do think she has an interesting story here.  While I'm still trying to figure out if I'm reading a new trilogy or an installment of a series, I would recommend Andersen's books.  I would strongly, strongly urge any reader to start with The Boleyn King and go from there but, if you've already read her Boleyn ""trilogy"" and enjoyed it, this would be a ""must read"" for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21PS2TUDCIK52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179360#wasThisHelpful","R21PS2TUDCIK52","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my, where to start.  Anyone can tell from reading the summary of this book that it is going to be heart-wrenching.  I am lucky in that I can't personally relate to Cistaro's story, yet I was still deeply affected by this book.  I can only imagine how someone who can relate to Cistaro's story would experience this.I enjoyed Cistaro's writing quite a bit and she wasn't afraid to go all in.  I suspect it can be hard to articulate the feelings that Cistaro had to go through in her life and I applaud her for that.  In fact, this book reminds me of another well-known memoir of a woman coming to terms with her mother's death and I think readers of that novel (you know what book I'm talking about!) may be interested in this book.I will admit, though, that I did have some problems with the pacing of this book  I felt that Cistaro did a fabulous job of digging deep and explaining her feelings, but I also felt that most of this book was stuck in neutral.  I never felt that Cistaro was getting closer to making peace with her feelings about her mother until, well, she had made peace. I wish that there had been more of a forward-motion in the narrative throughout the book.Would I recommend this book to others?  Yes, although not universally.  I don't think this is a book for just anyone and a reader needs to be in a certain ""head space"" for it.  But, for some, this is an excellent memoir.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S213J20NXJ5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492615382#wasThisHelpful","R2S213J20NXJ5O","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Folks, I'm scratching my head over this one.  There are definitely some wonderful things about this book, and I enjoyed the experience of reading it, but there were issues that I just can't overlook.I'll start with the positive.  This is my second book by Pamela Schoenewaldt (Swimming in the Moon was the first) and, once again, I was drawn in by the language in this book.  It is not overly verbose, but the prose is still lovely and completely readable.I was immediately attracted to Hazel as a character.  She is a young woman very much at a crossroads in her life.  As is typical among young people of that age, she is restless and then she discovers a family secret that leads her to question her life as she knows it.  I liked that while Hazel was a proactive character, Shoenewaldt still gave her time to process these things that go on in her life.The real draw for me with this book is how well Schoenewaldt draws America during World War I.  I've read a fair amount of WWI fiction, but I think it was all from a European viewpoint.  The United States had a unique experience with the war--while we didn't join in until late in the game, the war was fought by citizens on the streets of America.  Schoenewaldt captures this expertly and, for that alone, I would recommend this book.But, as I said, there were things that just didn't work.  My biggest problem is that it seemed like Schoenewaldt took 3 passes at this before settling on a plot, but the first 2 possible plots are still included, but never finished.  The first of these is Hazel's family secret, which is introduced, ignored for a bit, and then brought up briefly before being dropped for the rest of the book.  The second story line involves some magic realism.  It is not that I don't like magic realism--I actually quite like it when done well--but I do believe that it is something that an author needs to commit to and carry through the entire work.  Schoenewaldt does not do this.  It happens in only one part of the book and then is dropped again.  Throughout the rest of this book, I kept hoping I'd see a return, or at least an explanation, of the magic realism, but it never happened.  Because of this, I felt like I was reading 3 distinct stories (or 2 beginnings of stories and one complete story) instead of one cohesive novel.I really think that a but more editing and the removal of ""story stumps"" would have greatly improved this novel.  But, I cannot discount the beautiful language and Schoenewaldt's description of WWI-era America.  Even with its flaws, I would still recommend this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONNPCUY6TO2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062326635#wasThisHelpful","RONNPCUY6TO2U","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, I'm probably the last person around to read this.  However, this time at least, there is a good reason for it.  It was the selection for my book club this month and I try to read the selections within a month of the meeting.  So, I've owned a copy of this book for months but had to wait (well, made myself wait) until just recently to read it.The big question is: does it live up to the hype?  Yes, yes it does.  I was actually a little wary of this book going in.  From what I had heard about it, I was afraid it would be a Castaway scenario where it would be one character talking to himself (or to an inanimate object).  Thankfully, that is not the case.  Yes, the bulk of the book is Mark Watney trying to survive on Mars, but there are also scenes with NASA and with Watney's crew as they travel away from him.  And Mark never talks to a soccer ball, or personifies any other non-living thing, so that is a plus.There is a a staggering amount of science in this book, but don't let that scare you off.  I do not have a scientific mind at all and I was able to get through it.  I will say I did better when Mark was going through the science than when the people from NASA or the Hermes crew were relaying it.  Weir created a great voice with Mark, which is necessary since the bulk of the book is in his voice. He has a great sense of humor and even the driest science monologue was entertaining when it was coming from him.  However, I am kind of amazed at how much chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering he knows as a botanist (yes, I know everyone had multiple roles but...wow....)The movie version will be out later this year and I am in now way making a dig at the book when I say I think it will make a great movie.  It does have a very linear plot which translates well to film but doesn't always work on the page.  Here, however, is an exception.  The fact that Weir has directed everything in this book to one point is truly effective and I think that, if he had deviated at all from that, the whole narrative may have fallen apart.I read this book in one day, which I am rarely able to do these days.  Once I picked it up, I just couldn't put it down and I'm pretty sure that most people would have the same experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FGHVZB1XBZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418025#wasThisHelpful","R1FGHVZB1XBZP","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are books you read because they widen your horizons or make you think of things in a new light. Then, there are books you read because you want something dependable--you know how things are going to turn out and that's just a-okay.  It's Not Me, It's You definitely falls into the latter group.The basis of this book is not unusual: Young woman's life is turned upside down (by a cheatin' boyfriend, of course) and heads off to the big city where her world is opened up and she realizes her own strength.  Obviously, this formula works as it is a common trope in Contemporary Fiction.Because of that, I can't fault this book for being predictable.  I think I would have been disappointed if the book did not follow the expected path.  There is something comfortable about reading a book where you know what is going to happen--I don't want that for every book that I read, but it is nice from time to time.I say all this because a predictable plot is not my issue with this book.Frankly, this book was a good 100-150 pages too long and with 1 or 2 too many plots.  We have 3 major arcs here--Delia and her cheating boyfriend, Delia and her amoral boss and the journalist who wants to bring him down, and Delia and her internet Troll who becomes her friend.  Any one of these plots on their own could have been a book, but McFarlane tries to weave all three into one narrative.The problem is that she doesn't really do so in a way that three plots work together.  Instead, it seems like she deals with plot A for a few chapters and then drops it for plot B, drops plot B for a nod towards plot C, and then back to plot B until it is time to go to plot A. Because of this, I found it hard to get tied into any of the arcs she has going.I also felt that she dragged things on too long.  There was a point in this book, and 3/4 of the way through, where McFarlane should have ended it.  Yes, there was some character resolution in the last 1/4 of the book, but that could have been addressed earlier.  By the time that I got to that last part of the book, I just didn't care any more.I also felt that one of the plots mentioned above (no spoiler...) should either have been elevated or eliminated.  At the start of the book, it was by far the most interesting plot, but McFarlane never develops it from its initial burst and it left me feeling confused as to why, if she wasn't going to follow it through, why she would bother to include it.I was hoping for a fun, frivolous read with this book, but instead, I was left scratching my head and wishing the author had done a few more rounds of editing and re-writing before publishing this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30DVXZ23M4HL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0008116210#wasThisHelpful","R30DVXZ23M4HL7","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's start with the good--and there is a lot of good here.  I guess the proper review format would be to save my ""bottom line"" for the end of this, but I'm going to be a rebel and start with it.  I really enjoyed this book and it was exactly what I needed when I read it.Friedland's writing style is exceptionally good for this type of book in that there seems to be a fair amount depth to her writing and she fleshes out the main character of Evie quite nicely.The secondary characters are more one-dimensional, but since the novel is so focused on Evie, it isn't really an issue.The premise of this book is both unique and timely.  If you are reading this review, you are plugged in.  Evie goes completely off the grid.  Like, she won't even look at a computer screen (at least not when it is turned on).  I know I couldn't do it and I doubt many others could either.  I kept thinking there was no way she would be able to function in life without the internet, but she makes it and it is pretty awe-inspiring.  Honestly, I would recommend this book on the premise alone.Now, the critical part.  Before I go on, let me reiterate that I did enjoy this book.  It is on the lighter side, and I knew that going into it, so even though I have these criticisms, they were not big issues for me.First off, I knew exactly what was going to happen in this book.  There was nothing that caught me by surprise and I knew pretty much from the start how the book would end.  However, this book could fall under the ""chick lit"" umbrella and such books usually follow the same formula, so the fact that this book was not surprising is not surprising.I also wish Friedland had spent more time on what Evie went through the first few days and weeks of going off-line.  Did she go through the typical withdrawal symptoms?  Did she eat all the chocolate in the world?  I don't know, because Friedland never really went into that.  It seemed like giving up the internet was just as easy as deciding to do so and I really, really, really doubt that.My final little criticism is that the epilogue of this book just doesn't fit with the rest of the book.  You could just skip it and not miss anything but, if you choose to read it, you might be scratching your head, trying to figure out how it relates to anything. Epilogue should tie up loose strings, this one just tangles up a whole other ball of yarn.Still, this was an enjoyable read for me and one I'd recommend to anyone looking for a beach read where they don't get WiFi.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZ5KHDRGX0M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062379844#wasThisHelpful","RNZ5KHDRGX0M2","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Short story collections are things that I love, but somewhat hard for me to review.  Obviously, reviewing something with several distinct stories can be tricky but the bigger problem for me is that I usually read short story collections over a long period of time.  For example, it took me 53 days to read this 263-page book.The fact that it took me so long to read this book is not a commentary on the quality.  I just like to go slowly through short story collections, reading no more than one story a day.  I like to have a little ""space"" between each story so that I can enjoy each one on their individual merits.  Unfortunately, the fact that it takes so long for me to read books like this means it can be harder for me to keep the earlier stories fresh in my mind.So, I'm going to address this book with an overall eye.  For this book, this works well because Henry's style is fairly uniform throughout the book.  This isn't to say that this book is monotone.  In fact, it is quite the opposite.  Henry does an admirable job of including stories of women from all walks and stages in life. You can, however, tell that every story was written by the same author, which isn't a bad thing at all.  I actually loved Henry's voice and it even sounded Southern in my head as I read it.Henry is an expert at creating the world of the Lowcountry here.  I've never been there (the closest I've been was when I went to college in the Tidewater region of Virginia) but I could clearly see it in my mind's eye and, yes, I would really love to visit now.  The fact that she was able to pull this off is what really holds this collection together.This is a very readable collection and I would recommend it to readers new to short story collections, as well as to fans of Southern fiction from a female viewpoint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CHG4AMCA5FZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991358007#wasThisHelpful","R1CHG4AMCA5FZ7","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is an embarrassing confession on my part.  When I was a kid, probably 8 or 9, and first heard of the Underground Railroad, I thought it was just that--a railroad that ran underground.  Slaves would sneak down underground and catch the train.  Just typing that sounds ridiculous and--yes!--I know better now (I knew better about 30 seconds after I first articulated this belief as a child), but every time I think of the Underground Railroad, I think of that.Now, that really has nothing to do with my reading this book, except that I feel, because I started off in such a strange place with the Underground Railroad, that I should read more about it.  I can't say I've come across too many works of fiction about it, so I thought I shouldn't pass this one up.There are two stories going on here--a modern plot with Eden, who is battling infertility and questioning the future of her marriage, and Sarah, the daughter of John Brown who paints maps for the Underground Railroad.  I'll be honest, these two stories, which are interesting on their own, didn't seem to fit together for me until the end of the book.  I can't fault McCoy for this because it does ultimately all tie together, but I kind of feel that I should include this when I recommend the book.Also, this book was a lighter than I expected. It may just be that I tend toward heavier historical fiction, but it took me a little while to get into the groove with this book.  However, for someone looking for a light historical novel, this would be right up their alley.I enjoyed the two main characters.  Eden wasn't always likable, but her anguish was understandable and realistic.  And I dare anyone who reads this book not to fall in love with Cleo, the neighbor girl who comes on the scene to help with Eden's dog, but is a life rope for Eden.  Sarah's story was more interesting to me, but only because Eden is a historical figure working in a period that interests me.  McCoy surrounded both women with a colorful cast of supporting characters.  As I said, there is Cleo in Eden's story, but also Alice in Sarah's.This book kept me interested from beginning to end and I think it is a great novel for someone who is especially interested in the Underground Railroad.  It is also an excellent choice for people who are new to historical fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LOEYRZ0R3ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348908#wasThisHelpful","R22LOEYRZ0R3ZT","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was supposed to read this book about a year ago--it was one of the selections in my book club, but I wasn't going to be able to attend that meeting so I ended up not reading this book.  Then, I needed something to read on my phone during National Library week (or whatever) and this book had come up as being the most challenged book in libraries.  Well, I love a good controversy, so I finally got around to reading this.And, here is my question...what is supposed to be so controversial about this book.  According to the ALA, it is:Reasons: anti-family, cultural insensitivity, drugs/alcohol/smoking, gambling, offensive language, sex education, sexually explicit, unsuited for age group, violence. Additional reasons: “depictions of bullying”Anti-family?  Really?  If anything, this book is incredibly pro-family! Junior's parents are not perfect, but they are the best they can be and they love Junior and Junior loves him,.  I'm not sure how that qualifies as being anti-family. Cultural insensitivity? This is one of the most culturally sensitive books I have ever read. And, yes there are some scenes of drugs/alcohol/smoking, a few f-bombs here and there, and a description of what Junior does in his alone time (I'll give you a hint--it's the same thing almost every single 14 year old boy on the planet does).  However, none of that is presented in a gratuitous way.  It's Junior's life and this book would not be true with a white-washed version of his life.Look, I'm not going to go any further arguing the so-called ""reasons"" for challenging this book--it just makes me too upset.  I'll get off my soap box now....Obviously, I loved this book.  Junior was a fantastic character and I fell a little bit in love with him (and then went head over heels for him in the scene where he's interviewed by local media).  The depictions of life on the reservation are hard to read, but I believe that they are realistic.  I know life is hard on the reservations, and Alexie does not shy away from that.  Yet, at the same time, he does not fall into self-pity.What I found unexpected was how Alexie contrasts Juniors reservation world and his ""white"" world. In short, neither world is perfect, but neither world is doomed.  People are people and everyone has their own value and their own struggles.  I don't know if I was expected for own group to come out ahead of the other in some way, but I am very glad that didn't happen.I truly feel that this is an important book for young people to read.  Yes, it examines the struggles of modern Native Americans but, more importantly, it is about finding your own place in the world.  And to all those people who try and challenge this book....don't worry, when my children are older, they won't be checking this book out of the library. I'm going to buy them their own copies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q08BWVWT181C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006T2O8TW#wasThisHelpful","R2Q08BWVWT181C","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Horror is not a genre I normally read.  I have read it and I have enjoyed it, but it just isn't the section of the bookstore I tend to go to.  The truth is, I have a sort of strange relationship with it.  I am one of those people who is scared very, very easily.  I can't watch horror movies or listen to ghost stories.  Heck, I can't even go into haunted houses.  Yet, I'm very rarely scared when I read.  In fact, I've only been frightened by 2 books (The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova and Salem's Lot, the first AND LAST horror novel by Stephen King I've read).  I think that is why I've stayed away from horror--I felt like it wasn't working for me as it didn't scare me.  In time, I realized that getting a creepy or eerie feeling was probably okay and, let's face it, I shouldn't bemoan the absence of nightmares.So, when I come out and say that I didn't find this book frightening, it should not be taken as a commentary on the work.  I did find it eerie, and definitely a little creepy, so that is a win in my book.  However, I can't say if reader who are--and want to be--scared by such books would be.  I think those of you who fall into that category will have to rely on other  reviews to see if this book is spine-tingling.All that being said, I did find this a solid novel.  I don't know if you can much creepier than a creepy kid and, in that department, this book delivers.  Jack Peter has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, although it is clear very quickly to the reader that there is more to the boy than that diagnosis.  One of his more major issues is his agoraphobia--a fear of the outdoors.  He has not left the house in 3 years, except for necessary trips to the doctor.  Instead, he surveys the Maine Coast from the windows in his parents' ""dream house.""Jack Peter seems to have 2 outlets--drawing and his friend, Nick.  His parents encourage both, but Nick is not so sure about Nick.  The two boys have a complex relationship and one that Donohue fleshes out well.  The truth is that both boys need each other on one level and resent each other on another. And Nick is not so sure about all the drawings Jack Peter makes with an almost fevered urgency.That is the canvas on which this story is painted.  From here we have ghosts and monsters, family secrets and a mysterious woman.  I really don't want to get too far into the plot because I'm not sure how to do so without employing spoilers.  I will say this, though...this was a good horror novel for a reader like me, who doesn't read horror very often.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DEXFBHOCEGZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057159#wasThisHelpful","R1DEXFBHOCEGZW","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not proud to admit this, but I went into this book thinking I would know exactly how things would go.  I'm not saying that I thought it would be trite or predictable, but rather that it fell firmly into a trope of a life that is and a life that could have been.  And, to be sure, that is what The Bookseller is, but not in the way I thought it would be.I'm going to be especially careful writing the rest of this review as I think this is an unusually easy book to spoil and I really, really don't want to do that--I want you all to read it!Let me start with Kitty/Katharyn, who I call K from here on out.  I felt she was a strongly constructed character and robust enough to really carry this book.  She has to switch between two settings, sometimes with only a partial knowledge of her current world, but she is written such that she stays just one character.  The other characters in the novel are more one-dimensional, which normally is a drawback for me, but is actually necessary in this case (no, I'm no going to tell you why....read the book!).Setting in this book is paramount.  Both lives that K experiences is set in Denver, but in different worlds in the same city. If my memory is correct, I've only been to Denver twice and both times I was stuck in the airport.  So, I have no way of knowing if the portraits of Denver Swanson draws are accurate--but they are definitely evocative (for the record, it seemed like a hybrid between Portland and Tucson, which probably isn't too far off).  I felt like I was right there in Denver of the early-60s.  And, speaking of the time period, Swanson also uses current (to the time) events to set things up, something which I appreciated as a reader.  In a book where reality is questioned, it was nice to have an""anchor.""If I had a complaint about this book it would be that the moment when the situation becomes clear is a little muted.  I don't mean that I felt that there should have been more ""action,"" bu I do wish it had been a bit more of an ""a-ha moment.""In the end, though, this was a dazzling debut and one that I'd recommend to pretty much anyone...but I will give this warning; you'll probably start paying more attention to your dreams after reading this!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNBQQMV7UYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333003#wasThisHelpful","RFNBQQMV7UYD","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no secret that John Green has a bit of a cult following--and it is easy to see why.  He's a talented writer and he is tuned in to what young adults feel.  He's not afraid to tackle tougher topics, but he also doesn't dumb things down for his audience.  For that, I have great respect for him.My first encounter with John Green came when I read The Fault In Our Stars, a book I greatly enjoyed.  Since the movie version of Paper Towns is soon to be released, I decided that I would make this my 2nd Green read--so I can only compare it to The Fault In Our Stars.I say this because, based on these two books, I get the feeling that John Green is a formulaic writer.  Both books feature characters at a crossroads, which admittedly is not uncommon in Young Adult Fiction.  They also feature scenes of property damage sprees and unbelievably understanding parents.  Okay, that last part isn't necessarily a bad thing.The fact that there is a framework may not bother many people.  Let's face it, if it were a universal sin to be a formulaic writer, Dan Brown wouldn't have a prayer.  Unfortunately, it does bother me.  John Green is a very talented writer, but I really wish that he would get out of the box of his own making--at least I hope he does.  I will most likely read more of his books in the future so, you know, it could happen.  Heck, it may have already happened for all I know.  But the fact that this book was so similar to the other one of his books that I read did negatively impact what I felt about this book.However, let me address what I did like.  I liked Quentin as a main character.  I found him to be a believable narrator.  He's an essentially good kid--a young man who is trusted by his parents, gets good grades, and has a good social circle.  I enjoyed reading his interactions with his friends, who were the sort of people I knew in high school.  Yet, putting him next to Margo highlights what a troubled young woman she is.As I said, I am a fan of Green's writing--he is eloquent without being dramatically poetic.  I think this is what makes him so appealing to young adults.  Let's just say there is no shortage of quotable passages in this book.  Yet, he is still able to capture the vernacular of high school students and weave it seamlessly into his prose.Now, to my main problem with this book--and I have to admit that my own experiences greatly affected my feelings here--which is Margo Roth Spiegelman.  You see, I knew a Margo when I was in high school--granted my Margo wasn't as clever as Green's Margo and she never led us on a cross country hunt (probably because it never occurred to her), but I know first hand how damaging someone like this can be.  In many ways, Green romanticizes Margo and that just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Margo is a very, very troubled person and that is never truly addressed.  Quentin actually sacrifices quite a bit for her, yet he never really sees the cost of what he's done for her.  In this respect, I found the book unsatisfying.So, I'm torn on this.  Was this a successful book for me?  No.  Would I recommend it to others?  I don't know.  I do think that the younger the reader, the more likely they are to enjoy this book.  Yet, the farther the reader is from their own youth, the more likely they are to see the consequences of the characters' actions and behaviors and, as a result, the more likely they are to be dissatisfied with this story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PE3MR9RMOAAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014241493X#wasThisHelpful","R2PE3MR9RMOAAG","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Phew!  You know all those jokes about having to get drunk or behave in some other such activity after spending too much time with your family?  Well, that is how I felt after spending time with the Blair family.  This is not to say that this is a bad book--there is actually much to recommend it--but I, personally, did not enjoy it.  Admittedly, I'm not a reader who needs to enjoy a book in order to appreciate a book and, for the most part, I did appreciate this one.The best way I can think of to describe this book to someone is to think of an unfunny and dramatic version of Parenthood--the movie, not the TV show.  Four adult children come together to deal with their childhoods under the shadow of their ever-present (but deceased) father and their absent mother.  As is common with families, each child had a role--the oldest, the responsible and only girl, the treasured one, and the""bad"" one and, as adults, they are all dealing with these roles.The drama in this book is very realistic and, because of that, very painful.  I am sure that readers who enjoy family dramas will have more success with this title than I did.  Each of the children are explored, both as kids and as adults, and that results in 4 thorough character studies.  I found the oldest two children, Robert and Rebecca, the easiest to relate to.  The youngest, James, was at least understandable by the end of the book.  Ryan, however, never really gelled as a real character for me.  My guess is that Packer was trying to play with the idea of gender with him--he is heterosexual, but very feminine.  While I don't think there is anything wrong with that, I don't feel it was done in a way that was effective and I'm not sure why that is.  It wasn't that he was or wasn't likable, he just seemed like a lot was put on him, but he didn't have the depth as a character to pull it off.The two people who were very problematic for me were the parents, Bill and Penny.  We never really get to know Penny--there are a few passages that were told from her point of view, but mostly she was removed from the rest of the family.  On the whole, I understand why Packer did this--the fact that Penny was not involved in her children's lives is an important element of the development of the children's characters.  However, I wish Packer had committed to either telling more of the story from Penny's eyes or opted not to tell anything from her eyes.Then we have Bill.  Honestly, Bill makes Cliff Huxtable look like Al Bundy on a bad day.  Really, this guy is just too good to be true.  And the fact that he didn't seem true to me was a big issue for me as it seemed to undermine the entire book.  I kept wishing that there would be some kind of character flaw in this guy to make him human.I am the first to admit that family dramas can be hard for me as I find them intrinsically stressful. I know that there are many, many readers who are more interested in this than I am and I think that, if family drama is in your wheelhouse, this may be a good book for you.  I also think that this would be an excellent book club selection as families always provide much fodder for conversation.  However, if you prefer your family drama to be a bit--I don't know--lighter, you may want to approach this book with caution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMECM9KRE6I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476710457#wasThisHelpful","RXMECM9KRE6I2","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has been sitting in my Kindle account for quite some time.  I think it fell victim to my aversion to hyped books, or at least that is what I'm telling myself.  I recently won a copy of The Rosie Effect in a giveaway and I thought I should probably read this one first.  I went in expecting something light and quick.Don't get me wrong--this was light and quick.  Light in that it wasn't a book that I felt like I had to work to read and quick because I could not put it down.  To assume, however, that it being ""light and quick"" means it is fluffy is just wrong.  While this book is definitely smooth going down, shall we say, it definitely packs a punch.It took me a little time to settle into this book, to no fault of the books.  You see, I am a devoted fan of The Big Bang Theory and this book is very similar.  The main character is a man with Asperger's and a scientist.  Yet, it quickly becomes clear that Don Tillman is not a Sheldon Cooper clone...he wants to have a relationship and take pro-active, and questionable, steps to achieve that goal.The other characters in this book are well-drawn as well.  Rosie is an interesting woman and she turns out to not be what I initially thought she would be.  I can't say that I ""liked"" Gene, but he was an effective foil for Don and one that I wouldn't expect.  But, there was quite a bit about this book I didn' expect--I thought I had figured the Father Project out and was a bit flummoxed to realize that I had guessed wrong.There is great comedy in this book (including some unorthodox uses for skeleton) but there is great emotion as well.  Don's feelings are crystal clear to the reader long before he ever has the slightest inkling of going on.  Yet, when he does figure it out, it hits you like Billy Crystal's speech in When Harry Met Sally (but it is not when Don actually recites that particular speech...yes, that happens!).  I think the greatest strength of this book is how Simsion develops Don without Don actually knowing it.  And, yes, this is a love story--a quirky and sweet romantic tale, but it isn't what I would consider a ""romance.""  Don's relationship with Rosie is the tool that leads to his self-realization, not the other way around.It has been a while since a book so quickly worked its way into my heart as this one did.

"I will admit that I knew very little about Coco Chanel before reading this book.  I knew that she was French and worked during the first part of the 20th century.  I had a general idea of the ""Chanel Style"" and was very familiar with the iconic Chanel No. 5, as that is the perfume my mother wears.And that was the extent of my Coco Chanel knowledge.It is somewhat unusual for me to go into a historical novel being somewhat ignorant about the subject matter and, frankly, it is a treat.  Usually with historical fiction, I know the parameters in which the story has to operate but, in this case, I really only knew that there were some major (like World Wars I and II) events that would be happening.I hesitate to say that Coco's story is a rags to riches story...it's more of a ""raise yourself up by using every single tool at your disposal"" story.  While there are some ""happy coincidences"" in Coco's young adulthood, her success is still her own and, at times, comes at her expense.  There is not mistake:  Coco is a tough, tough woman.  Yet, I admired her, even if I felt that some (okay, many) of her choices were questionable.  She reminded me of one of those quintessential and glamorous 20th century anti-heroines, usually played on the silver screen by the likes of Bette Davis or Joan Crawford.Gortner creates the France, and especially the Paris, of this time period exquisitely.  Sometimes I get the feeling that authors just expect us to know what Paris is like and they get a little lazy in building it for us, but Gortner does not do that.  He illustrates every detail beautifully and lets the city evolve as it did through this tumultuous time period.Here is the difficult part of the review for me.  What I'm about to say did not actually bother me about this book, but I can see how some readers may have a problem with it.  As I said, I knew little about Coco Chanel going into this book. Once I finished, however, I did some admittedly light research (by ""light"" I mean wikipedia and a few other sites).  Gortner was very accurate about his facts.  However, judging by what I found online (and, again, it was ""light"" research), I think he gave Coco's character a very generous dose of the benefit of the doubt when it came to her actions during World War II.  I won't go into the details as I don't want to spoil the book, but it sounded to me that the ""real"" Coco was a little more, how should I say this?, opportunistic during the Nazi occupation of Paris than Gortner's characterization of her.  Personally, I don't see anything wrong with this--this is, after all, a novel and, frankly, no one really knows what Coco Chanel was thinking and feeling during that time.  Who knows?  It could be that Gortner was spot on with Chanel's motivations and just looking at the hard facts might give someone the wrong impression.  Still, readers who are more knowledgeable about the subject matter and more concerned with accuracy may have problems with this.Overall, though, this was an exceptionally good read.  Even though it is a work of historical fiction, it is definitely more of a ""character"" novel and that Coco--well, she was quite a character!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EGKPFYBXMZPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062356402#wasThisHelpful","R3EGKPFYBXMZPA","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those books that has been on my radar for a while but I just now had the chance to sit down and read it.  It was definitely a promising prospect--the plot convention of two stories separated by time is something that appeals to me, as is the time period of Olive's story.And, indeed, there were things I found enjoyable.  I really loved how Lehmann took the time to juxtapose the New York City of 1907 upon the New York City on 2007.  She does an admirable job of really going over the geography of the city and how things have changed.  I also appreciated the period photographs she included in the book.I also found Olive's story line intriguing.  A young woman who, through no fault of her own, falls from her place in society but still has the gumption to pull herself up and achieve her dreams.  Lehmann spends quite a bit of time highlighting Olive's naivete in the ways of passion, which actually fits quite well into her character and serves to draw a clear distinction between the life she lost and the life she had to live.On the other hand, I found Amanda's story line almost unbearable.  A woman who has been a 6 year relationship with a married man and then wonders why she's stuck?  That is just a tired story that's been told too many times.  I never felt any empathy for Amanda and, therefore, had no patience for her.  I can see how Lehmann was trying to tie the characters of Olive and Amanda together, but it either just didn't connect, or it connected too easily to be believable.There were some other issues with this book.  I respect Lehmann's attempt to illustrate the issues women had to face in the early 20th century in Olive's narrative, but she just tried to cram too much in.  She talked about religion, women in the workplace, childbirth, birth control, sexual fidelity, and immigration.  Phew!I also didn't find Lehmann's style as readable as I thought I would.  She isn't a difficult author to read, but there is just something a bit uncomfortable in her voice that I found a bit irritating.

"I've always enjoyed Amy Poehler, even though I never got past the first couple of episodes of Parks and Recreation (oh look...it's on Netflix....).  I knew when I heard about this book that I wanted to get it on audio, but I was still a little nervous.  Too many times, I've heard very funny people read their own work and it was just...dreadfully boring.  I get it--being in a recording studio and trying to make sure that you pronounce everything correctly and that you don't talk too fast or too slow can be daunting.  But, too often, the narration just becomes too monotone (cough, cough, Mindy Kaling, cough cough).I am very, very happy to say that this is not a problem with this book.  Poehler does a fantastic job of recording this--it is almost like she's sitting across the table from you just telling you about her life and life lessons,  And, let me tell you, she does not hold back.  I think there might be a temptation when you are writing about yourself to maybe make some of your negative aspects or experiences not quite so negative or to put some spin, but Amy Poehler doesn't do that at all.There are laughs--bazillions of them.  But there are also some great passages that really made me think (one that sticks with me: Make ""no"" a complete sentence).  And there is a section at the end where she talks about her kids which literally made me cry.  I kid you not.I haven't read the actual book, but from my experience with the audio book and from what other bloggers have said, I think I can safely say that this is a work that, while a great book, is much better in audio form.  There is just something great about Peohler's delivery.  And there is Patrick Stewart...reading haikus.  Need I say more?This is also a great audiobook if you've never done the audiobook thing before.  Because it is made up of essays, it is easy to stop and start--although, trust me, stopping can be hard.Just an FYI--this shouldn't be surprising, but this book is not safe for work (or, in my case, not safe for kids).  So, you know, get some earbuds.And, do me a favor.  Get this audiobook--or book (although I recommend audiobook. I may still get the book, though...you know, for the pictures....)  This is just amazing and something that you will listen to over and over again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQHZFYJOGSIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MP22QRQ#wasThisHelpful","R1FQHZFYJOGSIL","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cozy Mysteries are what I read when I want to just relax and give my mind a break.  I will admit that I'm not the sort of mystery reader who consciously goes through the book looking for clues and challenges myself to solve the mystery before the reveal; instead, I read these more as a straight novel and just enjoy the story as I go along.It had been quite some time since I last read a Cozy Mystery when I picked up this book. I really didn't know much about it other than it had cats (which I love) and that was the first in the series (which is a must for me).  Other than that, I went into this book with an open mind.This was an enjoyable read for me.  I immediately liked Kathleen and found I could relate to her.  As is common in such books, Mayville Heights is full of quirky characters, although I will admit that a number of them sort of blurred together for me.  I have a feeling that they will become more distinct as the series progresses, so I hesitate to hold that against this book.Another thing that I'm hoping will become clearer in later books (as you can tell, I've already decided to go further into this series) is how these two cats, Owen and Hercules, are magical.  In this book, their ""magic"" seemed to be limited to stealing and then getting stoned on catnip and walking through closed doors.  Still, I found these cats charming, even if their powers were a bit vague.I thought I had figured this mystery out until the very end, which is a good sign.  I also didn't feel that there was an unbelievable jump needed for Kathleen to solve the mystery.  I also appreciated that Kathleen didn't act like a detective throughout this book  Frequently in Cozy Mysteries, you get a baker or librarian or what not basically doing police work and that was not the case in this book.If you are looking for a new series, I would definitely recommend this book and series.  I'm hoping the following books are as good as this one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R264FI8LKPR7XQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451232496#wasThisHelpful","R264FI8LKPR7XQ","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is yet another case of me being late for the party.  It seems everyone has been reading Liane Moriarty, yet this is the first of her books that I've picked up.  I actually have a couple of her books on my e-reader waiting to be read, but I decided to start with this one as it is the most recent and is currently getting quite a bit of buzz.Folks, I could not put this book down.I can relate to it--not with the murder or abusive husbands, but with the having kindergarten-aged children as my youngest started kindergarten this year.  And, boy oh boy, am I glad that she isn't at the school in this book.  Yikes!I really liked the three women.  I could understand why Celeste stayed with her husband, which is saying a lot in today's climate (that's all I say to keep myself from crossing the line into Spoiler Land).  And Moriarty does another great job with Jane by creating a character who is completely framed by her past.And Madeline....there have been many times in my reading life when I've hated characters I was supposed to love, but I think this might be the first time I loved a character I was probably supposed to hate.  Madeline has a short temper, is clique-y, and has no qualms about starting trouble wherever she goes....and I simply adored her!Now, I must end my gushing because there was something about this book I really did not like.  You see, it fell into one of my biggest pet peeves.  It took some serious topics--which I commend Moriarty for tackling--and treated them almost too lightly in too much of a satirical light.  To be fair, while I was bothered by this in Big Little Lies, it was far less than in some other books (such as Julia Fierro's Cutting Teeth).  Perhaps that the setting of this particular book--moms of kindergartners--was a bit too close to me, but I couldn't help feeling uncomfortable with some of the tone of this book.But, while I was uncomfortable at times, I was never so uncomfortable that I would actually put the book down, so that is saying something.  I'm also to accept that Moriarty never goes so far that I felt that the book even nears the line between my own discomfort and general inappropriateness.In the end, I did enjoy this book, even though I wished at times things were toned down a bit.  It also introduced me (finally) to a great author who deserves all the accolades she is currently enjoying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FIKYXDOH6D8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDMMISA#wasThisHelpful","R2FIKYXDOH6D8C","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really, really thought I would love this book.  The summary sounded fascinating and I was quickly pulled in by Bloom's writing.  She has a poetic voice that I found hypnotic.  Unfortunately, that was not enough to save this book for me.I tried to put my finger on what went wrong for me and I came up with two big problem areas.  The first was the story itself.  From the summary, it sounds like this is one of those vast novels, but then you look and the book is less than 300 pages.  There are basically 3 sections of this book--New York, Seattle, and Canada/Alaska and Bloom just sort of drops the reader in each one--and I had a lot of trouble buying how Lillian got to Seattle and then to Alaska.  Bloom also dives a bit in to the world of the soap opera dramatics, which did not appeal to me.  I felt that a lot of what happens to Lillian just wasn't necessary and I would have rather that Bloom had used those pages for something else.The other problem was Lillian herself.  I just never felt any connection with or sympathy for her--which is strange because I can understand the desire to find your child, but it just didn't ring true for me with Lillian.  I never felt that I was able to get into her enough to feel her compulsion to go on her trek to find her daughter.  Instead, she seemed like such a survivor (and I don't mean that in an entirely positive sense) that I couldn't see her give up her comforts to return for a daughter she was told was dead.It's a shame as I think that Bloom is a fantastic writer and this book sounded great, but it just didn't work for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3IWO1KLXVPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812977793#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3IWO1KLXVPT","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to be honest, I almost put this book aside.  It was not due to any fault of the book, it was just that the subject matter was incredibly distressing to me.  I guess it is a credit to Hatvany that she could write about the situation so well that it left me physically shaken.So, yes, let's just say this is not a ""fun"" read.  Trust me, it's far more intense than the summary would lead you to believe.  It's pretty raw and heartbreaking--but I soon went from wanting to stop to not being able to put it down.  Hatvany does well with highly emotional material and this is no exception.I felt for Nicole--she had it coming from both sides.  Not only did she have to take over the care of her sister, but she also had a bevy of unresolved issues with her mother.  Her childhood friend comes back into the picture, who becomes a lifesaver to Nova (and she's kind of a kick--right when the reader needs something a little lighter going on in the story!).  Hatvany said in the afterward that she has a sister with the same disability as Jenny, so I'm pretty sure that much of this came from the heart with her...and you can tell.There is a bit of romance in the novel, but not so much that it overwhelms the plot.  I think the story could have stood on its own legs without the romance, but its presence didn't really distract me.  I think the more important aspect was the relationships Nicole had before she returned to Seattle.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for something ""light"" to read.  However, this is something I would heartily recommend it to someone looking for something that will hit their emotions with both barrels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TR8BKV5VLSUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EE5C6C#wasThisHelpful","R1TR8BKV5VLSUH","A3V5XZL28IAXTH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5XZL28IAXTH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Charles Slack points out the incredible value and political leverage of the First Amendment through the telling of six cases of prosecution under the Sedition Act of 1798. His message, or 'moral' is clear and poignant and delivered without political bias.Matthew Lyon - Irish immigrant, and elected member of the US House of Representatives attacked for being a loudmouth; David Brown a ""drifter"" persecuted in what was a kangaroo-court, presided over by a Supreme Court Justice; Benjamin Franklin Bache, grandson of the Founder and publisher of the newspaper ""Aurora"" destroyed for dissent; James Thompson Callender, a Scottish immigrant and editor of politically incendiary  diatribes, driven to a watery death; Luther Baldwin a workingman of Trenton, NJ who one morning joked, ""I don't care if they're firing through his arse."" in reference to a cannon blast of honor for John Adams and was jailed; Thomas Cooper an intellectual, firebrand and later in life professor described by Adams as, ""a learned ingenious scientific and talented madcap"", are the protagonists, and victims.Each of these cases is characterized by the politically vengeful nature of the law's application, the petty animosity of its prosecution and the senseless pain it caused to the accused. This was a craven law intentionally written to expire at the end of a presidential term so that it could not be set on its own creators. In the end less than a dozen men were prosecuted, but enough to besmirch the constitution and help ruin the political party of its creators. Years later and too late, the congress decided the law, ""unconstitutional, null, and void, passed under a mistaken exercise of undelegated power.""It is hard to find heroes in this book besides the victims themselves: Secretary of State Pickering acts the petty head witch hunter, President Adams the self-righteous Prince of Philadelphia tries in vain to stand above the Bill he didn't veto (appearing a FAR cry from McCullough's sympathetic John Adams), Vice President Jefferson is reactionary to the point of suggested disunion with his over-the-top Kentucky Resolutions; even Madison the now out-of-office drafter of the first ten amendments appears at best - lame, and Justice Samuel Chase, appears in his traditional role as the man history loves to hate. (See Wm. H. Rehnquist's, Grand Inquests... for Chase's impeachment in 1805)The book is very well researched, especially well written in clear, vibrant prose and structured with the fast-paced anecdotes of the victims interwoven through its chronology. The last chapter concludes with lessons from that period, and for modern time reminds us that; the Declaration of Independence is our mission statement, the Constitution our user's manual and (with a phrase that Slack borrows from Ernest Hemingway) the the Bill of Rights ought to be our, ""built-in, shock proof, sh_t detector""*. Recommended as good history, a good read and a good lesson to us all today who ""recoil"" at the ""other"" side of politics... regardless of which side you are on.__________* left incomplete through no delicacy of my own, but respectful of the ""terms of agreement"" for this page; substitute for underscore, the 3rd vowel of the English language, and blame Hemingway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IO25B5PVR5QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV9D9QI#wasThisHelpful","R2IO25B5PVR5QW","A23BNT7UYCWBX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23BNT7UYCWBX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a 'gritty' account of the events at Boston that led to the spark of the American Revolution. Gritty in that it is a rendition that is not often told - exposing a good bit of the selfish motivations and oafish methods of our forefathers. Why any of this surprises should be the surprise. American historiography probably got off to a bad start with the 'gushing' Parson Weems-style renditions so popular in the 19th century, placing the founders on a pedestal of reverence impossible to fully justify even with a cursory examination, and then it became the expectation.Author Harlow Giles Unger begins ""American Tempest"" with 'first principals': in this account, the founders are humans and decidedly not saints. The story exposes motivations - not always - but often led by economics, or personal power: no differently than today. The British quandary over American reaction to a relatively trivial tax, on a commodity unimportant in American society, for a purpose essential to American security can be understood. For the Americans, there was an essential indignity underlying the whole of the taxes that had less to do with economics than dignity. The colonies had matured to a point that their control by a parliament thousands of miles away, led by an effete class, in which they held no sway at all became the real ignitor for the conflagration that followed.A very recommended read, ""American Tempest"" treats an old topic in a modern light. Unger's writing style is certain, urgent, and efficient. The story is relatively brief by today's standards, 240 pages plus afterward materials, which keeps it well paced and on-topic and told so compellingly that a 5th star is justified. Once let go of the notion of the 'Sainted Founder', the reader is exposed to the events in a way that gets to a clearer understanding of BOTH sides, and at the end much better enlightens, yet still leaves the pedestals of the founders untoppled. Also - for a British view of the whole Revolution see O'Shaughnessy's brilliant: The Men Who Lost America: British Leadership, the American Revolution, and the Fate of the Empire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T0IW5KK3NAZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306819627#wasThisHelpful","R1T0IW5KK3NAZZ","A23BNT7UYCWBX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23BNT7UYCWBX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At last some ""science-sense"" applied to the game. For too long fans have been at the mercy of announcers and other television experts who ""watch a lot of games"", or even ""played the game"" themselves. But in integrating the great complexities of the game, the human mind simply can't be expected to keep up with the vastness of the data. There's no way to integrate the thousands if not tens of thousands of events that happen during the baseball season and synthesize a reasonable conclusion. Happily that is something a computer does very, very well and that data in the hands of a skilled statistician can provide insights into the game that no baseball ""old hand"" can see and most have proved incapable of even recognizing, or (sadly) acknowledging even after it has been demonstrated!""Clutch hitters"" and ""postseason tactics"" may all be 'bunk'. Risking an out for a stolen base, or a bunt may be nonsense, despite ""traditionalist"" belief to the contrary. Sabermetrics is catching on. There's still plenty of room for the naysayers, and they naysay, Luddite-like against technology, but it's catching on and catching on where it counts... at the GM level.Well written and easily readable, author Michael Lewis keeps his reader's attention right to the last page. Highly recommended, read it if you're a baseball fan: even if you're not persuaded by what you read, you'll be smarter about what Sabermetrics is all about and you won't have to deal with a single: mean, variance, or standard deviation!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH69ZNESSZYFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076XKTAA#wasThisHelpful","RH69ZNESSZYFH","A23BNT7UYCWBX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23BNT7UYCWBX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published for the Institute of Early American History and Culture at Williamsburg, Va., by University of North Carolina Press in 1968, this biography of the American Founder Rufus King is said to be the first on the subject. King is important enough as a Founder that his life can almost be deduced from his MANY appearances in the read of other books of the period: this biography, covering the entire scope of his life, provides a holistic portrait of the man.Rufus King, a native born Massachusetts man, represented his state in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Later as a transplanted New Yorker, he represented that state in the U.S. Senate as one of the state's first two senators. King was, from his political 'start', a Federalist and retained his philosophical association with that party, or 'faction' until his death in 1827: said by this author to be one of the last two remaining Federalists (John Marshall the other). Rufus King was one of a handful of the 55 Delegates who, in 1787, took on a major role at the constitutional convention and therefore had a decisive influence on the Constitution. Article I, Section 10, Clause 1: ""No State shall...pass any...Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts"", has its origin with Rufus King.  As ambassador to the The Court of St. James, or Senator from the state of New York, King served through each of the administrations of the first six presidents.Author Dr. Robert Ernst has written a thorough, scholarly and very well documented account of the life of Rufus King. This ~400 page volume is presented in a 'workmanlike' fashion - that is; comprehensive, well documented, and quite readable... albeit DRY. The narrative style can be seen in the structure, but the sentences come off lifeless, passing along the chronology without spirit. If you are interested in the period, or the politics there are better alternatives, however, if it is Rufus King in particular of interest, this read is recommended with the caveat that there are chapters that seem to plod for lack of energy, perhaps due to a thinness of the underlying material. Other chapters are rich with information and told well in the narrative style - especially King's mission to Great Britain (e.g. chap. XII-XIV) spanning the Adams & Jefferson Presidencies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39SIE7UB0MOE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZWEUE6#wasThisHelpful","R39SIE7UB0MOE3","A23BNT7UYCWBX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23BNT7UYCWBX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a timer with an 'unusual' feature - an astronomic capability to 'track', or offset for sunrise and sunset. If you need an INDOOR timer that turns on at dusk or off at dawn, this is the one. This timer does NOT contain a photo electric sensor: indoor, a photoelectric sensor can be undependable, fooled by lamps or draperies. This timer allows the user to choose a U.S. region: north, central or south (in effect setting latitude) and input your local sunrise/sunset for that day, available from a cell phone (in effect setting, or refining longitude from 'time'). Prior to 'event' programming you set year, month, day, local sunrise and sunset (for that day). 'On' and 'off' events may then be set using either time, or  a celestial event either in the 'on' or 'off' or both positions: e.g., on at sundown, off at 11:00 p.m.The timer also allows seven on/off per event-pairs which may be set to: all 7 days of the week, all 5 work days, week ends, or any individual day. Its 15 Amp capacity is also unusual allowing it to control larger loads such as a  Hp electric motor. It contains an internal battery to preserve programming in the event of an a/c power outage, or movement from one to another indoor receptacle.This kind of versatility comes at the 'price' of some 'programming' complexity. I am no 'rocket scientist' myself, but programmed mine on the first try: ""on"" at sundown, ""off"" at 11:00 p.m. - though I admit it demanded attention! The instructions are available at the manufacturer's web site, downloadable in .pdf format. Use this search string to find the instructions .pdf:  ""DT121DT122Instructions"" You should have a look before purchase to determine if your patience will permit the procedure. If so - this timer gives broad capability for a very fair price. NOTE that the timer contains 2 receptacles, but they are NOT individually programmable, i.e. on/off events affect both receptacles.

"Professor Ryan K. Smith captures the essence of his subject's personality, motivation and unfortunate legacy in this relatively svelte ~300 page book. Robert Morris, known to any student of the American Founding Period is nonetheless a lesser known founder to the wider public. He signed three of the four Great State Papers of the U.S.: the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution. Once fabulously wealthy, Robert Morris served patriotically as, 'The Financier of the Revolution' but died broken and disgraced, out of debtors prison only 3-years. Morris's story itself is an interesting read and has been told a few other times, very well by example, by Charles Rappleye in his book, Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution.Professor Smith, however, does something different with this approach: Morris's accumulation, then loss of his great wealth is told through the raising - then razing of his most grandiose edifice, one never formally 'named' and now mockingly known to Philadelphia history as, ""Morris's Folly"". The architecture becomes the metaphor of the man. The Folly went up in 1794 and came down in 1800: designed by another famous name in American history, Pierre L'Enfant the self declared, ""Engineer of the United States"" and draftsman of the layout of the American Capital. Professor Smith's story casually and cleverly weaves in the lives and fortunes of many other names famous in American history: Gouverneur Morris, Thomas Fitzsimmons, Robert Clymer, Thomas Mifflin, Pierce Butler (all signers of the Constitution) Presidents; Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison even Monroe, in cameo. There are also a list of villains - not so well known to history that help explain the incredible loss of wealth, respect and finally the house, or mansion, or 'Palace' itself, all told in a fashion that allows the reader to judge for him or herself - no overt moralizing offered by the author, or needed by the reader. Professor Smith delivers even handed, serious history without a 'tilt' of bias. And it ends with irony at today's, ""Tony's Paradise"", but you will enjoy finding that for yourself on the last page.Something 'fresh' and new, this book moves outside of the already (too?) well published litany of: Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, Madison. Very thoroughly recommended to history aficionados and just as enthusiastically  recommended as a good story - well told, even for those who may 'think' they don't care for the read of history.

"Another reviewer with some disdain for this offering called the writing ""amateurish"", an observation that in this case may identify a large part of the problem. The first four chapters of this book completely undermine Dr. Forman's credibility as a fair arbiter of events, or as a reasoned judge of the pertinence of material. (""The climb of the down-spout"", incident at Harvard spreads over pages, even with the eventual acknowledgment that it may never have happened and certainly no indication that it involved Warren!) The reading leaves one wondering where was the editor in the development of this book? It could easily be reduced by half and still miss no verifiable history. How much of what is presented (the reader wonders) is made up of whole-cloth, some examples:(kindle Location 421, Chapter 2) ""Joseph Warren may have been a member of the debating club, though no examples of his debate topics or student oratory exist. Such activity would imply attraction to public speaking, ability or interest in making points persuasively, and perhaps an enjoyment in expressive improvisation, and verbal sparring."" Without ANY indication of debating membership - Warren is accorded all of the expected virtues, of a Founder.(kindle Location 444) ""I am unsure whether to accept this story on face value [Warren 'climbs' a downspout at Harvard to join a meeting]. I WANT [my emphasis] it to be true in that it adds a dramatic little episode to a developmental period in Joseph Warren's life for which little else survives."" A sentiment that deservedly drives historical fiction - but should have no place in a book of this presumption.(Location 593) ""Speculatively interpreting the episode as an early meeting of the 'Spunkers' [club] provides additional insights into young Joseph Warren's character that are newly posited."" This speaks for itself.Chapter 4 rambles on the smallpox ""siege"" of Boston with paragraphs devoted to the speculation of whether Dr. Warren himself had been inoculated. No evidence exists apparently, and it would be a conclusion, either positive or negative, that would be barely pertinent to the story. Without inoculation Warren's bravery is enhanced even more... a leap of faith that the reader would gladly take without the tedium of the pages of Chapter 4 that offer no resolution anyway.The lack of coherent direction, lapses in historical accuracy... and lack of scholarly rigor, undermine the reader's confidence in the author. Similarly, following a storyline for 400 pages fraught with the author's, 'thinking out loud' exhausts then looses the readers interest! If there is a 'good story' here, it is buried under speculation, tangential material and an unfocused presentation. Certainly the story does not meet the expected standards of serious history: researched, or fantasized?I can't recommend this book, but do read the first chapters online (click ""Look Inside"" on the book icon) BEFORE buying to see if its style suits your own  expectations. The book is a frustrating read as the story vacillates between ""speculation"" (a term Forman even himself uses unapologetically) and undisguised author-subject adoration: too much of the first and any of the latter erodes the consequence of the message. No reader even vaguely informed of Dr. Joseph Warren is going to think him anything less than a heroic patriot; Dr. Forman in his zeal to prove the point already self evident, induces so many uncertainties that he undermines his own objective.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXJJEL6I2C6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080H12BG#wasThisHelpful","RXXJJEL6I2C6K","A23BNT7UYCWBX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23BNT7UYCWBX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There IS a tingling on the gums after a few minutes, but by no means uncomfortable... certainly not painful.

"An especially well focused biography; author Robert Middlekauff examines the men that became Franklin's friends and his enemies with an eye to reasoning WHY alliances and enmities developed. Not a psychological study by any means, instead a very insightful look into the characteristics of personalities which caused them to attract, or repel.The odd hatreds and detestations that came about between the characters involved in Franklin's attempt to rid Pennsylvania of the proprietary government of the Penns, and later still the animosities that developed within the diplomatic delegation to France are examined as penetratingly as any written account that I have encountered. Silas Deane's alleged (never demonstrated) larceny, Arthur Lee's near-psychotic sense of self importance, John Adam's conflicted sense of duty and jealousy are clearly laid out with careful scholarship and documentation. But it is author Middlekauff's clever ""connecting the dots"" that makes the read a successful historical examination.As ever, it is the enemies that garner more attention and interest than the friends. The opening chapters therefore make a less successful impression on the reader. Here the personalities and events seem less connected - more the laundry-list of names and personality traits that mesh well with Franklin's. Still, a well done, very interesting and important read of Franklin and the Revolutionary era. 4 stars, if I could give it, but not five, the early chapters don't keep-up with the rest of the book. Also see Beaumarchais and the American Revolution for an interesting & succinct look at the Deane, Lee, Adams conflict on the supply of French weapons to the Continental Army.-----kindle edition-----Disappointing! This is the quality of e-book publication that could be expected of the early years; lots of odd artifacts appear from the formatting to e-book process - most notably an endless stream of  (now incorrect) hyphenation that no longer fits with the changed format. More annoyingly, all of the strengths of the electronic format (the hyperlinks) are ignored. The citations are not linked: swipe up/down chapter change is not implemented, the index is not linked, and there are no page numbers. If this were a bargain book some of this might be excusable, but at ~$16 - more is expected; at half the price you can buy this book in hardcover!

"A very succinct and readable review of the covert mission of the French Government to aid Revolutionary America in the years prior to the alliance made by King Louis the XVI. The principal actor is Pierre August Caron de Beaumarchais the French agent (notable as the author of the play ""The Barber of Seville"") commissioned by French Foreign Minister the Comte de Vergennes. On the American side, the principal is Silas Deane, Connecticut delegate to the Continental Congress, acting in conjunction with Benjamin Franklin.Silas Deane's life and reputation are ultimately ruined in the scheme - principally through the petty-jealousy, distrustfulness, and bungling of Arthur Lee; and the American Congress embarrasses itself by ""stiffing"" the ""black"" corporation (Roderigue Hortalez et Compagnie) set-up to provide and ship its own war supplies.A well done overview of the events including reference to subsequent American audits of the the company, one inexplicably by Arthur Lee (of ALL people) that proved bogus and another by Alexander Hamilton - presumably accurate, but ""finessed"" by the American Congress to the point that they were able to bilk Hortalez et Compagnie of its payment in any case.

"Five stars for pure insightfulness. It will be difficult to find a book that bests this one in its ability to better render the personality, temperament, and reputation of the founders, because simply these writings are not filtered through the opinion of authors and editors; this book is a compilation of snippets written by the founders about their fellow founders. Fairly, editor John P. Kaminski includes BOTH sides of opinion, the positive and the negative.""There are few great men, to whom one is brought near, however dazzling may be their talents or actions, who are not thereby painfully diminished in the estimate of those who approach them. The mist of distance sometimes gives a looming size to their character; but more often conceals its defects.""  A eulogy, by Joseph Story presented on page 404 - but as the author implies, broad in its application.This book is probably best read after others (many others) on the Founders themselves because it tends less to teach, than to adjust, or temper, or confirm (occasionally even change) opinions formed by the reader from prior experience. Picked up with nothing on the subject prior, it will come off as dry and scattered. But, with some preceding learning, it is a jewel.

"Interesting satire on today's politics. Written by Gary Trudeau - so conservatives predictably take the brunt of the irony, but Dems., as a bit of counterbalance are occasionally characterized, stereotypically as twits. It is just zany enough to be believable (in concept) without going over the top, broadcast channel ""sitcom"" (ugh!) style. In short; four like-minded U.S. Senators (all GOP of course) share a house in Georgetown and we watch their lives as scoundrelly, well-meaning, self-absorbed, adorable politicos.Give it a try, if your political skin is not too thin, or you are naturally liberal by persuasion, you will likely enjoy the series. John Goodman is perfect (as always) in his lead role as the lazy, shiftless senator from NC. Clark Johnson is great, and quite believable, as the sophisticated but slippery senator from PA, Matt Malloy plays a religious zealot senator from UT - but the writing for the role, or Malloy's rendition is a little too farcical to mesh well even with, ""suspended reality"".

"A good caliper - capable of measuring outside diameter, inside diameter and depths. The construction is stainless-steel, but not by any means rugged. The caliper is meant for home DIY sort of applications rather than ""machine tooling"". If you intend to read in the metric (centimeter) scale, it displays adequately. If you need imperial (inches); the display window obstructs and the reticle confuses!Only every full inch is indicated - between indicated calibrations, you will find yourself interpolating and applying deductive reasoning whenever an inch marker does not fall within the window. Why the reticle also needs multiple etches is questionable; it is only the left-most that indicate the measurement, the remainder confuse or cloud the reading. It does what I need, but I can't recommend it in general. I think there are better calipers within the range of this price point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYJV3MY2DDM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6K7FVO#wasThisHelpful","R2CYJV3MY2DDM5","A23BNT7UYCWBX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23BNT7UYCWBX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Rob Rosen's follow-up to Queerwolf, we meet a guy who inherits a mansion--and the family ""bloodline,"" complete with an Igor! He also falls for one of the werewolves from Queerwolf, who, along with a bunch of other vamps and werewolves, must find out who or what is tossing spears nonstop at the mansion--spears that can mean certain death to a vampire!Just like Queerwolf, Vamp isn't a novel of terror. It's a horror comedy that focuses on the challenge of being a monster, not on victims being hunted by the monsters. While the humor is in the same style as Queerwolf, Vamp has less of the sexy situations present in Queerwolf--noticeably less. I personally enjoyed the playfully erotic segments of Queerwolf and actually missed their presence here. Vamp will probably be enjoyed more by those readers who are put off by ""unnecessary sex"" (can't understand the concept of sex being unnecessary).It will be great if Rosen continues writing novels that take us along on more adventures with these characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6BFIVXPLQYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608208788#wasThisHelpful","R2B6BFIVXPLQYW","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Rob Rosen's sense of humor, horror, and horny is all apparent as soon as you begin reading this novel about a man who finds out he comes from a lineage of werewolves. But first, he wakes up covered in blood and unable to remember the date he had the night before.This is all out fun and a wicked fast read. It's campy, comic, sexy and naughty, and an adventurous story of a werewolf, his hot new man, and the unexpected gang--including a Republican grandfather, a drag queen, a dude in a wheelchair, and a tough female ""bodyguard""--who must go up against San Francisco's most fierce (as in vicious, in this case) pack of werewolves. On top of all that, our leading man/werewolf has to contend with another big, chronic problem...if you know what I mean.Written in first person, this is a light and playful narrative that never gets heavy and doesn't deal with downer issues that come with being gay. It's strictly a horror sex comedy about gay werewolves.

"Okay, I'll admit I've been a Dyson fanatic for about 5 years. I didn't believe anything could compare to it. I have two Dyson ball vacuums, one of them being the pet vac. I have two dogs.The Bissell PowerGlide definitely has more suction than a Dyson. It is super powerful and pulled up so much dirt and hair I couldn't believe it. It also brought back the pile in rugs and carpets I've had for 6 years. As much as I love my Dyson, I think this Bissell outperforms it big time. It also has a bigger canister so it doesn't need to be emptied as often.Of course, as with all vacuums, it's the ease-of-use that also matters. Like the Dyson, the PowerGlide has some plastic parts that seem really flimsy (the handle, clips for attachments, and the handle on the end of the hose).The cord is pretty long, but the cord wrap is set into the side of the vacuum, so rewinding the cord back onto it is a little tricky. Also, there's a cord clip under the handle for keeping it out of the way when vacuuming, but the cord just doesn't stay in too securely. It falls out repeatedly during vacuuming.Emptying the canister is easy--one push of a button and it pulls off. Another push of a button opens the door. The only thing I noticed is that hair and dirt gets caught way up at the top of the canister in a section that's unreachable--on the Dyson, the top of the canister also comes off to get to that hard-to-reach section, but that isn't the case with the PowerGlide. Not sure how I'm ever going to get the trapped stuff out of there.The swivel feature moves smoothly, and the vacuum pushes along carpet pretty easily. However, the suction is SO strong that sometimes it feels like it needs more energy to push, and don't even consider vacuuming throw rugs. The vacuum is so strong it sucks them up. The manual says to turn off the spinning brush in the vacuum for doing throw rugs, but that fails to get up any of the dirt from them and the vacuum doesn't glide as easily over the surface, so the rugs move.Going under furniture, you'll find that the vacuum tends to tilt off the floor. Also, the foot release is positioned farther up on the base than most vacuums, so you really have to reach your foot around to get to it--and it is not a simple press of the foot. It's very temperamental and you find yourself stepping on it repeatedly trying to get it to work.The upholstery and crevasse tools attach right to the back of the machine. The upholstery tool is great on upholstery, but I tried to use it on carpeted steps and it was getting stuck badly. Also, the hose on the vacuum is not long, but that's because of the ""Lift-Off technology""; the entire canister detaches from the base so you can carry it freely! That makes doing an entire staircase easy, except for one thing; the machine is HEAVY despite being described as lightweight. Your arm will quickly become fatigued. Also, trying to put the canister back on the machine, it gets a little confusing with the electric cord and the hose getting crisscrossed and in the way if you don't make sure everything is cleared.And finally, the one MAJOR difference between this and my Dyson, and this is a big one--while the PowerGlide has several washable filters, it does have one filter that needs to be replaced and not just cleaned. That's a big deal because that means monitoring it, paying for an extra accessory every now and then--and, as with all these types of products, wondering how long this filter is going to be readily available on the market.So that might sound like a bunch of minuses, but they're really just the typical technicalities that make using pretty much any vacuum a chore. The PowerGlide is a truly a super powerful machine that makes you feel like you've cleaned your entire house from top to bottom just by vacuuming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ERC6F9PRDVEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUG0A7E#wasThisHelpful","R1ERC6F9PRDVEJ","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leaving behind the smooth R&B and soul sounds that were heavily present on his past efforts (except for the last 2 songs here, which close the original album sequence in that style), Colton and some of the biggest names in dance production have created a pop dance record loaded with vocal hooks and fantastic electro riffs. While ""Let Me Live Again"" was released as a single previously, it's not even the strongest track on here.Track 1, conveniently titled ""First in Line"" is one of my favorites on here, with a wickedly catchy chorus and flowing, floaty dance vibe. ""Look My Way"" reminds me of current dance tracks by male vocalists like Usher, Chris Brown, and Jason DeRulo. Awesome track that could easily be a radio hit. I'm obsessed with this song. ""Realize' is a light dance track with mellow guitar strumming accents. ""Get To You"" featuring Ultra Nate is another favorite--funky, hard, filled with attitude and awesomely catchy. Track 6, called ""Change"" is the dead center of the album and is a nice risk Colton is taking as a vocalist--it's a wonderfully trancey synth dance track with only the same vocal hook repeated occasionally. ""Can You Feel It"" is an upbeat party tune. ""Just The Way I Am"" is another hard, aggressive dance track with a hint of international flavor--it would make an amazing anthem if remixed into a 10 minute epic. ""The Music Always Gets You Back,"" a slamming club track originally included in its extended form on the ""Let Me Live Again"" single, is included in a shorter version. And that's where this fantastic dance album ends before we finally get to chill with the two slow grooves that close the album.The first bonus track on the CD is called ""Tonight""--and it's very similar in groove to the Chris Brown song Beautiful People. The full length Frankie Knuckles and Eric Kupper mix of ""Let Me Live Again"" is a pretty mellow dance mix. And then, I am completely blown away to have two of the ULTIMATE songs on this album included in extended versions: ""Look My Way"" and ""Get to You."" So glad they're just extended and not remixes, because these tracks are PERFECT as is. Just note that the songs are actually in the reversed order on the CD as compared to how they are listed on the CD. And finally, the last bonus track is called ""The Story"" and it fits perfectly with the electro dance style of the album, although it really doesn't feature as much of Colton's voice.Colton also reminds us why we love CDs and physical media--to have the liner notes and to get photos of the artist. The pictures reflect the feel of the album--sexy and fun. Colton is really embracing everything he is as a sex symbol in gorgeous photos that give us some beefcake in place of the feminine skin inside the CD booklets of pop princess releases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8QS1RUXNPHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWTAFIY#wasThisHelpful","RY8QS1RUXNPHI","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first thing you'll notice after the simple assembly of this unit is how nice and tight everything wraps up together for storage. It also happens to be simple to use--but I agree with some of the other reviewers; do you really need to pull this out every time you need to clean a spot, when some spray-on stain remover and a sponge can do the same thing?I'll say though, it did get out some spots on the carpet on my basement stairs that never came out before. Use is pretty simple. You fill up one reservoir to the marked ""water"" level (with hot water), and then poor in the Bissell boost and spot cleaners, each also marked by a level on the reservoir, so no measuring is necessary. There are also small job and large job markers. The only real question---why do we need separate boost and spot cleaner formulas? They REALLY can't make an all-in-one formula??? This means more money out of your pocket when it's time to buy refills...For most jobs, you'll be using the brush attachment. You press a button that shoots the liquid onto the spot, and then you scrub it with the brush, and then vacuum it away. But here's the catch. The bristles are short, and they are right UNDER the vacuum opening, so it's hard to scrub without vacuuming at the same time. Also, don't expect the vacuum to dry your rug. It stays pretty damp even after multiple passes, and it can be a bit foamy. For me, the unit did do something a spray-on cleaner and brush hasn't done very easily...it removed remnants of my dogs' rawhide bones, which tend to embed in the rug fibers and stick. Using the Bissell removed those without a problem and made me feel the section is much fresher than when I just hand wash it. The brush attachment also has a removable clear lid that captures dirt, so it needs to be removed and cleaned after use. Also--if you have dogs, you're best off giving an actual vacuuming to your carpet first, because this unit picks up a lot of the hair and I could see it becoming a clog problem.The other attachment is a simple crevasse attachment. No brush on this one, so it seems to be more of a way to just vacuum tight corners than to actually clean.Other things to note. The cord is fairly long for a small unit. It stretched across half the width of my basement, which isn't too bad. Of course, if you're doing multiple spots in a large room, you will have to switch outlets. Next, the cleaner reservoir and the dirty water reservoir are virtually impossible to empty completely because of the design of the emptying holes, which have a sort of lip around the rim. No matter how hard I tried to tilt and shake the containers, there was still a bit of water in each.So, like I said, you could probably do most spot cleaning jobs with a spray and a sponge, but the Bissell did get out some spots I'd never been able to get out before, and the sort of ""steam cleaning"" treatment makes the whole area you've cleaned feel somewhat more thoroughly cleaned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGH3T2V0LU86C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZBJ1JK#wasThisHelpful","RGH3T2V0LU86C","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When i was a kid, i was never a fan of these types of Play Doh toys for a very particular reason--I didn't want to mix my colors together! That's the first thing you should note about this ice cream maker. It's cool for your kids to make pretend ice cream cone swirls like they make chocolate/vanilla swirls at the real ice cream shop, but that means you might want to use play doh colors you can actually mix together to make a completely different color, because once you swirl them, there's no ""unswirling"" them.Then we have the ""sprinkle"" maker. It's supposed to sprinkle play doh sprinkles all over your ice cream cones. Instead, you sort of get clumps of play doh that just fall down around your cone which you then have to pick up and smush onto the ice cream to make it stay.And of course, there's the issue of making sure your kids won't be tempted to actually try to eat the ice cream. It looks tempting not only in cones...but in the included ice cream dishes WITH spoons! The other reason you'll need to monitor playtime--the ice cream machine is made of numerous small parts that click together, and because of the towering design, excitable children who want to pull the lever could easily put to much weight on the handle, bringing all the fun tumbling down!The set also comes with a very small amount of play doh! these 5 containers are TINY!!! You'll need to go out and buy some regular jumbo sized canisters if you really want to get the ice cream party started! And finally, the play doh is guaranteed to stick to all the nooks and crannies of the inner works of the machine, so it will never really be clean once you use it, so you'll have to consider where you want to store it so that it play doh remnants don't flake off and get all over other toys, toy boxes, shelves, or wherever you place it.Of course, these are all technical aspects the adult has to keep in mind.

"Didn't know what to expect with this toilet seat, but it has become the best one I've ever used. Rather than a typical nut and bolt attachment connected to the toilet bowl, this one features a screw system that attaches to your standard toilet bowl first, with a long plastic ""nut"" that is easy to manipulate compared to the short nuts on your typical toilet seat. The seat itself is not attached to this system. Instead, the seat has two hinges that lock onto the bolt system with a simple swivel lock on top of each one. The seat stays firmly in place. This also gives you the ability to remove the toilet seat whenever you need to clean it so you can get into the nook and crannies. And there is no exposed metal so you won't get any of that corroded look.The ""no slam"" feature definitely keeps the seat from slamming, but it also means you can't just drop the seat. You basically have to push it down all the way since there's an intentional resistance in the hinge to prevent slamming.Other than that, it's a nice contemporary design that isn't going to win any decorative awards but gives you a bit of a different look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJAC5SJ4K36X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TD4QLM#wasThisHelpful","R2NJAC5SJ4K36X","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zaine Griff's 2 eighties synthpop gems are finally available on CD...and the odd thing is, there were TWO different versions of each CD released in one year! Zaine himself offered versions through his website. BUT they are straightforward CDs of the album track listing. These Japanese imports offer much needed bonus tracks.As for comparisons, the Zaine Griff releases come in jewel cases and have simple inserts with the original album artwork. The Japanese versions come in mini LP sleeve replicas, have inner LP sleeve replicas to hold the CD, AND have fold out booklets with all the lyrics. As for mastering, quite honestly, both sets of releases sound predominantly the same to my ears. Good, crisp sound for the most part, and if you listen to them in headphones, you very well might get the same impression I do, that these may have been mastered from vinyl.

The thing is, my vinyl singles of these two tracks sound pretty much exactly the same, so the slightly lesser fidelity may very well be the actual quality of the original recordings.Track listing for Ashes and Diamonds:1  Tonight2  Run3  Ashes And Diamonds4  Secret Pleasures5  She's My Man6  Things You Say7  The Scandinavian8  Orient9  The Iron Curtain10  Ta Cigarette Apres L'Amour11  The Sentimentalists12  This Could Mean Everything13  The Haunt","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LI19EIFRJKGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ELTG2U#wasThisHelpful","R1LI19EIFRJKGI","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zaine Griff's 2 eighties synthpop gems are finally available on CD...and the odd thing is, there were TWO different versions of each CD released in one year! Zaine himself offered versions through his website. BUT they are straightforward CDs of the albums with the original track lists. These Japanese imports offer much needed bonus tracks.As for comparisons, the Zaine Griff releases come in jewel cases and have simple inserts with the original album artwork. The Japanese versions come in mini LP sleeve replicas, have inner LP sleeve replicas to hold the CD, AND have fold out booklets with all the lyrics.

Good, crisp sound for the most part, and if you listen to them in headphones, you very well might get the same impression I do, that these may have been mastered from vinyl.

"The new Funky Town Grooves edition offers not only the remixes of Dancin With Myself, but also the instrumental and dub mixes of the huge hit Just Got Paid. What you're not getting is the 7"" versions of the 2 singles. It so happens that the album version of Just Got Paid is the long version (and actually, the CD has the incorrect run time listed on the insert--it lists the 7"" time, but it is indeed the full album version). Aside from including the 7"" versions, it would have been possible to include the 7"" and 12"" versions of Johnny's song ""Birthday Suit"" from the soundtrack to the movie Sing. But even without those tracks, Funky Town Grooves as usual does an incredible job with the reissue from sound quality to the liner notes in the booklet.

"If you had the 12"" Mixes CD from years ago and were disappointed that tracks were left off, you should be happy with this 2-disc collection. All the songs from that collection are here, and then some. Do note that the longest mix of ""The Number One Song in Heaven"" on this collection (there are 2 versions) is a minute longer than on the single disc CD. Of course, the other disappointment is the exclusion of the 12"" mix of ""Music That You Can Dance To,"" which never makes these compilations because Sparks had changed labels for that release. It just seems like that's the one 12"" mix of theirs from the 80s that will never make it to CD.Track times:CD11-1  Tryouts For The Human Race (Extended Version)  7:591-2  Beat The Clock (Extended Version)  6:351-3  La Dolce Vita (Extended Version)  5:591-4  The Number One Song In Heaven (Extended Version) 8:341-5  Young Girls (Disco Version)  3:551-6  I Predict (Club Mix)  6:201-7  Modesty Plays (Extended Version)  5:181-8  Cool Places (with Jane Wiedlin)  4:38CD22-1  All You Ever Think About Is Sex (12 Inch Club Version)  5:072-2  Dance Godammit (12 Inch Club Version)  4:012-3  Progress (Vocal / Extended Club Mix)  6:152-4  Pretending To Be Drunk (Extended Version / New Mix)  5:392-5  Kiss Me Quick (Extended Version / New Mix)  5:402-6  With All My Might (Vocal Extended Club Mix)  6:402-7  Sparks In The Dark (Instrumental / Extended Club Mix)  3:572-8  Tryouts For The Human Race (12 Inch Short Version)  4:012-9  The Number One Song In Heaven (Extended Version) 5:19","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IENLGO1TYCVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EK5KKS#wasThisHelpful","R1IENLGO1TYCVV","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original mix of The Way You Love Me (included here) is a mellow, soulful disco house track, and for some reason, a majority of the remixes go with that same feel. However, Craig C takes the track to a new level, giving us a club banger that gives new life to the melody and Colton's vocals, creating what is essentially a different song. Also of interest is the Nekkid Mix, which actually gives the track a bit of an acoustic, rock feel. Very cool. As a bonus, you get the track i Know What Works for Me, a trippy house track that is NOT included on the Tug of War CD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286SZ7BRY6T7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007I6G3MI#wasThisHelpful","R286SZ7BRY6T7J","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let Me Live Again is an infectious dance track, but there's also a remix package loaded with mixes that you should get your hands on. The big deal here is the track The Music Always Get You Back.

"Annoyingly, there are TWO remix MP3 packages available of this track. The other one only has 4 tracks, including the album version (vocal and instrumental) and the straightforward extended version (vocal and instrumental). Personally, I wish they would have just scraped the other release and included the extended version on this amazing EP. There is barely a disappointing mix in the bunch.Colton's original mix gives the REM track a smooth and mellow electro house feel that's almost trance-like. The layered harmonies and changes in the melody, especially as they build at the end of the song, are stunning. And it's refreshing to have male vocalist doing a dance cover of it instead of a woman (I alone have several of those from the 90s, including Abigail and Rozalla).The M-Deep remix is one of my favorites, giving the track a bit more of a club bounce while doing the lush vocals justice.Many of the mixes treat the vocals as an afterthought. The Lost Daze mix is almost hardcore techno that takes the song in a new direction, and strips the song of Colton's harmonies and actually most of the lyrics, so it's more like a techno dub. The Paul Heron mix scraps much of the vocals and is like a funky trance mix. The Redsoul dub brings even more funk and takes out even more of Colton's vocals. The Mendy mix is sort of tribal trippy. The Fresh Mix is sort of the same, and manages to muffle the vocals. The Maurice Tamraz mix is pretty straightforward and has this in-your-face chord progression that shadows Colton's every vocal. And finally, there's the Colton-A-Pella in case you want to do a mashup or create your own remix to fit your set when spinning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HD0LSP8FFMAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FX5332#wasThisHelpful","R3HD0LSP8FFMAJ","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks to the digital age, many of Colton Ford's dance mixes have never made it to CD, only MP3 downloads. This amazing album's worth of mixes is great, however, 3 of the tracks are actually ON the CD of Under the Covers: the remixes of Follow Me, Show Me Love, and the mix of By Your Side, which is just the album version labeled as an extended mix as far as my ears can tell (it may be EQed a little bassier). Plus, if you have the CD single of That's Me, the mix of No One included here is actually on that CD single. And the remix of Losing My Religion is on the download-only remix EP of that song, so you may not need to download this entire MP3 album, just select tracks.Which leaves us with what are actually some of the best mixes on this collection. Right off the bat, I can say my absolute favorite on here is the remix of It's No Crime. This is one of those mixes that SHOULD have been featured on a White Party or Global Groove circuit CD, but for some reason, those compilations completely ignore Colton's output. This one is a club slammer and brings life to a track that I barely remember from the days when it was originally recorded by Babyface.The Dan McKie remix of Music Sounds Better With You is more of a dub that just teases Colton's vocals--it's still a refreshing change from the overplayed original track by Stardust, as is the Funky Junction mix, which is also more of a dub. Same goes for You Gonna Want Me, which is a harder, more driving take on the original club hit which, in itself, has been sampled numerous times.Your Music Is Killing Me, happily, brings back more of Colton's vocals and features a hard groove and bassline that favors the techno club feel. Hot. That feel is carried through to the remix of Lithium--banging club track and Colton totally pulls off the tone of the original vocals from the Nirvana version. Love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3LD07RCR1VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PUDD9G#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3LD07RCR1VP","A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A shame this track from the Tug of War CD didn't get a full set of remixes. This short version isn't referenced as a remix here, but it is indeed the short remix that is used for the video. It puts mainstream dance radio sounds into a track that was pretty much a tame soulful disco track on the album. The riff here will totally get stuck in your head and the chorus is infectious.

"Rearth has really outdone themselves with this case, this is a nice looking case with a great feel to it.  The rendered pictures don't do it justice...At first glance I thought the logo window was going to be cheesy looking, but in person it looks really nice and doesn't obscure the fact that you have a premium phone.The side buttons are nice feeling, but they are rubber so they have a little give to them.  The power covers are a nice addition, and if I didn't already use Bluetooth headphones and wireless charging, I'd probably cut them off to the detriment of protection against the elements.

"The adhesive wizards at Scotch/3M have really made a name for themselves with this amazing clear mounting tape.  It's super-sticky on both sides, so it holds a surprising amount of weight, but it's also pliable enough which adds a significant amount of strength.You can stick any two hard surfaces together with this stuff, be it wood, plastic, metal, glass, granite, ceramic, or your kid's head, to create a strong, long-lasting bond.I've used this stuff for mounting various set-top boxes (Such as the Amazon Fire TV) to the backs or a Wii Sensor Bar to the top of TVs, added signs to doors, and affixed various hooks and mounts to windows.  You'll probably find plenty of uses for this stuff, so you won't regret buying the big roll.However, I would NOT advise using this on painted walls or drywall, because while you can try to jam a putty knife or other stiff flat surface in to remove, you'll more than likely pull up a layer of sheetrock along with it, leaving behind fine divet.  I thought I was crafty in mounting some surround speakers to the wall with this stuff, but the granular nature of sheetrock made the bond weak, so word to the wise.For walls, you can't beat the other 3M masterpiece, the Command strips for lightweight items, and just use proper anchors and screws for heavier items.Knowing that, however, this is still my favorite adhesive product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROAB8FIW12LPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BL2REK#wasThisHelpful","ROAB8FIW12LPO","A1ANLTTDNI5H9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ANLTTDNI5H9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The USB ports charge my devices as expected.The whole unit is very lightweight, and is thinner than it looks, which makes me wonder how long it will last, but I'm not terribly worried about it.I mounted the power strip on the wall next to my office desk for all the plugging and unplugging that I find myself doing from time to time, and it suits my needs perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O65W8QBORNRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00870D47G#wasThisHelpful","R1O65W8QBORNRA","A1ANLTTDNI5H9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ANLTTDNI5H9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since I was a kid, I enjoyed the taste, feel, and even the sound of drinking water out of a glass Mason jar.  It's the simple things in life, right?So when Starbuck's came out with their 16oz glass water bottles, I immediately bought one, and started enjoying water from it on the go...Now, I can be a thirsty Sherpa, so 16oz would have me refilling way too often, so I found the Takeya 22oz water bottle and immediately ordered one.Amazon Prime delivered my new drinking bottle in very protective packaging; I immediately noticed the smell exuded by the silicone sleeve that encases the spacious 22oz bottle, so I threw it in the dishwasher and let it run through a cycle...the smell didn't go away, so I washed and scrubbed the sleeve, removing it and washing both sides.  No matter what I did, the smell would not go away.A few weeks later, I am still drinking out of the bottle, and the smell is still present, but not nearly as bad.  It's a shame, because other than that smell I love everything about this bottle.I'm getting used to it, but I just wish that there was no odor at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TT0VXQIHVN4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DTLO14#wasThisHelpful","R1TT0VXQIHVN4Z","A1ANLTTDNI5H9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ANLTTDNI5H9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Scosche reVIVE II - Dual USB Car Charger for Samsung Galaxy Tablet (GUSBC3) was a godsend for any one who needs to charge multiple smartphones while on the road, but it was so huge and stuck out so far; I also found that it was very easy to easily knock out of the power socket.

"Thinking of getting a nice faux leather case for your Google Nexus 7?  Well allow me to posit the following summary of events:Imagine it's a nice sunny afternoon, and you've got a nice, icy cool glass of homemade lemonade.  You decide to take your IVSO Slim Faux Leather Keyboard Case with your brand new Google Nexus 7 out to the deck for to compose a few emails, a little web surfing, and maybe to play a game or two.  You set down your lemonade and open up the case, start typing away...it's awkward and cumbersome, and you aren't sure if you can power through it.But that's the least of your worries, because you've just spilled your lemonade on yourself.  The sugary-sour daisy-colored liquid becomes sticky and uncomfortable as it attempts to fuse your clothes to your skin.  The lemon-scented goodness begins to permeate and attract a small swarm of yellow jackets begin to move in around you, buzzing and bouncing around against your skin, needling you with their pointy little feet and stingers.  Filled with panic, you stand up suddenly, which triggers the ""fight"" response of the bees, and they attack full force, stinging every bit of your exposed skin.  As your upper torso is met with a barrage of tiny stingers piercing your flesh, you realize that your legs had fallen asleep as you were sitting in the flimsy plastic chair, and they immediately become gelatin, causing you to hurtle towards your insufficiently attached deck railing.As the weight of your healthy adult body is afforded no resistance as it drifts effortlessly through the pressure-treated railing that the contractor assured you was perfectly secure (even though it felt shoddy and wobbly), you can feel gravity take hold of you and pull you towards the Earth several feet below.  Your instincts to feebly prevent injury by putting your hands out in front of you as you fell were met with a thud, several crunches, and then another thud as the rest of your body lands haplessly on the fallen deck railing in your backyard.  You are given a slight relief from the pain as the adrenaline courses through your veins, until the angry yellow jackets catch up with your now-mangled body, angrier than ever.  Your left leg has now fully gained circulation, but the deck railing has splintered, and that sharp stake has punctured straight through your thigh.  Your throat is dry, because you never even got one sip of that delicious lemonade, so you can't even call for help, though you wouldn't be able to anyways, because your lungs are filling up with fluid.After what seems to be a millenium, the gasping, the constant boring of yellow jacket stingers, the broken bones, the throbbing of chemical-treated wood wrapped in muscle tissue, and the dull pain of internal bleeding begin to fade as your internal organs start to shut down, your heart slows, your vision fades, and your mind starts to submit to the influence of dimethyltryptamine.As you struggle to will your own eyelids to close before you walk into the light, one very blissful thought crosses your mind: ""At least this is better than using the IVSO Slim Faux Leather Keyboard Case.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDEL2RAH0CFCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QJXPGS#wasThisHelpful","RDEL2RAH0CFCO","A1ANLTTDNI5H9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ANLTTDNI5H9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are plenty of reviews here that are spot-on, so I will try not to duplicate their efforts.  Basically, spend some extra money for an SSD that's no more than 7mm thick, and CL11 RAM.The first thing I did when I received my Zenbook Prime was break out my trusty DVD-Writer and launch the AI Recovery Burner software and create the recovery discs.  I then swapped the old spinning rust and RAM modules, and proceeded to restore the installation from those DVDs.Some ""power users"" would complain that this would give you an installation rife with awful Asus bloatware; to which I counter that it's much easier to uninstall the cruft you don't want (*ahem* McAfee) than to hunt down 37 drivers and programs required to operate this machine's various hotkeys and other features.  As a result, I have had very few issues that many people have had with the fan noise and WiFi controls.  For me, the Asus Facelogon works well, and I find the on-screen display to be visually appealing.I've also had no issues with backlight bleed, uneven frame, or keyboard flex.  The Prime gets quite warm, but that's because it's an nVidia GPU and Core i7 all wrapped in a diminutive aluminum frame.  The display has fantastic contrast and resolution, the backlit keyboard feels as nice as the Apple Aluminum chiclet keyboard, and overall system responsiveness is without delay.  I am not a heavy gamer, but I do enjoy a round of Painkiller and Portal 2 every once in awhile, and while not the most demanding games, I can play them on my Zenbook Prime at full resolution and effects turned on with no issue.I mostly use my laptop for audio production, and the built-in ""Bang & Olufsen ICEpower"" audio really is nothing more than a Realtek HD Audio chip with a little nicer pre-amp on the speakers and headphone jack (which accepts 3-striped cellphone style headphones with microphones built-in).  It does an admirable job and doesn't choke the CPU too much.My only outstanding issues with my Zenbook Prime is the trackpad; while it works very well with the latest Elantech drivers (not the newer Asus SmartGesture drivers), the drivers can't fix the louder-than-normal clicking.  Also, the keyboard subtracts several keys (volume, multimedia, pgup/pgdn, etc) and supplements them  with Fn key combinations; which is pretty sorry for some basic navigation keys.All in all, for my needs, the Zenbook Prime is a fantastic notebook, and with a few upgrades, it's nearly perfect and a good $800 less than a Retina Display Macbook Pro.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSMUXZ601IOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00863L2MS#wasThisHelpful","R2GSMUXZ601IOE","A1ANLTTDNI5H9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ANLTTDNI5H9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The price is right and seller shipped the case to me quickly.  It looks fantastic on my Marble White Samsung Galaxy S3 and the color is very much like a Kelly Green color, the exact color i was hoping for.The case has a ring that snaps off and surrounds the front of the phone, so putting it on was easy enough to do.  It feels sturdy, but the case is actually a white plastic job with the color painted on, so I worry a bit about the longevity if its looks.  It feels very nice in the hand and the texture the paint gives the case is satisfying enough, it looks like a premium case.It's a little thicker than I was hoping for, but not terribly so, and I still have no problems putting my phone in Arkon Universal Removable Swivel Air Vent Mount with Mega Grip Holder for iPhone, HTC EVO 4G, HD2, Droid Incredible, Droid X, and Galaxy S, however I have found some larger headphone jacks are impeded by the surrounding plastic on this case.All in all, it's dirt cheap and looks great.  Buy 10.Update: Maybe I should have followed my own advice and bought 10 of these, because one fatal flaw with this case is that if you take it off, you've pretty much ruined it...I've tried other cases, and always come back to this one, but I have to keep buying new ones because I broke the previous one taking it off...you'd think I'd learn?","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQMV6OBFGZA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AKMGMC#wasThisHelpful","RIQMV6OBFGZA8","A1ANLTTDNI5H9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ANLTTDNI5H9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well that was a fun! Loved the characters (even if I wanted to give a couple shakes), the setting (even though...nature! and, hello, that freaks me out!) and the romance as the hero tries to up his curb appeal (he's a politician) with the public by going on a back-to-nature adventure.High on sexual tension with just a little bit of actual heat happening.

"Sweet, spirited  full of saucy adventure. Jeffries, Hawkins, Camp & Duran charmed with a lovely Christmas anthology. I love Christmas stories. There's something so warm and cozy about them and the four novellas in What Happened Under the Mistletoe hit just the right spot.

"Single mama v. scummy ex's best friend. Who adores her daughter too. Pajama parties. Amazing families. And the feels. All the feels. #LovelyRomance #BringOnTheSwoonOlivia Miles' books always give my heart a little squeeze. Beautiful and touching. Hope Springs on Main Street was the perfect read for a Fall afternoon and a lovely second chance romance as childhood friends finally realize they may have been meant for more.The quick of it is that Jane's ex-husband is a complete jackhole and Jane is trying to move on and keep it together now that she's a single mom. And her life has just gotten even more complicated when the scummy ex's best friend comes back to town to deal with his own demons and despite calling it quits on the male population sparks start to fly...Jane and Henry were wonderful. They're good people and both a bit gun shy after suffering through divorces. Jane's was very recent and dealing with her ex is a daily battle. I seriously wanted to just scoop her up and give her a big ol' hug. And beat the hell out of the ex. He made me...have #rageface. Jane though. Gah! a single mama and fighting hard to give her little girl a good life and stability in the face of so much change. And Henry. Oh heavens. Henry was gorgeous and kind and exactly what Jane and her little girl needed in their life. A man who was good down to his toes despite the demons from his childhood he was still fighting.guys with kids, sexy men,There's not much in the way of heat other than a little kissing and heavy petting. Everything else is behind closed doors. But the slowly growing connection between them was lovely and sweet and had me sighing a number of times.I loved how much they cared for their families and friends. That connection and love was heartwarming and made the story even more special. And how Henry was with her little girl. It all just got me right....there. Ya know?It's not all fluffy though. There are some heard things both Jane and Henry deal with. The devastation of a marriage ending, with friends caught in the middle of the split, with old gossip and painful past memories and stigmas. It was heartwrenching watching them deal with their demons but wonderful seeing their inner strengths (even when they couldn't see them).All in all, Hope Springs on Main Street gave me all the feels. Miles has a beautiful way about her writing and of showing hope, strength and love triumphing over all. She's one not to miss!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23O0TIHGXULG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76YW#wasThisHelpful","R23O0TIHGXULG4","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Come on sexeh times. totally not my thing to see a guy kneel but omg, gib. GET ON THOSE KNEES! Let her do all kinds of dirty things to you. Or make you do them to her. #ResistanceIsFutileoh my word. Sometimes men are just such...men. *slowly closes eyes* someone ::cough, gibs, cough:: is so gonna pay for a very very bad call. bless your heart. this romance is not smooth sailing.I am freaking LOVING this heroine though.

She made air quotes. ""'A <insert PC word... kitty>.' Which, by the way, pisses me off even more because I have one of those. And they're spectacular. And being called one shouldn't be some ultimate insult.""amen! you tell em, girl!whew boy! this heroine can totally pull off the Domme attitude. holy cow.

Everything's good. A little prostrate massage while chatting with the boys is not a big deal at all.*Hrms. I'd need to convince myself on that too. I don't know how cool I'd be with chit chatting in my kitchen while rocking a c--- ring and a vibrating plug up my bum while waiting for the fixing of things to begin. I mean. Seriously.

"Ahhh Shannon Stacey. She's long been a favorite of mine and with this new series won me over all over again with a heart warming story of survival and hope. The quick of it is that Alex has come home to do what he does best...tell a story with photos. And this small town that's trying to save itself is one he needs to tell.  It speaks to him. Just like the woman he's rented a room from for his stay...So. 5 things about Defending Hearts>>>I loved the hero and heroine. Gretchen has had a hard life and she keeps her emotions tightly under wraps. She's a hard worker, self sufficient and a spot prickely but only because she really doesn't want to be hurt. And Alex. He's sexy and fun and I loved watching him settle into farm life even though it was so far from his usual globe trotting lifestyle. They were wonderful together. The chemistry was delightful and yum when things heat up it's nice (though not tooooo much).>>>I liked their careers too! You don't see pumpkin farmers too often in romances. lol Especially when it's the HEROINE who is the farmer! The hero was a photojournalist which was neat to see as well.>>>Cocoa! The cutest pup is in this book. She's wild and crazy and loves her people and she gives high fives obsessively. She was so dang adorable and I loved that the three main characters (hero, heroine and her gram) all doted and indulged her. Totally had me falling for each of them.>>>The small town. One of the things I love about this series is the feeling of hope. This town is broken. The Mill closed up and most of the families have been struggling and fiercely. But there's still a hope in them. Things are slowly turning around. They're fighters and doing everything they can to roll with the punches and survive. I love that about them. Seeing small bits of hope shining through. Families finding their feet again. The heroine and her gram's hard work and how they get through the day together. It's just touching.>>>The one thing that bothers me about the series is the covers. Yes. It's something I kind of harp on but these covers do not match the series. They scream New Adult and sports romance. Neither of which the series is. The characters are in their 30s and the only connection to sports is that the guys played together in high school and in book one the town came together to rally behind the current high school football team. But the actual heroes and heroines? So far a police officer (heroine 1), construction owner (hero 1), photojournalist (hero 2), pumpkin farmer (heroine 2) and in book three the heroine is a teacher (not sure what hero 3 is). The covers just do not fit.All in all, Defending Hearts stole mine completely. Stacey has created an incredibly touching and heart warming series that doesn't shy away from the realities of life but leaves you hopeful and completely smitten.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWCQDN88ZTM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028JK#wasThisHelpful","R3DWCQDN88ZTM9","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cocky, arrogant, snarky, blood-thirsty bastards! Gah, how I missed them! Dragon on Top was everything I love about the Dragon Kin. Action, adventure, some good lovin' and all with a gloriously snarky bite.The quick of it is that Bram needs to visit another dragon sect to get a stack of paper signed and his queen has decided he needs a keeper for his trip and has tasked Ghlenna--one of her Captains--with making sure he gets there and back with all scales intact. Only problem? He's been totally in love with her since they were kids and she...pretty much has no idea he even exists. lolSoooo. Bram--the peacekeeper-- and Ghlenna--the warrior dragon who has 300+ men under her command. Ahhh I loved them! They had fabulous banter, chemistry and were just fun together as they griped and flirted and dealt with their rulers, families and traveling across the country in both dragon and human form. They were hot together and so damn funny. Had some rocking sexy happening too.I loved how different they were on the outside. She's a total warrior. Battle scarred, deadly, a bit rough around the edges and he's all about the books, trying to facilitate peace between all of the dragon clans, and getting lost in the world of words. They're both crazy dedicated and easily get caught up in what they're doing so really they were pretty perfect for each other.All in all, Dragon On Top was a dragony-licious treat! It's a quick read but so fun to go along as Bram and Ghlenna and their group traveled about, gave each other hell, kick some dragon ass and a smitten dragon found his mate and finally got her to see him.*this one was previously released in an anthology and just now releasing on it's own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AL07VM8PQBFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE6PH9K#wasThisHelpful","R3AL07VM8PQBFK","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this and couldn't resist. I love history. I love design. And a book exploring both as it looked into American Whiskey and it's labeling over the decades sounded so interesting to me.And it was! I was expecting the focus to just but on the labels different distilleries have used over time but it had quite a bit of history included as well. While Rothbaum doesn't have the most lively writing voice the subject matter kept my attention.It was done in sections by decade(s) with a spot of history to open each chapter explaining life at the time, what the industry had been facing and similar then it dove into labels from those years with photos and brief little captions with each and then to close out each section there were a couple cocktails created or enjoyed during those years.I loved the artwork and photos included. Both labels and black and white historical photos. They're not all crisp but that's to be expected. It was neat seeing labels change over the years. Seeing the designs and how world events and laws influenced the industry and it's art. Why there are lower proofs now days. What they did to survive Prohibition and becoming a ""medical"" whiskey. They've struggled something fierce since the late 1800s. Prohibition, The Great Depression, Wars, etc. It's an industry with an incredibly rocky past and that's been hit hard time and time again with many having to close doors because of it but that's resilient as hell.

"Hot dayum! Hot Holiday Nights brought the heat! Best way to spend Christmas vacation? A hot holiday fling with one very sexy younger man. How to make it even better? Add his older best friend into the mix.Whew, boy! I was expecting hot, sexy, fun romance with a little Christmas spirit. I was NOT expecting a menage. <yes, yes, non blurb reading struck again lol> But oh it was a nice little treat that rocked so many of my favoritest things. Sports, Christmas, menage, sexy heroes and a strong heroine spending time in an exotic locale. Oh yeah. I was a happy happy reader-girl watching Victoria snag herself a couple hunky surfers during her holiday getaway to Hawaii.I really loved all of the characters. Victoria is no non-sense sports agent, confident and knows what she wants. Alex, a younger surfer at the top of his game (and a total stud) that's full of life and energy an charm. And Ben, a sports sponsor who's grounded and has that refined sexy older gent thing happening. They all fit nicely together. Had easy repertoire and dynamic chemistry. I loved how they fell into their romance. Spending days at a surf competition where Alex was competing and evenings rocking the sheets. Things definitely get hot and heavy with a nice little menage going on. Yum! But the romance wasn't skimped on much to my delight.All in all, Hot Holiday Nights was one sexy Christmas fling. It's a light read and perfect for warming up a chilly winter day. It works fine as a stand alone for those who haven't read in the series :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KJBS99TPEU5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013D6629A#wasThisHelpful","R1KJBS99TPEU5T","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh wow! Clare delivered a spectacular romance that had me completely invested and rooting so hard for these two to find love, passion and healing. I was expecting a fun light hearted read. A little fluffy sexy romp. And I totally got some of that--yay! But there was so much more, too, as Sebastian and Chelsea become each other's safety dates to survive the ordeal of a friend's wedding and found so more than either was looking for or ever expected.man candy, hot guys, men in suits, sexy menThe quick of it is that Sebastian and Chelsea have been paired up as bridesmaid and groomsman for a wedding they're both attending. And it's a BIG wedding with a year of events leading up to it and lord help em it's gonna crack em. Everyone is in match making mode and these two...NOT on board with it. So...they strike up a deal. They're gonna be each other's ""Safety Dates"" and pretend they're a thing so people will get...off...their...backs.These two. Yall. Gah they about did me in. I adored them both down to their toes! Chelsea is a cheerful roller derby badass that's hiding some deep down fears and she just made me ache. I loved everything about her and how strong she was even if SHE couldn't see her own strength. She was fun, sweet, broken, a survivor and a fighter. And Sebastian. This guy. He's what all men should be. He may be a little aimless in life but he's such a good man and was amazing with Chelsea and being there for her when she desperately needed someone to help her find peace.This one does have some triggery issues. Chelsea was raped years earlier and she's still very much dealing with the trauma and fear. It's hard to watch her terror when it overtakes her, see her struggling with being intimate with someone again, healing and falling in love. But it was also amazing seeing her work through things with Sebastian. Seeing him with her and how much he cherished her and was there for her no matter how ""broken"" she felt.The Billionaire Takes a Bride was just a lovely story. Beautiful, heartbreaking, full of hope and sweetness. Clare simply wowed. I enjoyed every second of these two as they dealt with family, friends, their lives unexpectedly changing and all of the wonderful things that brought them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYPY6DNCP7KUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV124TO#wasThisHelpful","RYPY6DNCP7KUH","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy freaking sizzler! Wild Ride was a scorcher! *giddy squee* Whew boy! Cathryn Fox upped the heat in the most delicious way with Wild Ride as two childhood friends get a hedonistic weekend away to explore a delightfully explicit list of fantasies and see if maybe they were always meant to be together.I loved these two. They knew each other back in high school and though they both kinda had a thing for each other never let on and missed opportunities and all that. Buuuuut now all these years later Tyler and his buddies are trying to make that right by inviting the ""girls that got away"" to spend an entire week on their Dude Ranch to see if maybe, just maybe, the sparks are still there.They were fun, sexy and had fabulous chemistry together. He's a bit wild, she's a bit shy, she centers him, he gives her the opportunity to get a little crazy and try all the things she's fantasized about over the years. They were just a tasty delicious pairing.Alright. So. I was NOT expecting this one to be as hot as it was. Book one was hot but Wild Ride was a whole other level. It's definitely in the erotic romance category and holy cow it will make. you. squirm. There's a little dominance/submission happening, a little kink, a bit of a menage with one of his buddies (though it's a m/f romance) and some back door action. It was all so very shiver-worthy. The excitement and passion flew off the pages and was just gloriously sinful.There were sweet moments too as they got to know each other, spent a little time doing the things each other loved most--him spending time with his horse and on the ranch and her with yoga (she totally gave him lessons). They were pretty adorable together.All in all, Wild Ride was one helluva quickie and seriously satisfying! Fox brought a delicious romance full of heat, humor and heart. Bring on book 3!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QDBN13N1NUE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151VLBQY#wasThisHelpful","R2QDBN13N1NUE1","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simply sweet. The Widows Choice was an easy read with lovely characters finding their hope, love and a place to call home.The quick of it is that Rafe and his best friend are moving north from Texas to Montana in search of a new start and they find a lovely widow struggling to keep her large ranch afloat. They're in need of work, she's in need of labor and they're hired on.I really loved the characters. Rafe and Charlotte, his best friend and her sister-in-law as well as an elderly ranch foreman. They're likable, hardworking, brave and felt like family. The romance was slow moving--she's slow to trust and he's putting everything he has into learning to ranch. I liked them together though and that it wasn't a speedy thing but took weeks. There's a nice spot of tension and a tiny little bit of heat to go with it.Things did go a bit dark for a spell as they deal with a crazy neighbor set on owning everything that's Charlottes. I was a bit surprised with how dark things went in an otherwise light read.My only problem was with the editing. There were a number of blips during the novella that could be a little distracting after a while.All in all, The Widows Choice was a lovely read that left me smiling and ready for more from this small Montana town.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3UTNDE7TGTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010123JL8#wasThisHelpful","R1H3UTNDE7TGTS","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A rip roaring good time! ::snort:: I couldn't help it! Roar...tigers...impossible to resist! A Tiger's Bride was delightfully silly and a total hero throwback to romances of yore with their unrepentant alpha males as Dmitri spots the lioness he wants, kinda (totally!) kidnaps her, marries her without her realizing and whisks her away to his mother land landing himself in all kinds of exhilarating danger when he and his seriously accident prone lioness go from hunters to huntees--forced to outrun an unknown attacker out to get them. Whew! Hilarity ensues!So. This one is just good silly fun. Dmitri is a total cocky alpha male of the feline variety. Think chest beating, taking what he wants, growling. And damn him he makes you giddy over it all. He's determined to find his perfect mate. Her requirements? Wide hips and lion status. He wants him some super babies and he's gonna get those tiger-lion cubs. Teena...gonna have to get on board. lol Teena was a trip all her own. She's the ""good"" twin and always been considered fragile but the lioness inside her is ready to break out and show every one just what she's capable of and so she does.I had a lot of fun with them both. Their romance is a spot twisted and kidnapper-ish but, you know, it worked for them. They're feline shifters. They're supposed to be a bit twisted and crazy, right? lol It was fun watching them get past that and kinda actually like each other. Dealing with all the crazy being thrown at them and surviving because of each other as they make it back to his home. It's make-you-snort funny with a big dose of quirkiness thrown into the mix. It worked fine as a stand alone (yeah I'm a bad reader girl and skipped books 1-3) but might be more fun having read the earlier ones and seen Dmitri in those. Sounds like he'd had quite the adventures before snagging him his Teena.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FKEMUJ7C52C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PVYITQ#wasThisHelpful","R31FKEMUJ7C52C","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A little Regency with a side of woo-woo? Yes, please! Romance, intrigue, characters with unique...abilities. A madman and a courtesan. A threat against the crown, blackmail and a race against the clock. The Madness of Lord Westfall was a tantalizing treat that was impossible to resist. Marlowe definitely delivered.The quick of it is that Pierce and his group have been tasked with finding those behind a nefarious scheme against the crown. Something that brings a courtesan into their mists. One Pierce must get close to in order to find out what she knows and put an end to the threat against the prince.I enjoyed the heck out of Pierce and Nora--the madman who could hear voices and the Lady turned courtesan. I always enjoy characters that are deemed a spot ""mad"" and I tend to have a soft spot for courtesans so these two definitely had my attention. I liked them too. They were good people who were freaking survivors. Life hadn't been easy for either of them but they fought and were just amazing people despite it. They were good together too. Had lovely chemistry and banter and had me smiling.While I did feel like I'd walked in mid-series (turns out this was book two oops!) it passed quickly and I was easily pulled in by this group of agents that all have interesting abilities--hearing thoughts, sending thoughts, control of fire or water or soul skipping and use them to keep country safe. I was constantly finding a minute here or there to read and spend time with them. I love that feeling. The suspense and watching them piece things together and use their talents kept me reading late into the night.The Madness of Lord Westfall was a quick read full of interesting characters, depth and a couple surprises along the way. Risk, danger, love, forgiveness and finding peace. It was a lovely story that had some grit and sparked my curiosity about everyone else on the team.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK75JJW9RS12M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CR0R7M#wasThisHelpful","RK75JJW9RS12M","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Murray writes it...I'm gonna read it. Damn, she's good! Sexy as hell hero, incredible heroine, the excitement of the game, a luscious romance and real life struggles...everything about Takes Two to Tackle was irresistible and captivating.The quick of it is that Stephen has a problem. He's just gotten back from rehab and is on pretty thin ice with his sports team. It's his last chance to prove he's clean, sober and can handle his job. In a moment of panic--to prove he has the support he needs--homeboy claims he has a girlfriend. *hangs head* He so doesn't. Not even a tiny little bit. And off he goes to try to convince his cleaning lady to move in, pretend they're a thing and help him keep his life in order. Whew!These two were something else. And that was most definitely a good thing. Margaret's blunt and sassy. Honest, hard working and totally solid. Says what she's thinking and doesn't let him get away with any of his s***. And Stephen's a total guy. Rough around the edges sometimes, crazy sexy and with an incredible heart.The chemistry was amazing. They just had that snappy zing between them that made watching them together so dang fun! It took a little while for things to fully heat up but even before that they were just good together. Made me smile, gave me those warm fuzzies and had me cheering them on.It wasn't always an easy read. There's lots of fun and sexy but addiction and alcoholism played a big part in the story. And I liked that. Some parts weren't pretty as Stephen tried to get control of his life again. But it was real and moving watching both his struggles and how his friends reacted to him. The support they provided, the ass kickings when he needed them, etc. It was incredibly well done.All in all, an amazing addition to the series. Murray tackled a difficult subject with Takes Two to Tackle and did so with class, heart and love. Adding in some fan-yourself-sexy and her trademark humor made it an even more delicious ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT0J0PBW1O6BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZS1U#wasThisHelpful","RT0J0PBW1O6BT","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Addictive! Sorenson has me hooked! Shooting Dirty was sexy, edgy and thrilling to the last page.The quick of it is that Janelle and Ace have an, erm, complicated past seeing how months earlier he kidnapped her, held her hostage and kinda shot her ex. Yeah. *big ol' owly eyes* And now he's trying to make up for all the s*** he's done, win her over and deal with two battling MCs intent on pulling him into their dangerous rivalries.This one was crazy interesting to me. It's an MC romance but the hero, Ace?...not in an MC. He left his and became an outcast and is getting clean. I've never seen that done in an MC romance before but I freaking loved it. He wants to be on the straight and narrow for his daughter. It was unique and interesting exploring a different facet.  Seeing how hard he wanted out but how deep the ties could twist.Alright, so, these two. Janelle is a survivor through and through. Been through horrible things in her past, raising her near teenage son on her own--yup they both had kids, trying to get a better life for them no matter what she has to do. Stripping included. She was easy to like and I definitely felt for her and her battles.Ace was blunt, maybe a little crass and had a cold edge to him. He's a former hitman and done a lot of bad s*** in his years. But he had a gentlemanly thread in him too that was pretty irresistible. Plus seeing how gaga he was over his daughter...total swoony hero material.The heat...hot damn! Intense, passionate, edgy. They had just a smidge of dominant/submissive tendencies that were fan-yourself-good. funny now and again too. This one has a lot of heat to it. Nothing too extreme but high on shiver-worthy action.The action...nice! They're caught between two rival clubs--his former MC and one that's trying to use him against it. Manipulations, attacks, edge of your seat action. Totally made my palms sweat.All in all, Shooting Dirty was sexy, gritty, make-a-girl-pant goodness. From the romance to the setting and characters Sorenson totally nailed it.

"The Wilde brothers are impossible to resist! Hot romance, sexy men and pulse pounding danger. I gobbled up Wilde at Heart and the luscious romantic whirlwind that was Reece and Shelby.The quick of it is that Reece--who is all about order, precision and simplicity-- can't seem to get over his attraction to his soon to be sister-in-law Shelby--who is colorful, wild and chaos personified-- and when arson, blackmail and danger threaten both of them they do the only thing they can think of...join forces, get hitched and ride out the storm until they can figure out who is behind all of the attacks coming their way.I adored Shelby. She's a bit of a wild child. I loved her passion, vibrancy and spirit. And my heart just ached for her. No matter what she does everyone always seems disappointed in her. She's never really had someone in her corner and gah that just killed me seeing her struggle with not feeling good enough or loved by the people most important in her life. And, man, I wanted to pound on some people for giving her hell.Including Reece. Who totally won me over but had some choice moments of needing to hand over his balls for being a jerk to his girl. He's a little geeky, a little socially awkward with women, a workaholic but loyal to his brothers and everything he does is to keep them safe and secure. Hard not to love him too. Even with the assery moments now and again. And he definitely made up for them in the end.I really did like these two together.  At a glance they're exact opposites but really they're so similar in that they're don't quite fit in with anyone else. They have secret layers and parts of themselves they keep hidden. It was nice seeing them come together and bring a little balance to each other's extreme natures. He kept her more centered, she helped him loosen up a little from his OCD ways. They were just a great match. And, whew, when things come together they're hot and explosive! A little surprising too but that's something you'll have to read for yourself <g>The suspense was interesting. Things were coming at these two like you wouldn't believe. Attacks against her business, arson, some shady s.o.b blackmailing them over some naughty moments they spent together. It was well done and kept me curious until the end. It managed to keep me guessing too which I always love.My only complaints were small ones but kept it from a solid four. Lack of capitalizing Marines (which hopefully was caught in editing but no idea), disappointment in some of the previous heroes and heroines who had parts in this one and did make up for it in the end but had me growly over how they treated the heroine and some nickname usage that just didn't work for me personally. Little things really in the overall scheme of things.All in all, Wilde at Heart was a delicious return to the Wilde brothers and once again they gave me all the warm tingles that have me craving more. Burrows writes some very tasty males and I can't wait to see how things pan out for the last two Wilde brothers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYK0SSDBU9NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P2QYQI#wasThisHelpful","RFYK0SSDBU9NS","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm...I'm just gonna need a minute here. Whew boy! *fans self* lolA Cowboy Firefighter for Christmas was a sweet holiday romance full of spirit, heart and quirky small town charm! I had a good time with this one. It was an easy read as Trey and the citizens of Wildcat Bluff gear up to celebrate Christmas, battle fires threatening their lands and welcome a curious outsider into their midst.firefighter, shirtless, man candy, sexyI really enjoyed the characters. Trey--the aforementioned cowboy firefighter cat lover-- and Misty--who just arrived to town and was immediately pulled into the chaos and festivities. They were fun, easy to like and just good people.  A little corny now and again (and not quite as funny as they thought they were) but entertaining as they danced around each other, flirted, saved kittens and tried to figure who was intentionally harassing the town by starting fires. They were good together, had some nice chemistry and just a tiny bit of heat. Seriously, yall. I was wanting some hot and steamy cowboy firefighter lovin mmhmm but it turned out to be pretty dang light and brief. *sniffles* There was some good lead up but actual deed...total quickies page-wise. It was still fun watching them fall in love and get to know each other though.The town itself was fabulous and quirky. They're all smitten with cats and totally pamper them. From personal pets to barn cats. Cats are KING in Wildcat Bluff. Woohoo! Gotta love that. It was fun getting to know all of the side characters and seeing how much they cared for each other. They've got spirit and charm in spades. Definitely looking forward to more from them.The suspense of who was starting fires all over the place was pretty predictable and writing-wise this one did feel like a first novel. A little rough in spots, overly detailed in others and that sort of thing.All in all, though, A Cowboy Firefighter for Christmas was sweet and heartwarming. A charming town full of Christmas spirit and all the good things in life. I'd totally live there and hang out with these people.

"Sultry suspense! Pulse pounding passion twined with edgy suspense. Wicked for You was one seriously hot, heavy and exciting ride!The quick of it is that years ago Mystery was kidnapped and during a harrowing journey to safety she managed to get herself all hung up on the man who saved her life. (seriously can't blame a girl because Axel...dayum!) Anyways. Once his job was over they went their separate ways and for years the thoughts of him have driven her crazy and she's ready to do something about it. She's gonna hunt him down and see what he can do between the sheets. *noms* Too bad that quickie fling is soon interrupted by bad guys out to finish what they started all those years ago. Mmhm. No worries though. Hot hunky hero...ready to defend the woman who's haunted his thoughts all these years too.sexy, alpha male, jeans, hot guys, man candyThese two sizzled! Axel is ALL Dom and one hella sexy alpha male. Totally lickable and hands down a hero to his very soul. He's got that dark little edge of being a Dom but is incredibly caring and gentle too. Yums all around, people. Yums all around. And Mystery. She had me wanting to pinch her a couple times but overall chickie was damn impressive. When life got hellish she persevered and fought to survive. She's no wilting flower. Hallelujah!Now the heat. *sucks in a breath* Oh yeah. The heat was excellent. Make a girl gasp and all kinds of lovely places tingle. From the second they met 6 years earlier they just had that zing that was so delicious to watch. Even when surrounded by danger they had a connection that just radiated between them.Whew! Hot, heavy and utterly swoon-worthy.The suspense was really nicely done too. Just enough to have you curious and keep things interesting. I didn't figure things out until nearly the end which...love when that happens. It was exciting and nerve wracking and kept me enthralled.All in all, a fine read from Black. If you love some wicked heat with your suspense this is a series not to miss.

"Oh how delicious! Tall, Dark and Wicked was an absolute treat! Sexy, fun and just a little bit wicked too.The quick of it is that Padua's father has been carted off to prison--charges unknown--and in desperate need of help in saving his life she seeks out a man known for his talents in the courtroom. Only to find out that the man she'd hoped to have on her side is the enemy himself and the man charged with prosecuting her father. Dum..dum..dum!!!!!! Even worse...he's gorgeous, sexy and completely intriguing and those feelings aren't one sided. Oh yeah. All in all...trouble for both of them.Ives and Padua were both fantastic characters and so well matched (even if not socially so--he's the son of a duke). She's no dainty flower and spoke her mind, had a powerful will and wasn't afraid to show her intelligence. And Ives. He's a good man that may be a little bit wicked in his down time but when it came to justice and finding the truth wasn't one to shirk his responsibilities. They had the chemistry, the respect between them and definitely the heat. It was fun watching them deal with their desires and getting to know each other. Dealing with the legal side of things that kept them on opposing teams (even if they didn't want to be). And eventually working together.The storyline with her father was nicely done. While it wasn't action packed there was a slight bit of danger and mystery in not knowing exactly what her father was charged with and who was behind using him for sinister means. Hunter had me just as exasperated and frustrated as the characters as they sought out the truth. Love when that happens.All in all, Tall, Dark and Wicked kept me turning the pages late into the night and seriously wanting to give the hero a good lick. <looks around innocently> With fantastic characters, a lovely romance and wonderful support in the form of his brothers I'm definitely excited to see how this trilogy will end.

"Sinfully Yours was what I would call an easy read. Easy to get into with an easy plot and romance and likable characters. It was one of those books that just rolled along--and I don't mean that in a bad way. It was a delightful escape for a lazy afternoon or a stressful day when I needed something simple and that would soothe and leave me content. A light read with a little humor and intrigue, some nice sexual tension and a little heat. It was a spot predictable in some ways but, again, sometimes you just need that easy read.I enjoyed both characters. Anna  and Devlin were a great match. Both more than they seem on the outside, a little combative when it came to each other, sharp of wit and opinion. It was fun seeing them wind up at a Scottish house party for a month. Forced to deal with each other, feel the tendrils of temptation and eventually join forces to figure out who was conspiring against one of the royal guests.The intrigue was rather predictable. There weren't any major twists or surprises for me on who was behind the plot against the Prince but I enjoyed watching Anna and Devlin figure it out bit by bit as they got closer together. The romance moved along slowly and I liked that. More them getting to know each other and the sharpness of their interactions softening. They definitely had some fire between them which is always fun. There's a bit of heat but it's not the focus. It's more them working together and uncovering each others secrets. I did think it made a bit too much of a jump there at the end to LOVE but I still liked them together.Overall, enjoyable. I'll definitely be reading book three. The teasers throughout for the next book storyline were fun to watch happen :) Elliott has a lovely, easy way about her books that just pulls me in and makes for a delightfully relaxing time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PX9PLI7J96VR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455573248#wasThisHelpful","R2PX9PLI7J96VR","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love me some Master Z and the Shadowlands. Mmmm. If there was ever something that could tempt me into actually moving back to Florida it would be Club Shadowlands and the luscious, swoonworthy Masters that work, play and love there. Seriously these men are all kinds of make your panties melt hot. Especially Master Z who runs the place and his brand new subbie, Jessica.The quick of it is that Jessica is having a bitch of a day. Pretty much everything is going wrong ending with an armadillo, lots of rain and landing her car in a ditch on the side of the road. I mean. Can't a girl catch a break? Trudging along to the nearest house she stumbles into Club Shadowlands--a BDSM club--and the sexy and mysterious Master Z who's all on board with introducing her to his decadent world“This was like being Alice in a very twisted Wonderland...”Lucky, lucky bitch! I seriously love Master Z. He's pretty much my older man fantasy come to life. Holy flipping hell. I would be a puddle around him. What I loved both times around is how safe he made me feel in this world. First time with getting introduced to BDSM right along with Jessica and this time just the comfort of a Master Dom who KNOWS what he's doing and has a gift for getting inside people's minds to see what they really need. He can make a girl shiver in all kinds of wickedly good ways. *nods*shirtless, man candy, alpha male, goatee, david gandyThen there's Jessica who was a pretty awesome heroine. She's rocking some curves and isn't rail then or perfect physically--another thing I love about Sinclair's writing. The women feel real and come in all body types. And their hero's totally worship them for every single bit of themselves. Anywho. Jess is a feisty one but can be a little shy and conservative at the same time. She's also one who will not back down when she thinks someone is in need of help even if it gets her in some rather...sticky situations. Like I said. My first go around I was experiencing it all with Jessica as she uncovered the world for the first time and I totally connected with her because of that. It was fun exploring as she did. It never felt overwhelming or too scary.Things are steamy as all get out between these two and kick off pretty quickly. And I loved it. Zachary is a talented talented man no matter what the situation and you can feel that power and control just seeping off the pages. Gah. I love when an author can really make you feel that. The sex scenes are just as intense and even though these two have just met the connection and trust between them is just incredible. Even when scenes are out in the open--in a club setting-- they have such an intimate and powerful feel to them.On re-read my only issue was that since it originally came out Sinclair did a bit of scene editing in one spot and I didn't love the change. It made it more watered down in my opinion in that spot and while the original scene had some edge to it I loved it and really preferred the original.I could easily go on and on about Club Shadowlands. The characters just touched my heart and made me want to be right there with them. The Masters are scorching hot alpha Doms that know how to wield a punishment but they're sweet and caring too and oh they can make things fun and light hearted when they want. If you've ever been curious about BDSM romances Sinclair and Club Shadowlands are the place to start. Hot and steamy, full of passion, intensity and humor. They're everything I look for in an erotic romance. Sinclair had me smiling, sighing and having a serious swoon. Just the perfect BDSM-y read for me each time around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5Q7JEWLI5PF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1N3EBC#wasThisHelpful","R1L5Q7JEWLI5PF","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sooooo.... I was 8 years old when Switchback made it's original debut. Talk about a throwback! lolAnd it was a fun throwback as Mallory and her daughter are targeted by a desperate criminal willing to do anything to retrieve a package he's sure her father-in-law has in his possession. Their only hope...a man name Mac who owes her father-in-law dearly and will do whatever it takes to protect them. Suspense, romance, a happily ever after...Switchback had it all.The CharactersMac and Mallory are definitely fighters. They had everything going against them but never gave up. Took a beating and kept on going. While they both had some issues--she's fairly naive at the start and he's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder--they were likable. Mallory definitely got her grit on and was pretty dang strong when most would have fallen apart. It was awesome seeing that side of her come out. And Mac had a good heart and threw everything he had into saving this little girl. I like characters with guts and determination and they had it in spades.The RomanceTheir relationship was interesting. Right from the start these two have a tension between them. And not exactly a good one. There's attraction but there's also some unease mixed in that kept these two from getting close right away. There's a wee bit of heat but not all that much since the suspense was more in the hot seat.The suspenseFast paced and intense. Anderson had my palms sweating as these two came up against unknown assassins, searched for the hidden package and raced to save her daughter. Bullets, car chases, never knowing where to turn. I could feel their frustration, exhaustion and panic that they'd fail in their mission. While I picked up on clues fairly early on it was still nicely done.Going Old SchoolSince it was written in the 90s there was definitely an old school feel and some outdated bits happening. Use of pay phones, medications that are now banned, use of a Rolodex, typewriters, slang and terms that just don't scream present day, him having fought in Nam, etc. It wasn't a big deal but did have an older feel to it when it came to the writing. But that's kind of fun too getting to see what romance books were like back in the day.Overall, I enjoyed Switchback. It was a fun kick back romance and I'd totally be up for another from Anderson.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7MX1VQP0QYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQTXMFC#wasThisHelpful","R3K7MX1VQP0QYN","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Woo! Second chance romance. Enemies to lovers. That just makes the reader girl in me go all...quivery. Sleeping with the Enemy was full of passion, manipulations, long ago misunderstandings and some pretty hot lovin as old flames are brought back together by someone trying to cause trouble for Jay's football team.The quick of it is that Jay and Bridgett had a thing many years ago when they were barely grown and it ended...disastrously and they went their separate ways, grew up, created new lives and hardened their hearts against love. But now Jay's football team is being sued and they need one helluva lawyer to get them out of the jam. Bridgett just so happens to be one killer lawyer and the sister of one of his players and back into each others lives they're thrown.I liked Bridgett quite a bit. There was just something about her that I connected with. She's strong and self sufficient and a survivor who keeps her feelings contained. I sympathized with her and wanted good things for her. Wanted to see the hard edges she protected herself with soften. Jay...I wanted to smack around a little. lol He was just as hurt by a misunderstanding that tore them apart and not willing to trust in love or let anyone close again but he was kind of a s*** about it when trying to get with Bridgett again all these years later. He wanted her body but that's it. They were good in the sack so why not while their time away getting sweaty together. And, yeah, he needed to be smacked for that.There were lots of good things but I did have a couple problems. I was never able to forget the bad blood between these two and instead of it bringing the right kind of tension and heat to their encounters most of the time it made me kind of sad for them instead. I also had some trouble with some wishy washy happening especially after the 3rd or 4th time with no real change in things. ex--Bridgett wanting to keep a distance, his lips meeting hers and that changing to *screw me stupid* instead then back to no we can't. And I was with her on that. They didn't trust each other and that kept me from believing them falling back in love. Especially since the misunderstanding was kept going for so long instead of them just saying something then everything wrapping up way too close to the end.Okay, so I enjoyed Sleeping with the Enemy to a point. There are some pretty funny moments, some that had me tearing up and these two were definitely scorching in bed together. And I loved a bunch of the secondary characters--both family, friend and coworkers--and am really hoping they'll get their stories told. Even the suspense with who was trying to cause Jay's team trouble was pretty dang good. But this one didn't quite do it for me overall. I love the whole second chance romance and seeing a couple deal with the animosity that can bring but this time, for me, the tone missed the mark a bit. Worth the read to see how things fall out if you've been reading the series but not the best to start with for the first time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PQ70FAJ42OUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B5E4#wasThisHelpful","R2PQ70FAJ42OUW","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loved. It. Snowbound at Christmas was an absolute delight! Hot hunky hero, stellar heroine, the magic of Christmas and danger around every corner. The perfect read to snuggle down with on a cold day with a hot cup of chocolate in hand.The quick of it is that someone is trying to kill Cat's sister and she's set out to find out who's behind all the accidents her twin keeps having. Everyone is a suspect including the hottie British actor who's suddenly come to town and is working with her sister. He's totally hiding some secrets but maybe not the one's Cat thinks...I freaking LOVED Cat. Mason writes the best heroines. They're strong, kick ass, reasonable and just plain likable women. Cat's a former police offer who's had a rough go lately and has been working for her sister who is...difficult. I loved everything about her. How patient and determined she was. How much she loved. That she could apologize when wrong and keep on moving. She was just great.And Grayson? Pretty sexy guy.I really liked these two together. They go a little slow since they don't really trust each other right off the bat. But it worked. I liked seeing them get to know each other, deal with the threats, come to trust each other and deal with their crazy families. And whew their families were crazy. Her sister. Lordy. I was totally on board with the Santa float in the Christmas parade running her ass over. Annoying crazy tart! How Cat stood her. Whew!The only thing I would have asked for more of would be heat. There's some nice chemistry and tension happening but actual heat and sexy bits...not so much. Very very light and mostly off page.The suspense of who was out for Cat's sister was nicely done. I kinda figured it out but at the same time was kept guessing long enough for it to really work.All in all, Snowbound at Christmas was a fantabulous Christmas read. A little danger and action, heart, romance, small town spirit. Christmas, Colorado totally won me over.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGLBUCS4YLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0BHC#wasThisHelpful","R1TGLBUCS4YLC","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Best Christmas book I've read all year! A Bad Boy for Christmas was everything. Heartfelt, sexy, full of humor and good friends, falling in love with all it's bits and pieces. Holidays, family, make you sign sweetness and lots and lots of dessert. Total win from page one to the very last word.I am ALL over Connor. OMG. Can I please have one of him for Christmas??! Everything about this guy was delicious. He's got the sexy swagger. He's got the ghosts from his past haunting him. He's got a kind hand and gentle touch. He's funny and sweet and omg every time he kissed her temple my knees went weak.And Faith aka Cupcake was a fantastic heroine too. I could totally be friends with her and bond over the sweet treats. She ran a little bit too hard now and again and I wanted to shake her for it because...seriously...Connor! but she was fun, sweet and could be a little naughty with him which was fun.The chemistry could melt snow! Yeah. These two were amazing together. When they were getting along, when he was driving her crazy hounding her steps, working together, playing together. They were just on fire and the banter and looks between them just steamy fun. AndIf you only read one Christmas romance this year...make it A Bad Boy for Christmas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QA7UU6FLZBTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0BJ0#wasThisHelpful","R3QA7UU6FLZBTN","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fun, curious and head spinning fun. Down the Rabbit Hole was an entertaining anthology as 5 authors gave Alice in Wonderland their own personal spin.Robb is one of my favorites so I was all in for giving this antho a go and it was a lot of fun. Each take was unique and interesting. I had favorites--Robb and Ryan and a couple misses as well--Fox and McComas--but all in all it was a twisty fun ride Down the Rabbit Hole.Wonderment in Death by JD Robb--4 starsIt's Eve and Roarke. You need it. Need it now! lol I love everything about this series and getting a tasty little treat with a side of woo-woo is always a delight. It's a quick little murder mystery as Eve and the team are called to a murder/suicide that may have had some outside influences and is riddled full of Alice in Wonderlandish connections. It was a good time. Classic Robb. Humor, friendships, a little romance and loving and a curious mystery that kept the pages turning.Alice and the Earl in Wonderland by Mary Blayney--3 starsA jaunt through time to save them all!!! Okay, really just a little time travel to set two hearts free and give them a chance at love as Alice and Weston are suddenly catapulted into present day London. Their lives switched with their contemporaries who are sent to replace them in times past.  Everything they know to be true rocked and their eyes and hearts opened by the experience. These two had been in love once upon a time but scandal and worries tore them apart despite still being in love and yearning for each other. I liked these two. They had that sadly sweet feel of wanting each other but not thinking it was possible--her because of her parents scandalous divorce and him because of inheriting a nearly bankrupt earldom. I liked seeing them together and watching them realize that none of that mattered. While there was some nice tension between them there's little to no heat. I enjoyed it. I wasn't blown away but it was a nice read overall. I'd be up for checking out the series.ILove by Elaine Fox--1 starILove didn't work for me on  any level. Basically the heroine hastily dumps her boyfriend at breakfast without explanation and walks away from him because she thinks he spends too much time on his phone instead of focusing entirely on her. And as she walks away he gets sucked into that phone into a crazy world... to be rebooted. He can only get out if he finds love via the ILove app available to him.I didn't care for the heroine at all. Or really any of the storyline. It came off as a preachy anti-technology PSA to live in the moment and get off technology. I get the idea but the preachy voice put me off.  And then everything was so wishy washy. She dumped him but then was upset he didn't call her afterward, she'd tell her friends and they'd act like she was crazy because he was a good guy then next page they were telling her he just didn't love her, he was always on his phone but examples were him waiting for an important work message or looking up something that they'd talked about (like if you're talking and go I wonder what...and he looked it up) or her taking him to a baby shower and him checking out his messages. It just didn't work for me. Had it been a more positive thing maybe I could have gotten into it but it seemed like the entire thing was about the hero learning how horrible a person he was and then the heroine finally realizing she was a horrible person too and things magically being fixed between them because they'd rather be together. It made me a bit grouchy and I was glad it was only a handful of chapters.A True Heart by Mary Kay McComas-- 2.5 starsWhew! Now, True Heart, definitely had me feeling like I had actually fallen down a rabbit hole.  In a mix of A Christmas Carol and Alice in Wonderland  Elsie visits with a friend while costume shopping and slips into another world with a guide intent on showing her the troubles with her life one costume change at a time.I spent a lot of the time feeling all swoopy and admittedly fairly confused on what was happening. I was totally feeling the down the rabbit hole vibes. Overall it was an okay read even with being all swirly. Elise and her guide wander through the shop trying on costumes that are supposed to help her with her figure out her life. The negative ways she behaves, etc. while watching flashbacks of conversations or moments with friends over the years. It was a little cliche at the end but personal growth and a couple smiles along the way did make it fairly enjoyable.Fallen by RC Ryan--4 starsSexy highlanders. I just. Are more words needed? lol I loved Fallen. It was curious, sexy, fun and had a little danger added to the mix. It was a very quick read and one I didn't want to put down as Bethany travels to Scotland to broker a land sale and while making her way to the castle she falls, knocks her head and is transported into the past and the life of Laird Colin who is living under a curse and with two evil step siblings out to do him harm.They were both lovely characters that suited each other and fit nicely. The world was magical and all of the characters (sans Bethany) waffled in and out of human and animal forms which was kind of fun. Things move quick, there's a little heat and a spot of evil lingering in the backgrounds. I was all set to be highly ticked with how things were ending but Ryan pulled off what could easily have been either cliche or a huge OMG NO YOU DIDN'T move and instead left me smiling and wishing there was more from this little world. Nicely done!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QQIED9OSYQGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028CC#wasThisHelpful","R1QQIED9OSYQGP","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fun and sexy with lots of humor, sweet declarations and characters finally winning over the ones they love. This was a charming Christmas anthology from Foster!One of the things I love about Foster's short stories is that while things get all hot and heavy right away all the couples have known each other for months, if not years, before the good stuff starts. Makes them so much more believable and to me a lot more enjoyable to read.If you love Foster and are looking for something you can quickly pick up and finish in one sitting Yule Be Mine is definitely one to check out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV13NUBNVY8Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MA6E48#wasThisHelpful","RV13NUBNVY8Q3","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Breathtaking and poignant. The Stolen Mackenzie Bride left me fighting back tears and wanting to fall down and have a massive sob. Beautiful, heartbreaking, passionate and utterly moving it gripped my heart and wouldn't let go.If you've read this series this one is a bit of a throwback. All the way to Scotland 1745 and the life of the Mackenzie family ancestor, Malcolm, as he found love, fought for family, freedom and everything he held dear in the midst of an uprising between the Scottish and the English that pulled his family into the brutal battle between them.  It's a tumultuous time full of pain, loss and heartache but hope, love and determination shone through.Mal and Mary were amazing characters. Full of grit and backbone and unfailing love. Their lives were full of danger and turmoil but they never let go of each other. They carried on, fought harder and survived time and time again. I loved them down to their toes and just wanted to curl around them and protect them from everything they were going through.This one had a very different feel and was much darker than the others I've read in the series. It did have funny moments as the two met and their lives became entwined. Little bits where I'd bark out a laugh or just couldn't help smiling over their antics or banter. The sexy bits were rather subdued as a whole but there were a couple scenes that were passionate and sigh worthy. But overall it was fairly dark. The uprising they were pulled into and the losses not just to them personally but to both countries as they battled gave me one of those 'oh God' moments. Especially when thinking about how it was based in real history. I just can't imagine. Whew. Anyways. It was powerful.It was so interesting seeing a different generation of Mackenzie brothers. Seeing where the fire, rebellion, love of family, rakishness, fierceness came from and how it was passed down to the ""current"" generation of brothers that the series is typically about. Being able to go Ooo Ian totally got that trait from him!  It was just special. And I really hope Ashley will do more with exploring the lives of Malcolm's brothers and the Mackenzies of this earlier century.Powerful and moving. The Stolen Mackenzie Bride was a bittersweet journey of family, determination and two souls finding love during a harrowing moment in time. It was beautiful and will stick with me for quite some time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1558P5LTO9LRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026AQ#wasThisHelpful","R1558P5LTO9LRP","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whew, boy! *fans self* Slow Ride was hot, sensual and delicious! Cathryn Fox delivered!The quick of it is that Coop and his high school buddies have decided to invite the 'women who got away' to an all expenses paid trip to a dude ranch they own to see if maybe, just maybe, they were really meant to be. And for Coop that means his best friend from high school. Only glitch? Her twin sister, Julia, shows up instead. The girl who'd always had his eye despite being ever so off limits. Friend code and all that, ya know? Plus thinking he shoulda had a thing for his actual best friend. Ahh poor guy.Okay so these two. I had a good time with them. Coops a cowboy and a doctor...could he be any sexier? Oh and he owns a dude ranch he bought just for his mama. Nice, erm, package happening too. He was one tasty man treat. And Julia is a lawyer whose life is full of way more work than fun and she needs someone to help her break into her wild side. And, Coop? Totally willing to help with that. It's a novella so it doesn't get too deep but what I saw I really liked. And I loved watching these two figure out that maybe they'd both wanted the same thing all those years ago.They were fun, sexy and cute together. And, lordy, the heat! Yeah. These two don't waste any time getting down and dirty--woohoo! Passionate, exciting and a little wild.All in all, Slow Ride was a quickie but a damn satisfying one.

"I've really been loving The Cavanaugh Brothers series which is about three brothers who are trying to solve the decades old murder of their baby sister and end up finding romance and family along the way. It's sexy and mysterious and full of...cowboys. I've totally been panting over them and have been desperately awaiting Bonded and getting to see how things wrapped up for this trio of brothers, the long ago murder and the surprise addition of another sibling--Blue--who was discovered after the family patriarch passed away and his existence was revealed in the will.Blue caught my eye right from the beginning of the series. The quick of it is that he worked for the Cavanaugh family for years and discovering he was actually family and the people he loved most had hidden that from him wrecked him and have had him running from everyone he knew, drowning his pain in booze and, it turns out, knocking up his waitress one night. There's a lot of turmoil in this man's life that he's suddenly having to deal with.So. I had some problems with this one.Mostly the romance which was more or less skipped over. Things went from 0 to 60 and skipped all the other pretty little numbers. Blue knocked up his waitress, found out, they fought and then LOVE!! I needed more from the romance and to actually see that love developing instead of everything magically just coming together for the perfect HEA.I needed more from the heroine and storyline in general. I loved Blue and his struggles. He's an angry cowboy that's for sure. Has closed himself off from everyone around him over the months as he tries to deal with the lies he'd been told and I really felt for him. Got his anger and fear of letting anyone close again. I was good with everything Blue and how he tried to be there for Emily and their child.Emily, though, I had some trouble with. She was okay but, to me at least, she kind of played games with Blue. She knew his issues with trusting people and being manipulated after his family issues and would do/say things that would hurt him in regards to having a relationship with his future child or being a part of the pregnancy that did much the same. Everything was about her and she'd push him away, try to deny him any say or part of the process, etc. It really just bothered me how she behaved when he'd really done nothing wrong and I had a hard time connecting with her because of it.The suspense and mystery of Cass's long ago murder was also just kind of glossed over. It's been building with each book as they discover bits of what happened and then in this one nothing much was done and I had that 'that's it?' feeling. It was just...there almost in the background to the pregnancy woes and someone who wanted her out of the picture and Blue's life. You know from the start who it is though so it's not really anything that grabbed your attention.I went into Bonded pretty giddy and excited to see what would finally happen but in the end I felt a bit let down by the conclusion of the series. Overall, Bonded was an okay read. There was nothing really wrong with it--other than a sometimes frustrating heroine--but it felt like it was missing things and glossing over others that had been driving the series. It really ended up feeling like a filler book which is a shame since it was the conclusion of the series (as far as I know).","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF3VART9C4LNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OJ98#wasThisHelpful","RF3VART9C4LNZ","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tracker's End was...so much fun and pulled me in completely with it's fan yourself sexy, laugh out loud humor and a fabulous crew of characters. I had a great time as Tracker and Lana finally did something about their year long attraction and the 'good girl' finally snagged herself a bad boy biker. Add in a hero rocking a bit of hardware below the belt and some Ed Sheeran fandom and, hell yeah, I had a good time and maybe just a couple squees along the way too.Alright. The quick of it is that Tracker is a biker in an MC. And Lana's best friend is with one of the guys from his club so she's around and about and man that sexy biker with the long blond hair is giving her some real dirty thoughts. Turns out her shy quiet ways have totally snagged his attention too and after a year of resisting...it's on. Woohoo!Lana was just a fantastic heroine. A spot geeky, a bit inexperienced but not naive, a romance writer and just a likable woman with a good heart that would be easy to be around. She struggled now and again with trust issues but was solid and fun.Tracker was pretty damn hot too. Sexy and cocky and the aforementioned rocking of some hardware on his manly bits. I freaking LOVE pierced bits so was all woohoo! over that. He could be an jerk, could be incredibly sweet and could really screw things up too. Basically. He was a male. lolHeat-wise. These two pretty damn hot. Lots of passion and tension and a heroine that made him wait until they'd gotten to know each other a bit before having sex--yes for an awesome heroine once again! I do wish more had been done with his decorated bits which other than mentions at the start was mostly ignored. But that's okay, I knew it was there. I liked these two together in and out of bed. They had very different personalities but they meshed well and brought out new and fun sides to each other. She got a little bold and sassy and adventurous--living life instead of just writing about it. And she softened his hard edges. Calmed and centered him.I did have one fairly big issue and that was the hero's screw up. He pulled a Ross Geller and a 'we were on a break' bit and even though I enjoyed the book, the romance and how things ended I was pretty damn disappointed in him and it did take the rating down a half a point for me. He got a semi-pass with it since they'd had a falling out but for me as a reader I wasn't okay with that bit.Now. On the MC front. On a scale of 1 to Madeline Sheehan...Tracker's End is a 1 when it comes to being an MC romance. I'd say this is a book for those that want to read an MC but don't really want an MC read. It's a contemporary romance. One that's ever so very very slightly dipped into the MC world. It's set in an MC but there is absolutely no grit to this book. Pretty much everything MC is off pages. They talk about badass things they've done, dangerous moments, etc but other than the heroine getting beat up by the hero's ex there's not all that much happening here. I'm not saying that's a bad thing at all though--because I did have a good time with it--but don't go in expecting a lot of grit with this one. There's a very contemporary romance feel to it instead.All in all, despite an issue with the hero there towards the end and it being fairly tame MC-wise I had a fantastic time with these two. Fernando pulled me in completely. Tracker's End was one hot and sexy ride I just couldn't put down. I read it pretty much in one sitting and stayed up way past my bedtime so I could devour every last page. I'll definitely be back for more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GKXEOE1WLHJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WNVS#wasThisHelpful","R1GKXEOE1WLHJ3","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was way late to the Dirty Eleven game but hot damn I got there and oh I loved it! Great characters, hot sex, a slightly taboo relationship. Manipulations, danger, dirty deals, revenge. Gah. So good! Sorenson had me panting for more the second I closed that last page.The quick of it is that Mia's husband was killed years earlier by MC members and she wants her revenge. Which has come in the form of one dangerous and sexy biker who's made a deal with authorities. They'll spring him from prison early in exchange for turning informant on his club and the deal includes weekly visits with a psychologist...Mia. He knows the life and the two share a common enemy in the rival MC club and she fully intends on using that to her advantage. Messy. So messy. *rubs hands together*Mia & Cole were such an interesting pair and so deliciously taboo with their therapist/client dynamic. I thoroughly enjoyed both and the vast differences between them--she's prim, proper and classy and he's, as he said, a thug (though he has really great bits too). Quick to temper, covered in tattoos and dangerous. And somehow...they worked and flowed together and had some pretty funny moments as their relationship went from therapy sessions to hanging out.I was a little worried about Mia with her initial scheming but she quickly realized he was more than a thug. Was a good guy that had had a hard life and she couldn't use him the way she'd planned. But damn if she could turn off the chemistry and need for him in other ways. Thank goodness!The heat...whew! Hot, dirty and shiver-worthy. Mia may be prim and proper on the outside but she's adventurous in the bedroom (or out of it as the case may be) and glories in it. The two were combustible and the passion was scorching hot. I really thought going in this was a contemporary but I'd put it more in erotic. There's some backdoor play and a menage scene with another female. Not usually my favorite but turned out to be pretty hot too.There's a little mystery and danger as she gets involved with the MC and they both start uncovering the past and what happened with her husband and his brother's death while he was locked up. Dealing with dirty cops out to get him, dangers in his MC and with rival clubs. It had a little grit to it but not too extreme and was a nice backdrop to them falling for each other and figuring out all those messy wonderful emotions.All in all, I want MORE! I can't wait for book two and plan on backtracking to some of Sorenson's other books in the meantime. She hooked me completely with Riding Dirty. Sexy, dangerous, thrilling! Couldn't ask for more. If you love MC romances...grab this one up now!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVZWVVS4FJFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z768TXM#wasThisHelpful","R2PVZWVVS4FJFV","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahhhhh it...was...good! It took a bit for it to stop feeling like a recap of book one (about 10% in) which was really the only negative thing for me about the book (and why I didn't rate higher) but once it did...holy cow, Begging for It was an incredible ride as these two try to figure out their relationship, come to terms with their mutual dark fantasies (rape fantasy) and deal with a real rapist (not sure why he's called a stalker) that's terrorizing the city and bringing suspicions to Jonah's door.The sex scenes were incredibly hot. The relationship full of ups and downs that had me aching for the two. The secondary characters (other than her horrid family) were fantastic and added a wonderful layer to the story--including his siblings who I would LOVE to hear more about some day. Come on give us more books! lol A lovely ending as well. Nicely done! A beautifully twisted romance that touches the heart, heats up the sheets and leaves you begging for more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCT2KT5HSRLWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026JC#wasThisHelpful","RCT2KT5HSRLWK","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adore Ashley's shifters and last year dug into her historicals with the Mackenzies and oh...my...yum! Fun, sexy, scandalous. Highlanders, kilts and mystery. Excellent series. The Scandalous Mackenzies is a print release of two of the previous e-book only novellas-- The Untamed Mackenzies and Scandal and the Duchess. And, as always, Ashley left me smitten.The Untamed Mackenzie (#5.5)It took me a little while to get into The Untamed Mackenzie. The quick of it is that Louisa has been accused of poisoning a man at a party and Lloyd (who she's rather smitten with) has come in to investigate the murder and try to find the real culprit. Which he's very much hoping is not the lovely Louisa.The romance took a second seat to the investigation for most of the novella. I think that's what kept me from getting wrapped up in it at first. I just didn't have a strong connection to either Louisa, Lloyd or the simmering attraction that had been going on in the months prior to the book starting. But at about the halfway mark it pulled me in and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Louisa and Lloyd were a nice pairing and brought out the fire in each other for sure. I liked his focus and determination when it came to police work and her strength in holding her head high despite the gossip surrounding her.All in all, not a bad novella. The suspense wasn't exactly a surprise but it worked and there were some interesting developments along the way. And the romance. It was nice seeing these two finally get their act together after being mutually smitten for ages. They just needed a little push shove apparently in the form of a scandalous murder. lol My favorite part of the novella, though, was the secondary characters and getting to see both Ian and Daniel from other books and who really stole the show.Scandal and the Duchess (#6.5)I was totally charmed by Scandal and the Duchess as Steven comes home to pay his respects to a soldier's widow, gets bumbling drunk shoring up his courage and runs smack into Rose as he leaves the pub and maybe giving her an accidental grope in the process. Oys! Rose and scandal go hand in hand since her husband passed and stepson threw her out. The media is gaga over her. And now. *hangs head* They've gotten quite the show as a drunk Scot slides right on down her and tries to climb back up. ::snort::These two were fantastic together. They ended up pretending to be engaged to stymie the media and it was so fun watching them quickly fall. They've both been lonely and needed someone just for them. They're very caring people and always giving everything they have to others. They were just nice and damn they were scorching hot too! There's some good loving and some fabulous chemistry between them as they help solve each others problems--keeping Steven offlimits to other women and making sure Rose gets the inheritance her first husband left her and that her stepson is trying to deny her. There's a slight mystery or rather puzzle left by her husband that they have to solve which was rather entertaining.Scandal and the Duchess was a very quick read but it was so fun and sexy too! And very satisfying as well. Not an easy feat for a novella but Ashley did a fine job as always. I'm definitely hooked and can't wait to go back and read the rest of the series. The cameos from previous couples seriously caught my interest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ECWTBUND6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266273#wasThisHelpful","R24ECWTBUND6","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh dayum! The Drifter was GOOD! Freaking awesome characters--a fierce heroine and one crazy sexy laid back cowboy, mystery and sabotage and a family doing everything they can to survive. Add in lots of cowhands who were all such characters and a cute pup named Cracker and I was just completely smitten with The Drifter as Chet makes his way cross country on horseback and lands on Maria's lands in need of work and ends up being much more than just another cowhand.These two. I absolutely adored them. Everything about them. Maria was an amazing heroine. She's incredibly strong of spirit and just a good woman through and through. Struggling to keep the ranch afloat but not willing to turn away someone in need. Cares about her family, her workers and the land. She was definitely a woman you could look up to. respect and completely feel for when she's struggling with things. And Chet was most definitely her equal being a damn good man. He's laid back, confident, has a sexy strength about him.They were just so good together. I loved watching their interactions. Seeing trust build, seeing them work together for the property, rely on each other, struggle with their paths in life and the kinks it threw at them. Finding love and passion and a hope for the future. It was just all a little swoony and lovely.The only thing that would have made it better was a bit more heat. Loved the romance and chemistry but, yeah, a smidge more heat would have been the perfect topper for me. But still I enjoyed what they had together. They made me smile quite a few times.There's a good bit of suspense/mystery with this one and I really enjoyed it. There's a huge corporate ranch in the area that is causing trouble with the smaller ranches trying to force their hands to sell out and they're fairly unethical. There's all kinds of shady stuff happening and watching as the two of them tried to figure things out, survive each day and save the ranch was something to see. There were even a couple surprises which was great.All in all, I'm pretty dang excited to have found Anna Schmidt. Everything about The Drifter was just gripping and had me rooting for these two to overcome all of the odds. Definitely a satisfying read and one that has me excited for more. Schmidt definitely wowed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MO4M08WZ6R4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492612960#wasThisHelpful","R3MO4M08WZ6R4R","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please! Can I have another?!! ohmigod. Crosstown Crush was like a deliciously dirty version of 'I'll show you mine, if you show me yours'...the kink edition. Leave it to McKenna to always bring something fascinating and unique to the table and do so in a gloriously sexy, intriguing way.This...was a new one for me. The quick of it is that Sam and Mike are married and he's got a rather interesting fetish--he's got a cuckolding kink. Yep, he gets off on thinking his wife is cheating on him and he's not good enough. Something they've role played in their marriage but are wanting to take to the next level--bringing another man, a stranger, into their lives to play out those fantasies in living, sweaty, filthy color. Even better...their kinky third has his own fetish and enjoys being watched. *noms* Kinky fetishes abound and it..was...glorious.It was impossible not to fall for all three of these people--Sam and Mike who had an incredible marriage and acceptance of each other and Bern who joined them. They're all so delightfully twisted with their kinks and desires and I loved watching them explore that together and seeing things evolve over the weeks. They all had that mix of confidence and insecurity and nerves and it made them so fun to explore with. The added bits of humor made it even better as they got past those nerves and settled into to one crazy weird relationship and crafted some seriously forbidden fantasies and brought them to life.McKenna managed to handle the relationships and kink in a way that kept things from crossing the line despite the subject of fantasy cheating. These three managed to make their kinks work for them--cuckolding, exhibitionism and menage. It was hot instead of sleazy. Passionate and almost romantic instead of cheap and tawdry. And they really worked at it, thought it out, talked about issues that came up. It was nicely done. Since the husband was in on everything including ground rules, all interactions, etc it really worked.Now. The heat.Whew boy!Okay. This one was scorching hot. I mean. Holy cow make a girl squirm hot. And the taboo factor just kicked it up another notch. Perfectly edgy and intense. These men were utterly sinful and burned up the sheets. Pushing boundaries to their breaking points, power, control, exploring everything that makes you tick. It was toe curling good!My only complaint was that the ending wasn't a tidy HEA which is fairly typical of McKenna's writing. There was more a happy for now instead of a happily ever after. It was good and very satisfying but I tend to prefer that little happily ever after bow.I'm seriously curious where this will go as a series since book two isn't listed yet. Will it be more of this trio? Will one break away from the arrangement? Will there be a whole net set of people (since we didn't meet anyone else in this one)? Kills me. It does. I need to know! lol Captivatingly kinky...Crosstown Crush is one not to miss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18BW3ERZUD0C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451476050#wasThisHelpful","R18BW3ERZUD0C3","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well. Any author who can take a only-out-for-himself manwhore defense attorney and make him not only likable but endearing and entirely loveable too has my full damn attention. Sustained was a knock out and hit all my reader girl buttons. It was an absolute ride as Jake--who's POV the book is told from--has his world seriously rocked by a petite little woman and her brood of kids. All SIX of them.Alright so the quick of it is that Chelsea's brother passed away and she's now the guardian for all of her very lively nieces and nephews and they're giving her a run for her money. Including one of the little hellions who brought defense attorney Jake into their lives...by picking his pocket. Yeah. *hangs head for her*The CharactersJake: Gah. I NEVER would have thought I'd fall for Jake. The guy. Well. He's a total prick when things kick off. He's upfront about it but he pretty much uses women for sex then he's done and ready to move on to the next. And, really, he's a defense attorney and good at getting scum off the hook..I'm over here going 'oh you are a major tool!' But...that tool totally won my ass over. Color me really freaking surprised. *bows down to Chase cus that's some impressive s*** right there* Jake turned out to be a pretty awesome hero. I loved that it was told from his POV and he really didn't hold back. There's a lot of good under his shallow bad boy persona and it was fun watching that peek out.Chelsea: Chelsea's a strong woman, that's for sure. She's got so much on her hands but is sweet and caring and doing everything she can to give her nieces and nephews a happy home despite the tragedy they've been through. Totally uprooted her own life to take on tremendous responsibility and she did it with heart and love and strength. She just made me want to hug her and I am NOT a hugger. lolAnd the kids: They're colorful, lively and an absolute whirlwind but I adored them. Usually kids are a hard sell for me but Chase did an amazing job with them giving each a distinctive personality and issues. I was seriously smitten with the whole herd of them.The RomanceThese two! Their lives are night and day different but I loved them together and watching the relationship change from him just lending legal counsel to the kids to slowly becoming more and more involved with the family and not being able to resist...any of them. They felt comfortable together as they kind of fell into a domestic set up.Now, the heat. Whew, boy. So it takes them a while to get going since...there's the whole herd of 'cockblocking interrupters' but oh man when they finally get a few minutes alone it's delicious.The FamilyAs much as this was a romance it was really a family affair too and it did a number on my heart. I loved watching Jake with the kids and seeing them all fall for each other. This guy is so not the man you'd ever match up with kids but it worked and was so cute and endearing seeing him go to Mommy & Me classes or pop concerts or just being there when they were sick and needed someone. He really didn't clean up his mouth at all around them and told em like it was when they was causing trouble or being bratty and it was hilarious. They're all a little dysfunctional but in the best way and gah it was good. I'd love to be a part of this family.All in all, Sustained won me over. Utterly heartwarming, sexy, and hilarious! I will definitely be reading more from Chase!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0V5GJGBMD3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WQF6#wasThisHelpful","R2G0V5GJGBMD3Z","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm so gonna need book two now! Black & Blake have me seriously smitten over their new series The Perfect Gentlemen and Scandal Never Sleeps. Heat, scandal, danger, sexy as hell hero and a heroine who is solid through and through...definitely a fun ride. Add in an incredibly intriguing secondary cast and, yeah, these ladies totally rocked it and left me panting for more.The quick of it is that Gabe and his friends met back in prep school and formed a group--The Perfect Gentlemen (of which they most certainly are not lol) and they've become powerful, wealthier and deliciously sexy as they've aged. *noms* But tragedy struck and they've been hit by a death in their own ranks. A death tinged with suspicion and that has Gabe dealing with the messy life his friend left behind and questioning everything. Including the sexy woman who helped ease his heartache the night of the funeral and may have had a curious relationship with the best friend he'd just buried.I love, love, loved Everly. She was an awesome heroine. Sexy and smart, willing to get a little wild. And when Gabe started being a jerk, knew her worth and wasn't going to accept it. I was seriously cheering this chick on. And, Gabe, despite some oh-you-need-to-be-pinched moments was one sexy sonofagun. I loved his connection to his friends, his loyalty, the passion in him and even his struggles.Heat-wise it edged on erotic but I think was more contemporary that had high heat. Verra good though. These two had scorching chemistry--I mean toe curling fan yourself goodness-- and quite the stormy relationship as their one night stand turned into more. The sex scenes were luscious for sure.The suspense was intriguing as they found themselves faced with the suspicious death, trying to unravel what really happened to their mutual friend and realizing that maybe you don't always know the people you love as well as you thought you did. It was nicely done with twists, surprise discoveries, danger all twining together. I liked the hints and teases about the other Perfect Gentlemen that it brought into the mix too. These men are just fascinating together.All in all, Black & Blake have another winner on their hands. Scandal Never Sleeps kept me up late into the night and and was totally worth every single second of lost sleep.

"Woohoo! Now this is what you call stellar romantic suspense. Energized gave me all the tingles I was looking for starting with one hella sexy (and sometimes grumbly) Marine. *swoons* Romance, awesome characters, fan yourself sexy times and one heck of a surprise twist. Add in a dash of woo-woo (the heroine gets visions from touching objects) and some crazy creepy visions and, oh yea...awesome time. Loved it to bits.Alright, so the quick of it is that Hannah has gone searching for her long lost sisters and the stars just happen to align exactly right bringing her back into the life of one sexy Marine she shared a scorchingly hot night with months earlier. Pretty much her life has just turned all topsy turvy and a little bit crazy too.Hannah and Niall were fab. Had no complaints about either. Hannah just had a lovely spirit about her and is someone who easily draws others towards her and is friendly, capable and a good person. She totally had a basass sassy side too which I loved. And Niall. He's a little grumbly and can be stand offish but he's dealing with the horrors of war and being a civilian again and it can be too much some days. But he's an amazing guy. Does very sweet things and cares for those around him--both friends and employees at the restaurant he now runs with his brother.These two are crazy hot and combustible together. Things kick off with some serious heat when they first met and, whew, it had me squirming and fanning myself. They cool down for a bit but oooh yay us they come back to the sexy once they get back into each others lives and get to know each other for real.There's a nice side of suspense with this one and it was creepy and interesting and totally surprising. Hannah gets visions from touching metal objects and manages to link in to a serial killer that's hunting and torturing men in the area. She kind of becomes them when she's in the vision. It was incredibly well done and had my palms sweating and got me just as concerned over Hannah as those around her as she fought to keep her sanity and not be taken over by the visions she was seeing. Behre managed to get me too. Kept me guessing on who the villain was and what would happen. Freaking LOVE that.All in all, Behre continues to shine and is definitely one to keep an eye on if you love romantic suspense. The romance, the heat, the secondary characters and the suspense blended together perfectly and make for one helluva read. I'm seriously hoping some of the other characters will get books. The support cast is always just excellent and I'm gonna need Ryan and Ian's stories. I really am.Oh!! And she got the Marine bit right! Thank you! Love when an author actually does that. Capitalizing Marine, getting the attitude and the lifestyle. Once a Marine, Always a Marine and ma'aming ya to death. lol Fanfreakingtastic job.

"Ahhh so many mixed feelings on this one. I loved the characters. I loved the set up. I even loved the fated mates and how heavily that's relied on for the romance side of things. The hero and heroine were great. I enjoyed them and watching them together as they each dealt with their own issues and the big bad who seemed to be taunting the hero. There was some very good stuff happening there for sure.I had issues with some of the little things though. Lack of condoms (or mention that shifters don't need them) especially with a story plot that happens because ew, yall just met!, a secondary storyline with a straight male shifter who's been given a male mate--not loving that at all--it feels very forced and I don't care for the way everyone acts like he's ridiculous for not being all on board with things which came up multiple times and really pulled me out of the book, and a very cliche run in with the 'bad guy'. While it didn't all ruin the book it definitely made it more...average. It wasn't bad pnr and I did enjoy it even with the issues and definitely want to read the next one but it wasn't the strongest of the series. .","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVLMQH7TJ022/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451466926#wasThisHelpful","R2PVLMQH7TJ022","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wolf Trouble was just one of those easy reads. You know, the ones where you're reading along and look up and realize holy cow I'm already 50% through! and it just feels like no time at all has passed because you're totally into it and the characters and cruising along having a great time with them. I love that feeling!The quick of it is that the SWAT team is being forced to add to it's ranks to keep the city's higher ups happy. They want a woman added to the all male team to head off any potential discrimination lawsuits. And the guys...aren't so happy since that'll mean a human on the team and risk their wolfy sides being exposed. Anywho. A woman they need...and a woman they're gonna get in the form of a female cop desperate to start over in a new city after her unit turned their backs on her.So...Kakhi (weird name, right) and Xander...I really enjoyed them to bits. Kakhi totally ruled as a heroine. She's smart, dedicated, incredibly determined to hold her own and be a part of this team. I just loved her spirit as she came into this incredibly intimidating situation and was faced with becoming part of a 16 male alpha werewolf team and with being a new werewolf. I could see hanging out with her no question. And Xander. Damn sexy man who was slow on the uptake when it came to Kakhi and got himself all good and grumbly over her as he tried to resist. He was great too.The romance was a bit slow going--not really starting until about halfway through--but I liked it. Kakhi needed to get settled and it was fun watching them both being utterly tortured by their attractions and trying to resist the pouncing and lickage of each other. Once they finally gave in...lots of furniture destruction as they got all hot and dirty together. It was lovely. HehThe SWAT team is one of my favorite things. There are a LOT of men (16 total) and they play a great support cast. There's a lot of time spent as a team training and getting to know Kakhi and I really loved all of that time and seeing the inner workings of SWAT as they prepare and get Kakhi qualified for duty. You just can't help but like these guys. There was a little suspense and danger as they were called out to a series of bank robberies and some moments that got my palms a little tingly. It wasn't anything too over the top suspenseful though but that was fine with me.All in all, Tyler had me smiling like crazy and enjoying the heck out of this sexy SWAT team. The romance, the hero and heroine, the team as a whole, seeing them all train and bond as Khaki joins their ranks, the danger of the job. It was all...just fun, entertaining and impossible to resist. Especially when the guys ditch their shirts and get all sweaty. *noms* I'm really excited to see what'll happen next with this team. And, just gotta add, look at those freaking covers!

"I actually really loved Hair Food. It smells INCREDIBLE and is in a pretty container. And it worked great. My hair was pretty dang shiny and smooth and felt amazing after using it. Why it wasn't rated higher had to do with the directions which were terrible. They didn't say how long to leave it in or how much to use or anything very helpful for those of us who have maybe never used this type of product before. Some trial and error helped though. My 2nd round was when it worked and won me over. First time I didn't use enough or leave it in long enough. But overall. Loves!

"Yay Puffs! This was just a fabulous idea on their side. Regular sized Puffs in a soft flexible package! Everything about these are great. The tissue itself is soft, the packaging has a funky fun pattern--and there are multiple choices in design just like their hard packs, and they're flexible! I love that. The soft packaging makes them easy to pop in a tote bag for traveling or in the glove box compared the the regular hard cardboard packages that are always just a bit too big for wherever you need them to go. These were a total win and I'd buy them in a heart beat.

"This was actually pretty good. It's a nice sized bottle and I liked the design of it. I took this out with me while I was working in the yard pulling weeds and doing some planting around the front steps. It had a slightly off flavor when luke warm but was very crisp and tasted great when chilled. It didn't have that kinda odd aftertaste like it did when lukewarm. So. Overall...not bad even if it goes a little new age-y with the whole ""holistic way to hydrate your body, nourish your mind and sustain your soul."" bit on the bottle. Herms. Okay now. *raises right eyebrow* That...was a little weird. But, if it was put in front of me again... I'd drink it.

"The Unlikely Lady was my first read from Bowman and oh I had so much fun as as Jane and Garrett--who drive each other a spot crazy--are forced to endure each other's presence at a friend's wedding party. A little mistaken identity at a masquerade ball. a bit of meddling by those pesky friends and witty banter land the two in quite the different sort of engagement than they're used to and it was just a delightful ride to go along on as both their worlds were tilted on their sides.So today's review is a little different. It's all about...the heroine! I usually have so much trouble with heroines but Jane...I adored her. And here's why...10. She's courting scandal...just a little bit. Jane just wants to be left alone to her own pursuits and not have to worry about marriage and matchmaking. And her friends are the ones to help her come up with a little scheme to make that happen. I loved her and her friends. They're a little bit mischievous and would so give a mama grey hairs but they were fun, loved each other for exactly who they were and ready to do whatever was needed to help each other get the lives they wanted.9. She feeds a cat. She might not want to claim said cat but she frets and makes sure mama and babes are well fed. Jane's really tenderhearted under all her attempts to look otherwise. She might have talked to dogs too. And I just find that endearing.8. Teacake obsession. She's got a terrible sweet tooth and I instantly want to be her BFF to share in the noms. lol I love when a heroine enjoys her food.7. She wears glasses. Now. I know that might seem like a huge thing but as a spectacle wearing chick myself I really appreciate seeing a heroine rocking them too. They're so rare! My only complaint with that was the hero kept telling her she was so pretty whenever she wasn't wearing them. Hrms. Though he liked her with them as well but still...6. She's a bluestocking. I so love reading about them. She's smart, knows her own mind and was solid, quick and sharp.5. She's a fighter & competitive! During the house part an unexpected guest arrived that was rather catty and determined to steal the hero. But Jane, once she decided she was in, fought back and didn't let this shrew of a woman push her around. I loved that she was confident and willing to go for what she wanted.4. She's got quite the mouth! Oh yes. She's not afraid to say what she's thinking, throw a good barb, give her hero a little hell. The two had quite a...not love-hate relationship but a good bit oh you drive me crazy! there at the start which was very fun to watch.3. She snagged one yummy delicious man. Really. She's got good taste. Well, once she decides she's got a bit of a thing for Garrett and would rather kiss him than trip him. lol The two were great together. Had fiery chemistry and just fun interactions. There wasn't much in the actual heat department but there was a little and it was very nice when it did happen.2. She's very...matter of fact. Something might embarrass her but she'll deal and move on. She doesn't shock easily and often looked at things from an academic view I thought. I like that though.1. She's a book lover!!! I was in total girl crush mode. lol Stuck out in the rain? Devil if ruining her shoes or hair is a concern. Her book might get wet!! Move, people! Move! Heh. My kind of girl. She might have squee-d over a room of books too. I mean I have NO idea what that would be like <snorts>Really. The Unlikely Lady was charming, fun and had me chuckling. These two were quite the pair and it was so fun watching their lives change little by little. Definitely one to check out if you love a great heroine with spirit and sass. Bowman was a lovely discovery and I can't wait to read more from her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQOJDVNRO57M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFL6QKI#wasThisHelpful","R2GQOJDVNRO57M","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well now. That was an interesting romance. Older hero, younger heroine (by a nice sized clip)...a teacher and his student...big city guy and a girl from Kentucky. Need Me was a little edgy but oh it worked. It so worked.The quick of it is that Honey...she's crushing hard on her English professor. And she's ready to start her seduction of this tweed and glasses rocking man. An accidental encounter locked in a cabinet, finding out they're friends know each other and, well, attraction through the roof despite the taboo-ness of it all and sparks...they are a flying.I seriously loved Honey. She's young--only 19. But her spirit and everything about her was so easy to connect with. She's sweet, comforting, knows what she wants. Has an incredible mind and loves to take care of people and cook. I adored her. Wanted to be friends with her. Wanted to smack a difficult man for her.Which brings us to Ben. There was a spell there that I was kind of okay with him being killed off. Well, not really killed. The man has a fine cock, wears glasses and loves books something fierce. So it would have been a shame for all of that to die. But a maiming? Oh yes. A maiming was in order. Holy but Ben is very good as screwing things up. He does so gloriously. But thankfully he can fix that as well. And somehow I managed to love him and his sexy self too.Okay so the age difference and the teacher-student set up. I was real nervous about that but whew Bailey made it work. Just taboo enough to be exciting but not land in the creeper category. Brought in just enough drama and turmoil. Was sexy and total fantasy material. And lordy be. The heat was there as always. They're scorchers and will make a girl squirm just a bit.You really can't go wrong with a Tessa Bailey book. Fun, sexy, a little bit down and dirty. They're a hit every single time. She knocks out fantastic reads again and again and hot damn! it's a good time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SD3X7JWTXG2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M714LHI#wasThisHelpful","R2SD3X7JWTXG2H","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just want to <tackle hug> Tessa Bailey. Chase Me was oh so fun, sexy, touching and everything that is amazing about Bailey and her stories. It's been a bit since I've read one of hers and I swear I just wanted to roll around swoon a little in it all. lolThe quick of it is that Roxy has hit rock bottom and is doing whatever she has to to survive including delivering singing telegrams and belting out an ode to Louis and his mighty fine, erm, dangly bits---thanks to his hook up from the night before. It's...quite the first meet. Whew boy! And oh she catches the playboy's eye something fierce. So now not only does she have to find a job...and a place to live...and deal with new roommates who wanna be friends but she's got to keep her cool around one sexy cocky man with a dirty mouth and a thing for prickly females.The Characters:Pretty much. If I was going to have a man made for me...Tessa would be the one I called to whip that gloriously lickable beast up for me. Gah, but she can write a sexy as sin male. Hell. She even made the name Louis sexy. Alpha playboy with a good heart, a filthy mouth, wicked moves.  *pants*And Roxy. She totally pulled at my heart strings. She's had a rough go of life but is determined to see her dream of becoming an actress realized. She's a tough chickie who just keeps on fighting with everything she's got.The Romance:Ahhh these two. They're both a little bit broken and have avoided commitment any chance they could so the attraction they feel for each other...blasted inconvenient! But so so fun for us. Roxy was skittish as all get out and Louis really had to work hard for every inch. They were great together though. Had nice wit and banter and seemed to get each other. I loved seeing him woo and fumble and them both deal with each other. It was sweet, funny, lust-able and sometimes it just made me ache for both of them.The Sexy:Good Lord. The sexy. Bailey writes the absolute hottest reads. Toe-curling-make-a-girl-sigh deliciousness. She's my go to for dirty talking males and Louis was rocking a bit of it. He wasn't her most filthy mouthed but, oh yeah, he'll get a girl squirming.Really everything about Chase Me and watching these two fall in love and heal each others damaged bits was wonderful. I didn't want to put these two down for a single second. The secondary characters in this one--his friends and sisters and her roommates were just as fantastic as everything else. I can't wait to see what will happen with each of them. If you haven't read Bailey...go. Go now. You must read her! It doesn't matter which title you pick up. If it's got Tessa's name on it...it's going to be absolutely fantastic (and probably rocking a dirty talker). *swoons*","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JAS2TVECY0XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O11HCQE#wasThisHelpful","R1JAS2TVECY0XR","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh oh! One of my favorites....an American in England and dealing with all the stuffiness of the ton. An artist, no less! Heh. It's so fun seeing one of those 'crazy Americans' among the ton. And The Art of Sinning...such a very good time!The quick of it is that Yvette is in need of a husband...according to her big brother and he's decided to hire a famous painter to do up her portrait in hopes of getting her a bit more notice on the marriage mart. Though the painter in question has another idea of how to immortalize the lovely Yvette in paints and can't help but strike up a deal with her as well. One that'll bring them scandalously close together (yay) as his vision becomes reality and he helps her with her side of the bargain...a trip into the brothels.Soooo 5 Things about The Art of Sinning.I loved Jeremy and Yvette. They both have sharp wit and a good bit of sass to them which was really fun when they turned it on each other. The banter was just excellent. I liked them individually too and how they bucked societal norms and did their own thing.The romance wasn't too romancy. It was more of a connection forming than a full out swoon and wooing happening. But I liked it for them. Both had had trouble in love and trusting themselves ever again. So it worked. There was a little bit of heat but mostly just chemistry and tension humming between them. I think anything else wouldn't have fit them and their pasts all that well.I loved the art of it. Of Jeremy painting Yvette. Both the prim and proper portrait under her brother's protective eye and their late night rendezvous as she posed for his private masterpiece. It could be intimate and awkward in turn and was interesting watching the process happen.The one off: To get his secret painting of Yvette Jeremy had to help her track down a soiled dove in one of the brothels. Someone Yvette had to find because of a connection to her family. It definitely added an interesting element. She's a determined one and I liked seeing their adventures as the mysterious woman was sought and Yvette got an eyeful of another side of society.Aaaand then I've got to mention the secondary characters. Eeps! One of the things Jeffries does best is making you fall for all of the support cast. They're there just enough to make you totally smitten and excited but never overshadow the main couple. And gah! They were good here. The hints for future couples and storylines plus appearances of characters from previous series this one is a light spin off from... It totally made me squee a bit when those past characters or connections to them would come to light. Silly of me, maybe, but it left me giddy and smiling. To bring out that connection and love of them really is just a special talent I think.All in all, I enjoyed The Art of Sinning. It was a lovely start to a new series and was full of everything Jeffries does best...amazing characters, unique storylines and the perfect blending of serious moments and delightful humor and wit. You really can't go wrong picking up one of her books, in my opinion. Definitely looking forward to more of the Sinful Suitors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RB50WVVMD2QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WYUS#wasThisHelpful","R3RB50WVVMD2QP","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The heroine was a cat lady!! *fist pump* Heck yeah!! The Taming of the Billionaire was fun, sexy, full of kitties, had a fabulous heroine and one sexy beast of a hero that was a gaming geek to boot. Clare packed all kinds of make-a-girl-squee goodness into The Taming of the Billionaire, that's for sure.Now. For a while there I was thinking quite a few people in this book needed to be featured in surprise headline making ""bus mows them down"" accidents.When I finished it...I felt much the same. lol Thankfully the hero redeemed himself and no longer needed to go splat like a couple of the secondary characters.See. Edie's sister and Magnus's brother want to hook up but her sister claims she has no time because she must be there constantly to help Edie and Magnus's smitten brother refuses to work until he can get with this sister. Which is where Magnus comes into play. To get what he wanted--his brother to buckle down and work on their gaming project-- he went along with their scheme to distract the heroine and pretend to like her so his brother could hook up with her sister, get her out of his system and get back to work! Millions to be made and time is a wasting!Mmhm. That's where the bus mowing his jerky self down would come into play.But thankfully he kind of fell for his girl fairly quickly and realized he was a huge, erm, putz to have gone along with the scheme concocted by their siblings.I actually really loved this one despite the jerkery of some of the characters. Edie was a heroine I totally related to because, hello, I'm a cat lady too! She loves her kitties and helping those in need--she's a feline behaviorist. She struggles with an old injury to her knee that holds her back in a lot of ways and makes her reliant on help from her sister (of the bus mower downee fame), can be downright bitchy--though I kind of loved that too-- and totally embraces getting a little down and dirty.And Magnus. Well I loved his opposites. He's rich as sin and oh so sexy but he's also a coding nerd and can get lost for hours in the video games he's making. He doesn't always make the best decisions but he's also one that's hard to keep a hate-on for. And when the man grovels...he GROVELS! And does so in a spectacular make a girl cry way. Like. Best grovel ever. How all grovels should go. He is the king of grovelers which made for an amazing end to the book.They were good together too. Sexy and funny and full of all kinds of yummy passion. Some pretty hot sex scenes too as they spent time together and each wound up both tackling issues with their siblings--him with a slacker brother who was damaging their joint business and her with a manipulative sister that wore the facade of caring giver but really was playing everyone to get what she wanted.Oh and the kitties. There were LOTS of kitties. I was in kitty heaven! She had 7 of her own in all forms of special needs babies, there's some time as she works as a behaviorist, some rescue time and, well, Magnus becomes a cat dad with multiple chargers and goes from anti-cat to doting kitty lover. It was awesome.All in all, Taming of the Billionaire was a pretty fun read. Made me growly a couple times over some of the jerky side characters but I really did love the hero and heroine, the romance and one of the best 'big gestures' I've ever read. Clare rocked it and put together a blast of a read that'll leave all cat lovers totally smitten.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19B9HTQYEK9V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV1294O#wasThisHelpful","R19B9HTQYEK9V3","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the rare times I really curse myself for being a non-blurb reader. Often that leads to fun surprises. But, unfortunately, with Drive It Deep that wasn't the case. First though. I freaking love Cara McKenna's books. I rave about them often and they consistently get 4-5 stars from me but for the first time that wasn't the case and I'm not recommending one of her books. Which just guts me.Drive It Deep takes place two years prior to the previous book in the series despite being book 2.5. It's the story of the heroine from book two--Raina, who got a hea with another man in that book-- and Miah--one of her best friends-- having a failed romance all those years ago. Hooking up and then her breaking his heart. While the writing was impeccable, as always, and the sex scenes blisteringly hot a very nice man was hurt badly when he just didn't deserve it. If you read the series that's implied in the other books that they had a failed go at things but actually seeing it happen on page was a very different thing and not in a good way.Had it been the 0.5 release and what kicked the series off it might have worked. But at this point in the series it just didn't make sense and left me feeling sad and disappointed and a bit less in love with both the series and a heroine who I had adored in her own book. It actually has me not wanting to read anything else right now I'm feeling so bummed from it. There's obviously no HEA since Miah and Raina broke up (so she could eventually get together with her forever hero), things end badly and really while I'm perfectly fine with a heroine having a past of the sexual nature once she has her happily ever after and a hero of her own I don't want to hear or read about past hook ups. Same would apply to a hero.So this was a big miss for me. And not one I would recommend. I WOULD recommend McKenna's other books. She's an amazing writer and her characters are always unique and interesting and the sex incredible. Both book one and two of this series were fantastic. I'd add After Hours and Willing Victim to the list of ones to try out as well. Both were amazing and have stuck with me for quite some time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SCL5NSTP9BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZRB6#wasThisHelpful","R26SCL5NSTP9BH","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quick of it is that years ago Zack was in love but one day she just...disappeared. And he's spent 12 years searching for her and trying to survive the heartache of not knowing what happened to her. And now he's walked into a security job and recognizes a scene from a painting hanging on the wall. One only his lost love would have been able to paint. He's found her! Only Anna-Grace...is terrified of him and he'll be damned if he can figure out why. Add in a bit of drama from some bad guys, a little life or death and trying to figure out what happened all those years ago pretty much consumes Zack's life.So. Sounds like a pretty fantastic set up, right? I love second chance romances and was all in for Safe at Last especially seeing as how I enjoyed the previous books in the series. The mysterious disappearance of Gracie years earlier, the trauma and vastly differing recollections and the bad guys trying to get Gracie to hurt Zack meshed together for quite the start to the book. However, past the storyline concept nothing else really worked for me. Lack of progress for the majority of the book, a frustrating heroine and then things magically being perfect left me a very agitated reader and feeling pretty let down.Alright so my main issue was that I felt like I was trapped in a never ending cycle. You know. Everything just keeps repeating over and over and nothing moves forward. That was the first 60% of the book. Yes. 60% of the book was spent with him asking ""What did I do?? I loved you. I've searched for you. Explain to me what I did that made you leave me and hate me so much!"" and her response of...""How DARE you?! How dare you act like you're innocent and don't KNOW what you did!"". Over and over and over and over again. And then one more time for good measure. With a intermission between each verbal match of him being comforted by his teammates and lamenting not knowing what to do next. That 60% could have been whittled down to 3-4 chapters but instead was dragged out to the point of annoyance. Heck, the hero was even annoyed but still we kept going on with that.She did eventually tell him what happened but only after he finally forced her. And it was something incredibly awful. I'll give her that. But it wasn't anything he caused or knew about. That she wouldn't believe him and had thought the worst of him all those years really bothered me. Because of their dynamic there was next to no heat in this one either and the romance...nil. It was all him trying to get her to talk, her refusing, a bit of life or death happening, him finally having proof he was innocent and her going from sheer terror at the sight of him to finding out the truth and nearly instantly declaring she loved him and agreeing to marry him. Really now? *deep breaths* It was just absurd.Had the suspense or paranormal aspects held their weight I might have been okay but they both fell short as well.The suspense side of things was a slight continuation of the previous book and amounted to the bad guys seeking revenge by attacking the women who meant something to Zack and his teammates. It wasn't very fleshed out, there was nothing new happening and it felt like just a random add in instead of an actual storyline. Maybe 10% of the book actually had something to do with the suspense and a chunk of that was the final battle.On the para-side. The women in the series have psychic abilities of some sort. In Gracie's case she could read minds. However after the past trauma her power went dormant so there was next to none of that in the book. Only towards the very end did it come into play which was another let down since that aspect of the series has been great until this point.What finally did things in for me was an incredible case of multi-heroine TSTL syndrome. Gracie and the two previous heroines...become bratty and instead of allowing the men--who were trained and rescue people as a career--do their job the women used their psychic abilities to glean info and then withheld the info the men needed to save a teammate's life until they agreed to take the women with them. Into danger. When one was still recovering and weak from being nearly beaten to death and the other two weren't trained in any way. I just. Nope. I cannot stand women like that. They risked their lives unnecessarily and of course the heroine was nearly killed by the bad guy because she had no sense and really shouldn't have been there. I was done.All in all, Safe at Last, other than the initial concept and a small secondary storyline for a future couple, was a very big miss for me. I am curious to see what happens with the next couple's story though. I just hope there's actually something happening in their book and it's pulled together more than this one. The earlier books in the series were entertaining and I had a great time with them so I'm hopeful this was just an exception and not a hint of what's to come for the series because really the 30+ chapter book could have been amounted to about 4 chapters of actual story that was set on rinse and repeat. I adore Banks and her books but this was far from even mediocre for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JIQXQZ944B2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L19M2LO#wasThisHelpful","R3JIQXQZ944B2S","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fun, sexy, hilarious. Hot damn! I pretty much loved everything about Ironic. The characters, the sex, the humor. The one night stand and some surprises. Harper Miller rocked this short story hard and left me totally smitten.The quick of it is that Mimi finally has some free time after work's kept her crazy busy and she's....got some needs. A little browsing on a kink meet-up site and she's ready to get those met with one luscious specimen of a man and his very impressive cock.These two were fantastic. Mimi and Aden are both older-- 35 to 42--which, hello, I seriously LOVE. They're hot and adventurous and a spot kinky--though not too much. They know what they want and aren't afraid to take it.It was so fun watching them meet and flirt online then meet up for a night of hard and dirty sex. And *noms* All that sex was make-a-girl-fan-herself good.

"Well now, I might have found a new author to binge on. Do Not Forsake Me was a wonderful read. I'd say it's more family saga than romance but I loved it. From the characters--who were in their 40s-50s and married 26 years-- to the locale of the frontier to the danger surrounding this family at every turn. A legendary outlaw turned lawman who so many want to take down just to claim they were the ones to kill the legend. A reporter wanting to tell the story of the real man behind that legend. It was just fascinating at every turn.You don't read about a long married couple too often. And I loved that. Miranda and Jake were incredible and so unique. I loved that they were in their mid 40s&50s too! Had grown kids, grandchildren and a lifetime of being together. Had been through hell and back multiple times and were fierce, strong, loyal and completely, utterly, unquestionably smitten with each other. They know each others strengths and weaknesses and it was wonderful seeing them together as they faced danger once again and the fear of losing each other after so many years.While they had a strong storyline the book really was about the whole family. Everyone had their own storylines going that weaved together. The parents, their son finding love and romance again after being widowed, their daughter and her husband growing their family and overcoming something terrible. They wove together with ease and were just such an amazing group. They had a unique upbringing with their father being a famous outlaw, they hard some horrible rough patches over the years, but this family is solid. You'd never question if you were loved and safe with each other. I loved the feel of them all. The connection and dedication and just the pure love that radiated from all of them for each other. It was very sweet and touching.The frontier was a pretty ugly place and this family was smack in the middle of it due to Jake's former life as an outlaw and so many men wanting to be the one to claim killing the legend and his current job as a lawman sent out to hunt outlaws. Life is not easy for this family. They have people gunning for them constantly and it's brutal and scary and at times heartbreaking as they deal with evil men out to make Jake pay for being him. There were some scenes that were incredibly hard to read but I liked that it wasn't made out to be all roses and sweetness. This family had to fight hard and did whatever it took to survive.While this is the second book about this group--the first I'm guessing is the early years of Miranda and Jake falling in love and dealing with life over the years--it was easy to get into without having read book one first. I think in part due to Jeff...a reporter wanting to write Jake's story. It made getting to know the family and their past easier since he was slowly learning about their past too. I really liked him as a character as well.All in all, Do Not Forsake Me was a wonderful read. It's a hard story and a difficult life but an amazing family that inspired and shone brightly in their harsh surroundings because of the incredible love they had for each other. A definite winner!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7HTUF75TUVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG8TG9E#wasThisHelpful","RS7HTUF75TUVY","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fun and sexy! A little edgy too! Taming Lily was my favorite of the series as Lily uncovers a plot against the family cosmetics company and has to go on the run when the woman stars coming after her to cover her illegal activities. So...Lily runs to Hawaii to hide for a bit and figure things out only to runs into one damn fine man she can't seem to resist and that might be hiding some serious deceptions of his own.I loved Lily. She's a 'wild child' party girl as far as everyone else is concerned. She screws up, makes scenes and is just...out of control. But it's really quite an act. I liked seeing her away from everything. With her hair down, the fascade brushed aside and her just being her. She was easy to like, funny, a little at lose ends and trying to figure out what to do. And Max was crazy hot. He's not got the best intentions but his redeeming quality for me was he knew what he was doing was messed up and he battled himself internally over it. I liked him even if I wanted to strangle him a time or two but he pulled through and the heroine was fab.The heat is verra verra nice too. A wild vacation fling that's hot, steamy and a little reckless. They definitely heat things up and it was fun to go along for the ride as feelings start to get in the way and real life intrudes once again.I liked the storyline of Lily being on the run and trying to figure out how to take down the scummy employee and protect the family company. I liked it as it was happening and unfolding but the end was a bit lackluster. I expected more of an explosion with things but it just wrapped up fairly easily which was a bit of a let down even though it worked.Taming Lily was an easy read. Fast, sexy and fun. Perfect for a hot afternoon in when you just want a quickie that'll hit the right spots.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4MR7MAVIPHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEXJBZ4#wasThisHelpful","R2O4MR7MAVIPHG","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mmmm yummy rockstars. I Want You To Want Me totally rocked. The set up was pretty unique and fun. Derek's band is on tour and they're making a name for themselves but not always a good one. They're self destructing and if they don't pull it together they could lose everything. Which brings Violet into their lives. She's a minder (something I've never read about!) and is there to get them back on track and channel all of their energy into positive endeavors so they don't become yet another band that was taken down by partying, booze and drugs.Violet and Derek were great characters that struggled something fierce with their pasts and their warped childhoods. She was all alone growing up in foster care and it's really made her feel like she was unable to love or be loved and Derek grew up with a father who always ragged on him or put him down...and that continues to do so. They both have trust issues, trouble opening up and being vulnerable but gah they were both amazing and wonderful together. Had amazing talents and strength even when they didn't realize it. I loved his creativity and her unflappable nature and how she just rolled with the punches. The romance/heat was a bit slow going in some ways because of their job but I liked seeing them become close other ways than hitting the sheets and having a full out romance. Seeing them slowly get under each other's skin and become a safe place for each other and that finally turning into heat, love and romance.One thing I'm learning with Kelly is that it's not going to be easy. Oh man. She tortures her heroes and heroines. Sweet & sexy romances that have to battle for that happily ever after. Real life issues and insecurities that rear their ugly heads and damn near have you thinking there's no way past them. It's not always easy to read but man alive do you feel for the characters and want them to figure it out even if you have to shake them to get to that point. lolAll in all, I'm loving this series. Not just the invididual couples and romances but the whole band complete with their troubled crazy moments and wild lifestyles. They're an interesting group and always have me wanting a little more from them. I can't wait to see how each of their stories unfolds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I06WP2IIG18W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5DLWV2#wasThisHelpful","R1I06WP2IIG18W","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two words: Aussie. Doctor.*noms*Truly Madly Montana was fun, sweet, a little sexy and pretty dang unique in some ways.The quick of it is that Will and Millie are spending the summer working at the same hospital as he supervises her clinical rotation for med school. You'd think all was well and good but, alas, not so seeing as Will thinks of Millie as one of the guys which is a problem for her since she's totally crushing on him. And damn if it doesn't annoy her that he just does not see her as a woman. And so begins weeks of the clueless-- yet gorgeous-- male making an absolute flub of...pretty much everything Millie.These two were...special. Millie has a lot on her plate but was a great heroine. A little insecure about some things and rock solid in others. A good friend and a hard worker. And Will. Bless him and his surfer boy looks and Aussie accent but Will had a knack for saying/doing exactly the wrong thing. A sexy risk taker that's hiding a world of pain. I liked him even if he had some head shakeable moments.The romance was very slow going there at the start since, well, again...he's 10 types of clueless but once it got going I really enjoyed the two together and watching them try to balance working together, playing together and a few things they each tried to keep hidden (nothing bad just personal struggles).Something very different was that Millie was diabetic (since she was 16). And it played a big part in the storyline. You hardly ever see a character with a chronic illness that's addressed more than just a passing mention. But it's a big part of her life and the storyline with the daily battles some life or death scares and how it impacts her confidence. It was realistic and interesting and I really liked the inclusion of it.The only thing that didn't work for me was a second romance that was told. I really liked the second romance and loved the characters (Millie's best friend and a new cop in town). They were heart touching and sweet. But the transitions between the storylines were very abrupt and I'd forget completely about the other storyline while reading whichever romance was being told. Which bothered me a bit. I think I would have preferred seeing two separate novellas than splitting my time between the two.All in all, I really enjoyed Truly Madly Montana. Lowe brought together incredible characters with unique lives, stories and experiences to create lovely romances that were funny, touching and just a little steamy too. I'll definitely be back for more of what this town has to offer.There's something about Bear Paw, Montana and the people who live there. Both exasperating and endearing and everything that's wonderful about living in a small town and the closeness it can bring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2LPQRNCOQM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5DLWOE#wasThisHelpful","R1K2LPQRNCOQM4","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh yes. Tara Sue Me is quickly climbing the ranks of my go-to erotic authors! The Collar was an emotional and sexy ride as former lovers, Dena and Jeff, are brought back together by their BDSM group and a scare in Dena's personal life. Having to fight through memories of a horrible tragedy that pulled them apart years earlier and finally find some closure and maybe some hope too.The quick of it is that these two were serious. They lived together. She wore his collar. Everything was wonderful until tragedy struck. Something neither of them could have prevented but that devastated and just broke them as a couple and individuals and at the time they just couldn't overcome it. It's been a few years and they're still part of the same BDSM play group and having to see each other now and again. The attraction's never died and when asked to do a demo together it flares brightly. Especially when a worrisome outside force pops up and she needs his professional security services on top of it.Dena and Jeff. I enjoyed them both so much. They're fiery and passionate. They moved together amazingly in the bedroom (or dungeon as the case may be) but outside of those doors they clash something fierce. They're from different worlds. she's definitely NOT submissive outside of the bedroom and hurts from the past are all working against them. But that chemistry! I loved watching them grow up. Deal with the past, with guilt and the pain and try to overcome it. The book bounces back and forth chapter to chapter between present day and as their romance originally stared 7 years later and how things fell apart. Sometimes that doesn't work at all but Tara did an amazing job with it and it flowed beautifully.Heat-wise. It's steamy but not over the top erotic. For a BDSM series I'd call it light. Really if the BDSM wasn't an element I'd put this one as mainstream for heat. So light-erotic and a good transition book for those wanting to check out the BDSM genre but that are nervous about it. I did love the sexy bits though. Their previous connection really made things intimate and gave it that extra layer of yum.There was a tiny bit of suspense as Dena starts receiving threatening notes and phone calls. It was a great way to bring the two together since he runs a security business. But it kind of felt like an afterthought. I was able to figure it out pretty much right from the get-go so it wasn't all that surprising or captivating from a suspense side of things. It worked as a storyline device though.All in all, The Collar was a sexy romp and made for a beautiful romance as two broken souls found a way to move past the heartache of their past and find a future together. Tara Sue Me is definitely one to check out if you enjoy erotic romances and a bit of BDSM. My only 'thing' with them wasn't too big of a deal but I never really felt IN the story. I very much felt like I was watching a show from the outside. Which wasn't a big deal at all to me just a different feel while reading.**Side note-- Boo on the covers. They make no sense for the series. I'm so anti this 50 Shades trend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B0IGRC19I2ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF7DW#wasThisHelpful","R2B0IGRC19I2ZD","A353K0UEDMX3PH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A353K0UEDMX3PH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michelle Miller's novel, the Underwriting, is an interesting story of the financial end of an IPO.  I know, that doesn't sound that exciting, but it was very interesting, and Miller's characters and their motivations and pressures make it a good read.While the novel presents itself as a mystery, that plot device is merely a prop to present the excellent characters and put them in motion.  Indeed, of the two major issues I have with this novel, the first is a surprising singular lack of character development/ explanation as to why the founder of the tech company picks this particular Wall Street player to handle the IPO. Oh, the author tosses a couple of paragraphs at the reasoning, but it wasn't enough to ring true or even make much sense to me as a reader.  This is even more confusing because everyone else in this book is so fully realized and their motivations are what drives the book so well.The other problem I had was the wrap-up of the mystery itself. To be honest, I forgot there was a mystery at play, because it was such a non-factor in the majority of the book.  But the author went to the trouble of adding in a mystery, and wrapped it up poorly.  In fact, there didn't seem to be much real connection between the mystery and the rest of the story.... almost like the author said ""well, let's add *this* in and try to draw the mystery/thriller demographic into my character piece.""This was a good novel with a poor mystery hanging off its shoe.  Read it for the characters and main plot, not the tacked on mystery, which was unnecessary to the main story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TLMKCWP5B1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399174850#wasThisHelpful","R23TLMKCWP5B1U","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Christopher Golden's ""Tin Men"" is a fast paced military sci-fi novel which has an interesting premise, and only minor flaws.Set in the near future, where soldiers remotely pilot metal human-shaped robots (the ""Tin Men"") the way drones are operated, Golden presents us with a plausible ""America as policeman"" scenario, and its consequences.  When anarchists disable technology world-wide, the novel follows three storylines about groups dealing with the aftermath.  A group of Tin Men at an embassy in Damascus must protect the embassy and adjust to the loss of communications and direction from home.  In Athens, the U.S. president and other global leaders attend a G-20 summit.  At a military base in Germany, the ""home base"" of the Tin Men, the military struggles to understand what just happened and why all Tin Men are cut off globally.To be fair, the author does a decent job of explaining why these robots work in a world suddenly bereft of technology, and while I don't know if that is technically correct, it was good enough for me to suspend my disbelief and move on.Characterization is there, but it is action and pacing that shine through in this book.  It is a fun ride for fans of near future military sci-fi.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ED18F4JAV9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034554885X#wasThisHelpful","R33ED18F4JAV9H","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These speakers are just alright.  They sound OK, but not great.  They are portable, which is a plus, but they have to be fairly close to each other, particularly in the setup phase.The setup was VERY difficult.  It doesn't help that they didn't come with an instruction manual, and no such manual was available online.  And if you need to call them to find out how to set it up, just know that they don't work nights or weekends, so you may have to call from work, if you have a day job.All told, you can get cheaper speakers that sound as good, and are a lot easier to set up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EJGBQUMUDPI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBROEFK#wasThisHelpful","R2EJGBQUMUDPI6","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need a chair for your desk, this is a great one.  It is comfortable, and is light, not the bulky, heavy item that some office chairs are.  This is due, at least in part, to the back being mesh, rather than an additional cushion and upholstery.ASSEMBLY:  This was *very* easy to assemble.  It took only a few minutes, and did not require any tools from me, as the allen wrench, the only tool needed, came with the bolts.  Pieces are easy to identify in the instruction sheet, and the bolts are provided in separate batches on a single package, so you don't mix them up.  It even came with extras of each, in a section identified as ""extra parts.""  It literally couldn't be easier to assemble.FEEL:  The chair feels sturdy, but comfortable.  There is flexibility, but not so much ""give"" that it feels like you are straining the chair, or that it might flip over.SEAT: The seat is smooth fabric, so it will not attract much dirt (or crumbs, if you eat in the chair).  The padding is nice.  It is easy to adjust up and down, and feels (and sounds) smooth when adjusting.ARMS:  The arms are hard plastic, but are smoothed on the edges to be comfortable.  The arms do not feel like they are cutting into you, and they have enough space on the sides so you don't feel confined in the chair.BACK:  The mesh material is comfortable, and lets the air flow through.  It provides enough, but not too much support.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HO8SCDPRRYRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVKEZQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1HO8SCDPRRYRX","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The start of a military sci-fi trilogy, Virtues of War has an engaging setting and plot, but has some flaws with the main characters.  All told, I enjoyed it, and will probably read the next installment, but I won't be desperately awaiting the next novel, as I have withbooks that *truly* captivate me.Set in the future in which mankind has spread to the stars, Virtues of War follows the adventures of a few members of the military as they perform their duties, beginning with an investigation of possible weapons smuggling among some outlying colonies.  What happens from there is an interesting series of events that could affect the entire Terran government.  There were twists and turns as matters escalated, and none of the developments seemed terribly far-fetched in the universe that the author creates.  It builds until a strong finale, which nicely sets up future novels.The problem I had was in the characters.  The main characters are Katja, (a soldier, and the closest thing we have to a main protagonist), Tom Kane (commander of a small ship and ambitious military climber), ""Breeze"" Brisbois (an even more ambitious climber and intelligence officer, in that order) and Jack Mallory (small ship pilot and supportive character).  The author goes to some lengths to make them individuals with multi-dimensional characters, but it just doesn't work for me.  While the heroes are flawed and the antagonists occasionally helpful, it felt like the author intentionally tacked these traits on, rather than having the characters truly three dimensional.  Unrequited love abounds, and people regret their actions, but much of it feels forced.I probably will read the next installment, but because of the flaws, it remains a ""probably"" rather than an ""I can't wait"" matter.Somewhat RECOMMENDED.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSSLIVOA48U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783294205#wasThisHelpful","R3PSSLIVOA48U4","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The BlackBerry Leap is a fairly entry level cost smartphone, and is clearly following the trend of on-screen keyboards, now that consumers moved away from individual keys on the device.  The first reaction is that it is yet another smartphone, without being the cutting edge business device that BlackBerry used to be.  This is perhaps not giving the Leap its due, particularly since one of the selling points is the security provided by the device.  I cannot speak to the technical aspects of this security, so I will just take it on faith that this is a secure device, particularly considering the low cost.As a recent smartphone adopter, I struggled with the iPhone vs. android decision, and ended up with the iPhone.  This review is from the perspective of an iPhone user.  All told, the BlackBerry Leap doesn't make me regret the iPhone choice.Tactile: The Leap feels pretty good, about the same weight as my iPhone 6.  The screen is clear and bright, although images don't seem quite as sharp.  I wish the corners were rounded a bit more, as this didn't feel very ergonomic.Cameras:  The main (away) camera is very solid.  It takes good, crisp pictures.  The front facing camera is simply OK, but will provide a slightly grainier image for selfies, etc.  The iPhone camera has a greater variety of functions.Data Storage:  Equipped with a minimal 16 GB storage, the Leap makes expanded memory mandatory.  Fortunately, with MicroSD, you can supplement it.  My iPhone has more storage, but is not expandable, and the Leap can potentially expand to provide more storage than my iPhone.Battery Life:  Substantially longer for the Leap.  A better, more efficient battery.Phone functions:  It does them just fine.  You won't be disappointed or delighted in this aspect.Apps:  Comes loaded with Amazon Apps, and has a good selection of apps for use.  The pre-loaded apps are acceptable, but not great, particularly when contrasted with those on an iPhone.  Both come with map and alarm clock functions, but the Leap versions just aren't as advanced.All told, there is nothing particularly wrong with the BlackBerry Leap.  It will work just fine, and has a superior battery.  The price is very good.  But use just feels lacking, and the overall impression is that BlackBerry is playing catchup with the other smartphones, and still has a good ways to go.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17866ZJPIZQI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UH9AMKM#wasThisHelpful","R17866ZJPIZQI0","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meh!  This cream goes on a bit heavy and greasy and I got a little in my eyes and they started to tear.  The outside of the jar says it is 24 hour soothing cream for normal or sensitive skin and boasts: ""a real source of beauty, this fondant cream ensures continuous hydration for 24 hours; it helps boost the skin's water reserves (8 plant Milks,Aloe Vera Sap) and maintain optimum moisture levels (Salicornia).  It soothes and significantly reduces sensations of discomfort and irritation of sensitive skin (Almond and Orange White Flowers).  The skin feels fresh, soft, and plumped.""You would think from this description that it is an all natural cream.  However, when you look at the actual ingredient list, the chemicals are no different than any other over the counter cream such as ""Glycol Palmate"", ""Tocopherel"".  There are natural ingredients too on the list, but many of them are further down.  I feel that this is a little bit misleading.As far as plumping and retaining moisture, I fear that this benefit might be offset by clogging pores and causing acne.  The cream makes my skin soft, but feels heavy on my skin.  I don't see any visible ""plumping"" effects, just looks greasy.

"Before I tested these, I thought noise cancelling headphones were just an expensive auditory scam..... I have always wondered what the ""noise cancelling"" headphone phenomenon was. I mean, don't all over the ear headphones muffle noise while providing sound from the speakers?  Well, yes, but that's not the key to noise cancelling headphones.These Bose noise cancelling headphones are remarkable.  They emit a series of sound waves that neutralizes background noise frequencies.  I tested them in an airport and on a plane.  Without them, there was significant background noise.  When I put these on, it was slightly muffled.  Then I flipped the switch and turned them on.....quiet.  blissful quiet.Not perfectly silent, but SERIOUSLY reduced background noise.

"I went to use this product and removed the plastic when it dropped on my tile floor.  The bottle is actually thin glass covered by plastic.  I was able to salvage some sans pieced of glass and found that it made my skin a bit sensitive.  The directions say you are supposed to use a couple of drops mixed in with your moisturizer, but I don't see the benefit in taking this extra step.  Why not make a product that already has it in it?  The serum itself goes on very very oily and is fairly strong.  It has a pleasant light citrus smell.  I had to remove it after about a hour or so because it was so oily and seem pretty potent.  While my skin did stay sensitive for about a day or so, I did not experience any exfoliation effects.  So far, not terribly impressed.  But, perhaps someone who was able to use the whole bottle might have a different experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SB1F4E1G86Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI1CNRC#wasThisHelpful","R1SB1F4E1G86Z2","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:40 Mins This Contigo Water Bottle does keep things extremely cold.  I tested this by putting ice cubes in the bottle, sealing it up, and waiting 10 1/2 hours to open it, to test the insulation.  The results, as shown in the video, show very little melting, and most of the ice remained frozen.  This is impressive in a water bottle.My only criticism is the locking mechanism is actually *too* tight for one-handed opening.  Maybe I just need to do it more, to break in the coking mechanism, but it was pretty difficult to engage and disengage the lock, and I don't think I could do it with only 1 hand, as the marketing suggests.All told, this is an attractive, effective water bottle, and I am very happy to own it.RECOMMENDED.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25E9Q5PI92RBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNX8JM#wasThisHelpful","R25E9Q5PI92RBG","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The brush is very light and easy to handle.

"I have to say I am really quite impressed.  I have used many chemical peel products in my time including prescription Retina A as a teenager.  I have also used various strengths of Glycolic Acid ranging from 5% to prescription strength 30%.  This amount of 10% is ""just right""--just enough to make you peel, but not so much that it leaves you red and flaky.I am an ingredients nut and I for the most part like to know what I am putting on my face.  I saw an ingredient Myristyl Nicotinate and looked it up.  Apparently this ingredient helps protect skin from skin cancer.  That is very thoughtful of them!  That is not to say that there are not any chemicals in this product, but there are some natural ones as well including Aloe Leaf Juice, Myritilus Fruit Extract, Willow Bark Extract, Sugar Cane, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Fruit Extract, and Sugar Maple Extract.The process is quick and easy and the product does not have any scent for those who are sensitive to fragrances.  It is a 2 step system: 1) Apply the detoxifying mask and leave on for 1 minute, then 2) Apply a thin layer of the Activator (Glycolic Acid) and leave on for 3-5 minutes (I went for the full 5 minutes).  Then, wash it off with a damp washcloth.  That's it!The instructions say to use it once a week, and I really would not use it more than that.  From the first moment of application you feel it ""tingling"".  Then after you wash it off, you can feel it working.  Day 2 my skin felt sensitive but no peel yet.  By day 3 I was able to slough off a think layer of dead skin cells with a loofah in the shower.  Unlike Retina A, you do not continue to flake and peel during the day.  Afterwards I did see a significant difference in my skin.  It felt more taught and the fine lines were diminished.  This one for me is a home run!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DKHH4MM0PD95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGB1J3K#wasThisHelpful","R3DKHH4MM0PD95","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This follow up to Natchez Burning is a powerful, emotional work.  It should not be read unless you've first read Natchez Burning, as the stage is fully set in that wonderful novel.  Here, there is a brief (10 page) prologue summary, to get a reader up to speed (or remind you of what happened last...) but it's real no substitute for the first book, unsurprisingly.The Bone Tree takes our main characters on the next leg of their journey into this tale of greed, power, and racism that has festered for decades.  While the last book finished with some degree of victory for our heroes, it was incomplete, and left a great deal still to do.This novel should not be spoiled, and I won't do it here, but Greg Iles uses this novel to continue to create rich characters and place them in situations where they must wrestle with right and wrong, and the consequences of their actions.  They must weigh the greater good and justice against personal costs, and sometimes, the costs are more than they expect or can bear.My only criticism of this novel is that it could have been edited slightly more, and the pacing lags in the middle.  Far be it from me to tell Mr. Iles how to write, as I have devoured every book he has written, as far as I can recall, but I think nobody would complain if this book were pared down to ""only"" 600 or so pages.  I don't think the plot or characterization would have suffered, and it might have made the novel un-put-downable rather than simply ""very good.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB7R8IIV1BYUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062311115#wasThisHelpful","RB7R8IIV1BYUD","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am not sure that using this every day will make a difference.  When I want a peel, I want to see a little more results.  On the positives though, there was no redness or irritation.  I would only recommend this product if you had an event to go to and needed a last minute peel that did not look red or obvious.Among some ingredients I cannot pronounce, the main active ingredients appear to be Glycolic Acid, Citric Acid, Lactic Acid,  Aloe Leaf Juice Powder, Calendula Flower Extract, and Ginger Root Extract.

"This is a decent case, but nothing exceptional.  The look is nice, if somewhat understated.  It goes on pretty easily, and the main interchangeable panels pop in and out fairly easily.It comes with the three panels, which match the 3 colors currently offered for the iPhone 6, and that can result in a camouflaging of the case, because the majority of the backing will be similar to the color of the phone.  With 3 panels, you can, of course, change the color from your actual phone, but there are no eye-catching options.My main issue with this is that it *feels* flimsy.  The packaging says it offers ""military-grade protection,"" but as pretty as the marketing is, it just doesn't feel particularly protective.  It may BE that protective, but it doesn't feel that way and instill me with confidence in the case.  I also suspect that if dropped from a small height, the colored panel will pop off, possibly breaking.  I've not tested it, and have nothing I can point to in support of this, but it is the overall impression I have when I hold the case and its panels in my hand.All told, the case itself is OK, but I was hoping for more from the great marketing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R221YZBU5A4HG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9E10UE#wasThisHelpful","R221YZBU5A4HG1","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hard action figure to describe, because it looks SO great, but has some serious design issues that make it hard to enjoy as a toy.LOOK:  The look is fantastic, with the bright, eye-catching armor and the cuddly unarmored figure.

The unarmored form has trouble standing on its own, but it can be done after a little experimentation.  The armor snaps on, but it is hard to make the panels *stay* on if you are moving the arms and legs for action poses.

"I bought this apron for my wife.  It seemed very stiff out of the package, so much so that the little ruffles at the bottom were more like creases that did not move.  However, when my wife tried it on, it was still very cute.  There are ties around the neck and waist so it is adjustable.  It has that cool retro 1950's throwback style.  When trying it on, my wife said she felt like she should be making cupcakes!We decided to wash it to see if it would make any difference in the stiffness.  After all, what is the point in having an apron with ruffles that aren't flirty and feminine?  The package says ""hand wash cold only"", but we put in the delicate cycle in the washing machine with cold water and line dried it.  This seemed to make a BIG difference.  Although, the package says ""100 % cotton""  and describes the apron as ""soft cotton"" on the package, it really feels more like nylon even after washing.  Perhaps this is for stain resistance?  However, I am a bit concerned that the label also says ""it may be flammable"" which makes absolutely no sense for something to be worn while cooking.After washing and line drying the apron, it looked even more adorable.  All in all, it is very flattering while doing the job of protecting one's clothes from splatter and spillage while entertaining...as long as you don't stand too close to the flame.

"My wife received this blush.  Here are her thoughts:I would consider the quality of this blush akin to MAC or Bare Minerals.  It goes on very well (one or two strokes is all you need). The color saturation is very good which means the color really shows, and it appears silky and radiant on the skin.  What I like best about this blush is that it combines the ""sheer radiance"" powder look of Bare Minerals with that of a blush in one product.  If you look really closely there are little gold flecks that give you a glow.  The color is more of a peachy-pink which looks good on most skin tones (fair-medium).It last very well!  I went shopping and after pulling clothes on and off over my head several times and the blush stayed pretty well.  Many times, I find that blush wears off by the end of the day.The packaging is lovely, the compact is rather small (approx 2 in. x 2 in and 1/4 in deep) and comes with a mirror (sadly, no applicator).I deducted one star because the color on the side of the box in more pinky (like Shade 01), than reflective of this color (shade 03).  If you are judging the color by the color on the box, you might be disappointed.Overall, I would consider buying this blush again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28AC84RG1643X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR66V60#wasThisHelpful","R28AC84RG1643X","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the start of a series, and it has an interesting premise.  That said, I could not truly immerse myself in it because of the dialogue, particularly that between aliens.  It was entirely too full of modern-day American phrases, despite taking place in space thousands of years ago in large part.  For example, if you have never been to earth, and it is 5,000 years ago, how are you using phrases like ""like a fly stuck in honey"" or ""greenhouse gasses"" or quoting the A-Team  tv show: ""I love it when a plan comes together""?

"I got this for my wife.  Here are her impressions:I was excited to order this via Vine after salivating over it but not wanting to shell out $100.  I do like that it comes with a heating pad and a removable thermal guard to practice with.  Since I had never used the Instyler I first tried with the guard on and I'm glad that I did because even at the lowest temperature the barrel is extremely hot!  The Instyer Max also comes with a cool tip that you can screw on to the top.  There is also a comb, but I find that is only useful if you are trying to make sections to style someone else's hair.  What is different about the Instyler Max and the regular Instyler is that the Max rotates in two different directions.  Changing directions is as easy as clicking the iron twice.  However, I found it difficult to tell which direction it was spinning.The paperwork includes reference to their website for video on how to use, but I found that these videos were for the single direction spinning Instyler.  My overall experience was that it did give me more body than my regular curling iron.  However, I have fine hair and found that the curl barely held and was no match for my $24 John Frieda ionic curling iron.  My impression is that this is really a straightening tool that also adds some shape, not for women with fine straight hair.  Also, I wish they had a video on www.myinstyler.com for this version since it does spin in two different directions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGFICMGGH7LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5N5KZO#wasThisHelpful","RQGFICMGGH7LJ","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Black and Decker CM3005S 12-Cup Tea and Coffeemaker is a good compromise for a coffee an tea household with limited kitchen counter space.  As many combination products are, this is good, but not great, at delivering some of the intended promise.  All told, it does what is expected pretty well.APPEARANCE:  As you can see from the picture, it is a nice, sleek, modern design which will compliment stainless appliances.  The clock is usable for timer programming, but is not big enough if you intend to use it as a visible clock.COFFEE:  This device made coffee just as I would expect, and did a good job.  I've never tried a B&D coffee maker before, but I've tried other brands, and it is just as good as the others I've tried.  It does what you expect it to do.TEA:  This is where the CM3005S doesn't perform as well.  Tea aficionados will tell you that you get the best flavor out of tea by using boiling water, and while this product certainly provides warm water, it is not steeping-hot warmth.  If this is you, you may want a tea pot and a coffee maker, rather than a combo product.  Some people don't care about the boiling water, and just want a cup of tea they can drink readily, and the CM3005S will do this.  You may want to clean between coffee and tea uses to avoid having tea that tastes more like coffee.FILTERS:  The filters are a nice feature, particularly if you are ecological and don't want to add paper filters to the world with each use.  The flip side is that cleaning them is more time-consuming that dumping something into the trash.  I've been told that coffee grounds down a drain can eventually lead to the pipe clogging up, and so I'm reluctant to do that.  But make up your own mind about how you want to deal with filters, either in this or another product.  The positive is that if you decide you want a permanent filter, this comes with them already.All told, this product will make very good coffee and will present drinkable tea.  With the combination of functions, this presents a smaller footprint that is good for small kitchens, such as those in apartments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFX39KAEBVKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I43C#wasThisHelpful","R2BFX39KAEBVKT","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tested out this vacuum today, and it has good and bad elements to it.GOOD:1)  On carpet, this vacuum has a LOT of power.  It probably has the best carpet suction of all the vacuums I've tried in the last few years, and I've tried several.  It got a lot of grime out of the carpet, and the agitator works very well.  It didn't tangle up with carpet fibers like others.2)  The price point is pretty great for what you get.3)  It's light in weight.4)  The cord is longer than other corded vacuums, so you won't have to unplug as often to switch to another outlet.BAD:1)  The setting for bare floors isn't truly a bare floor setting.  The agitator keeps spinning, and will shoot some debris out of the back toward your feet.  It just didn't work as well for hard surfaces as it did for carpet.2)  Because the suction and agitator are so strong, you have to push it pretty hard over carpet.  It requires more physical effort than other vacuums. I prefer cordless vacuums, as they make the whole ordeal of vacuuming easier.Nevertheless, I would recommend this for an inexpensive vacuum.

"I can't speak highly enough of this product.  I've uploaded before and after pictures of my headlight (the green car).The whole process took less than two minutes..... first, pour water on the headlight and scrub it with the included scrubbing square, then flip it over and polish.  Dry with the included microfiber towel.  Then put on the included gloves, tear open the wipe package, and just wipe it once over the headlights.It really is that easy, and that effective.

"I've read all of James Rollins' novels, and the Sixth Extinction is a worthy addition to his Sigma Force novels.  This is the tenth in the series, and was published on the tenth anniversary of the first book in the series (Subterranean).  With this in mind, it is not surprising that the author doesn't spend too much time on the backstory of the main characters, because on the tenth time out, a reader probably remembers.  The flip side is that if you care about character development and depth, but haven't read a Sigma Force novel, this may not be the one to start you off.Starting off with a radio signal from a secret research base in northern California warning of a breach and ending with the directive ""Kill us all,"" this novel puts Sigma Force into action in an effort to stop the spread of danger which may send the planet into the latest (the Sixth, of course) great extinction that changes the fate of life on the Earth.  From there, the action flows across the globe to various exotic locales as Sigma searches desperately for the solution to the danger and encounters some of the fascinating creatures that Rollins' books are populated with.This is a fun ride, with adventure, science, and thrills.  If you liked his other novels, you will find this one just as much of a pleasure.For fans of Rollins and adventure novels, RECOMMENDED","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17B9FSGUFSZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061784818#wasThisHelpful","R17B9FSGUFSZX","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I was getting just another travel mug when I picked this item up.  Boy was I wrong!  I know this is a travel mug, and I should not be this impressed, but I LOVE this mug.  I am shocked at how much I like it and how well it works.  The insulation on this mug is incredible.  I tested it out to see how well it worked, and here are the results:Cold Test:  I filled the cup with ice... no water, just ice.... closed the lid and let it sit on the counter.  If I had left a regular cup of ice on my counter, it would take about 20 seconds to start melting.  After about 1 1/2 hours, I opened it and held it upside down over the sink to see how much water melted and drained out.  Not a single drop.  No melted ice whatsoever.  I closed it up again and waited another 2 hours, and when I held it over the sink, about 1/4 teaspoon of water trickled out.  This was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay beyond expectations.Hot Test:  I made myself coffee and poured it fresh from the pot.  I usually let it sit for about 5 minutes, as I like it to cool off.  Because of the previous Cold test, I knew I shouldn't put the lid on or it would not cool off to a palatable temperature for a long time.  So I let it sit, uncovered, for about 1/2 hours before I went to work, then I put the lid on and went out the door.  After that amount of time, the temperature was just about right.... at the hotter end of my preferred drinking spectrum, but in the drinkable zone for me.  And it stayed there for the half hour it took to get to work, it didn't become lukewarm like in other travel mugs.  In fact, it probably would have stayed hot longer, but I finished my coffee.There are some notable design features.  I really liked the rubber grip.  It is comfortable in my hand, and makes gripping really easy and natural.  During my Hot test, I noticed that the lid got warm, but nothing below the lid was warm at all.  You couldn't tell there was hot liquid in in if you touched the grip or the metal.  Some people have put in their reviews that the lip of the mug makes drinking difficult.  I did not have this reaction, and in fact I don't understand how anyone would find it difficult, but a couple of people have identified that in their own personal experiences.If you need an insulated travel mug, this one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJLCHI1OV7Y4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR77HFE#wasThisHelpful","R3DJLCHI1OV7Y4","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been years since I read Robin Hobbs' first set of books with Fitz and the Fool, so (like a lot of others) when I saw a new adventure, I had to try it out.  I'm glad I did, but not without some reservations.This story picks up in FItz adulthood.... he's in his forties, and life has slowed down considerably for him as he lives with wife Molly.  But before you know it, he is unwillingly drawn back into an adventure.This book has good points and not so good points.... The author devotes a great deal of the book to the aging of its characters, and how their perspective on a lot of things change as the age.  It felt very much like the author was trying to share some personal insights.  But mostly, it is *slow* for the first 80 percent of the book.  Don't get me wrong, it is good characterization for the new cast that joins Fitz, and at times it can be emotional stuff, but it's still slow pacing and drags.  Unfortunately, about half of the new characters I actively dislike (I'm sure the author wanted me to) and one main character we are supposed to like I just found unsettling and a little creepy.  So in the end, I like Fitz, but only one of the others, and it's not the main one the author wants me to like.  Maybe it's necessary and maybe not, but I felt in the ""not"" camp for the most part.  It felt in need of an editor.  At the same time, it really allowed the reader to get into the skin of Fitz before the adventuring.Having said that, it does pick up, but you have to be willing to work through the first *600* pages for the story to take off (for the remaining 70 pages or so).  Even through it's a lot to ask for, it was worth it, because I really felt like I was getting reacquainted with an old friend, and it was easy to do.... I didn't feel like I needed to re-read the other books.If you are willing to put in the work, you will be glad you did, it's a very good read.  If you are looking for something faster, without the pre-action character building, this might not be your first choice.For me, it is cautiously RECOMMENDED.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DPIZ8ZNRNBLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392425#wasThisHelpful","R1DPIZ8ZNRNBLX","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago, I read Robopocalypse: A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries), and while I enjoyed the read and found it well paced, it didn't feel particularly original, seeming too similar in style to Max Brooks World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War.  For the record, I found it more engaging than WWZ (which sucked all the fun out of a zombie apocalypse), but Robopocalypse *felt* too similar in style and overall theme, so I dinged it for originality.  This second book in the series, on the other hand, is much more original.After the destruction of most of the old civilization, the survivors of the Robopocalypse must regroup and figure out how to live among the ruins of the old world.  And while they do so, they face new societal challenges as well as new dangers.Daniel Wilson, I applaud your pulling off a difficult trick:  making a robot apocalypse only the beginning of a greater conflict.  This does not feel like a rehashing of the first tale, and brings interesting new elements to the table.While the story has a satisfying conclusion (rather than just a cliff hanger ending), it is clearly leaving the door open for further storytelling.RECOMMENDED","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMLVSITQWWEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537093#wasThisHelpful","R2EMLVSITQWWEF","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed the first book in this series, but this one was not as gripping.  The author failed to expand the interesting world he developed, instead populating it with some cliched characters who didn't seem to bring any freshness to the story.  They seem to move the story along alright, but this suffers from a phenomenon common in trilogies:  The first installment is great, and brings an interesting new world and plot to the fore, and the next two books are only one complete story, but stretched out over two books worth of pages with a cliffhanger in the middle.As for the plot itself, it is just *slow* and a bit repetitive, and significant portions of  it involve characters I just didn't care about.  By the time the author got to the interesting part, it was the end of the book, and I was only then getting really engaged with the read.  It made me think that if he had edited the story better, this and the next book would make a very good single book, but as is, is only a decent read.... well written, but flawed.As the first book is being made into a movie, I will be curious to see if the story benefits from the mandatory editing and shortening of a film adaptation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XECEQ7XP4NL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477823948#wasThisHelpful","R1XECEQ7XP4NL5","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It holds many of my scarfs, but I would not want to put too many of them on this because it is more difficult to see them when they are stacked on top of one another.

It has four ventilation holes for transporting those sweaty items. The zippers are a hard plastic and seafoam green color.  There are silver buckles at the strap which look very sturdy.  The bag is very roomy with room for a regular yoga mat with two blocks stacked on top. There is enough room to zipper it shut.  For that extra thick yoga mat, there is room for it and the blocks without zipping it shut.

If you want a lot of laughs with your plot, this is a very satisfying fun experience.Martin Banks is a regular young man who tinkers with his computer and learns that reality is a giant program and we are al just subroutines..... that can be altered. Unfortunately, the alterations do not go unnoticed, and Martin is fleeing for his life.... back to medieval England.  But who wants to spend life as a serf in the Middle Ages?  Wouldn't it be a better life to dazzle people with your modern knowledge as a ""wizard""?  ............. and that's when the troubles really begin.This debut novel is truly funny and an awful lot of fun to read.

"This is a hard review to write, because discussing the movie and what makes it work (or not) lends itself to spoiling, and I work very hard not to do that. Having said that, ASM 2 is a movie with a little bit of everything, lots of action, romance, comedy, tragedy, hope, and more action.What Works?-- The acting is very good. Pretty much across the board. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have a real chemistry, and Jamie Foxx allows the viewer to follow along with his character's evolution from comic relief to dangerous threat. Dane DeHaan was new to me, but I thought he was excellent.-- The special effects are phenomenal. I am not a fan of 3D movies, but this should be seen in 3D, as it is probably the best 3D effects I can recall seeing. The motion of web-swinging scenes is a little frenetic, particularly early on, but it smooths out.-- Lots of little dropped names and visuals in the background, planting seeds for future movies.What Didn't Work?-- Peter's quest to learn more about his parents is a plot that gets a lot of airtime, but didn't seem to further the overall story. It just felt like it was there to create a mystery that didn't serve a purpose or have an acceptable payoff.-- There are some serious heavy moments, one of which really stalls out the joy and adventure in the film. This cost the movie a five star review from me.All told, this is a *very* good movie, which I wish had a slightly edited plot, so as not to derail the great momentum that was built for the movie and the franchise. Because of the effects, it should be seen on the movie screen, and in 3D or IMAX, or whatever fancy options are available. I don't often say that about movies, but this one deserves it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK7O4UY3O70QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPNZPCG#wasThisHelpful","RK7O4UY3O70QF","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is difficult to gauge how well this works since we just got an ALOT of rain and my roses are popping already.  I will say that the ingredients are mainly Nitrogen 9%, Phosphate 18%, Potash 9%, and sulphur 20%.

I also spread used coffee grounds as well for the nitrogen.  Whether or not this gives my roses an extra umph is hard to say.  I will say, however, that this is extremely easy to use.

"I'm a fan of James Rollins' novels, so I was excited when the idea of a spin-off novel featuring Tucker Wayne and his military dog Kane was made public.  While it was a fairly engaging read, it was not what I had hoped, and might have been better as a novella.As a private assignment winds down, Tucker and Kane are called on by Rollins' spy agency, Sigma Force, to perform a relatively easy task... assist a Russian billionaire in covertly leaving his nation.  But of course, nothing is ever easy... what follows is not just an increasingly complex escape, but a race across the globe, with apocalyptic consequences....I really like the interaction with Tucker and Kane, but at work and at rest.  For me, that is the best part of what is otherwise a forgettable, if well presented, story.  It's a different twist, and is fascinating to read about.The plot, on the other hand, seemed pretty standard in adventure novels.  I was never swept along, despite the author's ability to engage the reader.

"The Hoover Cordless Vacuum is a home run.  I've been using a regular vacuum with a floor agitator, and have been very happy with it...... until I tried this one!The standout feature is the cordless operation.  Cords have always been my nemesis, always requiring a stopping and moving to the next outlet, throwing off my momentum and mindset.  It seems like a minor thing when I type it, but it really was the biggest pain about vacuuming.  But with this Hoover, no more!  The rechargeable battery means I don't have to stop from room to room, or negotiate furniture.  And the second battery means I can keep going, even if I run out of a charge on one battery.  While that one charges, I'll just switch to the second one.It functions very well as a vacuum also.  I love it.  Works great on carpet, tile, or wood flooring.  It's easy to clean.

Although the killer gets away, Stevens and Windermere are thrown into the investigation which leads them across the country as more death follows... but who is behind it, and why?Laukkanen's exceptional gift is his ability to allow the reader to relate to not only the protagonists, but also the criminals in his story, and this is no exception.

"I've been a fan of Terry Brooks for decades, but his last book was largely a re-hash of an earlier, better novel, and this newest entry falls short as well.Paxon Leah, descendant of the accomplished family of sidekicks from earlier Shannara novels, is the focus of this tale.  His family is no longer revered or royalty, and Paxon runs the family shipping business.  When his sister is kidnapped, he must spring into action to rescue her, and ultimately enters the world at large, in which magic remains, even if limited to only a few users.While I like (in general) the advances in time that Brooks has made over the course of his Shannara novels, the actual plots have diminished of late.  Indeed, in this novel, he presents us with a new hero, but what he does with that hero is woefully inadequate.  By the end of the novel, I felt like there was ultimately no point to the story, as if it served only to set up a future novel by making us familiar with Paxon.  But there wasn't enough quality storytelling to make me want to see what comes next.  The whole thing just sort of shrugs into its finale, and no resolution is reached, but no interesting threads are left for future tales.Even for fans, I wouldn't suggest this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTRC28FSU7HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345540700#wasThisHelpful","R2LTRC28FSU7HB","A3JPTQPOKO6TVO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPTQPOKO6TVO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This short book is a summary taken from two of the author's books: 1.How to be Invisible, and 2. Invisible Money, both of which I have read and have on my Kindle Fire along with all his other books, and they are all on my Favorites shelf so that I can quickly access and refer to them when I want to.  Luna writes about what he knows, has lived, and uses with his clients.  His advice is legal, practical, and nearly always rather easy to implement. His writing style is straight-forward, and not one book contains ""empty, filler material"", every page is packed with useful information.  One of my favorite and most helpful of his books for me is ""Dirty Tricks for Savvy Chicks Ages 18-88"", which I would recommend to every woman, and men should give to their daughters, sisters, wives, mothers, female-friends.

"I bought these in dark denim and in grey at Walmart for $15 each, and Walmart has a variety of colors.  I bought them a size larger than my normal size so they would fit a little loose and look like real jeans, and not look form-fitting like leggings.  I'm extremely happy with them.  I prefer wearing these instead of real jeans because these are very soft and very comfortable, much more soft & comfortable than jeans.  People are surprised they are leggings when I tell them, they say they look and fit like real skinny-jeans.  I wear them tucked into boots, and also with ballet flats.  These leggings come in nine different colors and are $17 on the No Nonsense website.

"I LOVE this stuff!  I follow a Paleo/Primal lifestyle, coconut flour does not sit too well in my stomach, and I can easily over-do it eating nut flours.  Tigernut flour is perfect for me and for baking.  It exchanges 1:1 for white flour in conventional recipes and nut flours in paleo/primal recipes.  Since it's a vegetable I don't have to worry about the sort of thing you worry about when eating too many nuts or nut-flours.  I LOVE the slightly sweet flavor of tigernut flour and the texture is just fine for me.  I made pancakes this morning with tigernut flour, an egg, a little psyllium husks, a little baking soda, some apple cider vinegar, and canned coconut milk, cooked in a little coconut oil--all organic, of course.  The loft was quite high, the flavor fantastic, and I ate them without any syrup or honey--delicious!!  I plan to bake some paleo/primal bread and crackers with it, but I today I used the left-over pancakes to make sandwiches for lunch.  I just ordered two more pounds as this will be my standard baking flour from now on.We also keep whole tigernuts soaking in a bowl in the refrigerator if we get really hungry between meals. Just four or five eaten slowly takes the hunger-edge off deliciously!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D0GPGTRDTF0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NDI94BW#wasThisHelpful","R3D0GPGTRDTF0D","A2D5AK0IJ6B7KZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5AK0IJ6B7KZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried Kiehl's Musk Oil, other Egyptian Musk Oils, and making my own with various essential oil recipes on the internet--this Abdul Kareen Eyptian Musk Oi is by far my favorite.  Kiehl's is my second favorite, on me it's long-lasting but a bit more fresh & light; the Kareem oil on me is a little softer & denser floral scent & even more long-lasting.  I read that musk is a slightly-soapy floral scent, and to my nose this is exactly what this oil smells like, very pretty.  I like that I don't need to reapply during the day, the scent lasts all day, and for daytime I only apply it to my inner-wrists.  At night I apply it to a tiny little bit of the hair on the nape of my neck and the scent surrounds me but is definitely not overwhelming.  A little goes a long way for me, so this little bottle lasts several months.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16SUB9F35SINV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VUU3XS#wasThisHelpful","R16SUB9F35SINV","A2D5AK0IJ6B7KZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5AK0IJ6B7KZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I was a grateful person and a happy person, but throughout every day I have constantly battled negative thoughts and re-hashing negative situations over & over in my mind.  I have been using this book for 10 days, and I now realize I was at least one-tenth or less as happy and grateful as I am now; also, I no longer have to fight negative thinking, have not done so for the last 10 days.In this book, Rhonda Byrne states, ""There's no room for harmful negative-thoughts when your mind is focused on looking for things to be grateful for.""  Then with exercises for every day for one full month, she explains how to fill each day with specific thoughts of gratitude, exercises that leave no time or desire for negative thinking.  She cites people & things & places to be thankful for daily, that I am embarrassed to say I never thought of.  I plan to go back to the beginning of the book as soon as I'm done, and use it every day of my life.The past 10 days of my life have been the best and happiest days of my life, so with a happy heart full of gratitude I say that I am grateful for Rhonda Byrne's book for teaching me how to be truly thankful & happy, and not have negative thoughts.

"I used to use Secret anti-perspirant mainly to stop odor, & it was very effective. About a year ago I started living a Primal/Paleo/organic life, and stopped using Secret. I started making my own organic deodorant but I had to use it twice a day (once in the morning and again mid-day) and before bedtime for it to be effective against odor & that was inconvenient. Primal Pit Paste was rated higher by Amazon customers than the Primal Pit Stick, so I ordered the paste, and I have been happy with it since day one. I use it exactly as directed--be sure to read the label. I use it once after showering in the morning and it lasts all day and all night. I can even shower at night, put it on right after showering, and no odor through the night, no odor all the next day, and no odor through the next evening. The consistency is easy to use, and feels comfortable on the skin: not gritty, not sticky, doesn't burn, doesn't take a long time to dry, etc.  I will most definitely continue to buy it & use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJLA33X3E53X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A1ERF8U#wasThisHelpful","RVJLA33X3E53X","A2D5AK0IJ6B7KZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5AK0IJ6B7KZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very light-weight, rather sheer, oblong-scarf.  Popular Indigo imports these from India, and has them in several colors and prints.  I like a summer-weight scarf to carry on boats to wrap around my neck in case of a chilly wind, to tie my hair back, to do everything you would do with a wool or heavy silk scarf in winter but which are too hot and heavy for summer weather.Right out of the package this scarf was a little stiff, so I immediately put it in a sink of water with Dr. Bronner's liquid soap, let it soak for about an hour, hung it to dry, it dried Very quickly, and it was much less stiff.

Have been caught in the rain in them, and they dry very, very rapidly with no change in the color or dye-job.I'm going to buy them in their emerald color, which looks a little like turquoise to me, very pretty.

"I have only used this for a week, on a limited basis, but so far, so excellent. The touch screen is marvelous, much more sensitive and responsive than the unit I was using prior to this. It boots up fairly quickly, the screen is delightfully crisp, and its weight (what there is of it!) is a real plus, as it is unusually light (just over a pound). The orange trim is zingy - a nice touch. The keyboard is top-notch, as I am quite a fast typist, and it doesn't bog down or miss anything I input. I don't do video-editing or anything that would require far more power than this little guy has, so I can't speak to that. It has downloaded apps quickly and efficiently. I am keeping it at Win 8.1 for now; I have Win 10 on my desktop, so why bother? I have read reviews that Win 10 markedly slows it down.That it came with a decent case is a plus, although the magnetic link between tablet and keyboard could be stronger (or at each end, rather than in the center), but that's the only flaw I've found thus far. One must be careful to keep it on balance because of that (small) central link. The case has an origami-style top that folds to support the screen/tablet and that's a great help, along with the well-designed magnetic ""clasp"" that keeps it in that origami-type position.So glad I discovered this iRULU Walknbook when looking for a replacement for my less responsive tablet/keyboard hybrid (an Asus, if anyone wants to know). And for this price (under $200 when I purchased it)? How can one go wrong - with its specs, one can't. At this time, I would very strongly recommend it - and will update this if anything proves differently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28P1SBSQCM2PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GZQ1I4#wasThisHelpful","R28P1SBSQCM2PD","A3KO6JEVS1FJ8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KO6JEVS1FJ8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Poor performance, and it did not work as is said it would. The 1st night, I wetted my face thoroughly, and then applied the strips for 15 minutes, as suggested on the package. When dried, I slowly tore off the strip, it was very painful. When I looked, the strip was empty and the glue was left on my skin, and I was left scrubbing it off aimlessly, so I had to let soapy rags soak on my face later that night. On my next attempt, I watered it more, and then applied more pressure when putting them on. After that, I waited 25 minutes, as I thought maybe I had not let them dried enough the first time I used them. Here I am, scraping more glue off of my face, guess it's soapy rags again tonight.

With this little light, I reassure the offspring since we can see near and far (I bet it is easily 2/10 of a mile), up in the trees, down across the field, into the woods, under the cars, and all over the place!

I keep getting sunburned on my face despite being covered. I use SPF30. The melasma shows like brown spots all over my face. I got this stuff to see if increasing to 45SPF would keep me from further damage. While the extra SPF did keep me from being burned, whatever makes the tint adjust to your skin color made the tint adjust to some hideous orange shade like I was wearing self tanner. It didn't cover the spots. It made them look darker, and shiny! The product actually stung my face and made my melasma areas feel hot!

"Four rats have a lot of excretions.  We got these to help line their cage. They use a litter box for #2 but will pee anywhere and everywhere. Rat pee smells disgusting and it is a lot of work to keep the cage clean. By using these pads we hoped to lure them into peeing on the pads instead of randomly going wherever they please.  They did pee on them, though I think largely by coincidence.  They mainly tore them up and used them as a comfy bed.  So for entertainment value alone for the rats, I have to give 5 stars. I would get them again but not with any hope or expectation of wee wee control for rats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3233VLOWDPFRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006ABVEI#wasThisHelpful","R3233VLOWDPFRF","A1TBIVST1JDJPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TBIVST1JDJPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had nothing but problems with this vacuum.  The rotten thing clogs constantly from normal household debris. I absolutely despise this machine. I'm jealous of everyone who has had a good experience with it. Every time I have used it, it has significantly clogged. Toward the end of its life, I would vacuum and vacuum and see nothing filling the canister. So I took our power air blower and the vacuum outside to force air through the tubes inside to get out whatever was stuck in there.  This happened pretty much every time I used it!  I threw it away today.  It's been a total pain in the neck.  Everything was annoying with it, right down to getting the canister back in place correctly after emptying.  One thing that did work without trouble was the retractable cord.  But get this - the first time I used the vacuum, the cord whipped around and sliced open my dog's face.  So every time I took out this vacuum there after,  it caused him great emotional distress.  He would shake and tremble and pant in terror.  Couple that with my ranting and raving about the aggravation this piece of junk has caused me, and you could say we both have been emotionally scarred by this vacuum.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CC62T7UW8U1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HFDLCK#wasThisHelpful","R3CC62T7UW8U1M","A1TBIVST1JDJPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TBIVST1JDJPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was as if there was something taped on the stool and when the tape was removed part of the finish came along with it. The other had a chunk of wood missing from the lower side connection.

"Maybe I am not comprehending the actual use for these swim shorts, but in my mind they are supposed to be used for...er, um, swimming.  My daughter is modest and wanted these in lieu of underwear looking bottoms and  She dislikes how regular swim shorts puff up and out in the water. So the idea is that these would stay close to the skin and provide the modest coverage she wants.  And they do! The sizing seems true, if a little small. The material is a typical slinky bathing suit material. They would actually be the perfect choice EXCEPT for the fact they are not lined! I guess I expected an inner panty lining considering they are called swimwear.  I do understand that bikini bottoms don't have lining, but every other type of bottom I've purchased has had that inner lining.  So we are both disappointed. We got the shorts length as well as the Capri length. Neither is lined. She would have to wear something under these to fit in to modern society.  Otherwise, on a sunny day, she could stretch the wrong way and make quite an impression. And let's be honest here, choosing bottoms that cover so widely allows the wearer to get a little lazy with the grooming (if you catch my drift) and since these offer no lining, you will have to keep room in your budget for waxing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROXLPX1HH7HOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FAOTSW#wasThisHelpful","ROXLPX1HH7HOO","A1TBIVST1JDJPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TBIVST1JDJPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm no clean freak, but I can't stand the whirling tumbleweeds of dog & human hair that accumulate around the corners of my wood floors.  Using a broom to clean it gets the hair all tangled in the bristles and using a dust mop just ends up being me pushing around a dirty wig of hair that I have to pick off.  Grosser than gross.  Shaving our heads and dogs isn't really an option, and we live on a dirt road in the country, so I got this thing.  It has to be plugged in to the outlet, but otherwise it is more or less like a Dust Buster on wheels that can also be hand held. I've emptied it a bunch of times without incident or difficulty, though it is disturbingly disgusting to see what accumulates in that little area over time.  It isn't going to deep clean very well, but will do fine for your basic household grunge it is fine.  I've used it all over the house, including on the stairs, for crumbs, cereal spills, dead bugs on the window sills, some sandy grit, etc.  It sucks up anything light and airy that passes in front of the opening, it won't suction crud from corners or pull up heavy items, so you will probably end up using the dust pan for the remains.

"It seems like most of the reviews here are quite positive, so I am a little bit hesitant to voice my more negative opinion.  Perhaps my experience is one of an amateur so I am seeking different results than others. My usage is mainly for coloring in rubber stamped images. So, while I am not a professional, I have been stamping for 20 years and I have tried many colored pencils.  My hands now are seriously arthritic, so I seek out pencils that don't require me to press down hard to get color. I find the lead in these pencils to be hard and waxy. Great from the perspective of them not breaking, but I find the super hard lead to be stingy to release their color.  They are so hard they actually seem to resist being sharpened in both an electric and manual sharpener.  To get a deep layer of color, one has to press very firmly.  Then the pencil appears shiny and there are pencil indentation lines on the paper or cardstock.  On a positive note, these pencils can blend very well with a Dove blender.  My recommendation is that one needs a very light touch and must hold the pencil on its side to use the side of the pencil versus the point of the pencil for best results.I would prefer to wrestle with a set of exasperating pencils prone to breakage (Prismacolors) than to buy these again.  My children have Crayola colored pencils that I like better.  Go figure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QSX87WIB59H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003N7NKG8#wasThisHelpful","R1QSX87WIB59H1","A1TBIVST1JDJPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TBIVST1JDJPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so I got this in January 2013 and it is 10/30/13 and I am going to have to replace this thing. I have used it just about once a week on an area of about 900 feet. I have used it on tongue-and-groove floor, and vinyl flooring in the kitchen and bath. The cleanser always leaves a film on all my floors - not just the laminate, so I do not use it. First, I spray the area with vinegar/water and then use the steam option. I've found that I have to fill the water tank usually just once during floor washing.  For stains, I always have to pretreat and use muscle.  I am not super picky, and I enjoyed the smooth look and feel on the floors when they were first cleaned.  Although the results weren't great, this thing worked fine until about the last month.  It fell off the second step and hit the floor and it hasn't been the same since.  It drips a lot and the base it wiggly and loose, but still doing its job.  I was surprised it took just one fall to injure this thing, but there you have it.  I might get it again but never, ever, EVER for the price they're charging right now.Bonus tip:  I found some non name brand detachable pads on Ebay.  Made my life easier because I hate the idea of using a dirty pad to clean a floor.

"I don't mind buying things at Goodwill but used purses really do gross me out.  I abuse my handbags and with 3 children I am always finding disgusting things in my purse.  So I use the purses I get for a loooooong time.  I dream of having expensive purses but I hate the idea of spending a lot of money on a purse to have it ruined by an old lollipop or melted M & Ms.  So when I saw this bag on Amazon for only a few dollars more than what I could find at Goodwill, I snatched it right up!  And I'm so glad I did.  It isn't great quality and I think the bag looks pretty fake.  The stitching is terrible, too, but I can't tell you how many compliments I have gotten on this purse.  I think it is plenty roomy enough.  My big 23.7 ounce water bottle fits almost all the way in it and I could probably put 6 of them in there. The purse is red, the stitching is white, and liner in the purse is a horrid yellowish beige crinkly sort of plastic like you might find on an umbrella or a backpack (but easy to wipe clean). It doesn't have a shoulder strap, so isn't a shoulder bag but I can hike it up my arm and hold it in my underarm area just fine.  All things considered, I am happy to have bought this purse and I would definitely buy another one of these purses. It is a true ""beater"" purse and when it finally falls apart I won't cry about it - I'll just get another one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IO5TY8T9AV1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090UGFD2#wasThisHelpful","R2IO5TY8T9AV1U","A1TBIVST1JDJPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TBIVST1JDJPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one amazing vacuum!  We have an aging Dyson D45 and decided to test this Cinetic against it.  Firstly, it comes very well packed.  There is a picture-based instruction booklet and assembly is straight forward, snap-together, and took about 10 minutes (including putting the myriad attachments in their bag).The cord is a few feet longer than the D45, which is quite handy.  The vacuum hose is longer as well.  Compared to the old Dyson, this one is heavy and with the big ball it is a bit harder to maneuver, but it is still a feat of engineering how a twist of the wrist turns this vacuum!We have a German Shepherd (German Shedder) and my wife and I are mild to moderately allergic to his dander, so vacuuming is quite important. We had not vacuumed for two days prior to this test. We got out the trusty D45, which had recently been serviced, and vacuumed away.  It took three runs in each room before the D45 canister ceased to have something in it, so each room had been vacuumed 4 times!  Now we hit it with the Cinetic.  The first run filled the canister 3 times in the rooms he spends the most time in and filled the canister twice in the others!  The second run had virtually nothing in the canister!  Further, being allergic, one can feel the change in the air as you are vacuuming!  It is seriously noticeable, the HEPA filter on this beast really works!  We now vacuum daily with this amazing vacuum, and still cannot believe how much fills the canister after just one day.  The dust in the southwest and the dog (summer is shedding season) really get their stuff in the carpet and the Cinetic really gets it out!All of the attachments work brilliantly.  The one for the ceiling fan is genius.  The little suction powered spinning head one, works great on upholstery and does the stairs right...it actually fits perfect in the stair riser (we have carpeted stairs).It does a great job on hard surfaces as well.  One touch turns off the brush and the self-adjusting head goes right to work.  I actually saw a ball of fur rolling toward the vacuum as I was using it on the tile. It is, however, a bit harder to maneuver on the tile than the D45.I can't say enough good about this vacuum or recommend it more highly.  It is so amazing we got a second one for upstairs as it is a bit heavy for my bride to carry upstairs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3932YPHZA8ZTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLJPS2#wasThisHelpful","R3932YPHZA8ZTK","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This apron has high quality construction that consists of three different fabrics. All the fabrics are attractive except the skirt fabric which reminds me of my Grandmas kitchen in the 1960's, though that may be perfect for those into the retro look.  Its the perfect length, has nice long ties that can easily wrap around your waistline and tie in the front.it fits a size 16 woman. Out of the package it is very stiff, and needs washing before wearing. It washes nicely, and the stiffness goes away with the first wash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DI7OIG483JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4IYH9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1DI7OIG483JX","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keeping in mind that they are made of woven paper and quite inexpensive these are very nice soft-sided storage units.  The double zippers and double handles are a nice touch.  The zippers are a bit on the flimsy side, but I am not expecting a lot in that department from units costing about $7 each.  All surfaces are soft, there is not a hard bottom in these so one needs to consider the surface they will be setting on or if you are overstuffing the.  They collapse almost completely flat when empty, which is also nice.For the price, they are a great solution for off-season linens, clothing and just about any other non-sharp object.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RFV08QLQ1ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOF6CS#wasThisHelpful","R35RFV08QLQ1ZT","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The garage cools in short order with this bad boy!  It does get fairly loud from about 50% through max, but it isn't ear damaging loud in my estimation.  This is definitely a commercial product.  It is well-built and solid.  I, like another reviewer, felt the set screw to hold the blades on the motor could be a problem point.  I addressed it with Locktite.

"The Netgear AC1200 was a snap to set up.  I used the WPS path with my Netgear R7000 router, set up was complete in a couple of minutes.  The other path involves set up through a web page. I am using the unit in extender mode and not as an access point as I don't need separate networks.The R7000 has given me excellent signal strength in our home and for decent range outside of the home.  Placing this unit upstairs keeps all devices at max bars upstairs.  Placing it downstairs, in an outlet on the wall that abuts our backyard has ensured full-signal strength in all parts of our backyard.The Gigabit wired connection is great if I need to plug in for security reasons and I am not near a Cat5 drop downstairs.For me, this is another great Netgear product in my suite of Router, extender, switches, WiFi adapters, and Powerline devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EVAZC5TTGQ7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92CLCW#wasThisHelpful","R3EVAZC5TTGQ7F","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent hub!  Having 3 fast charging power ports is fantastic for those with multiple devices.  Today I charged an iPhone5, iPhone 6+, and a Galaxy S5 from dead to 100% in about an hour (not exact as I was working), and that is simultaneously!Set up is simple, plug it in to power, plug it into a USB port on your computer and use any of the 7 USB connections and/or 3 charging ports.I tested the 7 ports with 7 devices (4 phones for development, a 128 GB thumb drive, a One TB USB 3.0 drive, and one three TB USB 3.0 drive) connected at once with no issues.  The 3 TB drive was running a backup, the 1 TB drive was doing a large directory copy, for the test the thumb drive was being used to hold a file that was being rendered in 3D with Photoshop. Two phones had app builds happening, one was playing music, and one was just slow charging, At the same time I was charging 3 phones.

"I will start by saying The KRUPS EA9010 is simply amazing!  It really is an automated Barista.The machine setup was easy for the most part.  There was a hiccup, and this was likely me, where after installing the filter and filling with water, it started a cleaning process that ""I knew nothing about"" however, it was on the next page of the instructions.  In my defense, I was a third of the way down the page in the instructions when what was to come on the next page started.The machine is pretty much plug and play.  It does have cleaning solutions, descaling tablets, and a water filter (complete with a test strip to find the hardness of your water). The descaling tablets are to be used after approximately 360 uses, the machine cleaned itself and used very little of the solution in the first run.  The Barista One Touch will tell you when to change the filter (about every two months), when to descale, when it needs more water, etc.The left side of the unit holds the cleaning solution, the used coffee grounds, and a pre-measured scoop for ground coffee. The right side holds the water.This unit grinds its coffee on demand or can use ground coffee.  It has myriad preset drinks to enjoy from both pre-ground coffee and from coffee beans (pre-ground coffee has its own button, which also unlocks the door to add the coffee once a drink is selected).  The drinks are both milk-based and regular coffee.  Taking more than a month to review this unit, I have to say every drink comes out as in the pictures.  Coffee and milk, perfectly layered, nice to look at and tasty as well.  It tells you exactly how much milk to put in and when.  Once the unit is done, it self-cleans the steam tube so that there is never milk residue on it!  From start to finish, I have a fantastic coffee based drink that rivals the specialty coffee shops, in less time than it takes the Keurig to give me a regular cup of coffee!  Once of the best features is the ability to create your own drinks and set them to a button on the touch-screen!  Then you have your custom drink at the touch of a button...awesome.The unit is very solidly constructed, well designed, looks great on the counter and yes is expensive, but very much worth it. If you spend $/day at the specialty coffee shop, at the end of a year you could have bought this and never had to leave the house for that drink!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EG6TFTTQQCFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBGGULA#wasThisHelpful","R1EG6TFTTQQCFU","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.I highly recommend this unit to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JTAJIXGUE8GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGME60A#wasThisHelpful","R2JTAJIXGUE8GB","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am giving this 4 stars for the concept.  The art I would give 3 stars.  The base is very easy to hang, if you know command strips then you know how easy it is. If not, remove plastic cover to the non-wall damaging adhesive, place the sticky side on the wall, use the included level to adhere the base to the Velcro side of the strip you just installed...Done.  The art is held on the base via magnets.  That is it, quick and easy art, or dry erase, or chalkboard on your wall.The Velcro fasteners work great, I will get them for other projects!One there is a riser that can be placed on a base to give and added dimension to clustered art pieces.  Naturally, the art work can be switched amongst the bases due to it being held magnetically.Other than there not being a great selection of ready made artwork, the only other downside, and it was fleeting, was a chemical smell that lasted about a week.We will create our own art and use these frames, they are a great idea!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D0KDP2QCJSCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7XCS#wasThisHelpful","R3D0KDP2QCJSCY","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Beolit 15 is an amazing sounding, compact, Bluetooth speaker.  Like many, for me Bang & Olufsen represents extremely high-end equipment. I recall going to the local audio stores and lusting for the B&O equipment.  That said, this is my first piece of Bang & Olufsen equipment and it does not disappoint.  I have listened to it for about 20 days and I love it.The bass is deep and punchy but not muddled or overpowering, the mids are good (not perfectbut its a portable speaker), and the highs are clear but not shrill.  We currently have it about 2 feet from a wall about midway down in a 45 x 20 room.  This little gem fills this room with clear, unvarnished sound, even at max volume levels!  I have been able to go anywhere in our home (3,000 sqft;  2 story) and have not lost the BT connection to my iPhone 6, this is quite impressive. The speakers front and back give a near 360 degree presence to the sound.  It provides 70 watts of clean power from two Class D amplifiers so it gets loud, and stays clean and clear.There is no volume control or EQ, which is standard fare for most BT speakers (Our Klipsch KMC-3 has volume and a remote). However, our devices have volume control and there are apps for EQ.  However, I didn't find that the sound needed EQ whether listening to Beethoven, Led Zepplin, or Five Finger Death Punch...it just sounds great no matter what source you put to it.We have gotten about 20 hours out on charge at low to medium volume levels.  The cord is sufficiently long and stores nicely in the back of the unit.Lastly, the unit is completely balanced when carried by the strap.Yes, it looks a bit like a picnic basket, but this picnic basket rocks!

"This rake does an excellent job of standing up our medium height pile carpet.  Makes it look like new!  We have a German Shepherd, and he is shedding a lot. I raked the carpet and vacuumed with the Dyson Animal, filling the bin with dog hair several times.  Then vacuumed with the Dyson again, not much in the bin.  Then I raked the carpet again and vacuumed with the Dyson and got about half as much hair out of the carpet as the first time!  Now this is hair that one can't see after running the Dyson the first time!

"I don't think the age range of up to five is accurate, but for the younger children it is between fun and a blast. Firstly, the packaging is one of the more frustrating I have encountered to get the pieces out of.  Once removed, the toy can be used in two ways, either with each half separated or with the two halves hinged together (this requires a assembly with a screwdriver). This configuration allows for the toy to be carried when closed.  Batteries are included and installed. It is well built and should last a long time.The animal stalls make animal sounds when opened and that is the extent of the noises this toy makes.  The silo just allows the child to drop things down it, which can be fun for little ones.Now for the kid testing. My one year old nephew loves it, he plays with it for about 30 min before moving on, or incorporating other toys with it.  My two and a half year old niece gets 5-10 minutes with it before moving on, usually packing the little farmer or animals off to baby or have a tea party with.This is a good toy for younger children to engage in imaginative play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R334RNH6Q08J08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHPH4CM#wasThisHelpful","R334RNH6Q08J08","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great idea.  64 GB of storage that plugs into your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or PC.  First the unit must be plugged into a USB port to charge.  It is quite wide so if the ports are side by side it takes up enough space that nothing can be plugged into the port next to it.  It barely fits on a 2014 Mac Pro, as the ports are recessed and the drive is wide, but it does work.The iXpand app works great on iOS 8.2 syncing, uploading, downloading its all good.  As has been noted by others no DRM content can go on the disk.The instructions for the The SanDisk Secure Access app contained on the drive only explain how to install it on a PC, for the Mac there are no instructions.  I ended up dropping it in the applications folder and running it (or attempting to) from Launch Pad.  It never loads, so I cannot comment on it.I initially charged the unit on a PC, when I loaded the iPhone app and fired it up with the drive connected it had picked up a few folders from my PC without permission.Overall using the iPhone app is fairly intuitive and moving files around, viewing pics, listening to music, and watching videos on the drive is a straight forward process.  There were a few hiccups with playback of music and vids, but they were minor and just required starting the file over.  Future upgrades will likely take care of these issues.I have a couple of minor issues with this drive besides the behemoth size.1. the lightning connector is short and sits in a small recess on the drive, this just flexes up to be connected.  When using a case, like the Otterbox Defender, this barely makes it, and causes quite an angle on the cable, it is rubberized, but it is still an angle that makes me nervous about its longevity.  I am definitely not interested in removing the case each time I want to use the drive.2. It does not come with a USB extension cord, which would eliminate the issue of how much space it takes up when plugged in to USB.3. The cover for the USB connector is plastic and given to breakage and loss, which will expose the connector.  The thing is already a behemoth, maybe it could be made to have a retractable connector.4.

"The KMC 3 does not disappoint.  I have long been a Klipsch fan, and this unit met all my expectations, actually exceeded them.  I have tried many different units, Sonos, Beats, Marshall, but none satisfied me in all areas of clean mids, highs, and lows.  The KMC 3 does.  The vocals are crystal clear, the highs...amazing.  Crash cymbals, screaming leads, perfectly clear.  The mids are astounding.  But where I was most amazed was the bass...the beautiful non-muddy bass!  Batteries, battery life...blah blah blah...if you need to run it on batteries you will be blissfully happy all the way till they die.  The controls are simple...Bluetooth connect and volume...done.  If you need equalization, there are apps for that.  This simplicity and astounding sound make the KMC 3 worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NN71CQ81QZJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAQJ94Q#wasThisHelpful","R3NN71CQ81QZJG","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Much like Adobe's ""Elements"" programs have very full feature set from their big brother programs, but with a ""more user friendly"" user interface, Corel Painter Essentials 5 is the little brother of Corel Painter 2015.This program allows you to paint from scratch with a dizzying array of brushes and canvas types.  You can use a photograph and turn it into a painting using some automagic features and then clean it up by hand.  I am fairly proficient with Painter, so I can attest that the feature set is quite robust in the program, for me it is harder to use as I had to dig around to find things. That said I am impressed.  The test was with my wife, who had no experience with the program.  She was easily able to install it, and figure out how to get the basics going.  She found the difficulty in learning the program, to the level one can in a 30 day period, to be much like any other program she uses.The program works with a Wacom Tablet, which makes it much more ""natural"".  Doing the finesse work with a mouse is tedious, to me anyway.  This is a 64-bit program, thankfully, so it takes advantage of modern computing power and memory in the GBs.That said, she is having a blast with it and is creating up a storm.

"Thus far this has been a great product. It appears to be solidly constructed.  We have used it for stew, roasting a chicken, potatoes, and a roast.

You aren't jumping through hoops or tossing out the glasses when a rechargable battery would finally die. 2. there is nothing blocking light or other distractions from the side of the glasses.

"So far so good.  The Lift and Lock Pole Caddy took less than 2 minutes to be installed in our shower. One simply screws the needed pole pieces together, unlocks the bottom locking mechanism, places it where you want it and slides the pole up to the ceiling (you will hear clicks as its ratcheting mechanism locks on the way up). When it is firm against the ceiling and shower pan, then you press the locking mechanism down and you're done.  Adding the trays is a snap.  Just place them where you want and press down till you hear a click.So far we have some heavy shampoo and conditioner bottles on their own trays, razors, body wash, loofahs, etc on the trays and everything is just fine.  Of course I wouldn't put overly heavy items on the trays, but they are sturdy.  It also comes with a spare rubber piece that goes against the ceiling (that I nearly threw out as it was attached to some packaging inside the box with a bit of tape.)Some trays have large holes to place the bottle lids through when you need to turn your shampoo, conditioner, etc upside down and still keep them on the unit.Overall, it is a nice looking, solid unit that does exactly what it says and takes just a couple of minutes to set up.  Ours is brushed nickel and it matches perfectly with the other brushed nickel pieces in the bathroom.It is a very nice solution that takes up little space in the shower.Two week follow up: The unit is holding up well. It hasn't moved from its original installation location, the shower pan has a bit of a downward slope at the corner, where the unit is located. I feared a little movement and regular tweaking due to the slope and have items on the caddy, but thus far the fears are unfounded.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N2CNK226LCD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VK7D2K#wasThisHelpful","R2N2CNK226LCD5","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an older Wahl unit that has more attachments than this, but includes the same 3 trimmer heads. To be honest, of all the extras the older unit has I only use the one that is equivalent to the guide comb.  This guide comb is far superior in ease of use!

It charges so much more quickly, the quick charge feature is awesome!

The precision trimmer functions great, I use it to trim the 'stache and errant hairs in the brow and such.The dual shaver head does a great job of getting the stubble down to baby smooth where the beard no longer resides.The travel pouch is a great extra, the stand is about 80% smaller than the old one I have and thus the lady of the house won't need to hide it under the sink!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLX7LQOVD97M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2SLVTO#wasThisHelpful","R3VLX7LQOVD97M","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's always nice to have a little note!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHRHN1327N2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTSEI1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1EHRHN1327N2Y","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are sturdy hangers.  They hold my shirts up off the floor without making marks on the shoulders.

"This is a nice keyboard/case.  I have found it to be lighter and better built than my Logitech Solar keyboard case.The iPad slips easily into the case and Bluetooth pairing is a snap.  After charging the case, inserting the iPad and pairing took about a minute.This case has 3 positions for the iPad and they magnetically lock into place.  A feature missing and immediately superior to the two positions that required little feet in a ridge on the Logitech.  Placing the unit into one of the 3 positions also turns on the bluetooh keyboard, removing the device from the slot disconnects the bluetooth keyboard....no buttons!  The three positions are well thought out as well. The two with on the Logitech are supposed to encompass typing and media consumption...The Belkin is superior here as well.The keyboard can fold behind the tablet in two ways. 1. Keyboard facing out. 2. Keyboard facing the iPad.  Position 1 is the most comfortable as the keys are not in your hand.  Further position 2 allows the magnet that turns the iPad off when the case is closed to be on the same side as the iPads ""off"" magnet and this can turn your iPad off when using it.  If one folds the keyboard so that it is in position 2, the keys face the iPad which is more comfortable and the case's magnet is on the opposite side of the iPad and does not turn the iPad off.The magnet that puts the iPad to sleep when the case is closed is very strong (likely why is causes the sleep issue when the keyboard is folded back with the keys facing out.  This serves to keep the case closed nice and tight, another thing lacking in the Logitech Solar.  It flopped open constantly.The keyboard has a good layout and the keys feel good when typing.  I have large hands (4x motorcycle gloves)  and have had no issues thus far.Thus far the keys out folded position turning off the iPad has been the only tiny issue with this product.  Charge appears last, the keyboard is comfortable and the keys feel good, build quality is better than my Logitech Solar, and it is thin and light.I have been fortunate to not have any of the keyboard scratching the screen protector issues that other reviewers have had.  So, for me, this is a very nice keyboard case that works very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17IP9HQAL0T7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELOEIDG#wasThisHelpful","R17IP9HQAL0T7Y","A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Now how can a series starring Eugene Levy and Catherine O Hara from SCTV and Chris Elliott from David Letterman and Get A Life be so disappointing ! This is a Canadian series but definitely won't be favorably remembered as the other great Canadian series, Corner Gas.First of all, as they say in Corner Gas,there's not a lot going on. Corner Gas had many humorous and memorable moments and a great supporting cast, but in this case there really isn't much ... period and the dialogue and situations don't even get a chuckle ,these characters don't seem to have the charm and humor that we've come to expect. The show was described in The Toronto Star as a reverse of the Beverly Hillbillies with a bit af Andy Griffith of Mayberry thrown in, but it really doesn't appear to be.One of the biggest disappointments of this show is that Chris Elliott, who plays the mayor Roland Schitt (great name) makes only cameo appearances of 2 - 3 minutes, and he doesn't even appear in all the episodes, of which there are only 13 in the first season. After all, the show is named after his character, so why aren't there any stories involving him more? A real waste of this great talent.Another problem with the show is that most of the plots center on the fairly unknown characters, David and Alexis Rose, the grown up son and daughter played by real life son Daniel Levy and Annie Murphy, virtually unknown actors getting their first start. Daniel Levy is also one of the executive producers (and co-creator along with his father Eugene Levy) as well as the writer of several of the episodes, it seems as if he wants to dominate the show. Schitt's Creek has received mixed reviews, scoring 62 out of 100 based on ten critics on Metacritic,This show was heavily publicized and promoted during CBC's Hockey Night In Canada, a featured 'highlight' every week in the Toronto Star TV magazine, advertised on the radio as being the new Canadian breakthrough comedy - what a joke!, the only joke is that it was renewed for a second season even before the first episode was shown.So sad to say, Schitt'$ Creek really lacks the charm, there is a lot of whining and complaining by most of the characters, kind of depressing, not my idea of good time entertainment,if it had been called something else, like Smith's Creek instead, I doubt it would have gotten any attention,, I just don't get it!","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I2KLXTM15SY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9LNPHC#wasThisHelpful","R2I2KLXTM15SY3","A30Y6PX7QC1OR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Y6PX7QC1OR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andy Griffith is best known for his starring roles in two very popular television series, The Andy Griffith Show (1960) and Matlock (1986). Matlock is an American television legal drama, starring Andy Griffith  whose hair has now turned much grayer than when he was sheriff of Mayberry. And Don Knotts has a semi regular role, starting in season 3 through season 6, usually he's wearing a cap to cover his now balding pate - this was before being bald was in style. Andy Griffith (1926 - 2012)  Spouse (3)Cindi Knight  (2 April 1983 - 3 July 2012) (his death)Solica Casuto  (11 June 1975 - 1981) (divorced)Barbara Griffith  (26 August 1949 - 16 October 1972) (divorced) (2 children Don Knotts  (1924 - 2006)  Spouse (3)Frances Yarborough  (2002 - 24 February 2006) (his death)Loralee Czuchna  (12 October 1974 - 1989) (divorced)Kathryn Metz  (27 December 1947 - 17 March 1966) (divorced) (2 children)My favorite moments are when Andy plays the accoustic guitar and sings folk or gospel songs - he does some in this series.

"The short-lived program is considered a spin-off of Clint Walker's Cheyenne. The series follows the efforts of U.S. Marshal Frank Ragan (Larry Ward) and his three deputies, J. D.Smith (Jack Elam), Vance Porter (Mike Greene), and Del Stark (Chad Everett). All four characters initially appeared in a pilot April 1962 episode of Cheyenne entitled ""A Man Called Ragan"" - included in this set. However,the character of Cheyenne Bodie never appears in this episode.Crisp clear vibrant black/white picture quality - grim,violent,dramatic episodes highly reminiscent of the early seasons of Gunsmoke and opening/closing credits similar to those of Bonanza, this is a highly entertaining western series.Jack Elam became one of the most memorable supporting players in Hollywood, thanks not only to his near-demented screen persona but also to an out-of-kilter left eye, sightless from a childhood fight.The program would only last there long enough to finish out Cheyenne's abbreviated seventh season. When viewers saw the eighteenth episode, ""Sanctuary at Crystal Springs"", they were shocked by a scene that depicted the lawmen killing two outlaws in a church, one of whom had caused injury to a pastor, played by Charles Irving, before dying. Calls for The Dakotas to end its run were answered virtually overnight. After just one more episode, the show was pulled.

"I know it states at the end of each episode Filmed in Hollywood Before A Live Studio Audience - - that may be true but when you hear all that loud laughter practically after every line or gesture an actor makes, it's hard to believe that an actual audience is making all that noise, especially considering episode 3 takes place outdoors on a baseball fieldI was never a real follower of this show when it first aired, but was intrigued by the DISCLAIMER on the back of the cover. It States:WKRP In Cincinnatti has a complicated history of music rights restrictions.To make this the most comprehensive DVD release possible, we have done our best to include every scene uncut and to license as much original music as possible.WHAT A JOKE!!!!! Sure you get to hear the opening and closing Theme Songs, but What Music Is There in the rest of the episodes ??? - 2 or 3 seconds of a song clip ....REALLY, too quick to even recognize it sometimes.In fact, the battle over music rights has delayed the release of a number of classic TV shows of the past. Wonder Years was finally released this year, with most of the music intact, about 20 - 30 second clips of 3 or 4 songs per episode, but then it costs around $250 for 6 seasons. And Happy Days season 5 was released last year with all the original music replaced with generic music, yet the cost was still over $30. This year Happy Days season 6 was released and had 2 20 second clips of original music, ""Blueberry Hill""  by Fats Domino and ""The Twist"" by Chubby Checker, still around the $30 mark. But if you add the total music clips of WKRP for this season, it doesn't even add up to 3 minutes !, and some clips are barely 1 second long, eg Little Richard, and the audio is so low, you can barely hear it. THIS IS INSANE !!!!!, you can get compilations of practically every decade of 30 original songs or more by the original artists at Walmart for $5 each.On the bright side though, you get to see Loni Anderson, looking her best. And Howard Hesseman is fun to watch as Dr. Johnny Fever. And the other cast members are enjoyable as well. And the storylines are usually interesting.

"David Janssen was born in Nebraska in 1931 Birth Name: David Harold Meyer Died:February 13, 1980 (age 48) in Malibu, California.Update: JUne 16I have now watched the complete first 2 seasons and am into the third and so far I HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY EPISODE THAT HAS REPLACEMENT MUSIC. All the episodes had the ORIGINAL theme music throughout the episode and at the end. If you notice, all the people complaining about the 'replacement' music wrote their reviews within a day or 2 of the release, they didn't even bother to sit through and watch all these episodes to see if they were correct with their assumptions. I got my copy through Amazon.CA during the first week it came out and absolutely DO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS at all regarding any replacement music. It is a shame that all these negative reviews are on the first page of this great series, and that many people are getting voted down, possibly because of false information about this set.

"Just about 4 months after the release of season 10,CBS/Paramount is about to release season 11 of 32 more remastered episodes of Gunsmoke, the last B/W season. At this pace, it looks like we may get to see the 12th color season by early 2015.Fans who may be upset with the once again price of $85 for the full season, folks, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT FROM AMAZON. Other reviewers have noted that You can get season 10 at Barnes&Noble for around $50, or part 1 at Walmart for $20, so almost guaranteed that this will also apply to season 11. Or you can wait around a few months for the price to drop by 40% or so as it did for all other seasons, 'hot' items are always reduced when they are no longer hot.UPDATE NOV.30 - The price for Season 11 has now dropped to $70 and season 10 is now selling for $56, and if you wait around a little longer, it is sure to drop again.When you look at the amount of run time for some of the most popular series today, like Longmire, Hell On Wheels, or Justified,a full season runs average 9 hours for 13 episodes and pre-order prices range from $30 - $50, Falling Skies seasons are only 10 episodes for about 7 hours. And when you analyze these series, they are basically a lot like a mini-series, a main plotline that basically uses the same cast, few guest appearances, with the same storyline continuing over 10 - 13 episodes, usually ending up in a cliffhanger.With Gunsmoke, you get 32 different stories, about 28 hours running time, that's 3-4 times more than any of the above mentioned series per season, no cliffhangers, clearly remastered, a costly, timely process, albeit not every episode is a classic, but there are always enough to make you feel satisfied. And you bring back to life, so many cherished all time favorite actors that you never expected to see again, in their prime and glory.So according to the release pace of this year, now it looks like CBS/Paramount will be releasing 2 seasons of Gunsmoke a year and if this is true, all of us Gunsmoke lovers will be able to complete our collection of 20 seasons within the next 5 years, now that is exciting news!!!.Some interesting facts about James Arness that you probably didn't know:Born of Norwegian heritage (the family name, Aurness, had formerly been Aursness) in Minneapolis, MinnesotaHis marriage to Virginia Chapman ended in divorce in 1960.

Arness subsequently married Janet Surtrees in 1978Older brother of actor Peter Graves.An infantry soldier during World War II, Arness took part in the landings at Anzio, Italy. It was during this battle that he was shot in the foot and wound up losing part of it, an injury that made it difficult for him to walk for extended stretchesDuring his service in World War II, James Arness received the Bronze Star; the Purple Heart; the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three bronze campaign stars; the World War II Victory Medal and the Combat Infantryman Badge.Was the only actor to appear in all 635 episodes of Gunsmoke (1955).The following is the Season 11 episode list highlighting the major guest appearances`: A detailed guide with all the plotlines is available in my review on Volume 2.1 - Seven Hours to Dawn (John Drew Barrymore)2 - The Storm (Forrest Tucker, Stuart Margolin)3 - Clayton Thaddeus Greenwood (Roger Ewing,Jack Elam, Paul Fix)4 - Ten Little Indians (Nehemiah Persoff,Warren Oates,Bruce Dern)5 - Taps for Old Jeb (Ed Begley,Wayne Rogers)6 - Kioga(Neville Brand, John War Eagle, Nina Roman)7 - The Bounty Hunter (Robert Lansing, James Anderson)8 - The Reward (James Whitmore, Peter Whitman)9 - Malachi (Harry Townes, Robert Sorrells, Jack Elam)10- The Pretender (Tom Simcox, Tom Skerritt, Julie Sommars)11- South Wind (Bruce Dern, Michael Whitney)12- The Hostage (Darren McGavin, Vito Scotti, Simon Oakland)13- Outlaw's Woman (Lane Bradbury, Gene Tyburn)14- The Avengers (James Gregory, John Saxon)15- Gold Mine (Argentina Brunetti, John Anderson)16- Death Watch (Albert Salmi, Patricia Quinn)17- Sweet Billy, Singer of Songs (Diane Ladd,Judy Carne,Royal Dano)18- The Raid: Part 1 (Gary Lockwood,Jeff Fraley,Jim Davis)19- The Raid: Part 1 (Gary Lockwood,Jeff Fraley,Jim Davis)20- Killer at Large (Stuart Erwin, Geraldine Brooks)21- My Father's Guitar (Beau Bridges,Steve Inhat,Dub Taylor)22- Wishbone (Michael Fox, Lyle Waggoner)23- Sanctuary (Sean Garrison, Virginia Gregg)24- Honor Before Justice (France Nuyen, Michael Ansara,Noah Beery Jr)25- The Brothers (Scott Marlowe, Robert Crawford Jr)26- Which Dr. ( R G Armstrong, George Lindsey)27- Harvest (James MacArthur,George Kennedy,Lesley Ann Warren)28- By Line (Chips Rafferty, Denver Pyle)29- Treasure of John Walking Fox (Leonard Nimoy, Jim Davis)30- My Father, My Son (Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef - TOGETHER)31- Parson Comes to Town (Sam Wanamaker, Woody Chambliss)32- Prime of Life (Douglas Kennedy,Joe Don Baker,Victor French","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F2EZRU0DE08K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NARLNGK#wasThisHelpful","R3F2EZRU0DE08K","A30Y6PX7QC1OR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Y6PX7QC1OR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find it distracting when a preview comes on at the beginning or end of a show, like it does with all these Bronco episodes, because I don't want the plot spoiled for me, so I do a fast scan to the beginning of the show.And I also do a fast scan at the end where they show a preview of next week's episode, because again, I don't want the plot spoiled for me, because I intend to watch it next or the next day.  However, at the end of the third episode, as I was scanning through, I saw one of my favorite actors from the past, Tommy Rettig as a teenager in a guest star role, so I stopped to watch the preview, got real excited about seeing him in the next episode, and as I was watching episode 4, he never appeared. So I thought, maybe these episodes are out of sync, but I looked at all the discs and couldn't find the episode called The Ghost. I then went back to episode 3, watched next week's preview again, until I finally realized that this was a preview of The Sugarfoot series, which alternated with Bronco. The Sugarfoot previews at the end of each show are about 2 minutes long and practically give away the whole plot, but you get to see all the guest stars, so you can make a decision as to purchase this set or not, it does look interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8LGG9K2XN0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB49LAK#wasThisHelpful","R1L8LGG9K2XN0A","A30Y6PX7QC1OR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Y6PX7QC1OR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What more can you say about Bonanza than the 3 excellent and helpful reviews that are already posted. Tomasi's intellegent and helpful insights into the background of Pernell Roberts and the interesting comments regarding Guy Williams were so intriguing. And then ""pony"" follows up with a incredible comprehensive review of the entire package with information about all the extra features - absolutely a perfect review. Then Timothy P Roberts provides us with an episode list.So what I have to add then is slightly off the track, but in light of all these price complaints lately on Gunsmoke and Bonanza. I think it's time for Amazon to rethink their review rating policy.There is a huge major problem with the Amazon review system. Like in the case of the Gunsmoke reviews, it bases the most 'helpful' reviews on the number of votes received, whether the comments have anything to do with the show or not. Just look at the first page and you'll see the most helpful votes based on the most ridiculous price complaints - why would Amazon assign a most helpful rating to someone who is telling them not to buy their product?Then another major problem, like in the reviews of Big Valley S3 or Happy Days S5, is that the front page is filled with reviews of people saying they can hardly wait for the next season to come out, reviews that are 2 years older or more taking away space from any new review because of the number of votes received in the past, so any recent review gets buried in the pile because it doesn't have a chance to get noticed when it's only up on the first page for a day or so.And a third major problem , like the reviews for Justified, there are hundreds and hundreds of 1 line reviews flooding the site that say Five Stars or Great or some other meaningless phrase so that any meaningful review with good comments only stays on the front page for a day or less.What then Amazon has to do to fix these problems is to clear the trail by cleaning the slate, take off all reviews from the front page that are not current, that were written before the product was released and move them to the last pages, and then enforce all new reviews to at least 100 words, so that we don't have to be spammed with thousands of meaningless 1 to 5 liners saying Great, Cool, Love This, 5 stars, etc. We want to read real reviews.So basically now the only option one has is to find a reviewer that you like, and then go to his See All My Reviews list or Profile, so that you can actually read some critical comments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1JS2EV47VOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KW02JW0#wasThisHelpful","RB1JS2EV47VOT","A30Y6PX7QC1OR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Y6PX7QC1OR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anthologies are a rarity on TV nowadays, of course nothing comes close in popularity to the original Rod Serling version of the Fifties, but this is a fairly decent revival, 2 - 3 stories by world famous authors (e.g. Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, Harlan Ellison) per episode. There were a number of popular anthologies over the years, namely The Outer Limits, Alfred Hitchcock Presents (also had a color revival), Masters of Horror, Amazing Stories (Spielberg), Friday The 13th. the Series, Tales From The Darkside, Tales From The Crypt, Monsters, Goosebumps. Are You Afraid Of The Dark, Freddy's Nightmares the series, Twilight Zone the 90's series, Night Gallery (also Sterling) and Night Visions (hoping for this release).In fact , this 80's version was released in 2 separate packages over 10 years ago at a much higher price, around $70 each, so this is a bargain at this price. But some people might find a down side because of the packaging, 13 discs sitting on a spool in a booklike case with no protection between the discs. But there is an episode guide on the inside covers that includes a listing of the guest stars for each episode, a welcome bonus. And all the extra features are included like in the original release, commentaries, deleted scenes, interview with Wes Craven.The highlight of this series has to be the first episode of the second season, ""The Once And Future King"", a clever, compelling, loving tribute to Elvis Presley starring Jeff Yagher, who has his voice down solid pat and even includes 3 songs, 'Heartbreak Hotel', 'That's All Right Mama' and ""Are You Lonesome Tonight'. There's commentary on this episode by Philip DeGuere who calls this the perfect Twilight Zone story.Actually, after using this package several times, I began to like this idea of the stacking discs, the top one slides out easily, there is a cardboard stopper that holds them in place, and when you're finished watching, you just slide out the whole cylinder, which also slides out easily, and then replace the one you watched on the bottom, so the next one to be viewed is always on the top. There really isn't much chance of scratching the disc, on a standard package, some discs are packed so tight in their holders, that you practically have to bend them to get them out.However the picture quality is varied throughout, but is fairly good overall, but this is explained by Alan Brennert, one of the original writer producers of the show.""As one of the writer-producers who contributed to this series, I'm posting this to correct some misapprehensions concerning the picture quality of this DVD set. This is NOT a ""bad transfer."" The 1985-87 Twilight Zone was shot on film, but edited on video. In other words, the raw footage was 35mm film, which was then transferred to videotape. Editing, dubbing, special effects--everything was done on video. (We were in fact the first drama series on television to do this.) So unlike the original Rod Serling TZ, there ARE no original film negatives from which Image could strike new prints for transfer. All that exist are the old one-inch master tapes the fact that the original transfers had deteriorated over time""Still, if you're OK with this and the packaging, there are a great deal of interesting stories with some of the great actors of the time, well worth getting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30LVCO8CO83BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKTFQJM#wasThisHelpful","R30LVCO8CO83BQ","A30Y6PX7QC1OR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Y6PX7QC1OR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Falling Skies is a bit like the Tom Cruise version of War Of The Worlds, with a bit of Strange Invaders, Invaders From Mars, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Starship Troopers and  Alien thrown in. It took me a while to really appreciate this series, started off kinda slow for my tastes and then grabbed my attention in the last 2 minutres of season 1 with a cliffhanger that really started making sense and then continued to actually take off with the first episode of season 2.The best part of Falling Skies is the special effects. The main alien creatures are called Skitters, their appearance is horrifyingly beautiful, like nothing you've ever seen before, their bodies are about human size, resemble a hybrid mixture of  the Predator/Alien/The Fly attached to 6 spidery scorpion like legs.So take the ride, but prepared to have a lot of patience during season 1, it gets a lot better after that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YIATHPAYTX68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWTVDUW#wasThisHelpful","R2YIATHPAYTX68","A30Y6PX7QC1OR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Y6PX7QC1OR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I must admit that I just started recently watching this series and just needed to see the first few episodes before definitely deciding to get all the other seasons. Timothy Olyphant has been compared to Clint Eastwood by some reviewers, in fact, he may be considered  even better looking, especially with that incredible stetson hat he wears. I haven't really found anything interesting on TV lately, since the last excellent series 'LOST' , so this definitely was a pleasant surprise. It's really a crime show but has a lot of western influence, in fact, the reason I didn't look into it a lot earlier is because it isn't a real western, but what really makes this show different from everything else, is the dialogue, it is so compelling and the action scenes and violence are stunning, just like it was on The Sopranos. And just like in Gunsmoke, The marshall has no problem in dealing out quick justice, no need for long trials.There are thousands of reviews for all 5 seasons, probably more than any other TV series on DVD. That is why I decided to take a chance on this series and I'm not disappointed. So one thing that really puzzles me is that there are no complaints about the pre-order price which is $50.38 $US and at Amazon.Ca only $39.99 $CDN. If you look at the reviews of Gunsmoke for season 10, over 95% are outraged at the $85 price for 31 hours of excellent western shows, but noone is complaining about paying $50 for 9 hours of Justified. Must be a different audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10VFGAS0KTYEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HT850YW#wasThisHelpful","R10VFGAS0KTYEI","A30Y6PX7QC1OR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Y6PX7QC1OR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just picked up an advance copy at my local Record store for $70 CDN ($60 US) , how exciting, new opening and closing credits, 31 hours of 36 digitally remastered 52 minute episodes on 10 discs, that's less than $2 US per episode.

Top notch stories, as good as in any other previous season, and why not, it's the same group of writers (mainly John Meston, Kathleen Hite, Les Crutchfield). Marshall Dillon is as tough and compassionate as he ever was. In fact, some of the episodes are so good, so powerful, that you may not even notice the absence of Chester. On the other hand, there were more than enough episodes about Festus and his kinfolk, felt more like Beverly Hillibillies than Gunsmoke at times. This was sure worth waiting for, seeing all these all time great actors again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DYE21Z48IE85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB01OG8#wasThisHelpful","R1DYE21Z48IE85","A30Y6PX7QC1OR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30Y6PX7QC1OR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is stylish but a little lighter than what I would like it to be. It easily moves on the tabletop when I reach to pick my phone up. Also, the white plastic tab on the back left a horizontal mark on my leather iPhone 6 leather case. I tried to remove it, but it seems it is glued down.

"We had three of these installed in our kitchen. I wanted to add one more, so I searched Amazon, and the only problem was the Model number. There are two different models of the same light: 802L-BN and 802-BN. The ""L"" version is supposed to accept 75W bulbs and the non ""L"" version maximum power rate is 50W. However, there is absolutely no label on the lights to indicate which model you have already installed. We went with the 802L version to be safe, and again other than the box, there is no label or anything to indicate the model number on the light.

"This was my forth Korean drama, and so far, it was the best. I have watched The Great Doctor, City Hunter, Boys over Flowers, and now Secret Garden. Secret Garden has a very powerful pilot, which is rare. After I finished watching the whole series, I actually went back and watched the pilot and first five episodes all over again. It was all worth it, since I could understand how well the characters are developed from the beginning, and how every dialogue is crafted with deeper meanings. After Secret Garden, I tried to start a new series by watching three other Korean dramas, but I even couldn't finish their pilots. I think this alone should say enough how good the Secret Garden really is: it just spoils you to the point that you cannot start any new series for a while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AHENRX33OG5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AUQ2FRK#wasThisHelpful","R1AHENRX33OG5C","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best movies I've seen lately. It has about two hours of runtime, but I could easily feel my heart beat at least half of the movie.

"I started watching this because of the lead actor that I saw in another Korean drama called Faith/The Great Doctor. First episode was all over the place, so I wasn’t sure if I would continue watching this. Surprisingly after the first episode, everything got more interesting, and I had to finish it ASAP over the weekend. The series use very interesting cliffhangers that keep you on your toes until you watch the next episode. There are enough twists in the story that keep your interest all the time.

Compared to Rado, the ceramic quality is different; precisely, it is less shiny and lighter.

"I got this watch for my friend's gift, and I just received it yesterday. When I opened the box, I noticed that the ""60"" label on the bezel is not aligned to ""12"" O'clock label on the dial. I tried to rotate the bezel, but it is a fixed bezel. I immediately regretted getting the watch and started to think how I can return this. Then I realize, since I am going to return it, why not be more aggressive with the bezel. I rotate it with more force, and voila! The 60 on the bezel is now aligned with the 12 mark.The watch comes with a smaller case than the other Invicta watch that I got for another friend. The small yellow box is much better for the purpose of gifting. The impact case on other watch is too big, which results in less available space in the suitcase!The chrono function on this watch was a bit different. I spend a few minutes playing with it. When you start the chrono, the 1/10th dial goes fast, however, after about a minute, that dial stops completely while the 1 second dial continues working. I guess they did this to preserve the battery life, but it is very annoying since the first time I noticed that, I thought the watch is broken.To wrap it up, the orange is a little too flashy, so classy people might not like it. It is more suitable for a sporty guy. The box is small and nice which makes a perfect gift. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I don't know if it is worth the full price though, but it certainly is worth the sales price of the Amazon sales event.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK42L8POM4ABX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FALP4PA#wasThisHelpful","RK42L8POM4ABX","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this watch on the Amazon sales event as a gift for one of my friends, fully aware of the Invicta’s unfortunate support track record. Upon receiving, I was surprised by the size and feel of the impact case, and I think the case is more suitable and fun for younger people. The watch has some weight to it, and the case is well constructed. The rotating bezel works very well, and the size and thickness are proportional on the comfortable side. If it doesn’t break, it is a very nice watch for the price. I think the person who receives this watch would love it, since I am already thinking about getting an Invicta for myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G36XGM01L7QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FALPUOK#wasThisHelpful","R3G36XGM01L7QR","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 3rd iPad. I've had original iPad, iPad 3, and now the Air. Many people may say iPad is not worth the price for what it does, but in my case, it was worth every penny. I used iPad 3 and now the Air mostly for browsing the web, reading textbooks, and occasional gaming, and for these tasks iPad Air is perfect; not to mention, I've saved a couple of hundreds on textbooks already. Air is much lighter and faster than the other iPads I've had so far. Now, I can easily hold it longer while reading longer texts, and I can see the performance increase in web browsing and games.Mini vs. Air DilemmaI first got the new iPad Mini with Retina display, because the Apple sales person said it is identical to iPad Air in every aspect other than screen size. Of course it turned out to be wrong, since mini is a bit slower and has the display color accuracy issue. After a week, I went back and exchanged the mini for iPad Air. While mini is a wonderful tablet, I was keeping it much closer to my eyes that I liked to. Web browsing also suffered a lot on a smaller screen of the mini even with Retina. With iPad Air, everything is back to normal again, and I can browse the web more easily now.Wi-Fi vs. 4G CellularI have had the cellular version of iPad 3 and the original iPad. To be honest, I only enabled the service for a few months and disabled it afterwards. I find myself to be always near Wi-Fi networks, either at school or work, so I decided to get the Wi-Fi version this time. Another reason was that I can always turn on the Hot-Spot feature on my phone, and share the internet with iPad Air. Because of these points, it didn't make any sense to pay $130 more for the cellular version.Games and PerformanceI've tried a few games, including Dead Trigger 2, and the 3D performance is very good. The new A7 processor really shines here. I am sure new wave of 3D and 64-bits games will come to iPad pretty soon, and if you are into gaming, definitely go with larger than 16GB models. The web browsing performance has been increased as well, so you can browse the web more fluidly.ConclusionI am pretty happy with my purchase. The free iLife and iWork packages with the purchase of new iPad from Apple sealed the deal for me. It is much better than my previous iPad 3, and I definitely love the new reduced weight. The performance increase is also noticeable both in games and web browsing. If you are coming from older iPads, you will probably appreciate the new design and performance as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKHTEA4DO525/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2Y5YIG#wasThisHelpful","R2PKHTEA4DO525","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't seen the movie yet, but the idea of having a new set of alien ships was great enough that I ordered the game from Amazon almost immediately. This game brings back so much fun and so many original memories from my childhood that is worth being around the house.You may think the game is no longer fun for older 30+ people, but my wife and I actually enjoyed every moment of playing this game again. This game really deserves the ""classic"" in its title, because it never gets old. Although I prefer the older game rules, the new addition of cards is a nice touch. It is nice to be able to play this game differently after so many years.The quality of the plastic is not superb, but it is pretty good for a toy under $20. The idea that the boards attach to each other and form a small toolbox case is really amazing. It really increases portability and mobility. The new drawer has been placed under each board, for storing missiles and cards, and it is another nice touch. However, when you arrange your ships on the grid, their long pins jam the drawer movement; hence, you need to open the drawer half-way before placing your ships on the board to prevent it from being stuck.Other than the drawer minor issue, I don't have any real complains. I really love the new look and design. If you are deciding between this and the older versions, get this one! You will definitely love the new feel of this old game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14EAKYB8UPDDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GE6VMO#wasThisHelpful","R14EAKYB8UPDDN","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a very good set of headphones. Actually, the only one so far that use HDMI inputs, and can process lossless audio. The other models from Sony or other brands, all use the optical cable. A quick search on the internet will show you that optical and SPDIF versions cannot handle higher bandwidths. Unfortunately, these headphones are not available for the US market, and I had to buy them directly from Japan. Good news is, they ship pretty quickly. I received mine in 5 days, but I waited a month to write this review to be able to provide some information other than the operation and sound quality.Setup:Setup is easy. You just connect the adapter, charge the headphone, and plug the HDMI in and out cables, and you are ready to go. However, I had network interference between my Linksys E-4200 router and my network media player for streaming videos.These do work on the 2GHz channels, and their signal is strong. In fact, it is too strong that caused enough complications for my network player that I no longer could stream and watch x264 movies. My Sony BDP player kept restarting and giving error messages even on XviD files. Fortunately, there is a switch on the left side of the base receiver unit and you can change the transmission channel.  This switch has two separate sides. One side controls the functionality and can be set to either of ""Auto"" or ""Manual,"" and the other side controls channels in manual mode in three positions: 1, 2, and 3. I had some luck with Manual and 1st channel. Other switches on the side are a Control HDMI that can be set to ""Off,"" ""Mode 1,"" or ""Mode 2,"" and Display switch which only has ""On,"" and ""Off.""Operation:Once you place the headphones on your head, it automatically turns itself and the base unit on. You have several controls right from your headphones cans under your fingertips. On the left side, there is only the power button, and charging socket. On the right side however, you can change the volume, input source, loudness, center channel volume, and DSP effects. You don't have to leave your seat to change these settings, and you can do it very conveniently.Sound Quality:I never had any 7.1 headphones before, but I have a good set of Nocs headphones for iPod. Compared to those, the sound is really good. I can't say they are as good as being in the theater room, or as good as Paradigm Signature series home setups, but for what they do, they are completely adequate. You can actually feel some of the lower frequencies and subwoofer effects on these. The maximum volume however, is not going to damage your ears' drums, but it is satisfactory.Shortcomings:1- These do not have automatic HDMI switch. Sometimes when I just want to watch Apple TV without headphone, I have to go either to the base, turn it on, and change the input channel to HDMI 2, and then turn it off again, or I can just do the same process by putting the headphones on my head. It is a little inconvenient. They could prevent this by adding a HDMI switch, or at least providing an IR remote control.2- The size of the headphone is really big. ""Where is your plane parked?"" My wife teases me whenever I put these on!3- No English operation manual! You have to figure everything yourself or translate from Japanese.Verdict:Do these worth about half a thousand of dollars? Same as everything else, it depends. If you watch too many TVs that your neighbors get angry all the time, it is probably the only way to go. There are cheaper optical versions like Sony DS6500 with half the price of these, but they are not as future proof as HDMI. If you are looking for a wireless headphones with good quality and bright future, then give these a try. If you do not need the wireless option, then you can also get the Sony HMZ-T1 Wearable HDTV 2D/3D from Sony. In that case, you better wait for the next version especially in Sony's world. Hope you got interesting information in this mini review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3YYYGRILDLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008072KGC#wasThisHelpful","RY3YYYGRILDLP","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This remote is powerful and has a great range, but after only a year of use all the white prints on the black keys did fall off. It is also a little bigger than what I had in mind. Strangely compared to its big size, it is relatively light! The programming is easy, and I was able to put all my devices into this remote.

"Like all other reviewers, I have no clue why this hood is not included in the Canon EFS 10-22mm pack. Oh wait, 10-22 is not an elite ""L"" lens, right?! So, it is not worthy of having its own hood!Although this hood is expensive, you cannot use any other types of lens hood with this specific lens because of its wide angle of view.

"This movie is one of the darkest and most beautiful movies that I have ever seen about addiction and greed. If you know Darren Aronofsky, the director, you already know that he makes masterpiece fantasies like The Machinist, The Fountain, and Black Swan. He is a visionary director, and his movies always have powerful visuals and topnotch soundtracks. Even if you don't like the genre, Requiem for a Dream is among those movies that you have to watch at least once in your life.The soundtrack of Requiem for a Dream, specifically Lux Aeterna, is one of the most influential music that I have ever listened in my entire life. It has been used in many trailers and movies, including The Lord of The Rings Two Towers' Trailer which features Requiem For A Tower version of Lux Aeterna.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZTI30MK07BI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005Q4CS#wasThisHelpful","RZTI30MK07BI4","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This flash is the Canon's top of the line machine gun, or was until the introduction of the Canon Speedlite 600EX-RT Flash! You will be amazed how fast it reloads. With its incredible 58 meters guide number, which is about 190 feet, it is also very powerful. It is very versatile, and you can turn the head in two different rotational axes which lets you be very creative with the lighting and your bounce options. If your camera does not offer IR Assist beam, this flash has its own and lets you shoot easier in dim lighting. It is a bit heavy, but if you are serious about photography, just forget about any weaker models. Down the road, you will love all the extra features on this one.Overall, it is a versatile and very powerful flash. I am not a fan of artificial lighting, but this flash made a lot of impossible shots possible. There is only one newer and more powerful flash in Canon's lineup and that is 600EX-RT. That one offers wireless control of several flashes and is a little bit more powerful, so you may want to look into that before ordering this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBEWGLVXIH8AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NP3DJW#wasThisHelpful","RBEWGLVXIH8AT","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great book, but the title is misleading. If you are an experienced programmer, you probably know most of the 97 things printed in this book and marked as every programmer should know! For novice programmers, however, there exists some golden wisdom that only comes by years of hard work, experience, and frustrations. As being said, this book doesn't teach you programming, but only some wisdom to help you overcome or prevent some of the frustration down the road.This book lists collected essays from experienced programmers. The essays are short and only two pages long. They are easy to read and follow, but they are sorted in alphabetical order by their titles. Hence, the back-to-back essays are not necessarily content related, and you can just read any one of them as you please. For those who prefer to read related things in certain order, there is a section in the beginning of the book that lists essays with associated page numbers in predefined categories like: Bug and Fixes; Build and Deployment; Code Guidelines and Code Layout; Error Handling; and etc. Overall, it has an easy layout.There is now a Kindle Edition of this book that was not available when I purchased it a few months ago. If you own an Amazon Kindle, or an iPad or any other E-Book reader, you may find e-book to be a better choice. Since the essays are short, you can read small portions easier on the e-book when you are on your breaks or on the road.If you are in your golden age of programming, you may not find this book very useful. However, if you are just started and hungry for more, you will find enough satisfying information that makes this book worth having. Either way, hope this mini review help you further in your decision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G83L76UGM6KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0596809484#wasThisHelpful","R1G83L76UGM6KX","A1Y051MQ2SVPFI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y051MQ2SVPFI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This went together pretty easily. The instructions were sketches with no words which wasn't a huge issue, but I had to experiment a couple times to figure out just what the step required. It would've been a lot faster if it had been clearer. My sons are 2 and 4 so not really age appropriate for putting this together, but my 4 year old LOVES it. He did help with some pieces and he likes playing with it now that it's together. I had him help me find the correct pieces and punch them out.The pieces were all VERY tight which was nice because the whole mill came together solidly as a result (no loose pieces, except the stairs seem a bit loose). But if you think ""this must be the wrong piece because it's not going in,"" keep trying.The solar power works well but the wheel spins SUPER fast. The big complaint I have is that it's really supposed to be a water mill but the water piece doesn't sit low enough for it to go in water... It'd be *awesome* if this worked like a true water mill (in which case the solar wouldn't be necessary)- but it's still a great demonstration of how solar power works.

"This series has well written romance/sexual scenes, but there is FAR too much focus being placed on curves.

At first it seemed a bit thin but it kept expanding to what I expected for size.

"These are great for adults! I think they'd be very good in mixed drinks as they seem to keep the drink cooler than a plastic straw would. I use stainless steel water bottles which I love and these seem to have a similar effect in terms of keeping liquids cool.The brushes are really a nice addition. The straws are bent slightly so your brush can only go to the bent area, but the brush seems to reach the whole straw if you insert at both ends.These are the first reusable straws I've tried but I'm hoping to stop buying disposable straws. My kids are 4 and 2 years old and I don't think I'd want them walking around drinking from these. The edges aren't dull (I don't want to call them sharp because you wouldn't hurt yourself on them unless there was a bit of force used) and I can see where a child might get hurt if they fell while using one.

"I made a DIY Halloween costume using this kit, as well as a few other products. My son loves it.I was a bit frustrated that everything is in 3 languages and English isn't the top language... My son is only 3 so I like him to see lots of English words primarily so he can start to recognize them. Not a huge deal but if there'd been a similar kit with English as the top language, I would've loved to get that instead.We've also got a Melissa and Doug costume with some of same toys... They're about the same quality for the other pieces, but the M&D set's stuff is reusable. The tickets in this kit are paper. I think my son will enjoy that feature. Also, the cuffs in the M&D version come off easy with no key, but this set actually has a key. I like that it has a key but no key is convenient too.I LOVE that this has a case... But there's a plastic cheap insert inside the case to hold everything when you buy it. I decided to throw it out- seems like all kids toys come with that sorta thing and I wish companies would just build a quality case that would hold all the items so the toys would all fit nicely back inside the kit. As is, the stuff just floats around in there... But I'm not taping the stuff inside the plastic insert over and over.Also, I wish the stickers came off more easily.Add: The police whistle doesn't actually work... It makes a reallllly low sound like wind whistling through something. I'm not sure if my child just drooled on it too much, if it's broken, or if it's a strategic move by the people who made it.

"I bought this to read to my 1.5 yr old.We read it twice with no success- he had a hard time sitting for it. I'm a social worker/psychology major so I think that this could work for some kids, based on the ideas behind it. It is REALLY boring to read and you need to practice reading it CORRECTLY if you want to get good results. If you read this with a high pitched excited voice, it won't work. I wish I'd bought the audio book instead and played it for him.I *believe* the best approach for this to get it to work would be consistently and repetition. It's similar to doing shivasana (spelling?) in yoga in my opinion where you don't relax the first time as the teacher leads it, but you get conditioned to relax over repeated classes.As such, given it is boring for parents to read, I think getting the audiobook instead, turning the lights off, and letting your child play quietly with a toy (something that doesn't flash or make noise) for the length of the book would be helpful. If you nurse your child to sleep before bed, you could also have it playing during that. Do this every night. Keep the room cool (our bodies need to cool off to sleep best according to doc we saw for our sons sleep issues). I'd try it for about 15-20 nights before giving up.Oh and there's not many pictures so getting the ebook or hardcover may be pointless. The ebook is nice for travel, but remember that we aren't supposed to have any  ""screen time"" for 1-2 hrs before bed- the lights can trigger our brains to stay awake. So if you get the ebook, I recommend turning it so your child isn't having the screen flashing in front of their face.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5KADY2E0PKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BC09M1U#wasThisHelpful","R1M5KADY2E0PKQ","AFY8QLS51NVI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFY8QLS51NVI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"English is a common language to the people of India, where over seven hundred are spoken. This is a boon for us because it makes for a rich literary tradition that has is immediately and directly available to the English speaking reader. This novel is no exception. While at heart it is a police procedural and a mystery, it is much broader in scope and grasp. It tackles the fascinating city of Mumbai, Sikh culture, the horrors of partition, the Bombay riots, organized crime, and much more of modern India. At it's heart are two central characters a weathered Sikh police detective Sartaj and a crafty powerful crime boss Gaitonde. In the opening chapters of the book Sartaj corners Gaitonde in an impenetrable fortress where Gaitonde takes his own life. Sartaj then takes on the task of finding out why he would and what exactly the notorious crime boss was up to. It turns out to have national implications and has also caught the attention of India's answer to the C.I.A.. Much of the story is told from Gaitonde's perspective it gives the story of his rise to power. Along the way many fascinating ancillary stories are told and a whole cast of colorful characters is brought to life. This is a sometimes long, but altogether satisfying, read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMS7QU7OPU01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJBKU12#wasThisHelpful","R3TMS7QU7OPU01","A12P9KAAW8D9XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12P9KAAW8D9XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No I haven't quite finished this lengthy and intimate look at the Roosevelts yet but already, there is much to say. Like all of Burn's films it does an excellent job of fleshing out it's subject and placing it (or rather them) into the context of American history. These two Roosevelt presidents were from different sides of the aisle but shared much more than their prestigious family name. Both overcame health obstacles, powering through disability and pain that would have cowed lesser men. Both were considered turncoats, traitors to the class in which they were raised. Both believed in loftier ideals than that of the privileged establishment. Above all both were extraordinary public servants when either could have gotten by on inheritance and birthright. And not to be forgotten is the courageous activist Eleanor Roosevelt who redefined what it was to be a First Lady and blazed new trails for all women of the twentieth century. Again, Burns brings these great Americans alive with exhaustive research, interviews with our greatest historians, and archival photos and footage. I can't see getting through this in one sitting, it is a lengthy work. But it is worth investing the time in viewing it at one's own pace. There is much to learn of our nation's history here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNKQSHP2VYHQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NL5NGPW#wasThisHelpful","RNKQSHP2VYHQ5","A12P9KAAW8D9XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12P9KAAW8D9XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This beautifully produced piece bears two similarities to A&E's Madmen, an early sixties timeframe and a handsome male lead with a secret past. But the similarities end there, this is a unique piece altogether. It is about a very successful London obgyn and surgeon with a hidden side business of providing safe illegal abortions to women in need. He is also is an early proponent of the nascent birth control pill which will go on to change society in radical ways. But some things still remain the same. Doctors are still predominately male, and the ultimate accomplishment for a nurse of that period is still to marry one and have a family. This is a great piece with a great cast and does loosely fit the mystery genre, but there is a lot here even for those who aren't mystery fans. It is a layered period piece with a great cast done by British television, which excels in such productions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P9SUVF7R8BYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYFAR6G#wasThisHelpful","R3P9SUVF7R8BYB","A12P9KAAW8D9XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12P9KAAW8D9XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This beautiful album released in 1964 shortly after Washington's death Is Aretha's sixth studio album. It is in no way an imitation of the great singer's voice, they are very different singers, but a tribute to Washington's soulful side. Who better to capture this than the queen of soul herself. She captures the irreverent and blues driven ballad Evil Gal Blues perfectly somehow making it her own and still honoring Washington for whom it was a signature. Johnny Mercer's Drinking Again, another Washington favorite is given a beautiful intensity hear. She takes on two notable standards What a Diff'rence a Day Made and Unforgettable are performed with a distinct soul flavor, just as Dinah gave them, but still unique. If you are either an Aretha fan or a Washington fan this album is a must have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BUE4YM1OVVUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RSEQ6U#wasThisHelpful","R2BUE4YM1OVVUQ","A12P9KAAW8D9XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12P9KAAW8D9XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most ambitious thrillers I've ever read. It was long-listed for the Booker prize last year and is actually four shorter novels that make up the whole narrative which is broad in scope. It is essentially about how big business went to war in Iraq as much as our government did and what conflicts of interest and corruption can arise, Halliburton often came to my mind. There is a tragic bombing and a scapegoat on the run as well a revolving cast of very well drawn characters across several continents. Some characters pop up briefly only to return later. The action goes back and forth in time giving the different and interesting viewpoints of the main characters on the same events which gives us more of the clever plot. One must be on one's toes to keep up but it is entertaining and suspenseful as a whole. The best novel in the group and that most able to stand on it's own is The Kill. It is available separately in paperback if you are reluctant to commit to such a long piece. It is a vivid and richly imagined story within a story documenting the re-creation of a grisly murder set in the crime-ridden streets of Naples. While the author is British, many of the characters are American but use a vernacular that is sometimes distinctly British, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the piece as a whole. This is definitely my favorite Summer read and I am glad that I waited until it was available on kindle as a whole piece in the U.S..","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EBG75ZZVGHA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1W239K#wasThisHelpful","R1EBG75ZZVGHA1","A12P9KAAW8D9XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12P9KAAW8D9XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of this piece offends me on two levels. That masculine, gay men are some sort of rare exception to the rule. Not only an exception, but when stumbled upon are somehow superior. Masculine is good ergo the effeminate is bad, really? The other problem is that these gay men simply seem like a lot of modern gay men I've known. They aren't exactly all that straight acting to begin with they are in a lot of ways like many urban gay men.  Actually, to be blunt there is not much ""acting"" going on at all, except bad acting.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z65UYN1NH6HX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERWMFKA#wasThisHelpful","R2Z65UYN1NH6HX","A12P9KAAW8D9XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12P9KAAW8D9XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Clinique's skin supplies for men for many reasons. Most importantly, for me, they do not use perfume or other things that can irritate the skin. The second is that it gives me a simple, straight forward routine to follow without a lot of steps because basically, I'm lazy. This facial wash is a case in point. It cleans the skin well,without drying, which is a concern for men in their forties. Often I just wash with this and moisturize with M lotion.

"This is an excellent compilation by a varied group of artists. I don't regret purchasing it, but I wish I had known there were three volumes. Parts one and two are available separately, but there is a third version with those two parts plus an extra volume! That said if you are not as rabid a fan of Porter as I, the first volume could suffice. It's an eclectic group of singers spanning the decades from Fred Astaire singing I Concentrate on You, a little too old fashioned perhaps, to Betty Carter's brilliant, ethereal interpretation of Everytime  we Say Goodbye. It is a masterpiece. Sarah Vaughan delivers an ebullient, bouncing version of It's De Lovely that I now hum to myself constantly. An acerbic but light hearted Blossom Dearie sings another song, Always True to you in my Fashion, with perfect delivery. Ella Fitzgerald is as perfect as always on Night and Day straight from her songbooks. An excellent CD for when you have company for cocktails or dinner, it will set a great tone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ER5N3G7PPYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O3YKS0#wasThisHelpful","R39ER5N3G7PPYV","A12P9KAAW8D9XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12P9KAAW8D9XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is an interesting dynamic, a successful female cop in a leadership position as an option, not an exception.

"I got a free sample of this wallet, but I don't think that had a huge effect on my opinion.  Basically this wallet is pretty cool.  It has a matte, uncluttered metal finish.  Inside is a ""fan"" of plastic pockets that will hold 6 cards so they are ready to pull out at any time.  I have been using this for several weeks now and think it works well and looks pretty cool.So why did I deduct one star?  Well, who only has 6 cards these days?  Maybe it is just a limitation of the laws of physics that this is how many slots you can put in a small case.  But since when did Amazon review writers have to be rational, even when they get a free sample?  I tried to double up with two cards in each slot, but if you add more than one extra card the wallet will not latch closed.  7 turned out to be just enough for the cards I really need to carry around with me, including the all important Starbucks gift card.Maybe they could make another design that was more like a cigarette case with a clip to hold all the cards in.  They wouldn't fan out for easy access but you could get a lot more in.  I still feel very posh pulling out my metal wallet and will be using this wallet from now on.  Perhaps the bonus feature is that it is helping me de-clutter my life.  Do I really need all these loyalty cards now that they can just look it up using my phone number?  Do I need my dog's vet record cards and business cards at all times?Well, maybe the business cards.  You never know when opportunity will knock.  I will just need to have a separate case for them.  I can probably live with that.EDITED TO ADD: I have now been using this wallet for many months and I am still very happy with it.  There is no damage including to the plastic card holding device on the inside of the wallet. This is a very hardy product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ZFVJ313VWEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO72QV8#wasThisHelpful","R10ZFVJ313VWEL","AA95FYFIP38RM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA95FYFIP38RM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Dove Deep Moisture Body wash has a fairly light smell, but I don't really like the scent.  It's a bit too candy-like for me.  It comes out of the bottle in a thick, creamy consistency, but it easily breaks in to chunks, and a bit always slides off my hands when I try to lather it.  The design of the bottle is also a little annoying because I can't store it upside down on the ledge of my bathtub, and it doesn't have a neck, so I can't store it upside down through the holes in my shower caddy.The moisturizing formula is nice, and my skin definitely feels softer and smoother than with my Irish Spring Body Wash.  While there isn't anything terribly wrong with this Dove Body Wash, I probably won't buy another bottle after I'm done with this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R102REF8LJTDQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK72CZ6#wasThisHelpful","R102REF8LJTDQE","A3N4VTNFPMTHEF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N4VTNFPMTHEF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These GreenSaver Produce Keepers are meant for people who have the regular problem of produce rotting away in their fridge.  If you're good about eating everything in your fridge before anything spoils, or if you know how to buy manageable amounts of produce, then you don't need this product.  At all.  It's meant for the less responsible of us who don't keep track of what we buy.I have the smallest size of the OXO GreenSaver Produce Keeper, and it's perfect for storing small baskets of berries.  The internal basket is suspended away from the clear plastic container so your produce doesn't get smashed and rotten at the bottom.  The carbon filter does seem to work well for keeping produce fresh, but I'm not really keen on having another filter that I have to regularly purchase.  These containers are kind of pricey to start with, and you have to replace the carbon filter every 90 days.

"I've always been a big fan of Irish Spring bar soap, so I was actually pretty excited to try out this body wash.  It still has the same Irish Spring scent, and it comes in a pretty masculine bottle that's just black and green in color.  The plastic bottle even has a similar shape to a whiskey bottle.  I think the best part of this body wash is how thick it is.  A lot of body washes are so runny that I end up wasting some of it each time I dispense a blob and try to lather.  The Irish Spring body wash is very thick and easy to lather.  A small blob of it will go a long way.Currently, Amazon's price is pretty good for a 15oz bottle and they even offer Subscribe & Save.

"I wanted to try these out despite the questionable name, because I'm a big fan of Pocky.  The boxes are labeled as ""Pocky's friend"", and they definitely taste similar to Pocky, but with a different ratio of biscuit and chocolate.  Rather than a stick of the biscuit, it's a thin tube of it rolled with chocolate inside.  They're only slightly thicker than Pocky.In the end, they aren't THAT much different from Pocky, but I do kind of like that there's more biscuit flavor.

"I got this mainly to be able to listen to Pandora in my car using my phone since I don't have an auxiliary jack in my stereo and it definitely does the job. It's compact enough, but feels well built. It's rubber all over so it feels like it could take a beating if you drop it. The suction cup on the back is very strong and seems like it should stay on my window, thought I haven't kept it there for too long of a time to really test it.The sound from the speaker is really good. I had a previous portable speaker and I definitely think this one has the superior sound. Particularly impressive is the bass which I tested with certain songs, and it performed wonderfully. The volume is impressive too.The Bluetooth connection is pretty straightforward; after you connect your phone once, as long as your bluetooth is on, it will automatically connect when you turn the speaker on. The up and down volume controls on the side second as next track and previous track for your currently running app, which works with Pandora (you hold the button for it to change volume). The play button can second as a call/hang up button when you get calls and can also redial. The buttons are the same black rubber as the sides, so it's hard to see your feel which button it is you're going to press, which can be problematic in the car, so I would have preferred colors and texture to indicate that better.One weird annoying thing about the speaker is that when you turn it on or off, a voice very loudly says ""POWER ON"" and ""POWER OFF."" I'm not sure how to turn that off or even just lower the volume of it...

"My dentist recommended that I start brushing with a Sonicare toothbrush, and she told me that any version that has the Quadpacer timer would be fine.  The Quadpacer timer is basically a feature to help you brush all four corners of your mouth consistently.  As you brush, it will notify you every 30 seconds so that you give each quadrant of your mouth the same amount of attention.  While it seems trivial, it really has helped me brush more consistently and thoroughly.This new Sonicare Gum Health model seems almost the same as my slightly older Easy Clean model, except that it offers three intensity settings.  Both models have the timer feature, and they seem to use the same brush heads and charger too.  As of March 2015, there's about a $15 premium for the newer Gum Health model, but if you do have sensitive teeth or gums, you might appreciate the power settings feature.  I haven't had any issues with my old one-setting brush, so I think most people would be fine saving their money and just getting whatever is cheapest, as long as it has the timer feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNZL2GN6932C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67T3O#wasThisHelpful","R1BNZL2GN6932C","A3N4VTNFPMTHEF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N4VTNFPMTHEF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was actually kind of excited to try this. I can't tell you how often I wish i had something that would hold my phone to my arm while i'm doing other things. Putting it in my pocket isn't always a great option for me so I was hoping this would solve the problem. However, there are a few issues. It's uncomfortable. It's just nylon mesh basically which doesn't feel all that great against bare skin. It does seem to hold the phone fairly securely but getting it IN the holder with only one free hand is a bit of a pain in the butt with the closure they're using. The deathstroke though is that the entire screen is obscured while the phone is in the holster. You can see the corners, but you can't interact with the phone other than with a bt headset to control tracks and volume.

"Admittedly, when I opened the little zipper tote these glasses came in I was a little overwhelmed. I mean they're just sunglasses right? After a few minutes of playing around with them and figuring out how to swap the lenses and reading up on what the various lenses are used for I can honestly say this is the one pair of sun glasses to rule them all.The polarized blue are my favorite for bright and sunny days. The yellow are amazing for night driving. They filter out all of the blue light which drastically reduces glare for night driving, a big thing for me because I have astigmatisms. Changing lenses takes less than 2 minutes, including cleaning them after handling. I keep the little zipper kit with the cleaning cloth and extra lenses in my dash console and just swap lenses out as needed.It's worthy of note that these are also SUPER durable. I'm VERY hard on glasses.

I'm not constantly going back to my tablet to pick it up or get it dirty touching the screen.Incidentally. I also discovered this works VERY well as a small platform art easel.

"I've been taking these specific Vit D pills for well over a year now. They're excellent. No aftertaste or burps or anything weird. They're very small so easy to swallow. They're gel caps so they have a bit of a tendency to stick to each other. Just give the bottle a shake before you pop the top. At a 300 count this is nearly a year supply for one person. Recommended dosage for average weight is 5000 IU (one pill) per day, but remember D is fat soluble and has a tendency to build up in your body fat so if you're overweight you should probably be taking double dosage. Most adults, especially those in modern countries who doesn't get a lot of outside time are woefully low on Vit D and you dont get NEARLY what you think you do from Milk. You would have to drink 2-3 gallons of milk a DAY to get the same equivalent D as one pill. The fortification level in D is to keep you from going critically low... not to keep you at healthy levels. It also helps if you take these with a shot of something fatty like milk so they have something to bind to and get absorbed into your system better that way. I take mine with a protein shake mixed with soy milk in the mornings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PL1WAB9I1T3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JV4934#wasThisHelpful","R1PL1WAB9I1T3Y","A15XI2BEGGFEOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15XI2BEGGFEOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was honestly a little hesitant to try a glass screen protector, but i've used skinomi screen protectors almost exclusively for the last few years and they're all great so i figured i'd give it a shot. I was doubly skeptical when I saw how THIN the glass was, but now that i've had it on my phone for over a month i'm VERY HAPPY with it. You get the benefit of easy to clean glass that has a good touch/feel to it and an almost impossible to scratch surface without any of the tackyness or easy to scratch skin with the hard or soft plastic protectors. This is the best of both worlds. I'll never got back to a non-glass protector again.I'm a LITTLE disappointed that with the way the pre-applied adhesive works it never really fully bonds with the edges of the screen so there's a very small air gap all the way around the screen, but having actual glass totally makes up for it. You can't even see a color difference on the edges once the screen is lit up.

"Excellent pepper. I have a large wooden manual grinder like in the restaurants cause i'm a bit of a nerd about pepper and some spices. Fresh ground is the way to go.

"This stuff does actually work pretty well. I was highly skeptical, but after testing... I can't really argue. Throw 3-5 sprays into the water before you go (assuming you're not about to explode and you can take a couple seconds to do that) and do your business as usual. This has a strong orange citrus smell that does a good job of masking ""other"" odors. This is especially ideal to keep in the office restroom. I'll be bringing a bottle to work soon. Someone in my office is having perpetual taco tuesdays. I will, however, mention that one of our toilets is ""low flow"" so the water level is very low.

"So, yeah, i'm not saying i'm an alcoholic or anything, but I AM an avid home brewer and we go through a LOT of wine. I've been through almost every bottle opener and cork screw design on the market. My favorite is the Rabbit design. I have a $60 gift set a picked up on sale a while back that has a foil cutter and a heavy duty unit and a hard plastic case. That's been my go-to opener every night for years.Until I got this bad boy. First and foremost, lets talk about durability. There are a couple of common failure points on most cork screws, even the high end models. If they fail they usually fail where the moving part of the handle meets the body of the unit just from sheer force exerted OR they'll fail where the top of the actual cork screw meets the body of the unit. That is NOT a concern with this unit. It's made VERY well. Materials are substantial. I think this might last well into the zombie apocalypse. You'll run out of bottles to open before this thing gives up the ghost.Also, i have to say i've been a huge fan of the rabbit design for years. It's an excellent design that uses a 2nd class lever to open the cork. I really didn't think there was any way to improve on that design... but this thing does. It's basically a compact rabbit with some design tweaks that make it more compact without sacrificing ANY functionality. You'll be astonished at how easy it is to pop a cork out.The box is also beautiful, stunning in fact. This is very much a gift set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6WW8VP07HV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z4D1P3Y#wasThisHelpful","RW6WW8VP07HV2","A15XI2BEGGFEOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15XI2BEGGFEOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So we have 3 adults in our house. Each of us has multiple devices that all use micro-usb chargers. I set this up on the kitchen counter and plugged in 6 micro-usb cables so we all had a readily available charging port. Previous to this we each had a single charger set up in our typical sitting area of the living room, but this was problematic because we have multiple devices. Having a power strip and multiple chargers for each of us is a bit ridiculous. This charging station solved that problem. When we walk in the door from the day we'll plug in our phones or other devices and let it sit there for an hour or two. Come back and everything's completely charged. This charges faster than my OEM charger for my Nexus. It's pretty nice. The unit itself is solid and well built. My ONLY criticism at all is this unit really probably should come with 6 small Micro USB cables included. Those are easy enough to find cheap here on amazon though. I have to say I love the fast charging port too. It really does charge pretty darn fast. This is an excellent charger.

"I've reviewed a LOT of BT headsets. I own probably close to 10 pair, two of which are of a similar design as these. My pet peeves are sets that don't come with various size inserts or if it's difficult to open the door for charging. This pair has neither of those problems! Thankfully! I have no fingernails, and even I can pop the charging door off. It also comes with an assortment of various sized inserts for your ears. You're guaranteed to find a fit.Sound quality is excellent. Surprisingly excellent. Clarity is superb with good mid range and bass. Volume controls are very easy to access, though i typically control that via my phone anyway. Battery life is excellent. I have a one hour commute, which is generally when I use them. I used them 4 days in a row (8 hours) before I recharged and they weren't even dead yet so not sure what the full battery life is.I will say that there are two minor points of criticism that aren't so much flaws as much as points to keep in mind. This design uses an inside-the-ear retainer to keep the unit in place. This is comfortable, but not the most secure fit for most people. Because of that you probably wont be able to use these for working out or running without having them occasionally fall out. These are more for casual use, which is fine because they're very comfortable to wear for long periods.I let the GF give this a shot (mistake) and she decided to keep them....

"I've been on this brand of CoQ10 for several years now so when I got the chance to review it for vine I was happy to do so. This particular brand features a black pepper extract that dramatically increases the bioavailability dramatically. That's VERY important. You can give your body everything it needs, but if it can't absorb what you give it there's no point. Also note that this supplement is VERY synergistic with Tumeric (spice - highly anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor) as black pepper also increases the bioavailability of tumeric as well. I also recommend the herb known as Hawthorn for cardiovascular maintenance and blood pressure control as well. There are no suspect fillers in this brand and it's fat soluble so absorption is even better, especially when taken with food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AAFFJ7O7IIUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HES205Y#wasThisHelpful","R2AAFFJ7O7IIUE","A15XI2BEGGFEOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15XI2BEGGFEOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is basically 1/2 a tent and a very clever idea IMO. Like many other reviewers have said, this is a little difficult to assemble if you're not very experienced with tents. I recommend practicing putting it up once or twice. Once you figure out what the (poor) instructions intend it makes sense and you probably wont need them again. Docking a star for that. Otherwise, this is a pretty awesome little sun shelter. Great for picnics or even fishing from the bank, track days, concerts, etc. It's not going to stand up to much in the way of wind.

"Ok, this was a cool opportunity for me to review something I use on a regular basis. I'm a lime-aid nerd. I make it at least once a week and am a little bit of a nazi about it. I only use fresh squeezed limes. I'll share my recipe below. Needless to say, i've got 2-3 of these type of juice extractors along with a few of the standard OJ style manual reamers. This design is FAR superior to the reamers where you press down 1/2 the fruit onto a spike and twist. You get much better extraction with this design.In fact, this really is the best example of a a juice extractor i've seen. It's VERY well made (I've broken 2 other squeezers of similar design). You need to put a lot of tension on this design to get good extraction so it's hard on the metal. This design seems to be prone to breaking at the hinge, but not this baby. It's VERY well made. I have very strong hands and I can really bear down. The components don't seem to get stressed at all. That being true, the longer handles make it so that a lot of force isn't really even necessary. You dont have to be very strong to get good extraction.I was surprised at how much larger this one is compared to my others, It's easily twice the size, but that's probably one of the reasons it's so easy to use. I haven't tried it yet, but you could probably even juice small oranges. You'll be shocked at how much juice you get out of a single fruit, especially if you use my trick below. Highly recommend this particular unit. You'll never need to buy another one.Best Lime-aid Ever:For best juice extraction try microwaving the limes first. They need to be just a little warm to the touch. Don't juice cold limes. You wont get full extraction. Also, roll them on the counter firmly with the flat of your hand back and forth a few times after microwaving. Then cut in 1/2 and juice as normal. Juice 10-12 large limes into a gallon container. juice through a strainer if you're not a fan of pulp. The magic blend of sweetening for me seems to be 2 tbs of Truvia + another cup of white sugar (not bad for a gallon of juice). Using straight Truvia / Stevia isn't that great, but mixing the two is awesome. If you want something sweet, but less intense also try mixing with 2-3 cups of pineapple juice. This plays very well together if you dont want to use stevia or sugar. Serve cold over chipped ice. Also mixes very well with vodka or coconut rum.I was provided this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.

"I have a surgical scar from a fairly deep incision. When I was in the final stages of healing the pain got to be fairly uncomfortable as the nerve endings on the skin started to heal. The pain was actually relatively intense at times, especially in the evenings after a shower when I crawled into bed. There's no way I would have been able to sleep without something to deal with the pain. I had been using ""burn gels"" from the first aid section of Walgreens for a while, but lidocane in those brands ranges from 0.5 to 2.5%. The 2.5% was fairly effective, but difficult to find. I would have to use multiple applications of the 0.5% to deal with the situation, and even then it wasn't long lasting.After looking at the reviews online I decided to give this stuff a try. It's been a godsend! One very small application and the pain is completely gone. Within about 15 seconds the pain is completely gone. There's no sensation at all. This stuff is awesome! Highly recommend for this kind of thing.

"This is a great tasting blend, but honestly not as potent as the True Lime I'm used to. We used this to make an orange cake this weekend, and honestly it took about 1/2 the container to achieve a similar level of intensity of flavor and even then it missed the mark on intensity. The flavor is there for sure, but not as ""in yo face!"" as true lime, which is what I was hoping for. Still, the flavor is excellent. The ginger is honestly pretty subtle. There's not ginger heat at all, but you can tell it's there as a supporting flavor.

"We put this mat through the paces this weekend. We did 2-3 batches of cookies and even some melted cheese chips and nothing, absolutely nothing stuck. Everything peeled off without a problem at all. I have a couple of other mats at home that I actually dont use anymore because stuff cooked on them tends to burn around the edges before the center is done, even on small cookies.

"So I have a buddy (adult) who's into flying RC planes. He's been into it for a while and owns 3-4 different models. I picked this up for him as a gift and he was blown away. Thought it was the most awesome thing he'd seen in a while. The kit is put together well and was assembled in about 20 minutes. Components are fairly well made, constructed well enough to be functional for sure. It actually does fly, which is awesome, though not very far since it's just rubber band powered.

"FYI, I've actually made several batches of soap at home for regular use and have done tons of research on soap making. I was seriously looking at it as a home business option at one point so I'm very familiar with both cold and hot process soaps that use Lye in the traditional methods and the glycerin ""melt and pour"" soaps. This kit uses glycerin soaps which are very safe and easy to handle. There's no lye or harsh chemicals involved at all. This is the easiest method of soap making available.The book is really the crown jewel of this kit. It's very well written with simple and clear instructions that literally a child can follow. The author encourages creativity and thinking outside the box and is more interested in teaching the skill of soap making than just using the components in the kit. That's a huge bonus in my book. The kit does include everything you need to get started and make a couple of small batches. Excellent gift for creative kids into crafty stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D1W6G32MLRCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGM5O3I#wasThisHelpful","R3D1W6G32MLRCV","A15XI2BEGGFEOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15XI2BEGGFEOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Didn't think it was going to make a mess but yeah buddy did it so I went on the hunt for a replacement. Looked over some reviews and based on that and the price this looked like what I was looking for. Very happy with the fact that you can clearly see the size grind through the cup. No more guesswork. You see exactly what you're getting. Grinds quickly and fairly quietly. Also like the fact that the lid is actually a cup. Load your beans in the cup and snap it onto the grinder. When you achieve the desired grind just flip the whole thing upside down and remove the cup. No mess. Very well thought out design. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKXLSU6F80HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SPEU#wasThisHelpful","R2YKXLSU6F80HC","A15XI2BEGGFEOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15XI2BEGGFEOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 2 large dogs. My pit is only about 3 years old and is already showing some signs of hip problems. She's got a slight limp if she's been layign down for a while. Vet said to put them on a glucosamine supplement so did some research and these chews seem ideal. About 3 weeks on this supplement and the limp is completely gone. She seems to have full flexibility back now too as she lays out flat stretched out on the carpet like she used to all the time when she was a puppy. I was really surprised to see an impact that quickly. Both dogs also love the flavor. They think they're getting treats every night so makes giving it to them easy. The price is a little high on the bottle but there's a LOT of them. That's nearly a 4 month supply for both my dogs.

"OK, so i'm a lime freak. I LOVE me some key lime, lime-aid and I make this jello cake we call ""shrek cake"" around the house. I add this stuff to all of that for a super awesome extra lime kick! There's no off-taste at all. It tastes exactly like fresh lime. Not sure how they do that and dont care cause its awesome. :) For anyone interested in the cake it's easy to make. Make a standard white cake either from scratch or box. When you pull it out of the oven (still hot) perforate the top with a fork and pour an ample amount of freshly mixed liquid jello mix into the cake. The cake will suck up a suprising amount of the mix so I plan on 2 large boxes of lime jello mix for a 9x13 pan. That'll fill the cake pan to the top almost. Set the whole cake into the fridge to set for a couple hours. When it sets up mix butter cream frosting with about 2 tablespoons of true lime and mix well. Add some green food coloring too if you like, then apply icing. It's amazing! One of our house favorites! Now that I see they have true orange available now we're going to try that same application next. You can also add true lime to the jello for extra kick but keep in mind that a little goes a long way!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLZKO8VPXPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Z2O0T4#wasThisHelpful","RWLZKO8VPXPM","A15XI2BEGGFEOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15XI2BEGGFEOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not a HUGE fan of selfie sticks, but there's a time and place for everything and there are a few occasions where one of these is handy. This seems to be the cream of the crop.

Telescopes out quite a ways and the rod is very sturdy even when fully extended. The mounting bracket for your phone is universal and should work with almost any of the phones, even the larger ones like my Nexus. The retaining bracket is very strong so your device is safe.

"Ok, admittedly the first time i saw this thing I was like ""really? why not just use a plastic bag?"" This is WAY more durable than a ziplock and is guaranteed to keep water and elements out. It's VERY well made and durable. I'm very impressed with that. It's also nice that it's set up so that you can still use your touch screen through the bag. That's pretty much essential.

"I've had a very similar mount in my car for a long time. The GF liked it so much I gave her this one. The mount itself is well made. It's sturdy and materials are quality. It holds very tight to the dash. No problems there. It also articulates for just about any angle so that's very helpful. It takes a little practice to be able to put your phone in with one hand, but once you get the hang of it there's no issue. Essentially put one side into the bottom of the mount first then use your thumb to hold the top half of your phone up while you use your pointer finger to stretch and snap the other arm into place around the top of the phone. Removing it is the same thing in reverse. It's actually easier to use this than my old mount that has the standard ratcheting arms. Screw that design.

"So we have 3 adults in our house. Each of us has multiple devices that all use micro-usb chargers. I set this up on the kitchen counter and plugged in 6 micro-usb cables so we all had a readily available charging port. Previous to this we each had a single charger set up in our typical sitting area of the living room, but this was problematic because we have multiple devices. Having a power strip and multiple chargers for each of us is a bit ridiculous. This charging station solved that problem. When we walk in the door from the day we'll plug in our phones or other devices and let it sit there for an hour or two. Come back and everything's completely charged. This charges faster than my OEM charger for my Nexus. It's pretty nice. The unit itself is solid and well built. It has a matt black finish so it doesn't hold fingerprints or anything like that.

"I've owned a couple of low end food processors over the years, i think all of them were Hamilton Beach so this is sort of my first serious unit. I have to say, i'm VERY impressed. Construction is VERY good. These pieces are made to last and lock together very well. Blades are sharp and controls are pretty much brain dead easy to operate. It comes with an assortment of attachments. I haven't played with the dicing attachment yet, but the other reviewers seem to rave about it. I have used it to dispatch a great quantity of veggies for a couple of dishes and have been VERY impressed. This unit has the power to get the job done, that's for sure.The included storage container for the various attachments is very handy. I also love that the feet are actually suction cups so that it keeps the unit from walking around the counter. If i were going to have a complaint at all would be that the ""adjustable thickness slicer"" can't be dialed into a specific thickness from that I can see. You seem to control the thickness by how hard you push the veggies down. That leads to some variation in thickness that may not be a good thing for some applications.

"The humidity in my basement is typically greater than 70% (levels above 60% promote the growth of mold and mildew) so a dehumidifier is a must in our basement.  to keep mold from growing, it is advised to keep humidity levels below 50%.

The Perfect Aire has a few more options such as low temperature control and a timer function but also a higher price.The instructions on the Perfect Aire were reasonably clear (although operating a humidifier is not terrible difficult).  The unit was well packed and pretty simple to set up.  Once set up, I removed the bucket and realized that it was difficult to get back into place.  The display readout was pretty intuitive.

The watch band and most of the parts are made of gun metal which is quite attractive.  The only odd part is the rubber ring that goes around the bezel, it really detracts from the otherwise attractive styling.  Setting the time and date was simple enough but the crown didn't have the smooth and tight feel of other watches I've owned.  The face is mineral which means it is susceptible to scratching (sapphire faces are extremely scratch resistant).So, metal band styling is attractive but at the price of readability.  The price is inexpensive and while styling is nice, the crown felt cheap and the face will scratch over time.  The watch is very large which is the current style but  may be too large for some tastes.  Not a terrible watch but not fantastic either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJ4ZLUGI9158/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01445IB84#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJ4ZLUGI9158","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Without electronic stimulation, my boys resort to actually using their imagination.  This toys is perfect.  It's well constructed and can be used for imaginative play, number recognition, or math practice.  For my youngest, this is a fun boy and a way to practice numbers.  My oldest can use this for math practice (although there is only one of each number which limits how much math you can do).

"Current trends in watches favor larger, heavier styles with an industrial look.  This watch definitely fits the current fashion, this is a heavy large watch. It seems to be a pretty sturdy watch and since it has a synthetic sapphire face, should be scratch resistant. The time is easy to set and the piece fells well constructed.

"I tested the lightest shade, Opal.  My skin is very pale so I was concerned that the foundation would be too dark.  I was happy that the coverage blended well and was a very natural color (not too much peachy or pink undertones).  The foundation blended very well and provided excellent coverage.  The foundation I currently use is Urban Decay Naked shade 0.5 and I think the Vichy Opal shade may be just a bit lighter.  The Vichy is also a bit more natural than the Urban Decay (I have struggled to find a good foundation that is not too dark-this may be the one).  The coverage was excellent, I have a sun spot that I am looking to cover, this foundation minimized but did not completely cover this spot.  This also minimized but did not completely cover the dark circles under my eyes that I am prone to.I was happy to read the ingredient list.  This is one of the better sunscreen containing foundation on the market.  This contains 15.6725% titanium dioxide, a mineral sunscreen that provides both UVA and UVB protection and the concentration is high enough to be truly effective.  There were no ingredients that raised safety concerns.This is a well formulated foundation with good coverage, a natural shade, and an easy to apply texture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P9X93GP2KWIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FTWABYE#wasThisHelpful","R1P9X93GP2KWIR","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a refreshing change, a moisturizer that doesn't promise to give me the skin of a child or to transform all wrinkles into unicorns and doves.  This promises deep moisturizing and I found that it delivers on that promise.  The moisturizer was very light and was absorbed pretty quickly without any shininess.  My skin has felt very soft and no issues with dry patches which I had been fighting.  The ingredient list contains no parabens and plenty of well known good performers (glycerin, Shea butter, hyaluronate) .

"I really struggled with how to rate this product.  The sound quality really is excellent but the installation was definitely buggy. I am thinking this is closer to a 3.5 star product because of the difficulties we faced in getting the system set up and it is still not optimal.We are using this in a larger downstairs room and the system still delivers good quality sound.  At all ranges, the sound is rich and clear and travels through the entire room.  The footprint of this product is small and you are not stuck with a zillion speakers hanging throughout the room.  If installation had gone easily, then this would be a hands down 5 star product. My husband and I worked through this installation together and we ran into a problem with trying to get it to connect to our tv.  After running through the troubleshooting guide, we finally called the Bose customer service.  The customer service was very friendly and helpful.  Our SMART  TV is not brand spanking new but it does have an HDMI ARC input.  We could not get the system to work using the ARC input even after multiple troubleshooting tries with the Bose customer support.  The customer support person was exceptionally patient but could not figure out how to get the system to work with the ARC input.  We finally got the system to  work by running everything through the DVD player which is a less than ideal solution.  So if you have a fairly new tv (less than 3 years old) this will probably work perfectly for you and you should consider this a 5 star product.  If not, you may run into issues like we had and this may be a buggier set up for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F32WTM1YSST1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6M8C#wasThisHelpful","R2F32WTM1YSST1","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both my husband and I enjoy long distance running.  I have used a Nathan for carrying gel pouches and carried a collapsible water bottle but I have found that to be tiresome so I was looking for better hydration options.  Needless to say, I was delighted for the opportunity to test this product.  This product is definitely a winner.  The pockets easily held my galaxy or my husbands iPhone, keys, and gel packs.  The bottles were easy to grab when a drink was needed.  The waistpack was comfortable to wear and didn't move around when either I or my husband used this (even with a full bottle of water).

"This is the fifth convertible car seat that I have installed over the last 8 years and this one was hands down one of the easiest to use.  Our son is two and a half so this was installed forward facing using the latch anchors.  We recently installed a Diono in our other car and the installation instructions on that seat were an absolute nightmare (although the seat itself was excellent).The seat itself is on the larger side (much larger than the Diono) and probably won't fit 3 across in any but the largest of cars.  It sits somewhat high which means my toddler can see out of the window very well which makes him happier.  Recaro is well known for making seats for racing cars and they are transferring the safety design features of their seats to their car seat line.  This seat should provide superior protection in a side-impact crash (which can be the most deadly).  In the US, seats are not required to be tested for side-impact crashes but this seat has performed well in side-impact crash tests in Europe. This seat has also performed well in independent crash tests. Another nice feature is the no rethread harness.  For most seats, to change the harness height, you have to uninstall the car seat, remove the straps from the splitter plate, and then rethread them into the higher slots. Sound like a pain in the neck?  That's because it is.  A no-rethread harness adjusts with the knob on the side -way simpler! For ease of use, safety performance, and comfort, I am rating this 5 stars.  The material of this car seat can not be machine washed- only spot cleaned.  Recaro recently recalled a large number of seats (the model I tested was manufactured after the recall date).  For some potential buyers, this may factor into their decision so I am including the information here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSHBS8NF1HPOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V851WWQ#wasThisHelpful","RSHBS8NF1HPOE","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy is a bit of a 21st century rock'em sock'em robot toy.  In this version, the robots have remote controls and spin (which is actually pretty cool) but the goal is to beat your opponent's robot.  In this version, you also kill a Forest of battery trees -10 AA batteries (negative blow to the environment and the pocket book is why this is 4 stars).Outside of the painful battery costs, this toy is pretty entertaining and kept the kiddos occupied for quite a few hours. The toy was relatively simple for my boys to figure out and so far, we have not seen any signs that the toy will fall apart easily.  The price is pretty high, especially when you count in the cost of the batteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJIU31DMO3JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7EXKL0#wasThisHelpful","R2TJIU31DMO3JR","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was torn between a 5 star and 4 star rating for this car seat.  Quality and safety wise, this is an easy 5 stars.  It is a highly rated seat in terms of safety.  This does not have the wings that some of the other models have but in my case, that is a bonus.  My child hates the wings. Not sure why because he is 2 and logic usually does not factor into his decisions.  I seriously considered subtracting a star because I found the instructions difficult to follow.  The pictures were in black and white when they really should be in color.  So there was some mumbled curses while I figured them out.  But, at the end of the day, the instructions were a few hour inconvenience while the car seat will be a multiple-year product.  Since the product itself is so good, I will go with 5 stars.  But be pre-warned, grab a nice glass of beer or wine or cocoa to indulgE yourself and settle into and accept the frustration.This seat has the advantage of a narrow profile so it can be used 3 in a row.  The frame is truly made of steel.  It makes for a heavier but way more solid feeling seat.  We have a 2 year old so use are using forward facing with 5-point harness.  This will seat rear-facing to 45 pounds so can be used for extended rear facing but without some of the bells and whistles of the RXT and GXT models (like wings).  This will work for a newborn through pre school or Kindergarden so it truly is a seat that will suit all your needs.  This is a top-rated safety seat and it feels it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZRPO3B53QIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009S1DWP2#wasThisHelpful","RZZRPO3B53QIR","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 8-year -old son is doing a mystery/detective unit in school and this was a great compliment to what they were learning in the classroom.  This is really a science lab kit with a detective twist -lots of experiments for kids to run.This set is probably best geared for kids at least years of age.  The set comes in a case and comes with a guide and a bunch of detective tools (finger printing powder, crime scene tape, magnifying glass, black light, tweezers, notepad for writing crime details).  I really liked that this kit wasn't electronic and that it let my son use his imagination and brain to work through the problems.This is a great set for kids who like to solve puzzles and riddles.

"With the trend towards paleo and gluten-free eating causing many people to eliminate pasta from their diets, the increased interest in spiralizing is spawning many cookbooks. Spiralizers basically turn vegetables into noodle substitutes.  Paradise for veggie lovers and a great gluten and grain free substitution.My family loves vegetables and we look for lots of ways to incorporate veggies into our diet so I was very interested in trying this cookbook.  So far we have tried a handful of recipes and all have been VERY good.  The book organization is by diet type and not meal type so you can't flip to a soup or salad section.  Instead, there are paleo, vegan/vegetarian, raw food, gluten-free chapters.  There is also 3 chapters covering basics, the spiralizer pantry, and getting started.  We have liked what we have tried but the only downside is that there is an awful lot of squash recipes.

"This is a workout targeted for intermediate/advanced exercisers and it is now my new favorite workout program.  I am midway through week 7 and I have gained noticeable definition in my arms , legs, and waist/core (comments from coworkers on my arms:) I am an exercise fan and have been working out for years but I have been holding on to about 6 pounds of post-baby weight for 2 years and I was looking for a program to help me kick up the intensity.  This did not disappoint.First, this really isn't a program for beginners. I would consider myself an advanced exerciser. This year, I have run 2 half marathons and I can do full push-ups, pull-ups, and chin ups.  I found this program difficult but doable.  I began this program able to do a full push-up but now I can do clapping push-ups.  So I am very pleased with my gains in strength and definition.This program requires only weights (light to heavy).  The workouts are all about 30 minutes long and have a warm-up followed by 4 circuits each consisting of 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of core. There are multiple types of exercises included from body weight only, plyometrics, balancing, static holds, ect. This really does work multiple muscle combinations ans muscle fibers.  There is a lot of jumping and plyo so if you have issues with joints, you will probably want to pass on this.The program is led by Jillian and a group of professional trainers.  There are quite a few I have seen in other programs including Zuzka Light, a personal favorite.  Jillian's banter with the cast is friendly and light spirited and the cast is all superbly fit and strong -definitely enjoyable.So far, I have lost 2 pounds and increased muscle definition.  I am going to do the 21 day fix extreme after this and then repeat this program.  I will update with a comparison of the two programs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJFD0YR1STQEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VS36SN6#wasThisHelpful","RJFD0YR1STQEX","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have mixed feelings on this cookbook.  The recipes are great so I am going with four stars.  There is definitely an Asian theme but the author is Asian and writes in the introduction that these recipes are inspired by how she ate and cooked while growing up.  Asian inspired recipes are a huge hit in our house (especially with my 8-year-old son) so that is a selling point for us. The recipes we have tried have been very tasty.  I think this is just trying to take advantage of the huge popularity of CSAs but really it doesn't really fit that well.  There are a lot of unusual ingredients like tomato leaves, radish leaves, or pea shoots.  Well, in the CSAs I have been a part of, I have never gotten tomato leaves because the farmer keeps them on the plant so the tomatoes will keep growing.  This is really a Use All of Your Garden cookbook and would be better suited for gardeners.The mixed feelings comes from the intro and writing stype which I  found a little off putting.  She writes about how she grew up with an immigrant family that always cooked and ate all the ingredients and how they were cooking while their American neighbors were eating boxed mac and cheese and wasting half their produce.  Really?  I grew up eating home-cooked meals and not mac and cheese or other convenience foods.  Many Americans of my generation ate  real home-cooked food with real vegetables.  The whole vibe of the intro felt like she was saying ""silly Americans, let my wise Asian culture teach you how to eat real food"" which I found somewhat insulting.  The writing as a whole just felt somewhat patronizing to me which is why this is not a 5 star book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UVCMQXMTYHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760347298#wasThisHelpful","R2UVCMQXMTYHU","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The instructions say that the battery can go for about 2 years between charges and then it is charged via a USB port.  I have only used this for a month but the battery shows no signs it will need a charge soon.  The only minor con for this is that the case is somewhat on the heavier side.

"This is a solid and well constructed bunk bed.  This bed has a maximum weight allowance of 125 pounds so this is really only meant for children through their early teen years.  I could not determine what type of wood this bed is made of but it does seem to be made of some sort of hardwood.  It does not seem to be made of pine or some other cheap type of soft wood.When this arrived, I was really impressed with how it came.  You could drive a car over this and you probably wouldn't damage it.  A lot of care and thought went into ensuring it would arrive without any damage.On the other hand, the instructions were not well done.  There were pieces missing from the instructions and the pictures could have been clearer.  I was tempted to remove a star for the instructions but because the bed quality was so good I decided I would note it in the review so that buyers would be forwarned.  For example, in one place, it indicated that pieces G, D, and E were required.  It left off piece H although piece H was in the picture.  Sometimes they indicated that the orientation was important and in other places they didn't (even though it was).  Since there sometimes could be two ways the orientation could work but only one was correct, this could lead to problems a few steps later.  If the orientation was wrong, you would have to take the last couple of steps apart.Quality-wise, this bed is excellent.  We have put together many pieces over the years and this is definitely one of the better built ones.  We really were pleasantly surprised at how well made and solid this bed is.  I am a bit of a worrier parent and I had no qualms about my child sleeping in this bed.  The pieces fit together perfectly with perfect alignment.  This bed should have no problems standing up to children (this is from a mom of two rowdy boys).  I would expect this to last many years.Overall, I would definitely recommend this bed.  The quality is very good and should last long past when your child outgrows this bed.  If you have a very large child, please not the maximum weight allowance of 125 pounds to determine if this bed will work for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q12NTCRE59JV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQX7R7G#wasThisHelpful","R1Q12NTCRE59JV","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was mostly tested by my 8-year old son who really enjoyed playing with this product.  The removable stock and barrel extender doesn't really seem to add much value and I think some of the other Nerf products shoot better and farther than this one.

"Toshiba's Satellite Laptops come in different series. This particular model is their C series which is aimed at the budget-minded consumer who wants a basic laptop without the extra features.  As such, this is a great entry-level laptop for school work or for someone who just requires a basic computer for email and other household tasks.  This is not the laptop to buy if you do graphic design or gaming. Toshiba offers other series with more features for more intensive activities.  Other series are the S (more power and speed, better display), P (their premium line, way more features), L (next level up from C, a few more features), and the CL (designed to be more portable).  This is reviewed accordingly as a basic feature laptop.  For a basic feature laptop, I think they have done a very good job of packaging a lot into this value-positioned machine.  This computer comes with a very respectable 8 GB RAM, 1 TB storage, and a very nice Core i5 processor. This was ready-to-use out of the box and set-up was an absolute breeze.  I set this up for myself and for my school-age son who has been using this for school work and online academic programs.  Very simple set up.This laptop has one USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0, an HDMI connector, and a DVD  player/burner. Also comes with video camera.  Wireless is only 802.11 b/g/n (not ac).This laptop does not have a touchscreen and the screen quality is really pretty average  The keyboard is not backlit and definitely feels on the cheap side.  I have noticed keys getting a bit stuck under the edges of the keyboard.  Not a big problem but definitely contributes to the cheap feel. I guess if you are going to scrimp somewhere on a value laptop, I'd rather it be the keyboard then the hardware. The cons are mostly minor and outweighed by the pros (good  processor, RAM, and storage) so I would definitely recommend this laptop.  It would be perfect for kids who need a computer for school or for the casual home user.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJMLSZ6XCLRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFY8LY2#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJMLSZ6XCLRG","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a large (and heavy) printer that takes up a large footprint.  Set up of this machine was pretty straight forward. The instructions were clear and easy to follow and I had no issues setting up the machine.  I set this up to print wirelessly.  Again, instructions were very clear.  I didn't need to install any drivers because this was recognized by all my machines as a network printer.Print quality was ok, not spectacular but not terrible.  I printed a photo as a test and some routine color documents.  I wouldn't use it for routinely printing photos but it is fine for normal household and homework use.  I can't comment on the longevity of the ink cartridges yet or the durability as I have only been using the machine for a few weeks.  If these do not perform as expected from the product description, I will update this review.  The scanner and copier functions worked well but I did not test the Fax.  Overall, this is a nice multiple-functional machine that is good for routine household use.  I would not recommend this if you want crisp high-quality printing but for routine use (which is how this will be used in our household) this is a good machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBUN0GGNE6XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUU7KNY#wasThisHelpful","R1BBUN0GGNE6XR","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a facial cleaner that is meant to compete with the more expensive alternatives such as the Mia.  I have tried a variety of deep cleaners and in my opinion, most of them perform similarly, the extra cost is for the perks.  Overall, this does a comparable job for facial cleaning as the more expensive Mia and the less expensive Olay Pro -X.  The Silk'n offers more perks than the Olay version such as charging station (instead of batteries), more brush options, and more variations for speed.  This has less options than the Mia (only one button to cycle through the speed options and no signals to move between facial zones).  Construction-wise, this feels not quite as well built as the Mia but sturdy enough.  I have only used this for a few weeks so I can't comment on long-term durability.As far as cleaning goes, this performs well.  Extra cost is for the product perks.

"My toddler (and my older child!) find this toy fascinating.  My 2 year old has been playing with this for a couple of weeks and really enjoys this toy. Since it makes no electronic sounds, requires no batteries, and builds skills, I like this toy too.  These click and pop pieces are easy for small pudgy hands to grasp and put together.  Each side has either a cup or a ball on the end.  The ball fits into the cup and has to be pushed firmly in until it snaps together, a nice hand eye coordination activity.  My youngest just turned 2 years old and he is able to fit the pieces together so this is definitely doable by the youngest of the recommended age range.  Pieces are holding up to toddler use.  We've been making shapes, letters, and practicing colors together.

"I have very mixed feelings on this device.  When it works, it is great.  The problem I have been having is that the device keeps disconnecting from my phone.  Often multiple times a day.  A device that is supposed to keep you connected to your phone should stay connected to your phone.  This seems pretty obvious.  I have rebooted my phone and that doesn't fix the issue. So it is hard to give this anything but 3 stars.One of the features that you can download is a fitness tracker.  Well it is very frustrating when it disconnects right before or during your workout and then you lose all tracking of the exercise.  One note, this seems to underestimate the steps you take.  My counted steps and my recorded steps were about 10% off.The device was pretty straightforward to set up.  The app was easy to easy.  If the device was more reliable, this would be a 5 star product.5/2/15. Updating this review and downgrading to one star.  Now this device is failing to hold a charge for more than a couple of hours.  This band lasted just a couple of weeks and now seems to be almost dead.

"This is a fun and stylish watch that is also a beautiful piece of jewelry.  The face on this watch is large and I was a little worried that it would overwhelm my small wrist (I am slight to medium framed but only five feet tall) but it looked great. The band also could be worn without needing another hole added so I was pleased.  Materials wise, this looks like a beautiful and nicely constructed watch.  This is not a watch that is made for hard wear. The instructions state that the leather should not be exposed to water other than briefly.  The face is made of mineral so is scratch resistant but not as durable as one made of sapphire.  The watch itself, minus the band, is water resistant to 33 feet so with a different band this could tolerate showers.

"This is the fourth convertible car seat I have used over the years.  This one lacks a lot of the bells and whistles you will find on higher end car seats but it is comfortable and very easy to use.  And to be honest,  extras like the cup holder on my other seat seem to be used to hold crumbs and whatever else my little magpie has decided to collect and rarely used for cups.Any car seat you will find for purchase will meet mandated safety requirements.  All car seats have to meet these safety guidelines and every year, they are safer.  This seat was easy to install and comfortable for my child.  My child seems to prefer this seat to the fancy more expensive seat I have in the other car.  The harness is easy to tighten or loosen.

I wonder where that plot device came from).  On the island, he finds himself in a world where bugs are in a war for survival against the lizards.  Max uses his big human brain to help save the bugs from the lizards.  The story appealed to my 8-year old boy who read it in one sitting and now wants the next one.

"This may have been the most painless set up experience I have ever had with wireless speakers.  Connecting this speaker to my iPad took under 5 minutes and the instructions were unbelievable easy to follow.  There was no need to download a special app and the devices paired immediately with no troubleshooting.  I paired the speaker, started the music playing and it was a little dance party for me and my toddler.  This easy experience engendered quite a bit of love from me as I have had some painful experiences in the past with wireless speakers.  The speakers were small and the battery life seems pretty good, I haven't reached the end of the batteries yet so I can't comment on how long but this isn't a battery eater.

"I have purchased both expensive (plus 100 dollars), cheap (around 30 dollars), and in-between non-stick cookware.  Minus differences in weight and quality of the riveting and construction, they all have seemed to last around the same amount of time before the nonstick surfaces ceases to be nonstick (between 1 to 2 years).  Therefore, I really am reluctant to spend a lot of money on nonstick cookware.  For me, this is a good price point for nonstick cookware.  The construction on these is a bit on the light size and I would not recommend this for high heat cooking but as a nonstick set, this is definitely serviceable. I have really liked the little single serve egg pan, its perfect for cooking eggs for breakfast sandwiches.  The nonstick surface performs well enough, some minor sticking if you do not add oil (or make sure the oil coats the pan).  In general, I am pretty pleased with this set and think it would be a good starter set.

"I have been looking for cookbooks like this because both my husband and I work outside the home and we have two small children.  Cooking during the week needs to be quick and easy because the time between walking in the door and toddler melting down is unfortunately pretty short.  This cookbook offers 8 strategies for planning and preparing meals that can be ready to eat quickly (prepare ahead, reheat and eat, bake and serve, fridge to table, shop smart, Sunday cook, crockpot, stock the freezer).  This book also has a hints and tips section for making prep ahead easier.  We have tried a couple of recipes in this book and have been pleased with all.  In particular, there was a roasted eggplant lasagna that everyone in the family (including my husband and toddler loved).  I have been married for 14 years and this is the first eggplant dish that my husband actually liked and the toddler just demolished it.  The toddler also loved the chicken shish kabobs (as did everyone else in the family).  The only real con to this book was that the preparation time for some of these recipes could be pretty long (over 2 hours in some cases).  Since the one thing we don't have  a lot of is time (something many of the potential readers of this could book probably share in common), it would have been nice to see more meals with shorter prep times.  I also wish the section of stocking the freezer was a lot longer.

"This vacuum is targeted as a more budget-friendly version of a popular but very expensive brand.  Honestly, it has a lot to offer and is definitely worth looking at more closely if you need a powerful vacuum but don't want to drop 500 bucks on a vacuum.  First and foremost, this vacuum has A LOT of power.  When I stopped moving this vacuum, I could see a cheerio two inches away from the vacuum being pulled into the vacuum head.  I vacuumed my room just after going over this with my Miele and this pulled up a bunch of new dirt.This vacuum can be used on hardwood floors and carpet.  Turn off the brush (little button near the top) and this is suitable for hardwood floors. Turn on the brush and you can do carpets.  This comes with the standard hose, wand, and crevice tool so that you can spot clean, do edges and corners, and furniture.  This also comes with a pet erase tool (I think this is the only feature that really is specific to a  pet vacuum).  The vacuum head of this vacuum was pretty maneuverable which made it very easy to vacuum around furniture and tables and under things.This did a pretty good job as a vacuum and considering the price, is definitely worth looking at closely if you are in need of a new vacuum.  There are a few things that keep this from being a 5 star vacuum.  First, it is heavy at close to 17 pounds.  Second, the instruction manual was definitely missing key details that made assembly and early use a little difficult.  There is no release button for lowering the handle, just pull down.  I didn't want to break it if there was a release handle so I was pretty gentle and I couldn't get the handle to lower.  Finally figured out that there was no release button and I just pulled down hard and the handle lowered.  The cord does not retract.  I have gotten spoiled by retractable cords and this has a long cord to roll up.All in all, a pretty good vacuum for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6X7OD1HOK7EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR5UJJU#wasThisHelpful","R6X7OD1HOK7EW","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a lot of things to like about this stick vacuum.  There are also some areas where this could be improved.  I spent a lot of time trying to decide between 3 and 4 stars for this vacuum but I ended up going to 4 stars but it is really a 3 and a half star product.This is a cordless stick vacuum that also contains a handheld vacuum.  It is very easy to remove the handheld vacuum.  This came with crevice and dusting rushes for the handheld.  The handheld did a pretty good job on cleaning up popcorn on the couch and cleaning the car.  The maneuverability of the stick vacuum was pretty amazing, I have to admit I was impressed with how easy it was to navigate my kitchen and dining room with this (one of the features that I feel elevated this to the 4 star rating).  I never tested how long this would operate on a charged battery but I used this for over 20 minutes without running low on power (this long because my toddler decided to help clean and wasn't going to let go of the vac so it kept running).The LED lights are  a nice feature, it makes it easy to see the dirt to clean. The brush roll clean technology is also nice if you tend to get a lot of tangled hair in your vacuum brushes.  I have a lot of long hair and I she quite a bit.  I have spent a lot of time cutting hair out of brushes so I really appreciated how easy it was to clean the vacuum brushes.  This has a reusable filter and no bag, you just dump the dirt in the trash.  All of these features were easy to use and pretty intuitive.Some of the features that could use some work were the suction power and the engagement with the docking station.  Regarding suction power. this did a nice job and smaller and lighter crumbs but it had difficulties with things like cheerios and beans (it did not have difficulties with these items when the vacuum was used as a handheld, only when used as a stick vacuum).  I have a toddler and cheerios are often on the floor so I was disappointed that this had trouble with picking up cheerios and other larger/heavier crumbs.  Another negative was that this can be a pain to dock on the charging station so that the light comes on and it begins to charge.  I often have to reset it multiple times before the charge light engages.  It seems like other reviewers have had problems with the charging/dock station.I mostly really liked this vacuum.  It is convenient and easy to use.

"Scales with BMI information, calorie estimates, and goal weight tracking are extraordinarily helpful for anyone who is trying to lose or maintain weight.  I am comparing this scale with the Ozeri Touch scale, which I have been using for about a year.  They are both priced comparably but they have slightly different features.  Both scales give weight to one decimal point out.  Happily (well sort of) both scales gave the same weight (I wish that weight was a few pounds less but alas at least they were in agreement). Both allow you to program 8 profiles.  The Ozeri gives weight plus percentage fat, percentage muscle, hydration, and bone mass.  The Bowflex gives BMI, recommended calories, and difference between goal weight and current weight.  Both are useful depending on your goals, the Bowflex is probably a bit more useful for those looking to lose weight.  One feature the Ozeri has is that it automatically recognizes you based on your weight so you don't need to select a profile.  With this scale, you have to select your profile.  Both scales were easy to program and constantly gave the same weight.In summary, this is a good performing scale that is accurate.  It is easy to use and reliable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381TLORNFPX88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GM33ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R381TLORNFPX88","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess to being a bit of a conditioner snob.  I typically only use salon conditioners because I have ""temperamental"" hair (i.e. damaged from coloring and heat styling combined with its naturally tendency to frizz). I tried this conditioner and the Fekkai Prx conditioner and while both were very good, I think the Prx conditioner is a touch better for increasing softness and keeping hair manageable.  This conditioner was on par with a salon conditioner and left my hair soft and manageable and is really a very good conditioner.  The conditioner has a pleasant light scent and is very thick.  I did not notice any increased glossiness in my hair after use but my hair was still soft.  In the future, I would probably just get the Prx conditioner because I think that one is better for damaged hair.  This would be more suitable for finer hair and for hair that is not heavily damaged.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCW15DP4PCDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRDPNM0#wasThisHelpful","R3LCW15DP4PCDL","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess to being a bit fussy about my conditioners - I typically only use salon conditioners because my hair can be a bit ""temperamental"".  This conditioner is on par with the conditioners you would typically buy in a salon.  Cheaper conditioners are often thinner and don't always do a good job at preventing further damage.  This conditioner is very thick and rich, the scent is light and pleasant, and my fair feels soft and manageable after using.  I have used this conditioner for a couple of weeks and I am very pleased with this (hair still soft and no increase in split ends).  I think this conditioner would be too heavy for fine hair but would be very suitable for hair that is medium textured to coarse.  For reference, my hair is medium to thick, wavy, and damaged on the ends from heat styling and coloring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26NLW5YJ5DIUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYZY68Y#wasThisHelpful","R26NLW5YJ5DIUA","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are looking for one workout that will cover everything, this is worth looking at.  The target group for this is beginners to intermediates.  This requires some dumb bells or resistance bands.  Each segment of R.I.P.P.E.D is covered as a separate section (resistance training (7 minutes), intervals (5 minutes), power (10 minutes), plyometrics (5 minutes) and endurance (10 minutes)).  There is a warm up and a cool down.  Before each segment is an instructional tutorial.  There is an option to play the workout with or without the tutorial. There are beginner to advanced modifications for all exercises and low impact options are presented.The exercises themselves are a lot of solid tried and true standards with some innovative moves fit in. While they claim that you will burn 700 calories I doubt very few people will burn actually 700 calories doing this workout.  Maybe if you are 6 foot four inches and over 200 lbs but most people won't burn that kind of calories with this workout.Cueing on this video could be better.  The instructors can be a little chatty.  These are minor points and I think the overall merits of the workout are enough to bring it up to 4 stars. This would be a good video for someone who only wants to own a few DVDs and who wants to cover everything in a workout.  This is not quite as hard as a Jillian Michaels workout but it is still a solid workout if you are an advanced beginner to intermediate.  If you are looking for something like insanity or p90x, this may be too easy for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R216EY9LW6C1N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF46P6E#wasThisHelpful","R216EY9LW6C1N3","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a barre style workout that is most appropriate for beginner exercisers.  There are two workouts on this DVD and the only equipment required is a chair, mat, and a towel.  Both workouts are about 30 minutes and largely focus on the butt and legs.  The movements are gentle and easy on the joints.  Neither of these workouts would be a problem for someone with joint issues.Both workouts use a chair to mimic a ballet barre. Both workouts take you through a standing series on the barre with ballet inspired moves. The burn and firm workout is almost entirely lower body work and is done standing.  The lengthen and strengthen workout has more core work included and more floor work included.Cueing is done well, the scenery is beautiful, and the video is well produced.  This video would appeal to someone who likes Pilates and yoga.  You do not need a ballet background to use this nor do you need to be super coordinated.  The only thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is the lack of any real upper body work.  The video claims to give you a balanced body which suggests a total body workout.  This is really a lower body and core workout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35VXBZ9EOU41U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEHCR1E#wasThisHelpful","R35VXBZ9EOU41U","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an adequate but not spectacular slow cooker.  Considering it is made by All Clad and carries a hefty price tag, I really expected a lot more from this product.  It really didn't deliver.  I would consider myself fairly well versed with slow cooking. I use a slow cooker at least twice a week.  Compared to the Hamilton Beach slow cooker that I have been using for years, this All Clad is far inferior.  One thing I didn't like about this is that you can't program this slow cooker for shorter periods of time.  It has a four hour minimum time but I have recipes that only cook for two hours.  I need to set a timer to use this which defeats the purpose of a programmable slow cooker.  This also doesn't come with a temperature probe which something this expensive should have.

"One of the reasons I use a flat iron is because I have 2 crazy cow licks at my hairline that make my bangs go in all crazy directions.  This is the best flat iron I have used for getting right down to the hairline and pulling those suckers straight.  Basically, if you need an iron with a lot of maneuverability, this one does a very nice job.There is a screen that indicates the temperature the iron is set at.  This can be changed by pushing either an up or the down button.  For my hair, which is medium to fine, I set the iron at 180 degrees (the default and lowest setting) and the iron did a great job getting my hair smooth and straight.  These buttons are on the side of the iron.  One potential problem is that these buttons, along with the on/off buttons, are easy to hit with your hands and I have inadvertently shut this iron off at least once in the month that I have been using it.  Normally I would deduct a star for this but I am so happy with how close I can get to the hairline that I can't make myself take off a star.Personally, I love this iron because it makes my crazy cowlicks look shiny and neat (something that my previous flat irons didn't do well).  The only drawback is the placement of the buttons.  Good product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDTGBXMHK11RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYDSAO4#wasThisHelpful","RDTGBXMHK11RN","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used hot rollers since high school (about 20 years) but I have always used the ones with the wire pins to hold them in.  This set uses clips to hold the rollers.  This took a bit of getting used to but I personally liked the clips much more than the wires.  I use rollers for large waves in my long hair and the clips are perfect for this. I can't get the clips to hold the roller in close to my head, if you like your rollers set that way, this may not be a good set for you.I found these rollers heated up within a few minutes and as expected, set my hair within 5 minutes.  There was nothing fancy about the rollers themselves, they are your basic hot roller with one difference.  Unlike previous sets, the heating rod does not go through the bottom of the roller but through the side.  This means you need to be careful how you grasp them or you could get burned.  Because they sit on their side, this set also takes up about twice as much space as conventional hot rollers so if your counter space is limited, you may want to look at a different set.This set comes with 12 large rollers and 8 medium rollers.  There are no small rollers.  This is another feature I liked.  I never used the small rollers and mostly just use the large ones.These are basic no-frills hot rollers.  They work well and heat up quickly.  On the downside, they take up a lot of room and there is the potential to burn your fingers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1572PQH1AS4BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB8ZIQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1572PQH1AS4BA","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a book I would have typically picked up.  It had a few reviews that were very positive so I thought I would give it a try.  I am very very glad I did.  The easiest way to describe this book was riveting.  The author tells a tight,fast moving narrative that really draws you into the lives of the unfortunate hikers who perished in Russia so long ago.  The story is not familiar to Americans but is apparently quite well known to Russians.  Nine very experience hikers took off on a long hike in the Ural mountains over their winter break.  The goal was to document their hike for the purposes of obtaining certification as elite hikers. This meant that there was a treasure trove of pictures and diary entries that the author used to recreate their final days.  For some reason, on their final day, they ripped open their tent and fled half clothed into the brutal winter night.  Their bodies were found almost a mile from their tent with brutal injuries.  Why has remained a mystery for years.  The explanation the author comes to, which is only possible due to modern research, is plausible.  The author treats the story with care and compassion and fully draws the reader into the story. This is an  all around excellent book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MSXAYHT7PATH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452112746#wasThisHelpful","R1MSXAYHT7PATH","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My oldest son used a Britax Convertable  car seat which we were very pleased with.  Six years later and we were again in the market for a Convertable car seat.  My infant seat goes up to thirty pounds but at five feet tall, carrying 20 pounds of baby plus car seat weight was about killing me.  And, I have a CRV so I had to lift chunky monkey and seat into the car- so time to switch!So how is this car seat? First, let's address installation.  I found this to be similar to the Britax.  I had to push down on the seat to get the latch engaged.  No big deal once I realized that the latch belt needed to be in the proper location for the rear facing option. The manual had fairly easy to follow instructions.  For my son (9 months), the position of the head rest and the buckle were perfect so I did not attempt to adjust these.  Our installation was position 3 rear facing.  This is the most tilted back.  Ther is the option for two tilt positions for the rear facing installation.  It was pretty easy to go between the two positions.This seat is sold on its comfort.  My baby hated his infant seat, he'd scream as soon as he was placed in it.  Obviously at 9 months he is too young to tell us how he feels but i can report that he does not scream when he is placed in this seat. Sometimes he stays happy.  He sleeps well in this seat.  We drove 300 miles (one stop) and he was happy or asleep for most of the ride.  He seems pretty comfortable and happy in this seat.This seat has a nice built in cup holder.  The safety ratings are very good and the seat feels well built.  The only con to this seat is that it is pretty hard to unbuckle.  You really have to press in hard to get the buckle to release.  Pretty minor con and I can definitely recommend this seat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R147XGTYXE1MSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009X4C796#wasThisHelpful","R147XGTYXE1MSJ","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good diaper should hold in wetness and ""other stuff"", should be adjustable without tearing, and should be nonirritating to the baby. I received these and the Pampers Swaddlers for the purpose of reviewing these.  I typically buy Huggies Snug and Dry. I found little difference between this diaper, the Swaddler, or Huggies except that the Swaddlers cost a lot more and had a moisture detection dye.  All diapers do a reasonable job of holding in wetness and ""other stuff"" although the Baby Dry did seem to do a marginally better job.  None of the diapers tore during use and my son did not develop irritation during use.  I should note that my son does not seem to have a problem with irritation with any diaper except for Luvs (those turned his bum acid red). These diapers were less bulky than Huggies.  These do have a slight scent which I personally think is unnecessary, a poopy diaper is still stinky. Adding a scent does not make the diaper any less nasty smelling and its just an unneeded chemical that can cause irritation to a baby with sensitive skin. I deducted a star for the scent.  I would buy either these or Huggies, depending on which had a better price.  If both were priced about the same, I would go with the Huggies because they do not have a scent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DEZ4NZFOPY8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDMIWYI#wasThisHelpful","R3DEZ4NZFOPY8E","A28FJ93TJSSQS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28FJ93TJSSQS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good diaper should hold in wetness and ""other stuff"", should be adjustable without tearing, and should be nonirritating to the baby.  This diaper did mostly well on all counts.  Used overnight, we had 2 times where my son woke up wet in the morning.  There was one ""blowout"" during the day.  This was over 186 diapers.  All-in-all, not too bad and something that could be chalked up to parental error.  We have had similar results with the Huggies we typically use.  These are a thinner (less bulky) diaper than our Huggies Snug and Dry.  None of the closures ripped on us and our son showed no signs of irritation (although he does not seem to have sensitive skin).  These do have a slight scent which I personally think is unnecessary, a poopy diaper is still stinky.  Adding a scent does not make the diaper any less nasty smelling and its just an unneeded chemical that can cause irritation to a baby with sensitive skin.  I deducted a star for the scent.  These have a moisture indicator strip (goes from yellow to blue) which is not really needed by the time you are in a size 2 diaper (unless you have a monster newborn).  These are nice enough diapers, I liked but did not love them.

"Coming of age movies have found a built in audience with teens for years. As far back as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE through THE BREAKFAST CLUB and on, the problems faced by teens growing up has felt a similar concept running through them while adapting to the situations faced by each successive generation. So it’s always interesting to see what comes next as we do this week with PAPER TOWNS.Based on the best seller by author John Green who wrote last years THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, this movie takes a look at life through the eyes of narrator Quentin “Q” Jacobsen (Nat Wolff). As the film opens a younger Q tells us about the first moment he set eyes on his new neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman and immediately fell in love with her. As they grow they start out friends but a chance encounter with a suicide victim’s body changes their dynamic. Q grows into a semi-nerd while Margo (Cara Delevingne) runs with the popular kids, becoming the talk of her generation with the various adventures she has supposedly gone on.Q hangs with his two best friends Ben (Austin Abrams), a cocky little guy who talks big about his sexual conquests which obviously have never happened and Radar (Justice Smith) the only member of the trio to actually have a girlfriend. The prom is coming up and only Radar has a date. This is there life, a situation where all three never take walk off of the path to success or dare to do anything they shouldn’t. That all changes in one night.One evening Q is awakened by Margo sneaking into his bedroom window. She tells him she needs to borrow his mother’s car but he refuses. Instead he tags along with Margo on her “missions”. They begin in a store purchasing items for the “missions” and then begin. Each revolves around Margo taking revenge on her so called friends after discovering that her boyfriend has been cheating on her with another friend. As they go from place to place their doing things which could get them in trouble but having fun at the same time. A moment between the two is shared. And then, the next day, Margo goes missing.As Q tries to figure out where Margo has gone her friend Lacey approaches him to find out where she went as well. Q begins to find clues, the sort that Margo would use to solve the mysteries of life that have always intrigued her. As he and his friends cipher through the various clues Margo has left behind, Q becomes certain that she left them for him to find her. The end result is a road trip but it is the journey that it takes to go on the trip and the trip itself that offers the adventure these friends go on, a trip that changes their lives.The term “paper towns” is one Margo uses to describe life where they all live. It references something mapmakers used long ago, false towns they would place on maps to insure their copyright to those maps. The towns were fake towns that didn’t exist but insured that one mapmaker wouldn’t use the same information from another’s. For Margo it represents an empty life, an empty existence. It also provides the group with their greatest clue.The whole concept of the treasure hunt here makes for a lot of fun in this film. It creates the background story that links together the lives of the three friends, Lacey and Radar’s girlfriend along with Margo into something that explodes their lives from living the mundane existence that they have created for themselves and most likely will carry on till they die and transforms it into experiencing life for perhaps the first time.The young actors here do a wonderful job of bringing life to what could have resulted in nothing more than cardboard cutouts. Each has their own quirks that make them who they are but rather than those quirks being challenges to overcome they are what make each of them special and a necessary part to the journey.The story is one that grabs you from the start and holds on to you until the finale. Not only are these friends going on a journey, the viewer is as well. In the end perhaps each viewer will find themselves looking back in regret for a chance never taken, a journey never traveled. But the truth is that these opportunities for adventure never end. With any luck, those who go on this trip with Q and friends will seek out adventures of their own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2IEG9DTLVAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IL5FPG#wasThisHelpful","RW2IEG9DTLVAE","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a young movie fan I spent numerous days and hours watching the classic Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce versions of Sherlock Holmes on TV. These movies left a lasting impression on viewers for decades first when they appeared in theaters and then when people like myself discovered them on TV. Those 14 films they made were what we based our knowledge of the character on. For me it wouldn’t be until later that I discovered the books on which they were based.Yes Sherlock Holmes has been with us in one form or another for decades now. But we never hear about what happened later on in life, what happened when Dr. Watson had passed away and Sherlock got older. That is until now. With the new movie MR. SHERLOCK we get a glimpse of what might have happened. It’s a wonderful film that discusses both what happens when we age and what becomes of our heroes. And like those movies that inspired a search for the real Holmes stories my guess is this movie will make viewers seek out A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND by Mitch Cullin on which the movie is based.The year is 1947 and Holmes (Ian McKellen) is retired now, living in a Sussex village and tending to his bee colony. His life is less adventurous and he’s assisted in his home by his housekeeper Mrs. Munro (Laura Linney) and her young son Roger (Milo Parker). A bit on the cantankerous side now, Holmes softens when young Milo takes an interest in helping him with his bees. For a character who based his life on rational thinking with little or no emotion, he now finds himself faced with feelings that have long been buried. His fatherly affection for the young boy whose real father died in the war provide him with the impetus to do more than just get by.While his exploits gained him notoriety due to the literary license used by his chronicler Dr. Watson, Holmes always felt he got things wrong. In particular the one case that has bothered him the most was his last one which he feels didn’t tell the truth. But as he has aged so has he taken on the problems that entails. His memory is fading. The details of that last case elude him. With the friendship of young Milo Holmes is invigorated and begins to recall things he’d forgotten. Before the film ends the details of that last case will be remembered and the reason for much of why he’s become who he is at this point is revealed.What has always made Sherlock such an interesting character has been his ability to perceive the world around him in an analytical nature. And yet at the same time he was rarely able to see his own faults, in particular this lack of emotion. When it did occur it usually resulted in some tragedy and in the case of this film that potential happens with two different incidents, one in the past and one in the present. But this concept that Holmes always considered a flaw was what in reality made him the best detective that he was. While he never showed that he cared, deep down he did.McKellen is magnificent in the role, bringing to life the character at his deepest roots. Not to discredit those who have played the part in the past but their versions were always the man on the hunt, the deductive man of action in search of a criminal. McKellen is left to play a man who is aging whose nemesis is not a human being but himself and his slowly digressing mind and body. He brings to life a character we know and yet don’t know at the same time.The supporting cast also does a fantastic job here. Linney is wonderful as a woman dealing with her loss while at the same time trying to provide for a child she loves dearly. Parker as Roger is an amazing talent for his age and fills the shoes of this boy too young to know the legend of Sherlock Holmes while at the same time having an adulation for the older man who he shares a home with. It could have been played as far too precocious but he does a great job here.Those who are looking for the pace of the recent Robert Downey Jr. films will be disappointed, that’s not what this film is all about. But fans of the real Sherlock Holmes will adore this film. The pacing is slow but the story is what matters. And there is plenty of story to go around in this film. It’s one that fans of Holmes will want to watch more than once. I know I intend to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OKXLGB42JP1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PIQYIO#wasThisHelpful","R3OKXLGB42JP1V","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item was provided for review purposes.I was contacted to see if I would be interested in reviewing these headphones and agreed to do so. It’s been some time since I’ve owned a pair of headphones and to be honest I’d always opted for the very inexpensive brands in the past. This was due in part to their being affordable but also because I tend to be far too rough with my headphones. I’m one of those people who accidentally rolls from one part of the room to the other so immersed in my music I forget I have them on.Since the last pair I purchased there has been a dramatic interest in headphones and they’ve gone from a good pair for $20 to pairs that exceed several hundred dollars. I’m sorry but I’m still not ready to shell out that kind of money for headphones. If I worked in the recording industry maybe. But the truth is while I enjoy using headphones quality for the price is more of what I’m inclined to look at when purchasing them. There is also the fact that I am not a sound technician. I am the average Joe on the block looking to see what sounds good. No bells and whistles, no technical equipment to measure frequency and the rest, just two ears to listen.So rather than hook up modulators and the like I decided the best way to determine if these headphones were worth their salt was to try them out with some music. That is what most people will be using them for. And rather than try them on one single or one album (yes I’m old and still call them that) I would try them out on several songs from various styles. Would they hold up to heavy metal but not soul? What about classical or folk? So here is what I found using various songs.“You Shook Me All Night Long” by AC/DC. Great. The bass came through but wasn’t overpowering. Lead guitars were crisp and clear. Vocals came through as intelligible. The drums were fine and the cymbals rang. All in all this song came through perfect.“I Robot” by The Alan Parsons Project. The song starts low and soft and that was there with great mixing back and forth from left to right. Again the bass came through without being the only thing I was able to hear, one of my biggest complaints with headphones and sound systems in the past. As the melody came in all parts of the composition could be heard clearly and clean.  Another perfect sound experience.“Pink Moon” by Nick Drake. The opening guitar chords strummed away and I closed my eyes. I was transported to a smoky nightclub or campus center where I could hear everything as it was meant to be, Drake playing in an intimate setting. The headphones allowed me to go there, offering superb quality sound that brought it all together.“Déjà vu” by Crosby, Still, Nash & Young. One of my go to songs for harmonies, something that doesn’t always transfer well when listening to headphones. One that I listened to on headphones for years. The harmonizing of the four singers combined sweetly through the headset. Guitars solo and background sounded real. The bass was there but not overbearing. Another plus mark for this headset.“Elevate” by Winery Dogs. Great bass on a level playing field with the lead guitar. Bass drum pounding beneath it all. Other drums and cymbals beating wildly and with clearness not usually found in headphones. Vocals clear as can be. Once again a perfect sound experience.“Spring” by Vivaldi. The concert hall came alive. Lows, highs, midranges all came through loud and clear. Violins came through sweetly and the orchestra around them added much support clearly and cleanly.That gets me through the sound experience but what about the rest of what makes a good pair of headphones? To start with on a comfort level these were better than headphones I’ve had in the past. The cushions used allow for maximum comfort without applying too much pressure. They also provided great sound enclosure preventing sound from not only being heard by others but from stopping sound from coming in as well. When your wife comes in and tells you she’s been calling for you from the other room for the past ten minutes you know the sound canceling works better than she would hope for. The tangle free cord was a feature I loved as well having dealt with far too many coiled cords that did little more than wrap themselves up after a single use. Perhaps it would have been nice if it were a little longer but I can take care of that on my own with an extension cord. The case the headphones come in is nice as well providing a protective location for them to reside in when not in use.As I am not a game player and was using these for just listening to music I can’t tell you if the built in microphone on the cord worked well or not. But it seems like most headphones these days require that.My entire experience with these headphones was exceptional. Are they worth the money? At a list price of $79.99 on amazon but marked down to $19.99 I would say they are way more qualified for that sale price. They are quite possibly worth the $79.99 price tag. If you’re looking for a pair of headphones that will fill the bill of what is required for a basic set then this is something you should look into buying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWPD1EX6Q2FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMQKWE#wasThisHelpful","R1MWPD1EX6Q2FF","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Let me say up front that your political viewpoints will more than likely determine ahead of time whether you love or hate this book. Honestly, that’s sad. But we’ve become a political world where convenience seems to trump responsibility. Rather than look deeper than a headline people tend to base their beliefs on memes and slogans. If that’s you then you’ll miss something when it comes to this book. You’ll miss a great deal of information but on top of that you’ll miss some great laughs as well. So if you’re interested in both then continue reading.Greg Gutfeld is a commentator, a satirist and a member of the regular panel on Fox News Channel’s THE FIVE. Among the commentators there he is by far the wittiest and the most regularly hilarious member. As host for years of RED EYE, Fox’s late night show, he brought together a divergent group in individuals to talk about the days topics that was enlightening and funny at the same time. As his star has risen Gutfeld has taken his words from spoken to book format authoring four books including this one. All insightful and are worth reading.But this new book is something more important. It’s something that members of the Republican Party need to read, especially those higher up. It also should be required reading for all of the Republican candidates as well during this election year. They could use the sage advice offered here.Gutfeld makes numerous great points in the book but the most important is that if the truth of what the right stands for is to get out there a better presentation is needed to make it happen. What Republicans lack when it comes to speakers that represent them is a charismatic leader who can reach people on a level that doesn’t involve fact filled charts and graphs but just talking to them. The last time this happened was with Ronald Reagan and look how good he did.The book opens with a chapter called “Why We’re Evil” which doesn’t really present that as a desirable description but actually discusses why Republicans have been saddled with that label and done little to counter it with the exception of saying “Nuh uh!” Admitting up front that you will be attacked for saying you are a Conservative, Gutfeld explains how to explain you stance in a way that’s both quick and difficult to refute. That answer, from the book, is “Here is the simple stance to why you are Right: It is a more practical, generous, and compassionate way to live”. The fact of the matter is he’s right or to be more understandable, he is correct. He then discusses how to present you case in a way that doesn’t resort to insults or simply saying I’m right and you’re wrong.Much of what he carries on with discusses the fact that for liberalism to exist it needs conservatism there to allow it to be. As he says “Liberalism can exist only in periods of calm” that “…conservatism doesn’t compete with liberalism, it sustains it.” Safety and security must be a part of our society for there to be the free time to consider much of what liberals have to offer. Well not so much offer as take it from others to offer to someone else. With each word printed in the book he explains this and how both views need one another.But Gutfeld doesn’t let the right off the hook either. As he states in the book “The left is excellent at extolling horrible ideas; the right is horrible at extolling excellent ideas.” Therein lies the heart of the book. While he does lean to the right (Gutfeld says that he’s a libertarian and all things point this direction though I’m sure the left considers him just shy of Rush Limbaugh), Gutfeld points out problems with both sides of the issues. Best of all is that along with the humor he is noted for he presents arguments that are fact based. Sadly that might not matter. My father has told me more than once that liberals don’t want to be confused by facts. Which might be why this book is so important.That’s because Gutfeld doesn’t rely simply on facts. As I said from the start, the book is more about being able to argue persuasively. Eight years ago we had a relatively unknown and unaccomplished nominee for President running who won not based on his abilities and his record but because he was persuasive. It’s what young people today in a world of social media where everything is explained in 140 characters in a tweet expect. This book helps conservatives find the way to do that. And make you laugh.Greg Gutfeld takes a lot of flak from his co-hosts for promoting his books when they come out but the fact is they are enjoyable books to read. They make you think and they make you laugh. As with many satirists from the past, he blends those two things together to make an impression on those willing to look past those memes and slogans, those one worded posters like “HOPE” and extremely edited campaign commercials and find some truth in a world where one side controls most media. Now if we could just get Republican candidates to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK2C7KUBZO923/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VZZ2LZQ#wasThisHelpful","RK2C7KUBZO923","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.One of the great things about movies is that a subject matter can be sought out by an inventive writer or director and finally get the green light to have that movie made. When that happens, the writer or director can bring to the attention of the world a topic that they may never have heard of before. In the case of THE END OF THE TOUR director James Ponsoldt and writer Donald Margulies bring to our attention author David Foster Wallace.Some may be familiar with Wallace and his works. I am not one of those people. But in watching this film I was provided with a look at the author as interpreted by this team as well as David Lipsky upon whose book the film was made. The author and Lipsky are both brought to life by actors Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg in a way that makes them both interesting. When the film ends you may find yourself as I did, searching for information about both men and perhaps seeking out their books.The movie opens with word that author David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel) has just died of an apparent suicide. This causes writer David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) to be contacted to discuss Wallace and to reflect on the time the two spent together. Going back 12 years, Lipsky is an author whose latest book is well received but not doing as well as he had hoped. At a party among friends Lipsky talks about taking on a job at Rolling Stone as a writer and then hears about an author everyone is talking about, David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel), whose new book Infinite Jest is being hailed as the greatest thing currently in print. To see what the talk is all about Lipsky reads the book. Aware of how great the book is, he convinces his editor at Rolling Stone to send him out to interview Wallace.Thus begins a road trip that develops into a friendship between two authors both seeking something completely different and yet identical at the same time. Lipsky arrives in Wallace’s Midwest home in the middle of a snow covered winter, a far cry from the city streets of New York he is familiar with. Wallace is a nice sort who greets him and welcomes him into his home, an unassuming ranch house that’s more everyday guy than talked about literary celebrity. Wallace is a quiet man who lives with his two dogs, wears a bandana around his head and is wary at first of being interviewed.As the two men spend time together their comfort level increases and Wallace ends up opening his world, his life and his mind to Lipsky. Their discussions are fascinating to listen to and you soon discover that behind this sought after author is a man who fears losing himself and his sanity to celebrity. He loves his life the way it is. While Lipsky can’t understand this feeling as he desires notoriety, he comes to realize what it is that Wallace means in his search to retain his own identity.Along the way the pair share stories of their lives and backgrounds as they drive from one location to the next while Wallace completes the last stop on his travels to promote his book. The two bond as they travel until a jealousy seems to take over Lipsky and he begins flirting with an ex of Wallace’s that meets with them in Minneapolis. The rift between the two offers an insight into both with each jealous of the other. This up and down rollercoaster ride of adulation and envy that fills becomes apparent to Lipsky before the end of the film just as the acceptance of him and envy of his lifestyle is shown in the character of Wallace. What they each take back from their road trip makes for a wonderful movie.Both actors bring to life the two men that they story is based on. I’ve never been a huge fan of Eisenberg but when he’s on point he does a tremendous job and that’s what he does here. While his performance is that good it is Segel who surprised me here. Having watched his career for some time in almost always comedic roles, he takes on Wallace with apparent ease and takes what could have been nothing more than a quirky individual and turns him into something more. That he can do so in such a subdued manner makes the performance even more memorable.While watching the film I was reminded of the movie MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, a film that was nothing more than a dinner conversation between two intellectuals filled with a back and forth dialogue. While this movie moves around more than that, it feels the same. It is a film filled with conversations between two characters that holds your attention with every word they speak. In the wrong hands that could lead to boredom but here it grabs your attention from start to finish.Most films these days seem to include little more than explosions and car chases, super heroes or paranormal demons. This movie is about nothing more than two men who start as acquaintances and then become friends, contemporaries who find a common bond in their love of the written word. It’s the type of movie that rarely makes a huge splash at the box office. The nice thing is that with it coming out on DVD perhaps more people will discover the fun they can have while watching it at home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8V64BXEY3YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153C71C4#wasThisHelpful","RF8V64BXEY3YT","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.There have been revenge films since movie began being made. Perhaps the most famous of these was DEATH WISH, the Charles Bronson starring film that had him taking out street thugs to the cheers of movie goers who were tired of being victims of crime. With FINAL GIRL we get a twist on the revenge film nearing what was accomplished in OLDBOY.The film opens with young Veronica being questioned by William (Wes Bentley). Her parents have just died and she seems nonplussed by that fact. With each question William gets to know more about the mind of Veronica and when he finds her suitable for his needs he offers to take care of her from now on. What that need is is to create a perfect assassin, a weapon that can take out his revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife and daughter.Twelve years pass and Veronica (Abigail Breslin) is now grown. We witness her training at the hands of William. A brutal task master when need be, he helps Veronica to learn how to cope with any and all obstacles that might come her way. He takes her shoes when she’s in the woods, he gives her a cocktail of drugs to prepare her for what it’s like to battle under duress and he shows her that a gun isn’t the way to handle things because bullets eventually run out. When he feels she is finally ready, the pair set out on their task.The victims in mind are a predatory bunch. While we might question William’s moral sense early on it becomes apparent why he’s taking the route he has all these years. The group of young men he is about to turn Veronica loose on are serial killers. Four best friends with sociopathic qualities, this group of well-dressed killers will pick a young blonde, invite her to a party and then turn her lose in the forest while they track her down and kill her. While it’s never clearly stated one has to assume one of their victims was William’s daughter.Veronica does some reconnaissance by talking to one of the young men’s girlfriend and understand then that these men have no sense of right and wrong, they are incapable of love and affection. There only joy comes from the pain and suffering they instill in others. She suggest the girl can do better and then preps for her confrontation.It comes easily. The group’s ringleader Jameson (Alexander Ludwig) sees Veronica in the diner they frequent, an angelic vision with blonde hair in bright light, and approaches her. He casually and with an aristocratic air invites her to a party the next night. She accepts and the following night meets the rest of the group. Promising that others are on the way to meet them she goes along and finds herself in the forest with this group of tuxedo wearing young men. She knows what they are. They have no clue what they have gotten themselves into. Their night of “fun” will soon come face to face with William’s weapon of revenge.To begin with no one should take this movie as a reality based film. It is a story plain and simple that is shot in such a way as to be more artistic than one would expect given the material being witnessed. While this could have fallen away into the B-movie category the performances by all involved and the style with which it is shot make it more than that. Directed by photographer Tyler Shields it becomes obvious early on that he has an eye for composition with his choices of light and dark, the framing of his movie in all scenes. It’s not that it’s overbearing but it take the lowbrow medium and elevates it.What was nice to see in this film was the Shields didn’t resort to the least common denominator that most directors would, having the woman in question appear in various forms of undress before she took on her aggressors. Overused in films like the I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE series it carries no weight any longer and is just an exploitation device that no longer shocks as it once did. Instead he makes Veronica a very empowered young woman. And while after 12 years of training she has no problem killing someone there is also a moral base for her actions that is displayed in the comments and discussions she has with William. Viewers could find her a scary person to come into contact with but at the same time you can imagine her before a jury that would sympathize with her every move and vindicate her with a not guilty verdict.The movie comes to DVD on the heels of Halloween and would make a great movie to watch on that night or any other. It doesn’t rely on blood or gore and tells an interesting story that’s done so well it might be worth additional viewings. I know it’s one I’ll add to my collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11L2CNVPMXV0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112HPV9O#wasThisHelpful","R11L2CNVPMXV0C","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Yes go ahead and sing it all the way through. You know it’s there, you may even be humming it. When you’re done go ahead and read.The television series MISSION IMPOSSIBLE premiered back in 1966 and ran for seven years before calling it quits. It picked up again in the 80s for two seasons before leaving the air again. Eventually Brian DePalma came along and began the movie franchise for the series that continues to this day and deserves to keep going.But back to 1966. The world was a different place. Dictators ran various countries, the Soviets and the US were not getting along, self-proclaimed generals ran roughshod over their people and America did little on the surface to counter all of them. Not always but for the most part. If you bought into this series, which most of us did, we sent in a team of undercover experts to save the day instead.While most will think that actor Peter Graves as Mr. Phelps was there from the start the fact is for the first season the team was brought together by the elusive Mr. Briggs played by Steven Hill. Each week Briggs (and later Phelps) would go to some seemingly innocent location, pick up or be given a device on which a message played for them offering them a mission and then that device would self-destruct. This would be followed by him then sitting down and tossing down dossiers on a table or desk as to who he chose to help on this week’s mission.For the most part the cast remained consistent through the adventures. Barney Collier (Greg Morris) was the tech guy of the team. Willy Armitage (Peter Lupus) was the muscle. Roland Hand (Martin Landau) was an expert in disguise, a top actor. And rounding out the team was Cinnamon Carter (Barbara Bain) the beauty who was used to distract many a bad man. Occasionally another operative was tossed in with the group. Later in the series several members would leave to be replaced by actors like Leonard Nimoy, Lynda Day George and Lesley Ann Warren. But for most it was the initial team they remember.As I said the show had them take on various dictators and rulers with world domination or destruction on their minds. Examples from the first season included a South American general who possessed nuclear missiles, trying to make the Soviets think one of their own turned traitor, rescuing an elderly yet politically active cardinal, stopping a prince from starting a war with a neighboring country, “unfixing” a corrupt election in another South American country, stopping a bacterial attack on our country, taking on an international drug dealer and more. And that’s just the first season!The show continued on through 7 years and now that entire series has been collected into one group. I don’t mean to sound like a late night TV ad but this is a bargain for fans of the series. It’s been offered before in a special box set that looks like a powder keg in the $200 price range or just under. This new box set sells for far less, more near $80. For as much as you get that is a tremendous bargain. It comes in a box that holds three cases, two large and one smaller, holding the entire series of DVDs. If you’ve already collected the separate years then this won’t provide you with anything new. The same for those who bought the keg edition. But if you’ve held off then now is a chance to get the whole set in one affordable box that is well worth it.I would have loved to have watched the entire series here before writing but with 10,000 minutes’ worth of shows to watch that was my own mission impossible. I know that this set will provide me with non-stop entertainment from disc to disc, each year with its own special episodes and enough enjoyment that time will move far too fast once I reach that last disc. If you’ve never seen the show you’re missing one of the greats from the sixties. If you loved the show this is the set to buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356TV24H1F7IF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MUA5J2#wasThisHelpful","R356TV24H1F7IF","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.If we can have spaghetti westerns why not pizza Poe?The works of Edgar Allan Poe have been made into movies for quite some time. While there are a number of titles I’m sure everyone is aware of, in particular the Roger Corman films of the sixties, there have been lesser known movies made from his works that have been hard to find. Arrow Video is making sure that at least two of those titles are more accessible now. This two film collection features movies both based on Poe’s story THE BLACK CAT. Included are YOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY and THE BLACK CAT.While both films are incredibly loose with their connection to the original story the first is by far the most removed. Made in 1972 by director Sergio Martino the film is a classic giallo style movie. For those unfamiliar with the term these were movies made in Italy that were often compared to or taken from pulp murder mysteries from Italy that were featured with yellow covers or giallo. The films, most made in the 70s, always featured the killer unseen with the exception of more often than not  pair of black gloves as he/she killed his/her victim.Oliviero (Luigi Pistilli) is a burned out novelist who hasn’t written anything new in some time. Living in his late mother’s home in Italy, he spends his days and nights in the company of a group of hippies more than happy to live off of his free food and wine. Oliviero lives with his wife Irina (Anita Strindberg) who he abuses both psychologically and physically and their servant, a young black woman. While his relationship with his wife doesn’t show signs of sadism the hint that it is there remains throughout the film. A murder occurs in town and the police suspect Oliviero but don’t have enough evidence to arrest him. When his maid is murdered as well, he and Irina hide the body. Is he the killer though?Into this house of horrors walks Floriana (Edwige Fenech), Oliviero’s niece. An attractive and self-confident young woman, Floriana sets about seducing both members of the house. It is readily apparent that Floriana is there for some reason, most likely involving cash. The cat and mouse game (no pun intended) played among the three characters makes for some interesting moments. Before the film ends all is revealed.While the film is interesting from start to finish I’m not sure I could claim it’s entertaining as well. Moments are but the movie feels disjointed somehow. Perhaps it suffers in translation or maybe it’s just the difference in the way films are made from one country to the next. In any event it had me wondering just who the killer was throughout, a good sign in a mystery. The ending was satisfactory but one many will figure out before the last reel of the film.The quality of the film making is pretty good for the time and the fact that movies from Italy at that time always seemed less than what some come to expect. The acting is quite well done and Fenech cemented her standing as a scream queen with this role. Perhaps the strangest question I was left with was what anti per spirant Pistilli was using during the filming as he always seems covered with a sheen of sweat no matter what time of day it is.Arrow Video once more presents a high quality product with a beautiful blu-ray presentation of the film. Extras, as always with their offerings, are top of the line. Included with this movie are THROUGH THE KEYHOLE - an interview with director Sergio Martino, UNVEILING THE VICE – a making of retrospective featuring interviews with Martino, Fenech and screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi, DOLLS OF FLESH AND BLOOD: THE GIALLI OF SERGIO MARTINO – a visual essay exploring the director’s contribution to the genre, THE STRANGE VICES OF MS. FENECH – a look at the career of the much lauded actress and a short featuring Eli Roth discussing the film and its impact on him.The second film, THE BLACK CAT, was directed by Lucio Fulci in 1981. Perhaps known more for his gore filled horror films like CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka THE GATES OF HELL) and ZOMBIE, Fulci was quite prolific in the giallo genre as well. This film is only one among many that he directed.As with the first film this one suffers from translation as well, though in a different sense. American films always seem to take on story telling in a linear fashion, moving from point A to point B and so on. With each step we understand why we’re moving in this direction. This film doesn’t choose to do so and honestly until about the 30 minute mark how the various sub plots combine isn’t quite clear.We begin with a man who seems to be hypnotized by a black cat into crashing his car into another and killing himself. From there we find Prof. Robert Miles (Patrick Magee), a paranormal researcher and medium listening to tapes of strange voices speaking in Latin. It isn’t until later we find out that Miles has a hobby of recording EVPs of Extra Voice Phenomena in the local graveyard. We jump to Jill Trevers (Mimsy Farmer), a photographer from the U.S. working on a project taking pictures in the local graveyard.After taking photos that afternoon, Jill learns from the locals at the nearby tavern that Miles is a medium. She goes to visit him and shows him the microphone she found, one of his left behind. At the same time she finds out that Miles owns a black cat, a pet that he is less than fond of but that he keeps on for some reason.The next thing you know we’re watching a young couple trying to find a location to fool around in. Choosing a boathouse on the nearby river they start only to have the power to the building shut off. Not only are they left in the dark the ventilation system is shut down as well. Locked inside they’re facing certain death. The mother of the young girl, once close to Miles, seeks his help in finding her. She too faces a deadly encounter with the titular feline.All of these stories finally coalesce and make sense as we get closer to the end. Not only are these threads solved but the entrance of a young police detective who comes to town to look into the series of murders that have been occurring is resolved as well.As I said the movie takes nearly 30 minutes before it gels together and makes a bit of sense. When it does it becomes a more pleasant encounter and actually turns out to be an interesting movie. The performances are well done from all involved, especially David Warbeck as Inspector Gorley. Warbeck worked with Fulci on his film THE BEYOND as well. The movie is quite entertaining but as with most foreign made films those of us living in the US need to realize that movies aren’t made the same way around the world as they are here. If you’re willing to watch a film and accept it on its own terms it becomes a much more pleasurable experience. This one could help you achieve that.Once more Arrow packs on the extras. Featured with this one are an audio commentary by filmmaker and FANGORIA editor Chris Alexander, FROM POE INTO FULCI: THE SPIRIT OF PERVERSENESS – a discussion on the movie by film historian Stephen Thrower, IN THE PAW: THE PRITNS OF THE BLACK CAT – a look at the original locations used in the film, FRIGHTENED DAGMAR – a career interview with Dagmar Lassander who stars in the film, AT HOME WITH DAVID WARBECK – an extensive interview with the actor and the original theatrical trailer.The entire package is well worth adding to your collection if you’re a fan of Poe, Italian films and their directors or a horror fan making sure your collection is complete.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LAZMP65BQ59L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CMJJQK#wasThisHelpful","R2LAZMP65BQ59L","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Even more than the famed scene in THE GODFATHER, Hollywood has been known for taking a dead horse and beating it to death. Once something becomes popular every major and minor studio takes that theme and runs with it. Witness the popularity of TWILIGHT and the deluge of vampire movies for a short time. Now the craze is zombies due to the popularity of THE WALKING DEAD. Most of the movies involving zombies can be terrible (see what I’ve written about NAVY SEALS VS. ZOMBIES online), some aren’t bad and for the most part they’re kind of stuck in the middle.DEAD RISING: WATCHTOWER falls into the middle of the pack when it comes to zombie flicks. Based on the hit game for whichever gaming system you use, the movie takes place after the initial zombie outbreak has happened. While this means we don’t spend time on how and more on what to do it makes you feel as if you walked into the middle of a movie rather than the beginning. It works in some ways but doesn’t in others.Into the fray jumps Chase (Jesse Metcalf), an online reporter trying to make a name for himself and jump up to the big time. In East Mission, Oregon, with his trusted camerawoman Jordan (Keegan Connor Tracy) by his side, the duo witness an outbreak in the city. A medication to keep the zombie disease in remission is being administered to those who have been bitten but unlike the past it doesn’t seem to be working. Soon patients are leaping from their beds and attacking the medical staff set up in an emergency post.The pair take off alongside Crystal (Meghan Ory), a young woman who is infected but has her own street supply of the drug for the moment. As they escape the massacre of victims who then rise to eat the living, they come across Maggie (Virginia Madsen), a mother who was forced to kill her daughter when she turned into a zombie. Jordan gets separated from the rest and makes her way to the wall placed around the city to contain the zombies. Chase and crew head in to find the warehouse where the medication is stored.Jordan finds the head of FEZA (Federal Emergency Zombie Agency) and tries to find out what’s going on. If he can’t get the situation under control it will soon fall into the hands of the military led by General Lyons (Dennis Haysbert). With only a few hours to contain the outbreak if it fails the General has orders to bomb the city.On the inside Chase and his group find shelter and prepare to find a way to make their way to the warehouse and then to the wall. But it isn’t just zombies they must contend with. A motorcycle gang that looks like they stepped out of a Mad Max movie is traveling the streets as well, looting and killing along the way. To get where they want they’ll have to bypass this group while at the same time avoiding the flesh eating mass in the streets. With no clue as to the condition of the warehouse that’s what they set out to do.Betrayals and subplots involving the military, double crosses on the outside of the wall and one of the longest one take action sequences filmed the movie offers a decent night’s entertainment for horror fans and zombie lovers. These are not the slow moving zombies but the runners so know that going in. Added to the movie for comic relief is coverage of the story on the local news station discusses what’s happening with added commentary from Frank West (Rob Riggle), the sole survivor of the last major outbreak who tosses out advice that makes for some serious laughs.As I said, the movie is based on the computer game and uses a number of point of view shots that make it seem as if you’re in the game. The gore level is up there and the make-up varies from very good to mild. CGI blood is used throughout but not overdone. It does do a great job of showing how everyone is affected rather than just your standard zombie when you see things like police officers and clowns that have changed. Most movies don’t acknowledge that uniformed workers might be a part of the zombies.The film had that SyFy channel feel to it and in looking into it I found that it was on that channel. I’m glad to report that it surpasses most of what their movies usually offer and isn’t a bad movie. My one reservation is the length of the film. At 118 minutes it feels long, mostly due to the fact that they main story consists of running from spot to spot. The added features of secondary plots and new coverage don’t ease the feeling of it being too long. But it does offer a nice horror flick, adds a few new things to the genre and leaves itself wide open for a sequel. But most horror films do these days. It’s one worth watching for some fun but perhaps not one to revisit over and over again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OH1TLE93WUYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P0X1AW#wasThisHelpful","R3OH1TLE93WUYJ","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.With the glut of horror films coming out on a near weekly basis these days it is rare to find a movie that is original, scary and that gives you the willies at the same time. There have been a number in the past year that critics have hailed as doing so but for me they were still lacking. So when I came across a small, independent horror film that made me cringe every now and then you can bet it was one I couldn’t wait to recommend.LAST SHIFT starts off as a regular movie, almost a tribute to films like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and RIO BRAVO. Rookie cop Jessica Loren (Juliana Harkavy) gets her first assignment, to man the closing precinct station on its last night in business. Her first odd encounter is with the sergeant in charge turning it over to her. To say he acts a bit off is an understatement. He informs her that all incoming calls have been directed to the new station, that a bio team will be there in the morning to pick up the remaining evidence packets on hand and that all she has to do is watch the building in case someone comes to the door. Simple, right?But things don’t go as planned. To begin with, Jessica hears strange noises coming from the building. But then every old building makes noise. Her phone rings and it’s a young woman claiming that her life is in danger, that she just escaped from someone. Before she can get a location the line cuts off. Jessica calls the new precinct and they tell her to get the location next time.During the night a homeless man turns up at the door. Jessica lets him in and he returns to favor by using the front area as a urinal. She takes him down and locks him in a cell, returning to her desk. Along the way she still hears more noises. On occasion when she hears these sounds and goes to investigate, we the viewer see strange things over her shoulder. But when Jessica turns, there is nothing there. It’s an unnerving image used throughout that keeps the viewer on their toes.There is something strange going on in this precinct that Jessica is unaware of and it isn’t until late in the film it’s revealed but by that time we have a clue what it is. A year prior to this night the leader of a local cult was brought in and locked up along with several of his followers. The cult was one that killed people and once they were locked up things happened that are left unexplained to this day. Has someone snuck into the precinct to use the legend of this cult to their advantage or is something more malevolent going on? Not only that, Jessica eventually gets a call from her father during the night telling her to stay at her station. Except that her father, a decorated police officer himself, has been dead for a while now.The movie uses the claustrophobic nature of being trapped inside a building you have no ability to leave to its advantage. The same holds true with a character who is responsible and takes her duty seriously. Jessica may want to leave but her job, her first job as an officer, is to stay and defend the building from anyone who might try to do something to it. But in fulfilling her duty she may end up becoming nothing more than another part of the legend of the building, another stain on the wall.Harkavy, an actress with only 23 roles under her belt (one of those being on THE WALKING DEAD) does a remarkable job here. While there are others actors on view she takes up the majority of screen time here. If she wasn’t a capable actress it would make the part unbelievable. Trust me when I say that before this night is over you will believe that she is indeed Officer Jessica Loren and you will sympathize with her predicament.The movie has some well-done special effects but those are the centerpiece of the story. They heighten what comes near the end and in various moments but it is the story itself that holds our interest. The old adage that showing less makes something all the more scary holds true here. As someone who’s seen tons of horror films let me say that this one had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. Of course that was a seat well clear of the TV screen so I didn’t jump too far.While major studios spend tons of money to make the next big blockbuster film with the intent of scaring you, the fact is they’re more focused on remakes and sequels, movies that you pretty much know what to expect while watching. Not so with this film. It’s one movie that’s as original as they come. That makes it not just a gem of a film but a movie that will haunt your dreams after the final credits roll.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDRPHOPK04IK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C6OXCY#wasThisHelpful","R2SDRPHOPK04IK","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.With so many movies being released year after year there are bound to be some that fall between the cracks when it comes to making appearances over and over again. Such is the case with SPIDER BABY. It made it to the drive-in circuit but never really got the full-fledged TV treatment that it deserved. It disappeared from sight for a number of years. But fans these days are known to be diligent if nothing else. The search went out, it was found and resurrected and now Arrow Video has released what is by far the best version of this movie you can find.If you’re not familiar with the story it tells the tale of the Merrye family, a family cursed with a disease that makes them grow older in age but regress in mentality, eventually becoming homicidal maniacs. The caretaker of the Merrye children is played by an aging Lon Chaney Jr. as Bruno. Bruno loves these children with his whole heart and would do anything to protect and care for them. He is not just dedicated to the family, they become his family as well.The movie opens with famous celeb Mantan Moreland as a delivery man who makes the mistake of peeking in a window of the dilapidated house the family resides in. A quick drop of the window on his head finds him trapped and young Virginia Merrye (Jill Banner) coming at him in her spider mode, net ready to toss on him and then knives to serve as pincers. She kills him before she can get the message, one Bruno finds along with the body. It seems two distant relatives are on their way accompanied by their lawyer with the intent of taking over the family home, dilapidated though it may be.This sends Bruno into crisis management mode where he tells the children they have to be on their best behavior. Along with Virginia are Elizabeth (Beverly Washburn) and Ralph (Sid Haig). Ralph is by far the most gone of the three being the eldest. He’s at a point where he can’t even speak much less function. Keeping these three on their best will be a challenge for poor Bruno.It’s best not to go into detail as to what happens from here but know that the distant relatives Peter and Emily, a married couple with issues all their own, are not interested in what’s best for the children. While Peter might care in some ways he’s more interested in the secretary of the lawyer. Emily only has dollar signs in her eyes, hoping that there is enough to salvage from the home to make her a wealthy woman. They decide to spend the night and from there things begin to happen.Shot in black and white on a miniscule budget, director Jack Hill gets the most for his money. Not only does he make the locations and sets work for him, he gets some tremendous performances from his cast. Chaney has never quite looked this good in roles he took later in life. The younger, newer members all present themselves quite well here. Banner does an exceptional job and it’s sad to realize that she didn’t make enough after this film and died early at age 35. The originality of the story is something that is rare in most movies, even more so today, but to come up with something like this that reeks of exploitation but is made so well makes it astounding. I found myself caught up in all that was going on and never felt like I had to have the remote handy with my finger on the fast forward button.The movie entertains and does so with ease. This becomes even more amazing when you delve into the extras that Arrow has provided, something they do better than anyone else, even Criterion (who will charge you far more for their wares). Included in the extras are:* High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentation of the main feature, available in the UK for the first time* Original 2.0 Mono Audio (Uncompressed PCM on the Blu-ray)* High Definition transfer of the feature supervised and approved by director Jack Hill* English SDH subtitles for deaf and hearing impaired* Audio commentary featuring Jack Hill and star Sid Haig* Panel discussion from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences FILM-TO-FILM Festival, recorded September 2012, featuring Jack Hill and stars Quinn K. Redeker and Beverly Washburn* The Hatching of Spider Baby - Interviews with Jack Hill, Sid Haig, star Mary Mitchel, fan Joe Dante and more on the making of the film* Spider Stravinsky: The Cinema Sounds of Ronald* The Merrye House Revisited - Jack Hill revisits the original house that was used as the main location in the film* Alternate opening title sequence* Extended scene* Original Trailer* Gallery of behind-the-scenes images* The Host (1960) - Jack Hill's early short film featuring Sid Haig in his first starring role [30 mins]* Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys* Collector's booklet featuring writing on the film by artist and writer Stephen R. Bissette, and an extensive article re-printed from FilmFax: The Magazine of Unusual Film and Television featuring interviews with the cast and crewAs always Arrow provides so much bang for your buck it’s a sight to behold. I’ve gotten to the point where with new releases I actually dread the extras that they include. Blooper reels seem to have happened on set just to make the blooper reels. Information feels more like promotional pieces rather than information. But the ingredients that Arrow includes in their extras always seem to enhance the movie experience of what you are watching rather than be just tossed on to add something. Because of that when new Arrow titles arrive I am always excited to see them in the mail.This release is not only a great lost treasure it’s been placed in a fabulous chest because of the efforts of Arrow Video. For horror fans or those who love lost movies, this is a must add to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RV254G63RG20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRUJ8TS#wasThisHelpful","R3RV254G63RG20","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Samantha Abbott (Cobie Smulders) is a young teacher with her whole future planned out. She’s recently discovered that an opening at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry has come open and has a solid chance of getting the job. It couldn’t come at a more opportune time as the inner city school she teaches in is about to be shut down and students sent to another school. Then she discovers that she is pregnant.While most movies these days would focus on the option of abortion and get into a politically correct dissertation about that being the best choice to make, this movie instead moves forward with Samantha’s decision to have the child. She and her boyfriend John (Anders Holm) get married and begin making plans. He decorates a room for the baby. He is as interested in being a parent as she is.At her job, Samantha takes a keen interest in her students. In particular she has high hopes for one, Jasmine (Gail Bean). Jasmine has the potential to make something of her life, to get herself out of the mean streets of Chicago. Samantha has plans of helping her along the way, encouraging her to try out for scholarships to various colleges since her scores are always so high. And then Jasmine too becomes pregnant.Rather than see her star pupil continue the cycle of remaining in a low income life with few options to move her forward, Samantha takes a more personal interest in her. The two go to yoga classes together and talk about their plans for the future. Samantha tries to help Jasmine get into a college, especially the college that she once went to. But plans and dreams are often not the same as reality.But the movie isn’t just about Samantha and her attempt to help Jasmine. It’s also about these two women who come from completely different backgrounds and how they interact with one another. While the desire Samantha has for Jasmine is noble it may not be the reality that Jasmine knows exist, perhaps more so than her teacher does. Samantha’s disappointments in the life Jasmine may eventually come to expect shows that while she intends to do good sometimes intentions are not what reality will provide.The movie drives this home in her own life as well. Where she once had these plans of what she wanted to accomplish it all changes with the arrival of a child. She might want the career she dreamed of but with a child in the picture that might not be possible. Does this child present something wonderful to be cherished or is it just an obstacle in her desire for more? These are the same problems that confront Jasmine but on a completely different level.While these ideas may sound highbrow and not entertaining the movie makes them work and entertain as well. The camaraderie between the two leads weaves itself so perfectly that you feel for both women and want the best for them. You want that happy ending to watch when the film closes. But that’s the point of the film. What you want and what you get may be two different things. But there is also the possibility that what you wanted wasn’t what you really desired to begin with. And in the end the possibilities are always there if you’re willing to aim for them.The movie may not have been one of the top box office hits of the year but it is a film worth watching. All involved do an amazing job of presenting their characters as real people. For me the true sign of a good actor is if you can believe them in the part and not think you’re watching an actor in a role. Both Smulders and Bean accomplish that here and it makes me look forward to more from both of them.I can say that while I didn’t expect it I found this movie to be one of the more pleasurable experiences I’ve had lately when it comes to a mainstream movie that didn’t fit into any genre title. It succeeds on all levels from acting to directing to story and holds your interest start to finish. It’s one that I can honestly say is worth watching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJSRXVTEKNHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOJICP8#wasThisHelpful","R1HJSRXVTEKNHZ","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why it took my so long to write about this one is beyond me. The only honest answer I can give is the deluge of other items I’ve been watching and writing about that have preoccupied me. It certainly wasn’t that the film was bad, far from it. Recent news is that a sequel is in the works and that’s something I can’t wait to see if it holds up to this one.The film opens with a secret agent ops in the works that results in one member of the team killed. The agent who feels responsible, Harry Hart aka Galahad (Colin Firth), stops by to pay his respect to the man’s widow and leaves behind a medallion that has a number he tells her to call anytime there is a need. Fast forward to years later and the widow has taken up with a local thug, has a young child by him and the aforementioned deceased hero’s son has grown and hangs with the wrong crowd.Gary ‘Eggsy’ Unwin (Taron Egerton) is heading down the wrong path. With no love lost for his surrogate father and wishing he could do more for his mother he instead finds himself doing all he can to insult and anger said surrogate. His latest ends him in jail and with no one to turn to he calls the number on the back of the medallion. Harry shows and makes him an offer. He wants Eggsy to become the next member of the Kingsmen. But he must prove himself first.Harry explains to Eggsy that the Kingsmen are a secret organization formed centuries ago that operates outside of the mainstream, untied to any government of political system. Instead their goal is to protect mankind in general. Past members have all come from high placed members of society. That is until Eggsy’s father. He was an experiment to quote the head of the organization Arthur (Michael Caine), an experiment begun by Harry himself. Now he wants to continue that with Eggsy, someone he feels is worthy of becoming the next knight.With only one spot in the group open to join Eggsy finds himself in a boot camp of sorts with fellow applicants. Some welcome him like any other while the snobbish ones look down on him, a big mistake on their part. What most don’t realize is Eggsy’s past, not just who his father was but his intelligence and the fact he served in the military. As members are booted out, it comes down to two final applicants and it is Eggsy’s humanity that forces him to lose.While all of this is going on there is a megalomaniacal madman on the loose. Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) plays a lisping billionaire who has plans on taking over the world. It was his doing that opened up the position Eggsy was applying for when he killed on of the Kingsmen. Using advanced technology, Valentine has sent out free cell phones to anyone who wants one which of course means everyone. What he can do with those phones once they’re in the hands of the world is something else. A final confrontation between good guys and bad must take place and of course circumstances arise that force Eggsy to be taken back in to become a member of Kingsmen.What makes this movie work is the deft combination of humor, adventure, action and over the top madness that make it one of the best movies to come out this year. Weaving together the aristocratic world of the Kingsmen with the low class neighborhood that raised Eggsy pays off, adding a depth of character that needs less exposition as we witness both his possibilities and his capabilities. Egerton makes the character sympathetic and likeable that plays both on his world weariness and innocence in the same person. It’s one of the things that makes the movie work best.The three other major components that make the movie work begin with Colin Firth as Harry. Firth might be well known of his role in THE KING’S SPEECH but who would have expected him to carry off a role as a superspy who possibly exceeds James Bond? Alongside Firth is Mark Strong as Merlin, the armaments and tech support member of the team. Having gone through a string of roles where he plays the bad guy, Strong does an amazing job of being straight faced where a quick laugh is possible. Lastly are the effects laden weapons we see on display here, much like those of Bond in the character’s numerous films. Everything from exploding cigarette lighters to bulletproof umbrellas make the arsenal of each Kingsman ready for anything.As with Bond films the movie plays fast and loose with logistics and time zones and feels more like it was made for fun the fact. It delivers on the promise of that fun with some of the funniest moments alongside some of the most breath taking. By the end of the movie you’ll want to start it up and watch it again. You’ll also wish that the sequel were already there ready to be viewed. For me, it is a wonderful pleasure that I’ve added to my collection and one I know I’ll pull out more often than not to watch and enjoy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOGUM6422NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6OOAAY#wasThisHelpful","R2BOGUM6422NJ","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.It’s that time of year again, when things that go bump in the night roam the streets in search of candy, things that scare us come out from under the bed to drink apple cider and of course movies that make us toss our popcorn into the air make their way to the big and small screen. The month has a number of horror movies making their way to DVD and this week we start the month with one of those. Written and directed by Leigh Whannell, the creator/writer of the first two films in the series, is INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 3.If you recall the first two films they involved a family haunted by spirits that have left this world to move on to a place known as The Further. This time around the story goes back in time, a prequel to events that happened in those films. It helps us understand The Further a bit better as well as the reasons why the character of Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) does what she does.The movie opens with a young girl named Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) approaching Elise to do a psychic reading for her. Elise tells her she doesn’t do that anymore but is convinced to help the girl who wants to speak to her recently deceased mother. The girl has tried to reach her on her own with no success and yet feels her mother is there. Elise does a reading for her and recoils in fear, telling the girl not to attempt to reach her mother again because when you call out to one of the dead, they all hear.Quinn returns home disappointed but then things begin to happen, the most terrible of which is her being hit by a car. Quinn survives and ends up homebound with two broken legs as well as other injuries. Her father Sean (Dermot Mulroney) is concerned for her and does all he can to make her comfortable. Even her younger brother Alex tries to help. But try as they might, this is where the scares start to happen and things go from bad to worse.It starts with something small, Quinn tapping on the wall of her bedroom, the same wall shared by the boy next door she thinks is cute. He taps back so she texts him. He responds by telling her he isn’t home but at his grandmother’s. Cue jump scare. If you don’t know what a jump scare is, it’s when in a movie they do something guaranteed to make you jump. No spoiler here as this one featured prominently in the trailer for this film.Quinn begins to see more and more while alone in her room or the apartment. A ghostly image of a man with a mask on continues to appear before her. When noises are heard in the apartment upstairs and the ceiling cracks, her dad sees this and takes the building super with him to check it out. The apartment is vacant and yet there on the floor are slimy footprints of bare feet.While all of this is going on Elise remains home concerned about the girl having had visions of her. She wants to help her but at the same time is frightened of what will happen to her if she does. The movie tells us why she’s afraid and what she was looking for when this frightening event changed her life. Since she appears in the first two movies (that take place after this one) we know she’ll come out all right, but what about Quinn? Will Elise be able to help the girl or will she face banishment from this world at the hands of a demon Elise is unwilling to confront?The movie won’t go down in the annals of horror films as the best movie ever made but it won’t be considered one of the worst either. The two previous films were well made and frightening enough that in making a third the bar was set high. While it doesn’t quite reach the level of those movies this one does present an entertaining enough film that holds your interests and does a good job of filling in some of the blanks from the previous films.While all of the actors here do a great job Shaye deserves more credit than she ever gets. She’s a familiar face to movie fans who most will remember from her roles in the comedy films of the Farrelly brothers like KINGPIN and DUMB AND DUMBER, but once she got the attention of casting directors she began appearing in a number of horror films. She always turns in a performance that is outstanding and makes the roles she takes on believable, something not easy to accomplish in a horror film.As the days grow colder, the nights grow longer, as leaves change and fall and every dog that howls seems to take on an ominous tone, horror films during the month of October just seem like the thing to watch. INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 3 is one worth watching and having a good time with. While rated only PG-13 I would say that most kids won’t have a problem with this movie. If they’re impressionable perhaps you might hold off a while though. For most it will be as fun filled as a trip to the haunted mansion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SGCYCIGLMZFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT8SCSG#wasThisHelpful","R1SGCYCIGLMZFQ","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.The Western genre has suffered greatly over the past few decades. Granted there are some amazing movies that have come along (TOMBSTONE, TRUE GRIT and SILVERADO to name a few) but for the most part they aren’t around as much as they were when movies began. So when a new one comes around that offers something different and holds your interest from start to finish it’s always a good thing.Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a young man from Scotland who has traveled across the Atlantic and is in search of the woman he loves. Having left Scotland for reasons we don’t know as of yet, Rose Ross (Caren Pistorious) and her father have traveled west in the hopes of beginning a new life.The deeply smitten Jay is in pursuit of this one true love and heading west on his own when he meets Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender), a bounty hunter traveling the same direction who offers his experience and assistance helping Jay for a price. What Jay doesn’t realize is that Rose and her father are wanted for what happened in Scotland that drove them away and Silas is actually after them for the bounty.As the pair travel west Silas informs Jay that he will do what he can but that he can’t promise anything. He also insist that Jay do as he is told and to learn from him as they go along. This leads to some painful lessons for Jay at the hands of his now mentor, but he does indeed learn. Encounters with animals, with Indians, a con man and with a separate group of bounty hunters give Jay life lessons he had no idea he needed.As their journey moves them further west they begin to change. Jay begins to grow up a bit and Silas begins to rediscover the humanity that seemed to have deserted them when they first met. As they near their goal, the home of Rose and her father, the pair split. What happens from there leads to an unexpected ending, revelations of what really happened in Scotland and the always present shootout found in any Western.The movie is wonderful in so many ways. The cinematography is breathtaking in many moments, shooting in ways not used repeatedly in the past. The scenery in the film, from the forest where they begin their journey to the golden plains where they end it is beautiful to behold. The performances from all involved are above standard and Fassbender once more displays why his star is on the rise.It would be nice if more westerns were in production but it isn’t likely. If they were like this and word got out how good they were my guess is the public would once more embrace the genre. Until that happens we can all enjoy a movie like this time and time again instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSTCV5S3J7YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XU8CMUK#wasThisHelpful","R3PSTCV5S3J7YU","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.There is a part of a movie lover that reads the words “20th anniversary edition” attached to a movie like MOSQUITO that says “Really? We needed an anniversary edition for a movie like this?” What is most surprising is when you watch and then realize that yes indeed, we did need this version. It’s not that the movie is wonderful (it isn’t) or that it contains some outstanding performances (it doesn’t) but what it does do is show you how fun a movie can be even when the bad parts are there on screen to be witnessed. The folks behind this movie love horror films, especially big critter movies, and that shows in every frame.The story involves an alien spaceship dumping radioactive waste into a swamp. One of the canisters splits releasing some slimy green material that a mosquito chooses to drink up. Bingo bango bongo we now have mutated giant mosquitos to deal with.  But we can’t just run with that, there has to be more going on.We’re introduced to several characters who work in a national forest during the camping season going on. Most important of these is Park Ranger Hendricks. Why? Because he is played by Ron Asheton, one of the founding members of the proto-punk band The Stooges who were fronted by Iggy Pop. Asheton was a die-hard B-movie fan who had his dream come true in being a part of this film. Alongside his character is a new Ranger named Megan (Rachel Loiselle) and her boyfriend Ray (Tim Lovelace) who arrive soon after the first mosquito attack takes place. With dead campers everywhere to be seen they check out the Ranger station to find Hendricks the only survivor.Heading out to find help the trio come across Parks (Steve Dixon) a USAF meteor chaser who’s been tracking the falling debris. With his Geiger counter in tow they track down the mosquitos but are nearly eaten alive, making them realize the best bet is to high tail it out of the area for help. On their way they are stopped by a wrecked car. It’s a set up and they’re nearly taken hostage by a trio of bank robbers who are headed back to the park area to recover some of their loot. Of not here is that the leader of the group is none other than Gunnar Hansen, famous as the original Leatherface in the first TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.As the group tries to outrun the mosquito swarm they are attacked time and time again resulting in the motor home they were escaping in being turned over. As they continue to run they’re picked off one at a time until the number of survivors drops. A final battle ends the film…or does it? One can never tell in a giant critter movie.Yes, this movie is bad on a number of levels but when you think back to the fact that 20 years ago CGI was nearly non-existent they come up with some decent effects. What stands out are the practical effects on screen here, the giant bugs that the cast tangles with. When shot these things become goo dripping messes that aren’t likely to scare most adults but could creep out many a youngster. But if they watch keep in mind there is a nude scene so keep that hand ready to cover young eyes.The acting isn’t the worst ever committed to film but it does leave a lot to be desired. But that’s the joy of a movie that’s so bad it’s good. No one promises Shakespeare and the cast delivers on that non-existent promise. It’s all in fun and done well enough to actually be an enjoyable movie. Those with projection TVs they can use outdoor will want to show this come summer outside on a big sheet.Synapse has done a great job here when it comes to extras. If you’ve read my reviews you know I’m not a fan of extras for the most part. But here again, as with items made by both Twilight Time and Arrow Video, we have a movie that is enhanced by the extras. They don’t seem to be made simply to stroke the egos of actors involved or to promote a movie we already purchased. Instead they take us back to what happened then as it was being filmed and to show us how those involved are doing now.

"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.The myth of the gunslinger has been around for centuries. In the beginning it wasn’t the use of guns that made a man more dangerous than another but knives, swords, mallets and more. With the creation of firearms that changed. Add to that the tales of the old west and the gunslinger was born. Fables old and new arose from those days and they carry on to the present in movies we see released every year. They update those tales and sometimes work, others not. That decision is based on the viewer and their perspective.BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA is set in the world of illegal gun slinging in South America. Competitors face off with one another in an area designated by whoever is hosting their match. A circle is drawn for them to stand in, they put on their own Kevlar vests and face one another. At a signal from their host, they draw and attempt to push their competitor out of his circle unable to return. Shots are only at the vests and to draw blood is to lose the competition.In this world walks John (Ryan Kwanten), a young man on a mission. Joh know that he’s good, perhaps the best there is or ever will be. But until he meets up with the one man who has survived all challenges, a mysterious man known as Zorringer (Mickey Rourke) he will never know. But getting to Zorringer is easier said than done. To face off to Zorringer you have to be invited and he’s not likely to take on just anyone. His girl Friday checks out all competitors and to date, John hasn’t met the standards set. So he carries on, moving from one match to the next, earning his way to the top.Into John’s life walks Colt (Freida Pinto), a young woman on her own quest. Colt is another contender in the game. A deadly drawn and accurate to boot, she takes on challengers as well. Her goal is to find the man who killed her brother playing these games. Whether she will kill him or not is yet to be seen. While watching John she becomes intrigued and the two partner up to travel the roads of South America from meet to meet hoping to resolve the issues they have. John and Colt eventually become lovers as well. With the amount of time spent together it is inevitable. The question is will their different paths unite to keep them on one or will they part ways down the road?On their journey they pick up wounds, bruises and more. They encounter a couple of corrupt police officers and have to find a way out of that predicament without injury to anyone. Neither of them are murderers yet and have no intention of killing innocents. But while the law usually looks the other way in the competitions getting to them is another matter.While the story of Colt must have a solution the showdown between John and Zorringer is what most matters in this story. John does finally win his shot at taking on the man known as the best there is. While meeting there is no animosity between the two and they have a metaphysical conversation concerning what it is they do. And then they meet on the field.The movie does an even handed job of presenting the story and the competition for what it is, illegal gambling on a deadly “sport”. The intertwined stories of John and Colt work well together and their romance forms naturally in a world where the next day might be their last, especially when John is wounded with broken ribs from taking a few hits. It makes for an interesting film that holds you in its grip from start to finish. That being said it has one major flaw that arrives very late in the film that is a personal gripe with me but that I won’t spoil for those who want to see this film.The production value of the film is very good with some nice cinematography making things clear rather than going for an edgier look. The sound people have done an outstanding job here as well highlighting everything someone in deep concentration might be hearing throughout each confrontation. The acting is well done by all involved but Roarke is used so little here as to almost make his part a cameo undeserving of his name being used to promote the film.The movie may not be for everyone but it will present something different to watch on a Friday night. Finding an original movie is rare and this one doesn’t quite fit into any particular category making it more original than most. I guess you could call it a western set in a different location but on the whole it’s its own movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OJP9EL3US2EJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGPMBK6#wasThisHelpful","R2OJP9EL3US2EJ","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Discussions on exorcism were something that most people were never aware of, more often than not something loosely tossed into a story of some horror film. And then in 1973 that all changed when William Peter Blatty’s novel THE EXORCIST was brought to the screen. Suddenly we had numerous movies concerning exorcisms being done around the world. But none of them ever captured that sheer terror we found in the original. With THE VATICAN TAPES that record remains.Angela Holmes (Olivia Taylor Dudley) is a young woman about to be married. Her father Roger (Dougray Scott) is a military man who comes home to visit on her birthday. An injury at her party leads to a trip to the doctor where she begins to act strange. Conveniently a Father Lozano (Michael Pena) is on hand to witness some of the thing that happen. As the days go by and he sees more of Angela, he becomes convinced she is possessed. Security footage is smuggled to the Vatican, who apparently have an archive of such footage from around the world, and the eventual decision that only an exorcism can save this girl comes to be.The pacing of the movie is slow enough that while it should be developing suspense it actually bogs down what’s going on. I mean face it, we know from the title that an exorcism is eventually going to happen. And we’ve seen enough of these movies to know that the priests involved will have something in their history that makes their involvement either a hindrance on what they are doing or leads to their demise. But this movie takes its time getting us to that point where the exorcism takes place.It isn’t until the final third of the film that things begin to move in this direction. The background stories aren’t presented well enough to make them memorable. I watched this movie less than a week ago and honestly can’t recall much about them. But the exorcism happens and things make noise, furniture bounces and backs bend in unnatural ways on the possessed human. Been there, done that. They do add a twist here at the end that changes things up a bit but by then most of us will have lost interest. I know I did.I won’t say I hated this movie but come on, let’s do something new here. Let’s make it different than the hundreds of movies in the genre that have come before. Yes the production quality and the acting were better than low budget movies done on the same topic but there are no scares here and nothing to make anyone find their faith again. Even THE LAST EXORCISM brought something fresh to the table.If clichéd items are fine with you then you might enjoy this. If you’re a fan of every exorcism movie ever made then have at it. For me I can’t recommend this one to anyone. All it made me do was feel sorry for Dougray Scott who made the wrong career move when he decided to not take on the role of Wolverine in the first X-Men movie. Then again perhaps Hugh Jackman’s good fortune was better for us all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ0UXGM7H92RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HTAGBY#wasThisHelpful","RQ0UXGM7H92RM","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.I’m a fan of Gary Daniels. I’ve been watching his films since his early output when video was still around through the current films he’s made in the past few years. I have always been surprised that he hasn’t become a bigger star than he is. A featured actor in many direct to DVD productions his acting has progressed to far better than the roles he gets. He still handles himself exceptionally well in fight scenes. So why doesn’t someone use him in a big production?In this film he stars as Bradley, a hit man working for The Executive (Eric Roberts). His current assignment is to retrieve a disc of information from a crime boss named Vogel (Mickey Rourke). Vogel offers to pay him off but Bradley has some principles and instead takes off with the disc and thumb drive. Along the way he takes on Vogel’s henchmen, eventually shooting one as the doors to the elevator open. Unfortunately behind that man was Vogel’s pregnant daughter who was killed as the bullet went through them both.Fast forward months later. Bradly has been in hiding from Vogel, trying to keep a low profile. He lives in a bad neighborhood in London and watches as low level criminals assert themselves on the locals. When a brutal pimp continues to beat up on one of his girls, Bradley has had enough. He goes to visit the pimp in his brothel and discovers most of the girls have been abducted and hooked on heroin. A raging battle between Bradley and numerous henchmen follows and he sets the girls free.But one tags along with him. She’s intent on finding her lost sister, another girl who once worked for the pimp. Sent elsewhere she’s trying to find her and asks Bradley for his help. He chooses to do so and contacts The Executive to get assistance in finding the girl. But there will be consequences in dealing with the devil. Another job, another performance of some act without knowing exactly the reason for it. As Bradley moves deeper into the world of The Executive he finds out more than he bargained for. Will he find the girl? Will he confront The Executive? Or will Vogel find Bradley and enact his revenge on him for the death of his daughter?Action fans will delight in this film. The well-choreographed and shot sequences run from near the beginning of the film until the end. Little time is wasted on dialogue of story set ups but they are there. Instead the makers of this film knew they wanted to make it an all action slugfest and the results are all on screen for action fans to enjoy.The fact that amid all of that action Daniels can carry off any amount of acting is an accomplishment in itself. He does indeed do so making the character of Bradley a sympathetic one. He’s a man whose done wrong, killed many and will more than likely kill again. But he changes from a killer who didn’t consider the consequences of his actions to one who does so less willingly.While Roberts turns in a decent performance here as does Jeff Fahey, another direct to DVD star who deserves better, there are two performers completely wasted. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah play two of the top leaders in the human trafficking scheme though why they appear and how they are used feels forced, as if the film makers wanted to put them in there for name value only. Their scenes could have been omitted with no lost to the end product.Daniels fans will find a movie to delight in and action fans will be pleased with this release. If you can’t find your movie of choice on hand and this one is there, give it a chance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OJYC1NNLRZ4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGTJMP4#wasThisHelpful","R3OJYC1NNLRZ4S","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.The popularity of the Robertson family as seen through the eyes of their show DUCK DYNASTY has astounded those in the TV industry, including their home network of A&E. Where they were once thought to be just another “reality” show, they’ve become such a phenomena that people talk about them in the news and their products in stores are selling astronomically. So where did they come from? How did their show come about?That’s easily answered. They made duck calls and eventually produced their own series of hunting videos that they sold as well and appeared on the Outdoor Channel. The videos they shot included the homespun humor that fans have come to know over the past few years as well as their devotion to God. It was these same videos that caught the eye of A&E producers who came calling and with the help of the Robertson family turned that show into what we now have.But what if you never saw those original programs? What if you wanted a sampling of what they had to offer back then or to see what started it all? That happened last year when during their season hiatus they began to show a new series called BEFORE THE DYNASTY. With newly shot introductions from the cast these short spots were highlighted featuring those earlier shot programs, not in their entirety but in small dosages. Those programs have been collected to form this video.But don’t think that all of these feature nothing but hunting techniques. It’s much like the show we see now but perhaps just a tad bit less polished. The same as if you were watching a pilot for a show rather than the finished product. The same cast of characters are there to be found, the whole Robertson clan. And the antics fans have grown to love are all on hand as well. If you love the show, you’ll love this as well.Segments include a pair of NYC firefighters who win a trip to go hunting with the Robertsons and a trip to Las Vegas for a business convention. Both those and other episodes come up with just what you would expect from this series. At just over 3 hours’ worth of shows this DVD offering should keep fans happy while waiting for the next season to begin or the last to arrive on disc.The popularity of the show isn’t likely to disappear soon but eventually like all other TV series the odds are it will end. That’s not something fans will be happy with. It’s one of the reasons why DVDs like this are worth picking up. If you love the show and want to enjoy it forever pick up this and other seasons today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U7UO8YGQ1HQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOGZ91M#wasThisHelpful","R1U7UO8YGQ1HQU","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.As most of you know who read me regularly I am not a fan of “found footage” films. The reason is that the majority of them are made this way for two reasons: because it’s cheap or because the film maker is lazy. While it was a novel idea when this genre first began it’s become so overused as to make a film like this unwatchable. On occasion a good one slips in but it’s rare. This movie is one of those.Five friends go off to a remote woods to spend the night and to play a game. They head to a preserve that is supposed to be haunted and regularly attracts young people who choose the location to commit suicide. A friend of one of the girls going there for her first time recently did just that. But the group goes anyway with the intention of playing a game they do on a normal basis.The game is called nightlight and consist of one person being blindfolded while the rest head off to hide. After counting so long that person goes off to find the others. It’s an old game with a new twist in that everyone has their own flashlight or something to use as one. Our heroine uses a cell phone with a light on it while at the same time apparently recording everything that’s going on as well. The most amazing things about that is that the phone never seems to lose a charge. I’d love to know what model it is so I can get one like it next time I upgrade mine.As the night progresses strange things begin to happen. One of the girls goes missing to be found later on in a trance like state having no clue where she’s been or the passage of time since she first went out of it. Various members of the teens disappear only to show up later. All of them end up terrified that they’ll never find their way back to their car or survive the night alive. With good reason too as there are times the cell phone camera picks up on images of demon like creatures slightly off camera of out of focus making their way among the group when someone hits that trance stage.The movie offers a few suspenseful moments and has an ending that I thought worked quite well. But as I started out here, the found footage aspect of it doesn’t hurt but doesn’t help either. While the movie can be interesting at times and by the end has held our interest, it also doesn’t make you want to watch it over and over again or make sure that your friends don’t miss it. The jump scares featured here feel predictable rather than surprising. The jerk characters seem readily apparent. A few plot twists are nice and make the movie worth watching in the end.While not the greatest thing since sliced bread the movie is an entertaining film that will more than likely hold your interests throughout. While it’s not the greatest horror film ever made it is far from the worst. It makes a good night’s rental but not one to add to the collection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9VEVK1S4GL39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDAVFRE#wasThisHelpful","R9VEVK1S4GL39","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.I like deli food. At least the deli food I’ve had the chance to come into contact with. But as the movie here explains the deli is a dying breed when it comes to restaurants in the country these days. That should make folks who love real delis or who watch this film bring a resurgence in trying to find these restaurants before they can fade away into being nothing more than a memory.DELI MAN is a documentary that focuses on Ziggy Gruber, a co-owner of the biggest deli in Houston and grandson of one of the original big delis in New York years ago. Ziggy loves his business. He loves the tradition that he’s carrying on. He loves the history of it all. And all of that shows not only in this film but in the business that he runs.Keep in mind we’re not talking about that section of the grocery store that sells cold cuts and potato salad. Certainly their basis began with the real delis of old. What this movie is about are the outstanding delicatessens that have fallen by the wayside for the most part, dropping from the thousands to a mere handful in today’s world of fast food menus. Delis of old created special sandwiches and carried items like matzo ball soup, served real meats that were cooked fresh and sliced to order and featured many kosher delicacies as well.The movie might focus on Ziggy, coming back to him and his tale often but it also presents a pretty comprehensive history of the American deli at the same time. Through still of the past, old footage and interviews with deli customers and owners you get a timeline and a better understanding of what a deli actually was. It also makes you long for those delis to return in full force. Sure the local McD can make you a quick burger but the end product while passable will never have the same flavor of a corned beef on rye made on the spot rather than shipped frozen across country.Watching this movie gave me hope. It’s the same reason a show like DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES is so popular. People love food. But more than that they love real food at reasonable prices. They long for the places that used to dot the country from one end to the other, places that served fresh food to hungry customers, that recognized you when you walked in. Like to spots found on that series, delis offered the same thing.Watching this movie you grow fond of Ziggy and want nothing but long lasting success for him and for his deli. You want him to find happiness and by the end it appears that he has. It will also make anyone who is able to do so want to take a trip to Houston just to stop in and sample what he offers. My guess is that those who are fortunate enough to do so will be glad they did. The movie presents an Oscar worth feature that covers the topic well and deserves notice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKETU4KB7P29O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOB45DI#wasThisHelpful","RKETU4KB7P29O","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.There are movies made that are certain to be headline attractions and there are others made to be more or less filler, movies to occupy your time and provide work for actors who deserve better. As a fan of James Marsden, Thomas Jane and Piper Perabo they deserve better than this but at the same time I suppose it pays the bills. It’s not a bad movie but most involved are above this feature.Marsden stars as a recently returned trouble maker who has come back to help a friend who’s gone missing. Jane stars as his brother, the town sheriff who is none too happy to see his return as well as his brother. The two have gone their separate ways, have taken different paths and when together seem like oil and water. Perabo is the deaf/mute wife of Jane who is currently studying the bears in the nearby forest where most of the movie takes place.It seems that the missing friend was helping poachers in the forest which is now besieged by an angry bear set on taking out anyone who comes its way. Let’s just say this sounds a lot like JAWS 2 or ORCA and get that out of the way right now. Marsden goes off to find his friend and along the way saves Perabo from the bear. Jane, along with Marsden’s old girlfriend goes off to find his wife and ends up finding her and Marsden. Along the way to safety they come across Douglas (Billy Bob Thornton), a big game hunter they aren’t fond of who’s been hired to kill the grizzly who leaves them to go his own way.With the bear between the group and safety the only way they can get out of the forest is through a pass known as the Grizzly Maze, thus the title. Toss in some problems with just who was helping the poachers, several confrontations with the grizzly that always end with either a death or a near escape and a final battle that runs more along the lines of “what the heck” rather than “that was satisfying” and you end up with a movie that’s not the worst thing ever put on film but not one that will satisfy your desire to see a great movie either.My comparison to JAWS 2 and ORCA will give you an idea of the quality of this movie. The locations look great, the actors do a fine job, but the end results leave something to be desired. If this is what is left on the shelf or in the Redbox then it might be worth watching but it’s not a movie you would want to seek out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWAO6JEMA6MXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9HSA42#wasThisHelpful","RWAO6JEMA6MXI","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.With the success of shows like GHOST HUNTERS and FINDING BIGFOOT tons of real life adventure stories are making their way to the small screens on several channels. Almost all of them feature some person or group searching out something mysterious with the hopes of either catching it on film or capturing whatever it is they’re after. The two aforementioned shows at least present programs where they’re willing to say this is a hoax or there is a reasonable explanation for something. But others leave much to be desired.SWAMP MONSTERS falls into that category. Following the tried and true pattern being followed for these show we’re presented with a group who call themselves the Bayou Enforcement Agency for Supernatural Threats (B.E.A.S.T.). Love the acronym. This group sets out to capture and prove the existence of several threatening creatures down in the swamp lands where they live. They seem like nice enough guys but as if someone is trying to make normal people appear to be the cast of DELIVERANCE in search of legendary monsters.This DVD offers the group in search of three well known (?) monsters from the swamp. The first is the Grunch. No, not the Grinch, the Grunch. Then there’s the Honey Island Swamp Monster. Lastly is the Cajun werewolf. Each episode has the group doing research on the monster they are after, which is normally them interviewing colorful characters from the swamplands nearby who tell them the tales they’ve heard all their lives and their personal interaction with each one. Then they scout out the area that they’ve heard these creatures live in. They formulate a plan to capture it, creating traps that make you wonder why they think they would work. Lastly they head out for the night to catch their prey.The one thing that holds true to this show that does for nearly all the rest is that they never catch anything. We might hear something stirring in the woods, the trap might snap and catch something but they always seem to escape. Then our boys go home having and on to the next creature. It never seems odd that they spend perhaps three days to find information, get set, fail and then give up. They never stake themselves out for any longer amounts of time to catch anything which if you seriously had that goal would seem to make sense. Then again perhaps they are accountants during the week and do this on the weekend to shoot the show.There is some entertainment value to this program just like there are the rest. They guys on the team seem to have fun with one another and are honestly friends. The footage of what they never catch makes for some interesting and fun moments as do the interviews with backwoods swamp living people they know. It’s not a bad show but not one I’m likely to visit on a regular basis.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14VMQSVGD3QR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE4ZYWQ#wasThisHelpful","R14VMQSVGD3QR1","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.When it comes to movie made in other countries we here in the U.S. rarely accept or encourage their viewing. Yes I know there is a market for these films but it is a niche market at best for the most part. That’s sad. Rather than shy away from other points of view or have the opportunity to see something that might not be as mainstream as the rest, we’ve settled on watching things only we create and complain about the fact that we have to read subtitles. For that reason when the chance presents itself I often try to watch foreign films.All that being said there is a difference in film when you look at these works as well. The steadfast plotlines used in American film are not always adhered to. There are times that’s a good thing and others when it is not. In any event what I’ve learned from most foreign films is that there are more risks being taken there than in our movies for the most part.One more thing as viewers we need to take into consideration. Coming from the U.S. we have more freedoms and have had them longer than other countries and when viewing movies we need to keep that in mind. Artistic suppression sometimes decades long stirs something in artists to step out of the box, to come up with something different and sometimes uncomfortable, a display of the feelings and emotions long held in check. If, as we watch, we remember that then foreign films take on a different quality.Which brings me to IMMORAL TALES. Director Walerian Borowczyk was a Polish born director who first studied art, eventually attracted to the possibilities of film. His animated short predated those of Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam who seems to have adopted his style. Those works led to his interest in pursuing feature films. But to say his films are not like most is an understatement. Borowczyk always seems more interested in what we see, in the visual, than the story being told. It’s as if story takes second place to visuals in his films.IMMORAL TALES features four stories with little in common except for the theme of sex. The first story tells of a young man’s obsession and eventual seduction of his cousin, taking her to a beach and comparing his oral gratification by her to the tides. The second story revolves around a teenage girl in what seems to be medieval times infatuated with the church as she mixes her desires with images of the Catholic Church while masturbating in a locked room. The third story involves the legend of Elizabeth Bathory who was said to bathe in the blood of virgins to retain her youth. In this story that appears to be the case as she gathers a group of young women from a local village, strips them down and watches them cavort nude before taking the legendary bath. The final story concerns young Lucrezia Borgia, the daughter of Pope Alexander VI, having sex with her male relatives and their assistants. So from these descriptions it becomes obvious that the main thing that ties them together is sex.So what would prompt a highly regarded artistic director like Borowczyk to make a movie that at times feels more like soft core porn than art? Looking deeper into the film I learned that at the time the movie was made (1974) short films were not the rage they had been earlier. At the suggestion of his producer and because of the relaxed censorship in France it was thought that by directing a sexual film like this Borowczyk could draw a bigger audience to his films. The response to the film was mixed with some liking it and others feeling that his decision guided him more into the realm of pornographer than artist. While the movie did well at the box office many felt that it was his weakest film and that it led to a decline in his abilities.So with the storyline described and a touch of history added what did I think of the film? On a story level it left me wondering just what story was being told. The fact that there was no theme running through each left me confused. Then again perhaps that’s the American in me having grown up with stories in film that run beginning, middle and end. For me as a viewer then the movie wasn’t necessarily an entertaining experience.But there is also the artistic merit to consider with this movie. Borowczyk does have an eye for film. Images that he places on the screen are often unlike any other and I mean that in a good way. His framing of certain scenes brings to mind more famous works of art than they do pornography. While there is definitely nudity in the film none of it has the hardcore sensibilities that the world of pornography has made easily accessible with the click of a mouse online these days. I don’t doubt that it was considered shocking at the time but viewers today will consider it mild for the most part.From a moral standing it will all depend on your beliefs. Christians will undoubtedly be shocked by the images of religious leaders caught up in sex with various characters here. The incestuous relationship in the first story is sure to upset as well. Non-religious viewers will then rally to defend the film as art. The question of Borowczyk’s motive in doing so will not be discussed if that argument is followed. Was it done to shock or was it done as a reaction to years of repression he felt? One you get past the eroticism he uses that becomes the question.Arrow Video does another outstanding job of extras, one of the main reasons that movie fans have begun flocking to their releases. With the exception of Criterion films release you won’t find many companies that delve this deep into their offerings. The biggest difference is that Arrow doesn’t charge an outrageous fee for this with their movies at a more affordable price. Included on this release are a new high def digital transfer of not only the version I’ve described here but the five-part film that included “The Beast” (a segment that Borowczyk adapted into another feature also available from Arrow), an introduction by Borowczyk expert Daniel Bird, an interview featuring the production manager and cinematographer of the film, an archival interview with Borowczyk, a visual essay about Borowczyk’s works on paper, a theatrical trailer, an illustrated booklet with writing on the film by Bird and an archive piece by Philip Strick and a reversible sleeve for the cover.In the end I can’t say that I loved this film or would go back and watch it again but I will say it present an interesting look at film making from another country and the sensibilities involved because of that. While some will hail it as great art I felt more like I witnessed the potential of a great film maker gone to waste on something that was dropped into the world as pornography. It would have been interesting to see what he would have done with a more mainstream film.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9CY1XQUWOCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BQ46CI#wasThisHelpful","R3S9CY1XQUWOCP","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.So if there were two ways to judge a movie, one by content and the other by production value, then I’d have to start this review by saying that production wise this movie is sufficient but offers nothing outstanding. The effects are decent enough but nothing notable that hasn’t been seen or done before. As for the cinematography the same holds true with decent enough filming going on and night time sequences that we are at least able to see. That’s about it production wise.As for story and the like, not my cup of tea. I know there will probably be many out there who enjoy this sort of film but for me random acts of violence, especially against women in today’s world. I could say another aspect of this that I disliked but to do so would involve a major spoiler. Suffice to say that I found little to enjoy from start to finish in this movie.The story involves two Romanian girls who are riding along with three young Italian men in Italy on their way to a rave in the country. The girls don’t know the guys having just met but are game for a party to go wild at. Along the way they drink, get stoned and talk back and forth having problems understanding certain phrases, but seem to be having a good time. One of the men calls a friend back in the city to make sure they had the right directions. He confirms this while answering the door to admit a prostitute to his place.Eventually (and it takes some time) they arrive at their destination. They can hear no music and the guy’s cell phone isn’t working so he borrows the girl’s phone to make another phone call. He tells the girls that they’re the first to arrive and others will show soon and they continue walking into the woods. This is one of those moments where you’re supposed to suspend belief and assume that two young girls from a foreign country are nave enough to trust these guys in the woods at night with no music from a rave they are supposed to be going to.Eventually they find a clearing and sit down to wait, still drinking and smoking. At one point during their walk they came across a stone tablet in a wall that had writing on it, but no one could decipher what it said. Sitting around the first they’ve built they mention it to the only member of the group who can decipher Latin but forget about it quickly.Things take a turn for the worse when one of the guys takes one of the girls into the woods for what we would think is flirting but instead becomes a brutal oral rape sequence. Back at the fire the other two guys grab the remaining girl and start their own rape there leaving her helpless and naked as they each take a turn. Whether this is supposed to be a homage to films like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE I have no idea, but it is an entirely repulsive thing to watch. I’ve yet to understand how some consider this either art of entertainment.While all of this is going on an eerie smoke rises around the area and suddenly we have a group of gray skinned gladiators show up. Apparently the inscription said something about an area of the damned and these are the ghosts who protect the area. They don’t take sides either, attacking both male and female members of the group. If you want to know who survives or doesn’t you’ll have to watch. I will say that doing so would be a waste of time and effort.As I said from the start, I’ve never been a fan of the whole torture porn horror genre and this does nothing to make me change my mind. There have been efforts in the genre that at least present something interesting or different (AUDITION) but for the most part it is nothing more than gore for the sake of gore or degradation for the sake of degradation. In a world where complaints are made daily about misogynistic comments or attitudes to witness the treatment of women in this movie makes me wonder why those who are so up in arms about an innocent comment aren’t creating protest movements about films like this.The extras on here are nearly non-existent. The movie was originally made in 2011 but is just now making its way to blu-ray release. For me this is too soon. I understand the importance of releasing movies on blu-ray format, of trying to retain films and keep them alive as a historical record of movies being made, but something like this doesn’t seem worth the effort. If what you enjoy is seeing women debased and beaten then hey, this movie is right up your alley. For the rest of us it is one to steer clear of.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XSP68XFI706I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OKI12Y#wasThisHelpful","R1XSP68XFI706I","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.With the rising fan base in the genre of horror films it was inevitable that along with the good there would be bad movies made. For the most part the horror genre of the late seventies and early eighties leveled off in the good to mediocre level. But on occasion a movie came along that was so bad all you could do was sit and watch and wonder how anyone could be given the money to make a movie this bad. HELLHOLE is a prime example of that.HELLHOLE opens with a woman murdered in her home by a psychopathic hitman (Ray Sharkey) looking for some documents she has on hand. Her daughter (Judy Landers) witnesses the murder but escapes the killer. The documents being sought were from a doctor her mother worked for that would have destroyed his career. Landers suffers intense amnesia from the incident and this same doctor sends her to an asylum for help so he can keep an eye on her.The usual problems ensue with terrible help working at the asylum and Sharkey turning up trying to discover what Landers knows so he can find the documents. This asylum is one that always seems convenient for exploitation films as most of the time the female inmates spend taking showers or in various forms of undress. Apparently security and hiring proper staff is not something this institution is interested in. It is interested in strange techniques to explore and the main doctor there (Mary Woronov) experiments on patients she deems unfit to stay with the group.I could go on to tell you about the young orderly who dresses like he stepped out of a MIAMI VICE shoot rather than in the normal orderly uniform but that would make it seem a tad more interesting. In fact this movie is so terrible it doesn’t even qualify for the usual “so bad it’s good” standard that many bad movies end up in. Even playing as background noise this movie is not worth the time or money. It would even be a chore to watch if they paid you to do so.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y3RR33M9Y4UE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR1K088#wasThisHelpful","R1Y3RR33M9Y4UE","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.If you find yourself in need of rest and don’t have a bottle of Sominex or even Benadryl on hand then you might want to consider popping this movie into your machine. It truly is a bad movie on all levels and while it’s classified as an action film the odds are it will help you sleep in no time flat.Michael Jai White stars as special operative James Webster who has just finished a tour of duty and returned home. At his return party his brother seems concerned after a phone call but assures James it’s nothing and that he’ll explain it all later. He never gets the chance as he’s murdered during the night. Now James tried to find out who is responsible with vengeance on his mind.As he digs deeper into what happened James discovers a plot involving members of the government and a shipment of drugs. How his brother is tied in isn’t revealed until later in the film. As he continues his investigation the drug runners try to put an end to it as fast as possible. The head man even calls in a professional to assist him in the form of Ray Peters (Steve Austin). The odd thing is that after calling him in his man keeps telling him they can handle things and yet never seem able to do so.I like Michael Jai White. I came to know his career first when he appeared as Spawn in the movie of the same name. Critics hated the movie but I enjoyed it. I thought he did a great job. Years later I loved his performance and creativity with BLACK DYNAMITE, a movie I still recommend to people. So when I see him in movies like this it pains me. He has far more potential than it seems Hollywood is willing to allow him to live up to. That’s too bad because he deserves better than this.As much of a waste as White is here, Austin is even worse. While he’s not the greatest of actors he has shown he is capable of handling a decent role and here he doesn’t get the opportunity to do squat. He’s given lengthy tirades to direct at the man who hired him that don’t even come up to par with the promos he did while working in the WWE. Worse yet, he has fewer action scenes here than almost anyone in the movie. Why hire someone who is known for that and keep them from it?It’s difficult to decide what the worst thing on display here is. The script is terrible with dialogue that is below second rate. The cinematography is passable but below standard. The sets look terrible and out of place, especially the bad guy’s office. They show a glass building from the outside and when we go to the office it’s a hole in the wall with an old steam pipe heater by the windows that look nothing like the windows seen outside. The devil is in the details and no details were even considered here.I hate to say a movie it terrible beyond belief. I know that the efforts of people who do things from being grips to set decorators to wardrobe people to assistants are behind every movie made. But whoever was at the helm of this movie let down that entire staff and owes them a deep apology. This is one movie that I have to say you should stay clear of at all costs.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OMWGW0HLATFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IEW6EY#wasThisHelpful","R3OMWGW0HLATFW","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Movies known as “chick flicks” come in a variety of actual types of movies. There are the comedies that revolve around the trials and tribulations of being a woman (think BRIDESMAIDS), there are the women seeking something more out of their lives type (think THELMA AND LOUISE) and there are what was once just called romantic movies. The thing is that most of these movies aren’t limited in enjoyment by women alone. Guys like some of them as well. I have a feeling that will be the case with THE AGE OF ADALINE, and not just because guys are in love with Blake Lively.Born in 1908, Adaline Bowman (Lively) lives a normal life. She grows up, she gets married, she has a child and becomes widow. And then one fateful night it snows in California, Adaline crashes off the road ending up freezing underwater and having her car struck by lightning at the same time. The end result is that Adaline suddenly stops aging as we know it. This sets a stream of events moving forward that form the basis of our story.Years go by. Adaline continues not to age whereas her daughter (Ellen Burstyn) does. They meet often, remain close and as each decade passes Adaline changes her name and identity. She’s currently Jennifer, living in San Francisco and working for a historical society. She lives with no one but her dog and avoids contact with most people having few friends. She spends New Year’s Eve with one of these friends and as she leaves the party a young man jump into the elevator with her. Adaline has caught his eye and he’s determined to get to know her better. Unfortunately she rebuffs his advances knowing full well where this will end.But the young man isn’t that easily pushed aside. It turns out that he’s a wealthy philanthropist named Ellis (Michiel Huisman) and he’s about to donate some historical books where she works. IF she’ll go out with him. He slowly breaks down her barriers and the two get involved, but in Adaline’s mind for just a short time. She has plans on moving to start a new life, her new identity. Again, things never seem to go as planned.As the two begin to fall in love, Ellis invites Adaline aka Jennifer, to the home of his parents, William and Kathy (Harrison Ford and Katy Baker). A shock is in store for all as William immediately recognizes Adaline. It turns out that back in the sixties the two of them were involved to the point that he was about to propose to her. Passing herself off as the daughter of Adaline she calms things down. But through William’s eyes the resemblance is uncanny. Can Adaline move past the problems she knows she will face should she get involved with someone? Will William’s thinking he knows who she is complicate matters? And will Ellis be able to convince her to find love, be able to accept her if he learns of her problem?The movie unfolds at an even pace, never rushing things and allowing the viewer to watch learn more and more about this wonderfully complicated woman who has suffered severe pain and loneliness in a world filled with people. And that’s to the benefit of the story. Various moments in the film move back and forth through time, allowing us to see the things that happened in Adaline’s life that formed her into the woman she is today. While she may look 29 she’s actually 107 in her mind.Director Lee Toland Krieger does a magnificent job here on several levels. To begin with his method of storytelling is superb, bringing us the bits and pieces we need to know to move the tale forward and allowing us to develop feelings for the characters. At the same time his visual styling here is wonderful to behold almost turning the film into art rather than just a movie in the way it is framed and put together. It’s rare that I find movies to touch me this way and this one does it well. You want to watch not just to get the story but to just watch the images as they appear onscreen.All of the actors involved here turn in great performances but Lively must be singled out. I’ve seen her in a few things and have never noticed her this controlled and perfect in her performances. She carries herself with an air of elegance in this role as if it were made for her, never hitting a false note from start to finish. While watching I couldn’t help but think of Grace Kelly and the way she acted with that air about her that made you feel she was special.THE AGE OF ADALINE is a movie that will touch your heart. It will make you either long for a love that was lost or appreciate the one that you have, realizing that each and every moment you spend with someone is special. It’s not a fluff piece of romance but a deeply felt one that will capture you in its story and hold you there until the end. In the end while some will call this a chick flick I think of it more as a movie to be enjoyed more than once.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6FPSAOTL175/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPH4REI#wasThisHelpful","R2G6FPSAOTL175","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.It seems that the horror genre changes from time to time, bringing various boogeymen to the forefront and then changing that to a different one for a while. Remember when THE EXORCIST came out and suddenly there was a ton of exorcism movies on screens? With TWILIGHT came tons of vampire movies. And now we have zombies. The success of THE WALKING DEAD has led to numerous zombie movies and while most are terrible there are the exceptions. One I write about on the blog called WYRMWOOD which is a gore filled zombie fest fans will like. And this week we get something new and fresh to the genre, EXTINCTION.The movie opens with a busload of people being shuttled to an Army base. The bus stops and before you know can say flesh eaters it is besieged by zombies. Friends Jack (Jeffrey Donovan of BURNT NOTICE) and Patrick (Matthew Fox of LOST) fight off these zombies as others are crushed. Along with Emma and baby Lu they hide out but not before Emma is bitten.Fast forward to nine years later. The world is a frozen wasteland. We’re not told if this is constant or if this is just winter, but it seems to be as desolate as it can get. Patrick is out scavenging for food and ammunition. He gets back to his home, a building surrounded by chain link fence and next door to Jack and the now 9 year old Lu (Quinn McColgan). The two homes are separated by the fence that also surrounds both. But it is the fences built by the people in these homes that becomes the focus of the story.Sometime in the past, something happened that tore the two friends apart. Something so terrible that while Jack stays in his home barely scraping by with enough for him and Lu to eat, he continues to try and stay alive and well teaching Lu things like reading and writing. Patrick on the other hand has deteriorated. Long hair, unshaved and filthy he drinks most of the time when not foraging for food. His only companion is a dog he shares his home with. He spends his nights on the short wave radio trying to locate other survivors, all of this airing over speakers he’s rigged to his fence. Even though the fences are there, the fear of zombies is gone, all of them thought to have died out.One day while scavenging in a warehouse in a nearby city, Patrick finds a fresh, half-eaten carcass of an animal in the store. Following the blood trail he finds a zombie but not like the old days. They’ve adapted to the cold. Nearly blind they rely on their supersensitive earholes to find their prey. As this one goes after Patrick he tears out of the building, locking it in. Heading home on his snowmobile he’s followed by the escaped zombie. Nearing home he fires off his gun, trying to alert Jack. When the zombie knocks him off the snowmobile, Jack hesitates shooting it. Patrick survives but at a cost.Now with the knowledge that the zombies have adapted the two houses must unite if they are to survive. They must find a way to get over whatever it was that happened in the past. The secrets from those days unknown to us, the viewers, will eventually be revealed. The possibility of other survivors is always considered. And the last hope for a future rest in the combined efforts of two men who have grown apart over the years and a little girl who wants nothing more than for them to unite and find others.What makes this movie good is the same thing that makes THE WALKING DEAD good. That is while the story is framed in the world of zombies it isn’t about the zombies that is the center story involved. It is the story of humanity, what people do in the face of adversity to survive. It’s the story of two people who were once close as brothers but have drifted drastically apart. It is the story of a small girl raised in a world without others to play with, with no one but her father there to be by her side, who wants to feel safe and find a world like she’s heard of. What makes this and that series so special is that it focuses not on the killing creatures but on the human beings and what it takes to remain human under these conditions.Both Donovan and Fox have proven they are extremely good actors. To carry off a series for more than a year speaks volumes. Both turn in fine performances here that make you long to find out what happened in the past. McColgan is the surprise here, a new young actress who carries off her role with apparent ease making the character believable and one that we care about. We root for her to find a better world than the one she lives in now.If this movie played in theaters it was a limited run at best. It falls into that category of movies known as straight to DVD but in the select group of movies there that deserve more attention than they received to date. For horror fans you’ll find a new fun movie that you’ll want to add to your collection. For THE WALKING DEAD fans you’ll find a movie that will tide you over until the new season starts. And for everyone else you’ll find a movie that shows the best of what humans can be in the face of a world gone to seed. Definitely worth a watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVEA3YQDLCN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R3ILY6#wasThisHelpful","RRVEA3YQDLCN3","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Tom Hardy is becoming a force to be reckoned with. An actor who has found himself in numerous roles that are demanding and always able to meet the challenge, he has yet to break the bonds of stardom for some reason. His is not a name that most will instantly connect with stardom but perhaps his turn as Mad Max this past summer will change all that. Until it happens by all means catch any and every movie he makes to witness a great actor, starting with this newly released movie, CHILD 44.The movie begins a decade before WWII when a young Ukrainian orphan is adopted by a Russian soldier. Fast forward to WWII as the Russians are set to take down Berlin. Hardy stars as Leo Demidov, that young boy grown and a soldier who is chosen to raise the Russian flag over the city and thus becomes an icon for the heroes of the war. Among his compatriots are his best friend Alexi (Fares Fares) and a soldier named Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) who seems more intent on cringing in fear than doing his duty.The war ends and Leo becomes a pro-Stalin security officer, tracking down those unfaithful to the country and its leader. Life has treated him well and his notoriety from the picture has helped advance him to this point. He ignores the actual ruling style of those in charge since he’s a part of it. He adores his wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) but subtle hints from her make you wonder if the feeling is mutual.Leo’s world is turned upside down when he is presented with his next case and person to investigate. That person is his wife Raisa. As Leo finds himself torn as to what to do another incident crashes down upon him. The son of his best friend and colleague Alexi is found murdered near the train tracks. But murder is something that cannot happen in Russia but only a “capitalist society” and the death is ruled an accident, the murderer not even sought.When Leo reports that there is nothing to the accusations found against Raisa his world is turned upside down. With Vasili now in charge of the government organization looking into the matter, he strips Leo of his rank, lets the couple pack a few things and sends them to a much smaller town where he will work as an investigator under General Nesterov (Gary Oldman). Gone are the days of parties and social events with the couple now forced to share a flat.  The subtle truth behind what seemed to be a perfect marriage has changed as well with Raisa revealing more about where they really stand than Leo realized.When the body of a young boy is found near the train tracks of this town, Leo takes an interest. He tells them things about the body that he should not know, but all are memories of the facts of his friend’s son’s death. As he talks with his superior and explains all he knows, the pair decide that this killer must be found, even if it means taking on the propaganda machine of the country. As they prepare to do what they must to find the killer, Vasili continues to haunt Leo’s world and demean him as much as possible. His motivations fall back to Leo and Alexi’s witness to his cowardice all those years ago rather than advancing the party. Will this be enough for him to thwart the investigation into the crimes of a murderer who they find to have had 43 previous victims? And will Leo and Raisa be able to uncover the secrets that protect this killer from justice?Based on the acclaimed novel by Tom Rob Smith (who went on to write more novels involving these characters) the movie has a sumptuous look to it in set design, countryside and styling that does a painstaking job at recreating the past. As we watched the movie my wife talked about how great the movie looked, something she rarely does. She’s right. It looks great. It looks like a movie that should have been playing for several weeks at the local theater. But for some reason it was rushed to DVD which is a shame. It’s better movie than that and deserved to be noticed.Hardy does another tremendous job of acting here, presenting a character that is flawed but who discovers who he truly is before the movie finishes. Not only does he find his world turned upside down with all he believed called into question, he rises from the ashes to do the job he seems to have been born to do, to become an actual detective. Rapace matches him scene for scene, offering the troubled woman whose own life changes, rises and falls, with that of her husband. By the film’s end how they came together no longer matters.What make this movie works so well though is its story. Not just the story but the culmination of the work put in by all to make this story one that involves the viewer to the point you don’t look at the actors as actors but actually begin to think of them as the characters they are so immersed in portraying. Everything from the directing to the craftsmanship behind the scenes works toward the common goal of telling this story. And in the end all viewers benefit from that. This is a movie that never got attention but deserves it. It is one worth renting or adding to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R383PAED16C8GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z710UWU#wasThisHelpful","R383PAED16C8GS","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.To say the family featured in STRANGERLAND is dysfunctional would be an understatement. This new drama starring Nicole Kidman and Joseph Fiennes will surely disturb most and present all with a story that will frighten but not in a jump-in-your-face way. If nothing else it will start conversation with those who watch and go out for coffee after.The location is a desert town in Australia, a beautiful scenic area of stone and sand that offers a home to what appear to be drifters and those getting by. Tossed into this town is the Parker family, recently relocating there for reasons unknown until later on. None of the four family members are happy to be here and some are more vocal about it than the rest.Father Matthew (Fiennes) is a pharmacist who seems to have trouble relating to anyone in the house, in particular his wife Catherine (Kidman), a woman who still feels that emotional and physical need for her husband but whose affections go unfulfilled. Their oldest child, daughter Lily (Maddison Brown) is the rebellious child, a young girl turned 15 who seeks the attentions of any and all males she encounters, something that will lead this family down a torturous path. Lastly there is Tommy (Nicholas Hamilton), a young boy who is torn by the problems his family faces and who deals with it be sneaking out and walking the streets and nearby area in the dark of night.The movie opens by exposing these problems to us but never explaining just what it was that happened to bring these four people to this point. All we know for sure is that Lily offers what most would call tramp like behavior, sleeping with boys her age and older. Is this a response to their moving, is it because of something at home or is it just an act of teenage angst? Before the end of the film all possibilities will be pursued.It comes to a head when Catherine discovers one day that both children have not gone to school and have disappeared. With a major sand storm on the way, she contacts Matthew and they go to report them missing only to find themselves in the midst of the storm as they reach the center of town. When the storm blows over they report the missing children to the local police Chief David Rae (Hugo Weaving). Concerned but not overly so, he lets them know the children must be missing for 24 hours before a search is called for but begins on his own.As the movie progresses the bits and pieces we’ve been left to wonder about are slowly revealed, the problems that laid beneath the surface of this family that they were dealing with, each in their own way but never together. Tossed into the mix is the problems faced by Chief Rae, personal with the woman he’s sleeping with whose brother may be a suspect in the disappearance and his attraction to the attractive Catherine. With each passing day as the children aren’t found, suspicions and accusations will fly, past wounds that had scabbed over will be opened wide and the mental anguish of all involved will take center stage.This movie is not your normal fast paced detective drama that one would inspect. With the location being a small town in the middle of wide open spaces it doesn’t have that quick cut megacity feel to it. Instead we’re presented with a small town where most everyone feels they know everyone else’s business but at the same time don’t have a clue what is going on. People try to help by joining the search, refuse to believe anyone they know could have done harm to the children and all look with glaring eyes at the couple whose children have gone and they feel may be responsible.Kidman does a great job here, as both a tormented mother concerned for her children and as a woman who loves and longs for a husband who is in retreat for some reason. Fiennes comes off as a combination of unlikeable and sympathetic at the same time. Weaving takes on a commanding presence in the midst of it all while at the same time showing a vulnerable side that makes him wonder till the very end just what happened.As I said, this movie is not fast paced but not so deadly slow as to be boring. On the contrary each moment on screen doesn’t feel wasted. It all combines to make a taught thriller that keeps you wondering just what will happen next and with whom. It could be that the children hitched a ride, got lost in the desert or met with were the victims of foul play and the movie has you guessing with each scene. In the end it makes for a film that will hold our attention and consider the lives of the Parker family. Entertaining isn’t quite the word to describe the film but it will end with you thinking long after the final credits role.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BY6W8QJG5XVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3DC71Q#wasThisHelpful","R1BY6W8QJG5XVU","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.It seems that today’s teens are being exposed to literature in an unusual format. The rash of teen novels in several parts took off big with THE HUNGER GAMES but there are other stories out there being read. That’s a great thing. While it’s not Twain or Hemingway it is reading that is going on and it might lead to their discovering the classics. In the meantime they’re enjoying the books being written now. So much that movies are being made from the novels. As well as the aforementioned GAMES there is the DIVERGENT series. Now the second film based on the second novel, INSURGENT, comes home to DVD.When we last saw them Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) had taken on the forces of Jeanine (Kate Winslet) and headed for the outskirts of Candor, the city where the story takes place. On the chance you missed that film this was a world where people were sorted into 5 different factions, each with their own responsibility to society. Tris had abandoned her family’s faction known as Abnegation (selflessness) in favor of the more adventurous Dauntless (the brave). Eventually with several others in her group they discovered a plot to kill the Abnegation faction by the Erudite (intelligence) faction using Dauntless soldiers being mind controlled to do the dirty deed. Tris and Four led a group to stop this and that’s where we pick up with this film.On the run the Dauntless have separated and yet to rejoin one another. A secret box was found in the home Tris’ family lived in and Jeanine finds that the only way to open it is by using someone who is purely Divergent, an amalgamation of all the factions in one body. She sends the remaining Dauntless units out to find the traitors so she can use them for her goal, thinking that whatever is in the box can lead to the fall of the Divergent.A near miss with being captured, Tris and Four set off to find the rest of their group, jumping a train filled with a group of factionless drifters. A short fight later and Four reveals who he is and asks to be taken to their leader. He knows who this is and it plays into the story later (sorry, no spoiler from me on this one). Refusing to join with the factionless at this time, they reunite with their group and make plans to take back Candor. But Tris, realizing that her being their puts them all in jeopardy, heads back on her own. What happens from there makes for a few tense moments, some high-speed action and a great story that ends without a complete conclusion. Two final installments are in the working stages as we speak, much like THE HUNGER GAMES.What makes this movie work is the unique combination of story and action, of emotions and bravery put on display from start to finish. We know the characters after the first film but now we get to see how they react to the things that they learned and what they will do with that knowledge. It would be easy to just hide or try to go somewhere outside the walls that guard the area they live in. But rather than take that route we witness the growing up of young people willing to sacrifice themselves to make a better world. It’s a far cry from selfie taking spoiled children of today. With any luck they’ll get that out of this series of books and movies.Woodley turns in another great performance. The most difficult thing for an actor to do is to take on a character that many already think they know and make that person their own. Woodley does just that here making Tris a sympathetic character that you can’t help but root for. James holds his own with her but it felt like his role here was less involved and more the heroic action figure that Four can become. Being this is the middle of the entire story that might change next time around. The supporting cast also turns in great performances but the majority of the acting is left in the hands of the central figures this time.The movie looks great with some dazzling special effects sequences that are well done, computer generated realities that have you guessing as the movie carries on, wondering which sequences we’re watching are real and which are the worlds created by the machinery Jeanine uses to try and open the box. It all looks great and propels the story forward, something effects rarely do.I highly recommend watching the first movie once more before tapping into this one but if you’ve seen it once you’ll begin to remember what happened rather quickly this time around. Then enjoy this one and find yourself waiting with the rest of us for the next two to appear. This series may not have taken the box office by storm as much as THE HUNGER GAMES did, but it’s just as appealing an entry in to the teen action genre. For me, it’s another one to add to the shelf, ready to be pulled down every so often and enjoyed once again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17UHN0QWQUM72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5E7ZW6#wasThisHelpful","R17UHN0QWQUM72","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.If nothing else director Wes Craven always seems to bring to the table something interesting that we have never seen before. With each movie he’s made over the years he’s always made something unique when it came to horror films. Having done movies like THE HILLS HAVE EYES, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW and then SHOCKER, fans of Craven in 1991 were waiting to see what he would come up with next. They weren’t disappointed when he released THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS.Youngster Fool (Brandon Adams) is a kid with far too many problems for someone his age. His mother is ill with cancer, his sister may be working the streets to keep them alive and the owners of the building he lives in want to evict him and his family no matter what their problems are. Then his sister’s friend Leroy (Ving Rhames) offers him an out. Leroy tells him that the owners of the apartment building are wealthy and he plans on burglarizing their home. He just needs someone Fool’s size to help.Leroy, his friend Spenser and Fool scope out the house to see about getting in. Fool poses as a Boy Scout raising money but the owner of the house (credited as “woman” with Wendy Robie in the role) tells him to go away. Spenser then poses as a gas company inspector who worms his way into the house only to not come out again. When Leroy and Fool see the owner drive away in her car they break into the house.All does not go well as they are first set upon by a guard dog. Once they get past that and start checking out the house in search of hidden gold coins Leroy has heard of, they start to find out this house is not what it appears to be from the outside. The windows are barred from the inside to start with. The front door has a doorknob that is electrically charged. And within the walls of the basement there are people, if that’s what you can call them, living in the darkness. Fool finds them along with the body of Spenser just as the owners return home.Leroy is soon down for the count as the two owners (woman now accompanied by man played by Everett McGill) start to track down Fool. Earlier we were witness to them dealing with their “daughter” (A.J. Langer), a young girl frightened of doing the wrong thing that would set them off on her. Now she tries to help fool along with her friend Roach (Sean Whalen), one of the people under the stairs who escaped and who man has been trying to catch and kill for some time now.As man tries to track down Fool and Roach things become apparent that this is no ordinary house. Trap doors, secret passages within the walls, hidden closets where man changes into an S&M leather suit to wear while searching for them with his shotgun all help to increase the creepy factor on screen. Just who these people are and what they’ve been doing isn’t completely revealed until the end of the film. Does the treasure actually exist? Are these people really as evil as they appear? And what about the people under the stairs? All is revealed before the credits roll.This may not be the greatest film that Craven ever made but it did offer some scary moments, some skin crawling sequences and a different take on what could have been more of a haunted house type film. Instead he presents something completely different than what we’ve been exposed to before and that is always an exciting thing to see in a horror film. All aspects of movie making are on well done display, from set decorating to make up to acting. No one shines brighter than the rest but McGill and Robie, having just come off of TWIN PEAKS as a married couple there as well, have some of the scariest and funniest lines in the film.As is always the case with Shout/Scream Factory releases this is probably the best version of this blu-ray release that we will ever see. Not only are we presented with a crystal clear picture presentation the extras are formidable for a movie that’s this old. Audio commentary from Craven, another from stars Brandon Adams, A.J. Langer, Sean Whalen and Yan Birch, an interview with Wendy Robie, interviews with Greg Nicotero, Howard Berger and Robert Kurtzman of KNB Effects (this was one of their early projects), an interview with director of photography Sandi Sissel, an interview with composer Don Peake, behind the scenes footage and of course the theatrical trailer. Just getting through the extras will take some time and all are well done and interesting, especially the KNB portion.If you’ve never seen the movie then you can’t call yourself a horror fan. If you saw it once and remembered it then you’ll want to see it again. If you’re a die-hard horror of Craven fan then you’ll want to clear a spot on your shelf for this release. And if you’re just in the mood to watch something that is both creepy and scary then give this one a watch. You won’t be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TAWK7ZYF6ER9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8RORQK#wasThisHelpful","R2TAWK7ZYF6ER9","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.I always find it odd when a plethora of movies with similar themes all come out at the same time. I know movies take time to get financed and produced but it still seems strange. With CHILD 44 released a few weeks back and STRANGERLAND out the same week as this title maybe we could lay off missing children for a while now. Doubtful but let’s hope.The movie begins years in the past with Alice Manning and Ronnie Fuller, two young girls forced into a non-existent friendship by Alice’s mother Helen (Diane Lane). Sent to a party the backward and poor Ronnie lashes out at the party’s host and the girls are sent home. Along the way they hear a baby crying from the front porch of a house and take the baby with them. When the child is later found dead, the girls are sent away to juvenile prison.Now after time served and reaching their 18th birthdays, the girls have been released. Alice (Danielle Macdonald) has returned to her mother’s home. Each day she sets out in search of work as Helen continues to support her but nudges her to find a job. Ronnie (Dakota Fanning), on the other hand, is working at a nearby bakery. While Alice seems content with her life now Ronnie seems troubled. Heavy on the make-up and sporting a chip on her shoulder attitude, she’s moving through life but with no direction.Then it happens. Another baby comes up missing. And with a push from the mother of the child the two girls killed years ago, the police come calling with the girls as the most obvious suspects. Detective Nancy Porter (Elizabeth Banks) was the officer who found the first girl and is still troubled by all aspects of that case. Detective Kevin Jones (Nate Parker) is more inclined to believe that the boyfriend of the new missing child’s mother could be involved. Between the two of them a search for the truth and the missing child brings them together to search all possibilities.What makes the movie interesting is the lives of the two girls and how they slowly are revealed to us as the investigation and search for the new missing child takes place. A combination of flashbacks and current events helps us to see who these two girls are and what might motivate them (or not) to do what they did so long ago. That is if they actually did it. At times the flashbacks make us wonder if it wasn’t one as opposed to both who were responsible for the death of that child.The movie progresses along nicely and brings all of the characters together at different times before providing the solution to the problem at hand. No one was left unscarred by the tragic events of the past. Those wounds led to some serious secrets that are uncovered as the movie moves forward. And until the end not all will be revealed. In the end everyone develops new wounds and the secrets that were kept will have a lasting effect on everyone.Well written, well directed and well-acted this movie will keep you guessing from start to finish. At times you’ll think you know what happened when a new clue or moment presents itself to have you guessing all over again. The simple solution seems readily apparent and then a twist makes you think your original guess completely wrong. Then something else happens and you consider that maybe you were right the first time. That’s the sign of a good mystery. Agatha Christie would be proud.While you would think the stand out performances here would be the two girls in fact the ones that stand out are Lane and Banks. This is not discrediting the performances of Macdonald and Fanning who do a great job here, but the subtle moments of discomfort Lane displays and the troubled officer Banks offers are both a joy to behold. Both are actresses deserving of bigger films.With the tons of serial killers, rapists and one shot murderers seen on TV these days my guess is little will be considered shocking here. Yes a child has been killed but fortunately for us the director and writer determined that to witness that murder was something we didn’t need to see. We already know it’s a terrible thing to have happened. But along with that murder are several other secret things that are just as troubling. This one is worth watching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZTUXI8XL38W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIF8GF0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZTUXI8XL38W","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.I can honestly say that I love magic. No, not the hoodoo spooky stuff where people do incantations but the entertaining style of magic with card tricks and floating women. Doug Henning and David Copperfield style magic. And one of the most legendary performers of magic has been the Amazing Randi. Not only has he performed with amazing skill he’s also taken the task of exposing flim flam man and con artists who would prey on the innocent and gullible. This makes him a hero in my book.The title of this film involves a play on words of sort. We’re told that magicians are actually liars to the nth degree but that unlike those who prey on people they are up front about it. They tell the audience in advance I’m going to lie to you and make you believe I have powers that don’t exist when in fact I’m playing a trick on you. But there is something else to James Randi that many never knew about that made him an honest liar of a different sort. It wasn’t something he quite hid but it wasn’t something he talked about either. It was the fact that he was gay.But the movie doesn’t focus solely on that. Instead it covers the life of this amazing magician from early no through his rise as a performer of note, appearing numerous times on programs like The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. He appeared on stages around the world. And at the height of his fame he stepped back and began a crusade to stop people from abusing tricks and skullduggery to harm folks into believing they could actually perform miracles they could not.The biggest scam he uncovered (and one I’d heard of prior to seeing this film) was a television minister who claimed her could heal the sick. This man would encourage people to toss away their prescribed medicines claiming they no longer needed them once he healed them. It turns out he was using an earpiece and the information he had on members of the audience was being fed to him by his wife in the back, information taken from cards people in the audience had filled out when they arrived. Randi exposed him for what he was and how he did what he was doing. Sadly for those who believe in the healing powers of faith it is charlatans like this that besmirch the name of those they claim to represent. Randi knew this and set out to shine a light on them.The movie not only talks about his life as a performer and debunker of false mystics, it talks about his life long relationship with his partner Jose Alves. This becomes another form of an open lie taking place as well. Having read about it before I wasn’t stunned when it becomes known in the film just what that hidden piece of information is but I won’t reveal it here for those unaware.What is nice about the topic of Randi’s being gay in this film is that it doesn’t turn it into a political stance. Their affection for one another is not something that they feel needs a huge display on film. You know by the end of the film just how much these two mean to one another and that’s fine. Whether you agree or disagree with people who are gay doesn’t make a difference in this film. It never becomes an issue. It is accepted and discussed and that’s all there is to it.The work that Randi did in stopping charlatans who preyed on the weak was a noble effort. When he’s gone I wonder who will be left to take up his cause. I’m hoping someone will do so, someone who has as much knowledge on the topic as he does. As for magicians there are always those who will amaze us with their abilities. Watching this film you witness just how great a magician he truly was/is and appreciate him for how amazing a performer he has been.You will also see that he has and always was an honest liar. He told us up front he planned on deceiving us. He did just that in more ways than one. And yet it never affected how we viewed him or how much we enjoyed what he was able to do. After watching this an appreciation for all he provided will be the end result.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V5PBVUVOTIDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010GL2G7W#wasThisHelpful","R1V5PBVUVOTIDW","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Shout/Scream Factory continues the onslaught of releasing classic 80s horror films that were found on mom and pop video stores across the country with this double feature. Of the pair one is really good while the other isn’t bad but not spectacular. Still they both come out better than some of the things being released today.CELLAR DWELLER starts us off featuring Jeffrey Combs (THE RE-ANIMATOR) in what amounts to a cameo as comic book artist Colin Childress who in the 50s is creating a horror comic in the mode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT. The thing is he’s been using a mysterious book of spells as his inspiration. While reading from the book the creation he comes up with comes to life and upon realizing this he lights his studio and drawings on fire capturing the creature.Fast forward to the 80s and now the house he once owned is an art colony headed over by Mrs. Briggs (Yvonne DeCarlo). The latest artist to arrive is Whitney Taylor (Deborah Farentino), a comic artist who is a fan of Childress who is well aware of what happened in this building. Mrs. Briggs doesn’t feel that comic book art deserves to be included in this group but was forced to take on Whitney due to a scholarship.Whitney is introduced to her fellow artists. She meets Phillip (Brian Robbins) a painter, Lisa (Miranda Wilson) a performance artist, Norman Mishelski (Vince Edwards) a writer of hard-boiled detective stories and lastly Amanda (Pamela Bellwood), someone Whitney knows only too well. It seems that at the last school she attended Amanda wasn’t pleased that Whitney’s abilities drew more attention than her own and she sabotaged her tenure there.With no love lost between these two it is only a matter of time before they collide and with Mrs. Briggs egging her on Amanda is sure to try something.Whitney enjoys the location but soon decides to venture into the basement, a forbidden area of the house and the location of Childress’ old studio. Rather than suffer the wrath of Mrs. Briggs she convinced her to allow her to use this area for her studio. Soon she begins drawing comics in the same style as Childress as well as his creation, no doubt inspired by the book Childress attempted to burn in the start of the film. The bodies soon begin to pile up as the creature takes out the artists one at a time. Will Whitney be able to stop him before they all die?The movie is a fun romp that pays homage to the classic horror comics of the past while using them as the jumping board for the story being presented. If it sounds familiar a similar story was used in the TALES FROM THE CRYPT HBO series but I think this one does it better justice. The artwork used is creepy enough, the plotline believable enough for a horror film and the creature, a practical effect with someone in a costume/make up, works well. This was all before the big leap to CGI and it works here.The acting is better than most with actors that went on to much bigger things. That pays off in the end with performances that raise the bar on a low budget movie like this. Well shot, well directed and well made, this one is worth watching.CATACOMBS is the weaker of the two entries here. It’s not a terrible movie but it does drag a bit for the most part while offering a decent enough story. At a monastery in the late 1500s a group of monks have captured a man possessed by a demon. Unable to exorcise the demon, they instead chain him to the wall of a room in the catacombs beneath the monastery and seal him in with a blessed seal to keep him inside.We jump forward to 1988 (when the movie was released) to find Elizabeth Magrino (Laura Schaefer) coming to the monastery for research into the catacombs. Most of the brothers of the abbey have no problem with this save one, Brother Marinus, a by the book monk who feels the presence of a woman does nothing but invite problems. Overruled he is forced to sulk for most of the film.Also visiting the abbey is Father John Durham (Timothy Van Patten), helping to care for the eldest of the monks and attempting to regain the faith that has dampened for him over the past few years. He questions his beliefs and finds comfort among these monks who have dedicated their lives to God. Before the film ends his convictions will either be renewed or the lack of them will lead to his downfall.As the movie progresses it offers more story than scares, with each of the monks dealing with their daily chores as well as helping Elizabeth with her research. At the same time strange things begin to happen. Sand begins to fall from various ceilings and noises plague the monastery. Unbeknownst to the monks, the seal has broken from the wall and the bricks are slowly coming loose. The demon is awake and wanting to wreak havoc. Whether it accomplishes this or not is dealt with before the film closes.Once more made on a shoestring budget the film achieves quality through the performances of several key actors in their roles, recognizable actors by face only but who always turn in great performances. Among those are Ian Abercrombie as the head monk and Vernon Dobtcheff as the one monk who can speak enough languages to handle all situations. Both are faces you will know without knowing where you saw them before.The story here is deeper than most movies made by Empire Studios, Charles Band’s studio at the time and where a number of these Shout/Scream Factory titles are coming from. Having met Band before I can tell you that while his product isn’t always stupendous his love of movies runs deep. Having changed from Empire to Full Moon Studios the outflow of product he has released is hard to believe. Both of these movies offer a decent double feature that you can enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRVF8X4PAIMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX2241C#wasThisHelpful","R1HRVF8X4PAIMI","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Before producer/director Charles Band switched things up by renaming his company Full Moon he had a nice enterprise going with his company Empire Pictures. Band saw what Roger Corman had done by making quick product that went straight to drive-ins across the country. He turned around and did the same thing heading for the direct to VHS market instead. Churning out one movie after another with few name stars to mention in them, he created a business for himself that has lasted to this day.The nice thing that happened with this rapid release of numerous films was that it gave different people a start in the business. It also produced some incredibly well made movies that often entertained and in the early days of video that was a major plus. Not all mom and pop stores could carry 50 copies of the latest Hollywood blockbuster, but they could always pick up a low budget movie for the shelves at less expense. And on occasion, as with GHOST TOWN, they got more than they bargained for, a solid movie with decent story and acting.The movie opens with a convertible driving full speed down a desert highway containing a runaway bride tossing her veil to the wind and laughing. This is Kate (Catherine Hickland) and she’s just left her beau at the altar on another wild adventure. That all changes when her car breaks down on a side road. Things get stranger still when a sand storm heads her way containing an old western outlaw in its midst. As the wind wraps around her she’s swept up in the dust and disappears leaving behind nothing but a car with claw marks in it.Enter Deputy Langley (Franc Luz), a quick draw competition winner and all around nice guy who takes a call from the Sheriff to head out in search of Kate at her last known location. Fortunately nearby he heads over to find her car and the scratch marks. He radios it in and then sees something in the distance. Following this ghostly image he soon finds himself drawn into a similar sandstorm like the one that took Kate. When he gets his bearings he finds himself standing over a long forgotten grave. As he reaches down to clear the tombstone a skeletal hand pops up to grab his and tells him to finish the job. This is the body of an old western sheriff and Langley takes his badge with him while he continues walking.Eventually he ends up in an old ghost town, long ago abandoned. But then he starts seeing things out of the corner of his eye. He hears things as well. It’s not long until he meets some of the inhabitants of the town. Not realizing these are ghosts, he hears the story about what happened in the past. Most of us can put two and two together before he does and we understand that this town is cursed, destined to live under the heel of Devlin (Jimmie F. Skaggs), an outlaw who murdered the sheriff in cold blood while they all stood by.Having taken Kate captive only Langley can save her from a fate worse than death. Kate resembles the long lost love of Devlin’s life. He intends to keep her here with him through eternity. That is unless Langley can put a stop to this whole haunting.The locations are extremely limited, the story simple and yet it all works when brought together for this wonderful little film. Western stereotypes are played for full effect and the acting is far beyond what you would expect in a movie of this budget. Credit goes to the cast, the director and the writers who use a combination of wit, mystery and just a touch of horror to make this movie as fun as it is. I’ve seen big budget films that didn’t offer as much as this one does and that makes it special.Shout/Scream Factory has once more rescued a lost gem and made it available on blu-ray. Extras are nearly non-existent with this but that doesn’t matter. It’s the end product that deserves our full attention here and chances are as unknown as the actors and the rest were at that time there wouldn’t have been much behind the scenes information to gather. Instead have fun with this one. Fans of westerns, of ghost stories and of the inventive nature of low budget film making will be sure to enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BK9TGS2KZ6FA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX220WK#wasThisHelpful","R1BK9TGS2KZ6FA","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.When I first saw information on this movie I wasn’t sure what to expect. It seems like every week a new zombie movie is coming out and for the most part they can’t compare to either George Romero’s classics or the TV series THE WALKING DEAD. But on occasion a rare movie comes out that upends the genre and tosses in something new that makes it exciting all over again. This Australian movie is one of those.The zombie apocalypse breaks out and it appears that the disease is transferred via the air we breathe. Our story flips around from location to location but mainly focuses on family man Barry (Jay Gallagher), a skilled mechanic who rushes his family from their home complete in air masks to avoid the rushing crowds in the streets. His goal is to reach his sister Brooke (Bianca Bradey) in the country where they should be safe.What he doesn’t know is that Brooke has already been exposed but seems to have survived, not just the plague via the air but the attack she faced from her roommates. As if that wasn’t enough to go through Brooke has been captured by a group headed by a mad scientists who is trying to discover where this all began and why some people are naturally immune. How mad? He travels in a semi converted to a mobile lab with several zombies chained inside that he experiments on while dancing to disco music. That kind of mad.As Barry heads out his daughter and wife both succumb to the disease and he has to kill them. Out of bullets he can’t kill himself but just as he tries he comes across another survivor. Their cars can’t run for some reason, apparently the airborne disease affects gas as well, and set out on foot. As they travel Barry’s new friend is shot and killed by Benny (Leon Burchill) who thinks they are zombies. The new duo set out to find help and come to a garage where they meet two more survivors. Like Barry these two are inventors of a sort and between the three of them they soon realize that the gas emitted from the zombies works as fuel.With a car in the yard they battle it out to bring it back in the garage and rig it to run on the gaseous emissions coming from the mouth of the nearest zombie that they captured. Before they can set out to find Barry’s sister one of them becomes a victim of the zombies and now they’re down to three. That’s enough to get them where they need to go but can they make it in time or will the mad scientist use Brooke to find a way to cure everyone or make them all zombies in the process?What this movie offers more than anything is fun. From start to finish the movie will have you laughing while fearing for the characters at the same time. It’s hard to make a scary zombie these days since we’ve seen so many and chances are these zombies won’t cause you to lose sleep. But the movie will entertain you so much that won’t make a difference.One thing that the film makers of this movie decided to do early on was to ladle on the gore. Perhaps ladle isn’t quite the right word. Maybe buckets would be more fitting as the amount of gore and blood flowing in this film would be enough to make a football field turn red. The make up on the zombies is solid and comparable to most in the genre with a few standouts among them. While the CGI blood is found in the film the good old Karo syrup mixture is plentiful as well.For a movie filled with humor the actors do a fantastic job of playing it straight. Each one of them brings something different and the people they are playing all react differently to what is going on. Burchill as Benny garners the most laughs and Gallagher is completely believable as the disturbed husband/father who goes on living to save his sister. Berynn Scwerdt as the mad doctor also does a great job as a threatening presence who is funny at the same time.The movie, as I stated earlier, brings on a fresh new zombie presence and by the end of the film I found myself hoping that a sequel would be the end result. Word is it is coming and that’s a good thing. In the meantime you can enjoy this one with repeat viewings, it’s that good. Shout/Scream Factory has once more found a movie destined to be a classic of horror fans and done it right. The usual behind the scenes extras are included but those won’t be your priority here. The fun will be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHCM4E7L5NOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8ROPM6#wasThisHelpful","R2LHCM4E7L5NOZ","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.It’s difficult to come up with an original horror film icon, a monster or murderous character that can carry a movie from start to finish and filter into the imagination of viewers even after the lights have gone up and the film finished on the screen. The names of Jason, Michael and Freddy bring about those fears with ease to movie fans even though it’s been several years since any have had a major release to theaters. Some of these characters never made it to the big screen but have developed a following on DVD. Names like Victor Crowley from the HATCHET films or Chromeskull from LAID TO REST are well known to horror fans. My hope is that The Drownsman will be added to the lists of those fans.After nearly drowning in a lake, Madison develops a near catatonic fear of water. She soon becomes a shut in, unable to deal with her fear and finding herself on the downside of friendship with girls she’s known for years. In a last ditch effort to break the traumatic fear that keeps her captive an intervention is brought on by those friends where they include having a séance to help alieve those fears.Bad move on their part. It seems that once they do that the long dormant killer known as the Drownsman rises once again. And he intends to add more victims to his list. The killer received the moniker because of his penchant for taking his victims to a hidden location where he would proceed to drown them, not quite all at once but enough to keep them going before finishing them off.As the night and next few days progress, the girls begin to become his newest victims. It doesn’t take a lot for him to appear, just enough water to make his way into their world. Sure, you could see him doing this in something the size of a bathtub but instead he makes his way from his world to ours through things as small as a sink. He reaches through, grabs a girl and pulls her from this world into his, the dimly lighted sub-basement where he kept his victims long ago.As the number of missing girls rises Madison’s decision to face her fears and save her friends takes hold. But will this be enough for her to face down the Drownsman or will he merely add her to his list of victims? And once she enters his world how will she get rid of these ghostly killer? What will it take to rid the world of this evil?The movie offers some truly creepy moments. While the whole séance seems incredibly stupid for anyone to do to someone who has a fear of water and what could be in it, it’s the normal thing that happens in horror films. It’s along the lines of “oh gee, we’re in the woods and we’re teenagers, let’s have sex” type situation. That aside the character of the Drownsman has few lines but does offer an image that is nightmare inducing for some.While definitely a low budget affair the whole package has a well-polished look and the performances are above par for direct to DVD status. Each actor involved makes his or her character seem real and that’s not an easy thing to do in a horror film. The fact that the atmosphere seeps into each setting makes it that much more believable and aids in making their portrayals just as real.There are plenty of horror films on the shelves these days and far too many of them are direct to DVD. Most aren’t worthy of your time but THE DROWNSMAN doesn’t fall into that category. Instead give this one a watch with the lights out and then I dare you to take a bath.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNL4WH6VJC3T1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJH1TEK#wasThisHelpful","RNL4WH6VJC3T1","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Perhaps the phrase lost in translation isn’t quite as applicable here as I would have hoped. It’s not the literal translation of words that made this collection of films unenjoyable for me but the loss of the inspiration to translate into the world of Japan that I’m talking about here. While these films were immensely popular in Japan at the time, I’m guessing that had they played here in the drive-ins where the original biker films of the same time period played people would have wondered what they were watching.Inspired by the popularity of films like Roger Corman’s THE WILD ANGELS, Japanese studios began to make their own version of biker films around the same time. The difference is that the gangs represented here in these films felt more like teen gangs being portrayed by adult actors. Let me change that. These gangs felt more like pre-teens even. Their antics were lame compared to the depravity and violence found in biker films made here in the U.S. If you can accept the difference between the two then perhaps these movies might be up your alley. For me I found them lacking in everything possible.While I may not have enjoyed these films there are two things I will say about them. The first is that yes, there probably are people out there who will be so immersed in the culture that they fall in love with these films. Those people will love that this set is now available. Secondly I realize that there is a need for movies like this to be released in DVD or blu-ray format. Historically speaking any and all films deserve to be placed in safe keeping so they don’t disappear like a number of films that are already lost to the world.With that out of the way, here are the films with a short synopsis of each so you know what is included in this set.DELINQUENT GIRL BOSS – A group of girl bikers takes on the Yakuza after they rig boxing matches that involve a friend of theirs. When the leader of the bikers is taken out, revenge is sought by the rest of the girls.WILD JUMBO – This time a gang of five friends known as the Pelican Gang does little more than drive around in their dune buggies listening to psychedelic music. Eventually they plan a heist of 30 million yen from a religious movement.SEX HUNTER – This time around a girl gang takes on a racist male gang. Both seem to find time to do little more than fight and listen to rock n roll. The racist gang takes particular disliking to what they term half breeds and after hurting a friend of the girl gang a major battle is on the way.MACHINE ANIMAL – This time a girl gang called the Alleycats are on friendly terms with another gang called Dragon, the main supplier of drugs in their town. When the Alleycats attempt to help three guys including an American soldier on the run, Dragon isn’t pleased with their efforts and an eventual showdown is bound to happen.BEAT ’71 – This time around the Alleycats have become hippies and live in a commune. When the main girl’s boyfriend, the son of a Yakuza boss, fails to meet his father’s expectations his father kidnaps him to set him straight.While these descriptions of the movies included might sound simple the fact is that the movie themselves feel just as simple. More time is spent driving around, dancing to music, laying around wasted or just fighting at the drop of a hat to fill the time of each movie. And while they are termed violent movies while watching I felt like there was more violence on TV at the time than I found in any of these movies.For the most part I found myself bored while watching. I kept waiting for something to happen. I wanted to love these movies having heard they were such a part of the culture at the time and yet I could never quite get into any of them. But that’s me. As I’ve said all along I have little doubt that there are some out there who will love these movies and cherish them. I’m happy for you. But I’m not part of that crowd.Arrow Video has done a great deal by releasing these five films as a set for fans to enjoy. The set includes all five movies in the series as well as interviews with star Tatsuya Fuji who was in all 5 films, an interview with Yoshio Harada who was in BEAT ’71, trailers and an interview with the director of three of the films, Yasuharu Hasebe. As I’ve discovered with all Arrow Video releases they are made by fans for fans and should please anyone seeking these films.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352E42NE4NYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMFS266#wasThisHelpful","R352E42NE4NYC","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"YOUNG GOTHAM SAMPLER 2015What we have here is a collection of first issues from various comics series all revolving around Gotham characters. There are three on hand to sample and see if you like, thus getting you to venture forth and purchase either the old issues on their own or perhaps the collected first volumes of each. Here’s a breakdown of the three:GRAYSON VOL. 1: AGENTS OF SPYRALDick Grayson, former Robin and former Nightwing, has apparently joined a secret organization known as Spyral. Just what they’re up to isn’t quite clear but his first adventure has him dropping into the kidnapping of a Russian who seems to have some sort of power. Unfortunately for Grayson there are two other groups trying to take out the same target, one of which is being led by Midnighter from the Wildstorm series THE AUTHORITY. By the end of this issue we get a small glimpse of who is behind Sypral but not quite what they’re all about. It is enough to whet your whistle though. The artwork is well done, the story solid and it might make this one worth looking into.BATGIRL VOL. 1: THE BATGIRL OF BURNSIDEA new series involving Batgirl, out on her own, trying to fit in with everyone else and talking non-stop. No seriously, she talks non-stop. I had a difficult time even trying to read this one. It seemed that word balloons were filling the pages over artwork that for me just wasn’t up to the style that I enjoy. This is not to say that some won’t find this fulfilling and enjoyable but for me it was substandard to what I’ve come to expect from DC. And in all honesty the biggest problem lied in the overuse of words, words and more words filling each and every page.GOTHAM ACADEMY VOL. 1: WELCOME TO GOTHAM ACADEMYSo here we come to a problem. I have no idea who the main character is. From reading start to finish you get the impression she’s someone going to this preppy school based on a scholarship that she’s received from Bruce Wayne. As to who she is or what she’s doing there, no clue. But as the story unfolds you discover that she’s been there a year and her past friends now going there feel that she’s changed. Still she manages to accomplish feats most of us wouldn’t be able to when it comes to helping her friends. The artwork on this one is solid, in the style of comics drawn for kids that reminds me of a number of steampunk comics I read some time back.On the whole this volume is a good way to expose kids to three different comics in one volume. Is it worth the price? Myself I’d much rather pick up the actual comics and decide from there than go this route. The fact that only 2/3 of what I saw would get me to buy any of these comics may account for my thoughts on the matter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLXLCE5IT8VA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNZ5ZLW#wasThisHelpful","RLXLCE5IT8VA1","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leave it to SyFy to offer some of the most laughable science fiction or horror films that have made it to the screen in decades. Not since the drive-in fair offered by AIP in their heyday has a group made so many movies this bad. Perhaps bad is not quite the right word since these movies do offer some entertainment value. But much like the hubcap flying saucers of old SyFy’s CGI heavy effects filled movies leave you laughing at all the wrong times.This time around we have a meteor that crashes here on Earth splitting into two pieces in a small mountain town. Among the citizens there are the town handyman and the mega-business owner who isn’t fond of said handyman, especially since his son is interested in his daughter. As the town begins their annual Christmas celebration on main street, one part of the split meteor begins showering the city with shards of frozen meteor causing the freeze to rapidly spread through the streets. Touch it and you’re instantly frozen.As the terrain begins to flash freeze the citizens do their best to escape to safer locations. The second half of the meteor is more tropical and the only way to solve this problem is to join the two pieces, not a likely prospect since they’re miles apart. Someone please save the day!The funniest moments in this movie are the least intended. An example is someone crushed by a flying piece of frozen meteor that sends out a splash of CGI blood or a person frozen who then crumbles due to the extreme cold. There are side stories and people sacrifice themselves for the greater good while others who act like idiots are frozen, bringing on cheers from anyone watching.So in the end is this a movie worth watching? Heck yeah! It’s a no brainer! I don’t mean that as in the choice is a no brainer, I mean that as in the movie itself is a no brainer. There is nothing exceptional about this movie and that is why I say it’s like many of the old drive-in second features that played across the country so many years ago. It’s fun and hokey and just something that’s worth watching for a laugh. Maybe it’s not worth adding to your collection but you could have some fun with it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GIWWGRUKXLDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5DYU9U#wasThisHelpful","R2GIWWGRUKXLDL","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Sean Penn has been known to perform extremely well in many dramatic roles he’s had over the years. But little is said of the action films he’s made which is odd since his first notable roles was in BAD BOYS where he played a young troublemaker trying to stay alive in juvenile hall. That all could change with his latest film THE GUNMAN.Penn plays Terrier, a hired mercenary for a global company with interests in the Congo. Part of a team, their latest target involves a man the company has paid influence money to. Rather than trust him they decide to take him out and Penn is the man assigned. This means that not only will he be required to kill this man he will also have to leave behind the love of his life, Annie (Jasmine Trinker), since a killer never stays once the hit is carried out.Years go by and Terrier has returned to Africa, this time to actually do what his cover claimed years prior. Helping smaller towns to dig wells and solve their water problems during one drilling expedition a group of soldiers show not randomly but specifically seeking Terrier. In the course of events he defends himself stunning the locals he’s been helping by taking out the group of soldiers and his cover is blown. The question is why were they there searching specifically for him?Terrier leaves the country and seeks out and old ally, Cox (Mark Rylance), who sets him on a path to connect with Felix (Javier Bardem), one of the men from his group. Felix is now married to Annie having been in love with her prior to  ‘s leaving years ago. The pair do not have the happy life that he had wished for and with Penn back in the picture things get even rockier. Invited to their villa in the country a drunk Felix argues back and forth with Penn eventually revealing, as Penn has already guessed, that he’s called in troops to take him out. What he doesn’t realize is that this is a total cleansing and everyone from the old team is being taken out one at a time.Barely escaping, Annie in tow, Terrier heads for help. But who can he now trust? Who is behind all of these murders? And can he stop them from killing both him and before it all ends?This is a nice thriller that holds your interest from one minute to the next. Penn does a fantastic job of playing the ill-fated assassin who has tried to make up for his past mistakes only to have them follow him to the present. Sadly Bardem is wasted here playing the love smitten puppy who thinks he can win the woman simply by eliminating his rival. His was the order that sent Penn out to kill all those years ago. But his character here is limited too little more than looking jealous and getting drunk.The movie is well made, the cinematography stunning to watch be it the streets of London or in the wilds of the Congo. Even the night scenes, some of the most difficult to film for some, come out easy to see and not get lost in the shadows. Director Pierre Morel adds another top notch action movie to his list of accomplishments which include the first TAKEN, DISTRICT B13 and FROM PARIS WITH LOVE. With the way his movies have turned out so far he’s a name I know I’ll be looking for in the future, expecting some great action films under his name.Perhaps the only odd thing about this movie is the juxtaposition between the actions of the lead character and his crew and the real life opinions of Penn. A staunch anti-gun advocate he joins the already long list of actors who portray gun toting men of action in their films while demanding gun ownership be restricted or banned altogether. But then again this is Hollywood, the land that calls for clean air action while creating more explosions than most other businesses in the world.Truth be told it doesn’t matter. As a movie goers I’ll continue to watch the movies that these folks make and enjoy each and every one of them. The end product here is a watchable movie that entertains and thrills from start to finish. Penn does a good job and I look forward to seeing him in more roles like this. Add this movie to your list of those worth renting and watching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMZUQIQOWYDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXU96GK#wasThisHelpful","RWMZUQIQOWYDQ","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.While I wouldn’t say I’m a die-hard fan of Lee Van Cleef he’s always been an actor that if I saw one of his movies playing on TV I’d make an effort to stop and watch it. He seemed to me to be one of those actors that always carried off whatever role he was playing with ease. So when I saw he had a starring role in DAY OF ANGER I couldn’t believe that I’d not only never seen the film but had never even heard of it. And after watching it I was even more surprised seeing how good a movie it was. Why doesn’t this one get as much attention as the films of Sergio Leone?Here again we have a movie you won’t find at imdb.com under this title. Instead try GUNLAW. The movie opens in Clifton, AZ, with young Scott (Giuliano Gemma) making his daily rounds, picking up buckets of human waste and emptying them into his wagon barrels to be dumped at the stable where he works. Scott is the town bastard, the son of a prostitute mother and unknown father, who is treated poorly by everyone he knows from the local bar owner to the judge. Scott Ekes out a living under the watchful eye of stable master Murph, the only person who treats him well other than the owner of the local brothel. Murph taught him how to draw a pistol even though the only thing he has is a wooden one.Into town rides Talby (Van Cleef). Well dressed and well-armed it’s apparent that he’s a gunslinger. Talby impresses the young man who he immediately takes a liking to. After Scott takes his horse to the stable, Talby asks him to join him for a drink. Of course the locals aren’t happy with this due to their opinion of Scott. When they get in the middle of things a gunfight follows with Talby the man left alive. A quick trial finds him innocent and he heads out of town with Scott tagging along.As they travel to the next town Talby takes Scott under his wing, giving him a series of lessons on survival. These include everything from how to handle a weapon to not trusting anyone. All of these lessons will come into play before the end of the film.In the next town Talby confronts a man about a debt he is owed. It seems that for 10 years Talby has waited for the man to be released from prison after the man lost the money he took from a robbery they did together. When the man explains that the folks of Clifton took the money and framed the man to go to prison. The judge, bar owner, barber and banker were all in on it. With that information Talby sets out to return to Clifton but not before the man draws on him and dies in the street.Before heading back Talby and Scott visit another town where they pick up a sidearm for Scott. Choosing along barreled pistol Scott is thrilled. On their way back to Clifton Talby continues to train Scott on how to use his weapon. Surprisingly Scott turns out to not only be quick on the draw but an accurate shot as well.The two ride into town and Talby begins with the banker, letting him know why he’s there and taking a small payment to begin with. From there he finagles a part ownership in the local saloon. When someone tries to keep him from moving forward with his plans a gunfight follows and Scott begins to become the enforcer for Talby. It’s his chance to repay the fine folks of Clifton for their treatment of him over the years.But plans never turn out quite like those who formulate them would like them to. Talby becomes more and more a presence in the town, pushing things to limits that even Scott isn’t pleased with. Murph warns Scott that Talby is only using him because he’s aging and an eventual faceoff between the two will be the end result. Just who walks away and with what is the question.The movie has a wonderful story that unravels and reveals so much of the town’s past and those who live there. While it may seem like I’ve provided too much the truth is there is more to these people than what I’ve written. Those are the juicy parts of the film that make the writing of this movie so good. It’s not a surprise to learn then that the director and writer of this film later went on to make MY NAME IS NOBODY, a movie I consider to be a crown jewel of the spaghetti western genre.The acting here is smooth for all involved. There was a question about Gemma playing the part of Scott since he was 30 at the time and the role called for a much younger actor. But he does a great job. Of course Van Cleef does his utmost best here in the role of Talby. His character starts off as a well-intentioned guide for a young man only to be revealed as the killer he is before the end of the film.Arrow Video has done an amazing job with this release. The picture quality is stunning to look at, restored from a 35mm Techniscope camera negative. Extras include interviews with both the director and writer of the screenplay. On top of this the movie is offered in three versions: a shortened English version, the longer Italian version and that last version dubbed in English as well. After watching this I’m sold on the quality that Arrow Video has to offer. While I’ve never been a fan of most extras on movies, they provide just enough to add to the feature without making the extras more than the movie (unlike newer movies that seem to provide 4 hours of extras for a 90 minute feature). I read someone reply to their releases as Criterion worthy and I would have to agree. The biggest difference though is that Arrow seems to make their releases more affordable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R62OPQDUP944R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDT5P24#wasThisHelpful","R62OPQDUP944R","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.So many movies involving classic monsters have been made over the years and many in the past few. For me not a lot of these have stood out. When it came to werewolves I’ve always been a fan. The original THE WOLF MAN with Lon Chaney Jr. used to terrify me as a child. I enjoyed AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON but thought THE HOWLING was a much better movie. So when I heard a movie involving werewolves and soldiers was coming out back in 2002 I was ready. Except that it never played here. But once it hit video I watched and fell in love with the movie. So when I heard that Shout/Scream Factory was going to release a special edition I was set to watch it and love it once more. I wasn’t disappointed.The movie starts with a soldier named Cooper (Kevin McKidd) trying out for the elite squad only to fail his final tests. Several months later his regular platoon is sent to the Highlands of Scotland on a training exercise. No live ammo to be had and wandering through the woods, they come across the remains of the Special Ops group that Cooper failed to join, the sole survivor of the group being their leader Capt. Ryan (Liam Cunningham). As Cooper’s commander Sgt. Wells (Sean Pertwee) regroups his men and takes the weapons and ammo from the fallen soldiers, the group is set upon by the same attackers and do their best to escape.Unwilling to admit to what they saw, some wounded, they make their way to a nearby road and run into a jeep driving by which they stop. Driven by a woman named Megan (Emma Cleasby), they commandeer the car, tell her to move and try to find some place safe for the moment. Megan tells them there is a farm nearby and they head there knowing they won’t make it to the nearest town that night.As they set themselves up in the farmhouse to defend against whatever it was that attacked them they do triage on the injured members of the group included Sgt. Wells. Cooper takes over and in talking with Megan and in looking over the farmhouse, the group realizes that what attacked them, what they saw, was a pack of werewolves. Megan has been in the area looking for information about this pack as well as proof that they exist. The run in is all the proof theses soldiers need and now they’re in a battle for their lives. If they can make it through the night to morning then perhaps they can find a way to the nearest town. If not, they’ll be dinner.While this may sound like a simple plot there are several subplots I won’t dare reveal because in just knowing what they are you’ll have time to figure out the possibilities they present. I will say that one person wounded by these werewolves suddenly begins to heal faster than one would expect. I’ll leave it to you as to why that would be.Not only is this movie one of the most original treatments of werewolves I’ve ever seen, every pulse pounding moment on screen makes you sit on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Add to that some of the best looking werewolves to be seen on screen and you have a movie that is well worth not just watching but adding to your collection as well. And make note that these are not CGI created werewolves at all but practical effects werewolves, men in costumes with effects people on hand to help them along that make them all the more real looking. This in turn makes them some of the more frightening werewolves seen on screen in years.Included in the extras is a making of featurette, a look behinds the models of the sets, a theatrical trailer, still galleries, audio commentary from director Neil Marshall and a short film Marshall made prior called COMBAT. If that wasn’t enough the transfer to blu-ray was supervised by Marshall himself so this becomes a stunning copy that fans and collectors will find a must have to their collection.I can’t recommend this movie and this version enough. It is an amazing horror film that needs more recognition than it has received to date. Make sure you pick up a copy today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I9MXQ7HWWQXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB6N6PY#wasThisHelpful","R3I9MXQ7HWWQXH","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Good science fiction takes a what if story and makes it interesting. Great science fiction takes the same idea and makes it not only seem plausible but presents the result of the story as well. The right combination of science, storytelling and terror makes for some of the most interesting science fiction put on film, ALIEN being a prime example. Now we have EX MACHINA.The story revolves around three main characters. Caleb (Domhnall Gleason) is a code writer for a hugely successful search engine company. He wins a contest going on to select a single individual who will work with the creator of the company, a scientific genius who is also a bit of a recluse and working on his next project. Nathan (Oscar Isaac) is that inventor and he takes on the mad scientist role in this film.Our third character gets her place in the mix thanks to Nathan. It seems that Nathan has been working on creating a pure A.I. (Artificial Intelligence). A definition for A.I. is “The ability of a computer or other machine to perform actions thought to require intelligence.” In essence it’s making a machine or computer able to think on its own without requiring its creator to input everything into it. Nathan thinks he has done just this and has brought Caleb to a remote retreat in the forest to see if he has accomplished this with Ava (Alicia Vikander), a robot he has created.Ava is unlike most robots. Rather than a metal construct alone she is an amalgamation of things we’ve seen in the past. Her body resembles the structure of a human being but is made up of wires and metal surrounded by a clear plastic. Her face and portions of her head have been made to resemble and attractive woman, allowing her not just the look of a human but the ability to express emotion should she/it so choose. What Nathan suggest is that Caleb spend time interviewing and observing Ava to see if she truly possesses artificial intelligence or if she is merely just another machine.All of the interaction between Caleb and Ava is being monitored and watched by Nathan via cameras located throughout the house. Their discussions and back and forth give him an opportunity to observe Ava and learn more as well as to determine the goal he set forth for Caleb. But there is a glitch in the power system of the house that shuts down and reboots periodically. During one of these short blackouts Ava leans forward and tells Caleb that he should not trust Nathan, that he has a different intent for them both. Before he can ask for more information the power comes back on.This sets up a strange dynamic between characters as Caleb isn’t quite sure who to trust and what is actually going on here. Nathan, prone to seemed megalomania and short bursts of anger, has a tendency to drink too much and seem less and less like someone of genius. At the same time having created Ava it makes it difficult to believe he doesn’t possess just that. But has he come unhinged living out here in the middle of nowhere with no company except for Ava and an oriental servant who speaks no English named Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno)? Is something else going on here that Caleb needs to be aware of?Toss into the mix the emotions that Caleb begins to feel for Ava. A stereotypical nerd with no girlfriend and no family back home, he begins to grow attached to the robot. With her ability to display emotions and if she does indeed have the ability to think on her own, the question comes to mind, just who is manipulating whom? Is Nathan truly insane or is Ava the one in charge of it all?The movie does a great job of combining the odd mixture of science possibility, emotional turmoil and suspense that results in a movie that is both interesting complex at the same time. The one thing that might bother some is the slow boil that the movie uses to establish all that is going on behind the scenes. Secrets that creep up in the mind aren’t presented with solutions until the last 20 minutes or so. Some will find it incredibly boring to get to that point but all of the information gained from that slow moving first part of the film is necessary to understand what happens after.The performances are done well but nothing outlandishly outstanding either. Gleason does a fine job seeming perplexed while Isaac’s seemingly mad doctor rants coupled with alcoholic stupor result in presenting what could be the most dangerous person in the room. Vikander has the most difficult part and does well presenting a robot that displays few emotions via visuals but does so in her mannerisms and communication skills.The ending of the film presents a well thought out solutions to the entire movie and doesn’t lack for shock value and surprise. It leaves you thinking about the dangers of A.I. as well as the possibilities. Rather than question the attempts of man to act as God the movie instead focuses on the reaction of creation towards creator. In so doing you have a movie that offers one of the better science fiction outings in some time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJ1D1WW5ETCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI057M0#wasThisHelpful","R1JJ1D1WW5ETCI","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.Whether you enjoy the various types of music in this series of documentaries from director Penelope Spheeris or not, you have to admit that she did a tremendous job creating all three of these films. Where most new documentary film makers feel the need to slant things one direction or to add to their films overly scripted moments, Spheeris took on the topic of the world of changing music head on filming interviews and concert sequences that showed what it was all about without adding things to it. Why she never received an Oscar for this while others less qualified did is beyond me.This package collects all three of the movies that Spheeris did, all focusing on the music scene in LA and how much it changes through the years. That wasn’t the original goal but it’s turned out that way. The first film focuses on punk rock, the second heavy metal and the final film on a new form of punk music. All three are completely different films as well with the first mostly raw, the second a tad polished and the third a sad look at how things have become. Here are my takes on each part of this set.PART 1: THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATIONIn this opening film Spheeris takes a look at the rising punk rock scene that was in the midst of changing at that time. Having begun much earlier in the mid-seventies this movie was made in 1981 as things were beginning to slow down for the punk rockers. This is not to say the form died off completely but it did ease out of its original popularity.Punk rock was a more back to the roots style of music coming after a decade or overly produced music that ranged from studio created legends like Steely Dan and Pink Floyd to the entire genre of disco. In response to that kids began going back to basics, playing instruments in their garages and churning out fast tempoed, gut wrenching music with lyrics that harkened back to early rock which cried out about social injustice and my generation.Spheeris chose the LA scene because it was still going fairly strong then. The movie intercuts interviews with some of the big names at the time (X, The Circle Jerks, Fear, Black Flag, etc.), concert footage of these bands and interviews with fans of the genre. All are interesting to watch as the bands seem more inclined to care about the message they are trying to get out than they are about fame and fortune. Sure, most of their lyrics are undecipherable but they are dedicated to that above all. Some come off as truly inspired, others as delinquents with no discernable talent riding the wave of popularity of the style.The interviews with the followers seem funny to watch now. These counter culture warriors wear their piercings, tattoos and oddly shave hair styles as a way of showing they are different while looking all alike at the same time, much like the hippies of the 60s who claimed individuality while looking alike. The kids here all have that look of molly coddled suburbanites who want to revolt against mom and dad who later went on to become corporate CEOs and lawyers. It would be interesting to find out just what happened to many of them.What makes the movie interesting is its unbiased look at the whole scene. Some things are worth keeping, others not, but in the end the music lasted while the majority of followers petered out. I have no doubt some still listen to the music as they did before but instead of scratched records they’re downloading mp3s of the old stuff. It’s a great documentary that focuses on the reality rather than the manufactured.PART 2: THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION – THE METAL YEARSThis film doesn’t feel near as raw as the first one but then again Spheeris now had several movies under her belt and I have little doubt learned along the way. Released in 1988 the LA scene had changed in the 7 years since the first film. Instead of punk music, metal was making its way into the scene. And unlike most punk music there were various forms of metal from the hard core stuff to the hair bands that seemed to run rampant about this time. All are given time to be represented here.The first thing you notice in this film is the set pieces that become part and parcel of the film. Interviews are no longer relegated to the dirty, tiny apartments where the performers live but in concert venues and studios where things are more controlled. Portions with Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of KISS are definitely less raw and more staged. Other bands interviewed like Faster Pussycat and Poison are here as well as individuals like Lemmy, Ozzy and Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. All have something to say about their musical genre which started nearly 20 years prior to the time this film was made.It was the hair bands that brought things to the attention of most though. Not surprisingly most have disappeared or are touring together in retro concert packages now. The music was fun but not involved with social issues so much as what most rockers sang about decades earlier, girls and how to get them. The bands are more in tune with decadence, overindulging in drink and drugs and bedding any and every female they meet instead of what will become of the world. It was throw away music meant for fun times and less social conscience. Times had definitely changed.Fans were different too in some ways. Sure these seem like the same suburban kids out to rock mom and dad’s world but they’re more up front about it. Where most of the punk kids seemed to be infatuated with the violent nature of the musical style the metal kids were more into the make-up, hairstyles and clothes being worn. And the bands were more concerned with making it big, making it to the top, even if their antics did everything to bring them right back down.In the extras Spheeris talks about how she moved from these films to more mainstream major studio fare in part due to this film. Having worked with metal musicians she was picked to helm WAYNE’S WORLD and from there went on to do movies like THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, THE LITTLE RASCALS and BLACK SHEEP. She later had a revelation and thought why am I making things I have no interest in which made her go forward with the third film in the series.PART 3: THE DECLINE AND FALL OF CIVILIZATION PART IIIThis film is completely different from the previous two in that it focuses less on the bands and more on the fans. These fans are a sad lot and that makes this chapter in the series the most depressing of the lot. It was difficult to watch and see the hopelessness on display here. The new punk is known as gutter punk, named so because that’s where most of the fans live.Yes, there are interviews and performance footage on display here. But these bands all seem like caricatures of the original punk rock movement rather than the actual thing. It feels like art school dropouts who felt that this could become their performance art and they could bring awareness of social issues out once more all while having actual talent or sitting in crappy rooms not because they have to but because they choose to. All felt like they had a backup plan in case things didn’t work out, something the original punk rockers didn’t have. These groups felt more like they were taking issues that someone directed them towards rather than experiencing. The reality of their music felt less real.The fans though had become much more hardcore and much different than before. These fans were living in the streets, leftovers from broken homes or abusive homes with nowhere to go. Instead they lived in gutters and abandoned houses or raised enough money each month for rent on terrible digs and beer. They have no hope. For them changing the future isn’t an option as it was with the original punk rockers. Instead these fans all see themselves dead within 10 years of appearing in this film. They make a living panhandling or stealing things to be sold. Month to month, day to day is how they live. But once again each one makes the decision to wear their freak flag high as the old saying went. Spiked hair, colored hair, piercings and tattoos are the norm. Where they find the money for hair spray or body alterations is beyond me since most couldn’t afford to live in decent housing. Before the film was released at least one of these kids dies in an accidental fire and the expectancies of the rest don’t seem any higher.At the end of the film addresses and web sites to help the abused and homeless kids of LA are placed on the screen and it is suggested that people do what they can to help. The sadness of their situations, the stories that they tell will tear at your heart. At the same time you wonder if donating money to their cause will help them or do little more than prolong their misery. One can only hope that it provides them the opportunities to leave behind the lives they’re leading now and move forward.For fans of any and all films this is a must have collection to own. Not only are you provided with all three feature films you get tons of extras in each movie. On top of that is another disc with all sorts of extras as well. AND you get a booklet that talks about each movie. It is an amazing collection and one that should receive all sorts of accolades and awards that the industry hands out for such things. Shout Factory has done an amazing job with this set from the packaging to the transfers of the films to the items included on the discs. It is a set of films that music fans should make a point of not only watching but holding on to, a historical look at the music that made up the lives of those in each time period from 1981 through 1998. One can only hope that Spheeris is set up to do another film in the series just to find out what’s happened in the 17 years since the last one was made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JMG8T53LJPJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V02H564#wasThisHelpful","R1JMG8T53LJPJK","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.One of the great things about the invention of video and now DVDs is that movie fans can be exposed to so much more than they ever thought possible. Movies that we loved and adored while growing up can now become part of our collections. On an international level we now have the opportunity to watch movies from foreign countries that we might never have heard of or been exposed to otherwise. In some cases that’s not always a good thing but when a great movie comes your way it makes it a joy to watch.That was the case when I sat down to watch MASSACRE GUN. This Japanese film made in 1967 comes to us from Arrow Video in a pristine blu-ray release that’s a joy to watch. The movie opens with a hitman for a local crime lord who is ordered to kill the love of his life. He follows orders but then decides he’s had enough and quits his criminal ways. But one does not make a decision like that without suffering the consequences.Not long after he begins having problems at the club he owns. When his younger brother, an up and coming boxer, decides to follow suit, the boss has his men break his hands ending his boxing career. Enough is enough and the hitman along with his two other brothers decide to take on the boss head on, hitting several of his businesses and telling them they now answer to them. Unwilling to go down without a fight the battle is on between these two factions.Along with this battle is the fact that the boss’ right hand man is the hitman’s long time best friend. Eventually the two will have to face off at some point. Just who will win, who will be loyal to which organization and what will be the end isn’t revealed until the last moments of the film.Shot in glorious black and white the movie makes the best use of light and shadow seen in some time. While the film is in Japanese with subtitles the acting doesn’t lose a thing in the process. Anyone who doesn’t take the time to give this one a watch if you have it available is losing out on a solid movie from Japan that deserves to be seen.Arrow Video again delivers a great edition of the film as well as several interesting extras. Included in those are an interview with star Jo Shishido, an interview with critic/historian Tony Rayns, the theatrical trailer, a gallery of images and a booklet on the film. Give this one a watch, you won’t be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IRITA4FQRU50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA7UGFO#wasThisHelpful","R1IRITA4FQRU50","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.I have a distinct dislike for pretentious art films that come down the line. This is not to say that there aren’t what are considered art films that aren’t worthy and great movies. But among the many films released that fall into this category are movies created by directors or writers that critics fawn over who follow up with films that are so aimed at that market that creative life is drained from the movie being made. In an attempt to follow up to the movie that critics loved they make something aimed at more acceptance from that crowd than from the rest of the world.Director Noah Baumbach was praised non-stop for his film THE SQUID AND THE WHALE back in 2005. In 2012 he had another critical smash with the film FRANCES HA. Neither did great at the box office but critics heaped praise upon his work as the next best thing since sliced bread. Now he brings to us WHILE WE’RE YOUNG starring Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts.The film revolves around this couple, getting older and faced with friends who are caught up in the world of their children instead of the free spirited lifestyle they once had. Josh (Stiller) is a documentary film maker who has been working on the follow up to his first successful venture for the past 10 years. Cornelia (Watts) is his wife, the daughter of his mentor and one of the most praised documentary film makers to ever live, Leslie Breitbart (Charles Grodin). The pair is having problems dealing with the fact that they’ve reached middle age and their lives are not taking the same direction as their friends.Then Josh meets Jamie (Adam Driver) and his girlfriend Darby (Amanda Seyfried) when they sit in on one of the classes he teaches on documentary film making. Telling Josh how much he’s always admired him and looked up to his first major success, Jamie works his way into the world of this couple taking Darby along with him. As things progress both Josh and Cornelia find themselves enchanted by this young couple and begin spending more time with them than they do the friends their own age.This lends itself to the small amount of humor found in the film (and in most of the trailers for it). Included are scenes of Josh trying to ride a bike with Jamie only to pull a muscle in his back and Cornelia taking an exercise class with Darby that has he dancing to foul language filled hip hop music where the class is filled with young people doing dance moves they know and she attempts to follow. Funny enough but not a knee slapper.As the movie progresses Jamie tells Josh about a movie that he’s trying to make as well, using a slender proposition on which he hopes to discover a greater movie. Josh agrees to help taking no credit and soon the ball gets rolling. A movie about seeking out long lost friends from his past via Facebook leads Jamie to rediscover a friend who was traumatized during the war in Afghanistan. Moments that Josh helps film hold high drama in real life situations. Or do they?I for one figured out what was going on here while the movie unfolded but as it plays out the truth of the matter isn’t revealed until late in the film. I won’t say what that is as to avoid spoiling it for anyone interested in watching but the revelation comes extremely late and ends with a confrontational scene that unfolds in the last 10-15 minutes of the film. It gives the movie a sort of let’s get this rounded up atmosphere that feels forced rather than a natural progression of events. It also paints a picture of this middle aged couple as complete idiots who have no idea of what goes on around them.That being the case it made it difficult for me to feel for anyone in the movie. For Josh and Cornelia I felt like they were idiots who deserved what they got for behaving the way they did. For Jamie and Darby it made me feel like they were pathetic users only interested in themselves. The one person I felt for was myself for having sat through all 97 minutes of this movie only to have that abrupt ending tossed at me.I will say that the performances of both Stiller and Watts were up to par with the best of their work. I’ve come to respect Stiller over the years, watching him progress from the mildly comedic outings he began with into a dynamite actor. Watts felt like she had less of a part than his which I felt should have been equal but that’s just my opinion. Driver is an up and coming star in the world today but I feel like he has yet to show me something that deserves that attention. I guess we’ll see when the new STAR WARS movie comes out he has a major role in. And Seyfried feels completely wasted here, more a set decoration than someone with a major role.As I said, art films offer some of the most fantastic stories to come out these days, bypassing formulaic films and creating something fantastic at times. But when done like this they don’t raise the bar but lower it. I won’t say that I hate this movie, that is far too strong a term. I will say that I found it amusing at times but ended up feeling as if I was betrayed as a movie goer by the end. I’m sure some will enjoy it, some will praise it simply because of the director involved and others like me will be disappointed. In the end it’s a matter of personal opinion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMZ75K55XF1WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJJ5OK0#wasThisHelpful","RMZ75K55XF1WL","A2DAHERP7HYJGO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DAHERP7HYJGO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Is there anything in this world more boring to a pre-teen than spirituality? Well besides chores, homework and vegetables that is. It's bad enough to have to read about such subjects as; beliefs, traditions and rituals, and that's actually the easy stuff to grasp. At least those are things that are learned through memorization and repetition, two of the simpler and more frequently utilized teaching methodologies. However without the glue that holds them together what real use are they? The glue is `Faith' and faith only comes as a by-product of personal experience. The task of finding faith is Gods' invitation to partake in a wondrous adventure of self-discovery by learning how to discern the presence of the sacred within the mundane. It's not so easy a task. How do you know where to look or what to look for? You don't, but you continue investigating anyway until faith eventually finds you. A dichotomy to be sure, but it's nevertheless true.In `Diary Blog of the Fickle Finders: Investigates-The Other F Word' author, comic book illustrator, talk show host and occupational therapist Heidi Hollis has written and illustrated a fictional tale 256 page in length with 180 + images dealing with the subject matter of faith and the process of spiritual formation for pre-teens ranging from ages 7 and up. Taking full advantage of her trademark humor and quirky perspective the young reader will enjoy Heidi's storytelling style as they follow the exploits and thought processes of twelve year old Nina and her best friend Joe.Synopsis: Just days before attending their first catechism class our intrepid duo take on the task of figuring out what is faith, is it fickle* and whether or not they already possess it. Accompanied by Nina's miracle dog Alien our amateur sleuths romp about the neighborhood looking for clues that just might reveal the elusive and mysterious nature of faith. Even after a long day of field research the day's work isn't done until all the findings of their investigation are rigorously recorded on their secret society blog site ""The Fickle Finders"". Of course you probably already knew that since you are a subscriber, aren't you? With this kind of work ethic surely success will be their ultimate reward!Come and join `The Fickle Finders' secret society and add a few of your own observations to the internet diary blog, or maybe just meet them at the Bat Tree (yes I said tree) for a little upside down brainstorming. Finding Faith is definitely a daunting mission but the clues are all around and generally awaiting discovery in the most unexpected of places.*Fickle: changing frequently, especially as regards to one's beliefs, loyalties, interests, or affections.P.S.: If you happen to run into the prayer gnome please say hello for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEMGLSP96JTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983040176#wasThisHelpful","RHEMGLSP96JTX","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nobody approaches the topic of paranormal phenomena quite like Heidi Hollis. In a way she embodies everything you would not expect to find in a paranormal investigator.  She's a jokester, a rebel, a reluctant warrior and a basket case. In other words, she's just like everyone else; a stranger in a strange land trying to make sense of it all. Heidi makes no attempt whatsoever to appear scholarly or scientific, her goal is not to impress. Even when discussing the most serious of spiritual matters she never passes on an opportunity to interject a heavy dose of levity.  She's long since come to the conclusion that when you have to choose between laughing and crying go with the laugh.However even a Merry Mirth Maker like Heidi has moments when she has to deal with the dark stuff. Such is the nature of her newest book `The Hat Man: The True Story of Evil Encounters'. The author has for the most part set aside the usual menagerie of otherworldly characters to narrow her focus and concentrate on a particularly nasty humanoid shaped creature dressed in a long black trench coat, three-piece suit, white collared shirt and a flat rimmed gaucho hat. He has become known as the Hat Man, a name Heidi personally bestowed upon the entity in 1999 and that title has since found its way into the contemporary paranormal lexicon.In her own highly personal conversational style of writing Heidi invites you into her world once again to follow the investigative process as it evolves from the highly implausible to the possible. Through the sharing of her own experiences, those of friends and associates and a carefully selected collection of e-mails containing encounter experiences received from the populace-at-large, Heidi explores and postulates the unthinkable. As you delve deeper and deeper into the darkness that is the Hat Man you will eventually come to the realization that this is not a book Heidi wanted to write. It was an obligation that needed to be fulfilled.So what or who is the Hat Man and why are so many people encountering him? Is he a ghost, a disembodied spirit, an extraterrestrial, an elemental, a djinn, or maybe even a demon? It's a deadly serious question that desperately needs to be answered.  Join Heidi in sifting through the material contained within `The Hat Man: The True Story of Evil Encounters' and come to your own conclusion. If you find yourself in agreement with her follow the expert advice provided in chapter 15; it comes from a person who knows what they're talking about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTVH025FMMOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAP8Z9S#wasThisHelpful","RSTVH025FMMOW","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Watched the film 'Noah' yesterday. It definitely took me by surprise in that it relied more on the Book of Enoch and other apocryphal material rather than the orthodox Biblical text. Unfortunately, despite this highly original script the end product turned out to be a case of a great concept remaining unrealized. This is particularly true in the representation of the Watchers (fallen angels). Instead of making them appear awesome and terrifying they look almost comical; something in-between the 'Transformers' and the rock monster in 'Galaxy Quest'. Too bad, could have been something special.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26LHGHPSE2F00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBGWP3Y#wasThisHelpful","R26LHGHPSE2F00","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who's ever heard Heidi Hollis speak, whether in person or on the radio, is all too familiar with her catch phrase inserted towards the end of her opening remarks, ""been there and done that"". You might have initially wondered exactly what she means when she says that. I mean she couldn't actually believe her paranormal experiences and encounters support such a wide ranging, all-encompassing statement as that? Could she? Well once you've read her book `The Secret War' you'll understand that ""been there and done that"" is exactly what she means.When Heidi suggests for you to ""imagine yourself as free-floating energy"" she isn't speaking metaphorically, she's asking you to open up to a new reality. A reality she has personally experienced and fully embraces. And as you would expect from all true believers she is by no means timid in her presentation. Heidi comes at you like a whirlwind, hitting you from all directions simultaneously. I guess you might say the image of a swirling sphere of free-floating energy suits her perfectly. By the time you finish the book you'll be thinking ""We're not in Kansas anymore"".  Believe me when I tell you I'm still trying to process the download.The cast of characters alone is enough to make your head spin; extraterrestrial guardians, the Shadows, Reptilians, Grays, Nordics, men-in-black, walk-ins, hybrids, ghosts and Jesus, along with an occasional demon and chupacabra. Just by the mere presence of such a wide variety of ET's, inter-dimensionals and assorted spiritual messengers one immediately understands that `The Secret War' is not going to be yet another narrow, overly simplistic presentation concerning this ever growing, open-ended paranormal phenomenon. Heidi could have played it safe and left a few things out here and there. But then that wouldn't be Heidi. She's like the best friend who comes rushing over to tell you some big news and is already in mid-sentence before you can close the front door behind her.  In other words, you're going to get the whole story.  And exactly what you ask is the whole story? Well for a starter how about; shards of Kabbalistic theory concerning the origin of the universe, a brief glimpse of the Akashic Record or ""Library"", allusions to inadvertent Kundalini awakening and chakra activation, references to restless souls in a purgatorial existence waiting to be reincarnated and discussions of a subterranean world serving as home to the Shadows. Yes, really! Now don't you wish you had taken Heidi's advice and imagined yourself as free-floating energy before you began reading?Personally what I consider the most fascinating aspect of this book is the presence of a coherent and unifying current of early Gnostic thought linking the hostility of these inter-dimensional beings to the Archons of late antiquity. Much like the Christian demons, the Archons can not only harm humans on the physical plane but capture and enslave our souls upon death. Unquestionably the stakes are high in this on-going 'Secret War' and if we hope to be victorious we must first awaken to what's going on unseen all around us. Some readers unfamiliar with the authors' unique style of incorporating random moments of levity in the most unlikely of places might feel as though she's treating the subject matter lightly. Nothing could be further from the truth. Heidi's use of humor is intended solely to help lighten our mood and keep us focused on the message. Humor can be a powerful weapon against the darkness when used correctly while bringing our personal fear and negativity into the spiritual arena serves no positive purpose. Heidi's been in the battle for quite some time, she knows what she's doing.You have to admire a person like Heidi who doesn't hold anything back when it comes to getting her message out. I love her eclectic nature and outside-the-box approach to the weird and often frightening world of the paranormal. She's one of the truly original thinkers in the field today. There are of course those who will shy away from her experiences and conclusions, especially so when dealing with the channeled material coming through from a being named Cafth. Channeling remains one of the more disturbing phenomenon's to come out of the New Age Movement and there are many who have developed a strong aversion to this unconventional form of communication. Heidi does an admirable job at redefining the process which helps alleviate some of the stigma, but only time will tell just how successful her efforts have been. When you put pen to paper you do so with the understanding that you can't satisfy all the people all the time. The best you can do is be honest. The rest will take care of itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLTOZL4QRX7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYDR7C2#wasThisHelpful","RKLTOZL4QRX7P","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I began reading books on the subject of UFO's and aliens in the mid-sixties and have followed the formulation of the ""we are not alone"" in the universe scenario from its humble beginnings. As one would expect from any new field of study the early UFO enthusiast initially desired acceptance and respectability from both the academic community and the public-at-large. This meant they had to produce hard physical evidence for their claims which then had to be analyzed and interpreted through the lens of the sacred cow of the twentieth century, the scientific method. So the search for spacecraft and its occupants began along with the hasty development of whatever theories necessary to support claims of extraterrestrial visitation and involvement on planet Earth. However with the passing of time and the amount of published material multiplying there has been an undeniable shift in focus from the original premise of Ufology. For lack of better terminology I'd call it a shift from 'hardware to software'. The days of pursuing concrete answers to the UFO - Alien phenomenon via conventional nuts and bolts methodology have apparently come to an end. The efforts to replicate the design and engineering of alien craft, mathematically resolving distance, energy and time problems and searching the skies for probable planets that could sustain advanced life forms have been brushed aside. The metaphorical ship has changed course and sailed off in a different direction for destinations unknown.Within the last twenty-five years or so, bolstered to a great extent by the works of Whitley Streiber, the ET hypothesis has evolved into an ever darkening inter-dimensional mysticism comprised of runic crop circles, human abductions and cattle mutilations. All of which was confusing enough before adding into the mix the occasional appearance of Bigfoot, Mothman, skinwalker, fairy folk and assorted spirits of the dead and departed. One would think this has got to be about as deep as this rabbit hole can go, right? Wrong. Just when I thought things couldn't get any weirder along comes 'Love In An Alien Purgatory' by Farah Yurdozu and David Huggins. This slender, over sized paperback consisting of a mere 67 pages will only take about 20 to 30 minutes to read, depending on how much time you spend absorbing David Huggins artwork. However if you're anything like me these haunting, often times disturbing images will stay with you long after you finish. The old saying ""A picture's worth a thousand words"" was never more true.These lifelong encounters endured by David Huggins transcend the field of contemporary Ufology, harkening back to a more ancient, magical worldview. This is particularly so in the area of inter-species intimacy and eroticism. The connections with Celtic and Scandinavian fairy brides and Fairyland abductions, global shamanic journeying and transformation and the more frightening aspects of possible demonic succubus deception will no doubt be bothersome to some readers. If there's one thing you can't fault David for is his honest and candid presentation of the facts as he knows them. One thing is certain, this book will not languish away in your bookcase. You will pull it out on a regular basis to revisit this unique, hypnotic and highly personal Otherworld.Each painting is accompanied by a short commentary consisting of David's fragmentary memories of the encounter depicted in that particular work. His remarks are brief and to the point. There is no unsubstantiated conjecture or rambling analysis of what might have been taking place. There is no effort to provide a context, or outside form of validation. David's art and memories are laid bare before the reader leaving any final conclusions up to you. Hopefully this intermingling of divergent traditional streams of thought and belief won't weaken the books impact or desirability on its potential audience. I hope it strengthens it. Thank you David for this amazing visual document and special thanks to Farah Yurdozu for exhibiting the restraint and wisdom to let the paintings and memories speak for themselves without trying to force them into a more conventional framework or serve a private agenda. Truly 'Love in an Alien Purgatory' is a ground breaking work and unquestionably the first pictorial 'Grimoire' in UFO literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXTTC2L6V8NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933665432#wasThisHelpful","RXXTTC2L6V8NK","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't read any of the other 'Dummies' books, maybe I just don't take well to being called a dummy. However when it comes to anxiety, I'm riddled with it and even a little name calling wouldn't keep me from seeing if I could learn anything from this book series.As far as reading straight through, that wasn't going to happen. I found myself doing more of a hunt and peck for the information I found most insightful. But for that cause alone, this book was enjoyable enough, relatively informative and did what I has assumed it would.I can't say I'm sold entirely on reading other 'Dummies' books, but won't be throwing this volume out just yet..~ Allison Erland","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CK2SRI2CZCND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111852392X#wasThisHelpful","R2CK2SRI2CZCND","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There was no bigger fan of the late John Wooden and UCLA basketball in the sixties and seventies than myself. I watched it all in amazement as it happened and now after all these years their herculean accomplishments are still hard to comprehend. Needless to say watching this film is not only a wonderfully nostalgic stroll down memory lane detailing the Bruins achievements on the court and in the record book but also a fascinating social and political mosaic chronicling the turbulent times these events took place. My favorite moments however are the intimate. shared reminiscences by many of the pivotal players under Coach Woodens' tutorage. If you're a UCLA fan or just a sports fan in general you'll appreciate what this documentary has to offer.The one thing that bothers me about this presentation is the noticeable absence of Kareem Abdul Jabbar (aka: Lew Alcindor), arguably the greatest Bruin of them all. I certainly can't imagine him not being invited to participate in the film, so what happened?

"When it comes to understanding and utilizing the new technology of the 21st century I'm one of the least among the many. I'm probably one of the last remaining humans who doesn't own a cell phone, how's that for ""old school""? The only reason I own an ipad is because my wife gave it to me for my birthday, I think it was probably really a gift for herself and our daughter and just used my birthday as a devious plot to get it into the house.Obviously a electronics novice like myself was in dire need for some help and decided picked up a copy of Bud E. Smith's 'Using ipad 2'. The book covers both the ipad and the ipad 2 and was designed for people like me, those who know absolutely nothing. I found it to be comprehensive but not overwhelming, detailed but not complex and formatted in a manner that makes the pertinent information accessible and easy to grasp. If that weren't enough the DVD is invaluable, particularly for those individuals who are auditory learners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JR81IFAHR6KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0789748355#wasThisHelpful","R2JR81IFAHR6KQ","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've ever heard Heidi on the radio you're already familiar with her enthusiasm, laughter and bubbly, effervescent personality. She is one of those people who possess the innate ability to make everyone in her listening audience feel as though she's talking specifically to them. Much like her verbal banter, Heidi writes in much the same manner. She is emotional, personal and intimate, sometimes in a somewhat rambling fashion. You know, the way an excited friend would share an important event with a close confidante. Heidi is always honest and forthright, holding nothing back from telling you her story in her own original and uncompromising way.Heidi's newest book `Jesus Is No Joke' (2011) is her third following in the footsteps of 'The Secret War' (2008), a contemporary re-visioning of the on-going battle between good and evil and `Picture Prayers' (2009) a more reflective, inspirational offering. Both previous books display a somewhat unconventional perspective that is classic Heidi. This latest book is no different in that respect. The authors interests and expertise covers a broad range within the spiritual / supernatural spectrum; UFO's and extraterrestrials, shadow people and astral entities, ghostly apparitions and crop circles. Attempting to make sense of such a myriad of seemingly unrelated phenomena would make most peoples head explode, but Heidi believes she has found the missing piece of the puzzle that will finally bring an end to all the adversity and confusion. In `Jesus Is No Joke' Heidi shares her innermost beliefs brought to life during a series of personal encounters with Jesus and shares what she has learned from those experiences. It's a fascinating read and an intriguing opportunity to see how Jesus reveals himself within the contemporary landscape.Now you might be wondering at this point whether any of this should serve as a warning for Christians to stay away. Let me just assure you that despite the unique and unorthodox approach Heidi has taken here 'Jesus Is No Joke' does convey a Christian message that will draw you closer to Jesus not further away. Making the decision to write this book was a bold and courageous move on Heidi's part. Already accepted by a rather large and growing audience within the UFO and paranormal communities, incorporating encounters with Jesus into the mix was an extremely dangerous move. It has been my past experience that the majority of people on both sides consider these two worldviews to be mutually exclusive. Heidi acknowledges this problem in her new book and faces whatever may come with the same wonderful sense of humor and trust in Divine Providence that has led her to where she is right now. I guess it would be safe to say that she is trusting in Jesus to work it all out. Who knows, maybe this book and others like it will at long last bridge the gap between the paranormal community and Christianity and a working synthesis will finally emerge, God willing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HHKYFZFGS2MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615190057#wasThisHelpful","R3HHKYFZFGS2MW","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The audio version of 'Another piece of my heart' by Jane Green consists of 11 discs running 13 1/2 in elapsed time. That's quite an investment in time but if the author is willing to make the effort to read it aloud to us any self professed lover of this genre should be up to the task of listening. The author enunciates clearly and her voice quite enjoyable, which definitely helps the listener  concentrate. The production values of the product are also pleasing, the sound is crisp and clear so no one can blame anyone or anything but themselves if the drift off or get distracted. If I were to point to one thing that could be improved would be the box itself. It is in my estimation a little thin to house 11 discs. A little extra sturdiness can go a long way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MERZT6W6YVGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1427214735#wasThisHelpful","R3MERZT6W6YVGJ","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given the fact that I have never considered myself to be a Marilyn Monroe fan I was amazed by how much I really enjoyed this film. I fully expected this to be a rather predictable, shallow tale that would ultimately be embraced only by the most die hard fans of this iconic film legend. However nothing could be further from the truth. The 2011 Academy Award nominated film 'Marilyn' is a thoughtful, introspective and nostalgic film that can be thoroughly appreciated whether you are a fan or not. Even more surprising, the story-line is so strong and compelling on its own that it didn't have to be about a real person. You could change all the characters to fictitious people and it would still be a great film.Indeed one of the top films of 2011, the Academy got it right this time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCQ74HKQSFZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0059XTUB8#wasThisHelpful","R3CCQ74HKQSFZT","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I sit at my computer writing this review I find myself disturbed by the thought that such an amazingly personal and poignant memoir as Deborah Feldman's `Unorthodox' has received a rather mediocre 3 star overall rating from the 200 reviews that have been posted to date. Lets' just say there are obvious spiritual politics on display here and leave it at that.The truth is `Unorthodox' is a powerful, deeply moving book that will leave a lasting impression on the reader whether or not the're familiar with the Jewish Hasidic community. The author shares life events, emotions and thoughts so beautifully and effortlessly that one feels as though they're partaking in the experiences with her. Deborah Feldman is unquestionably a gifted writer who has shared her story through a cultural prism unfamiliar to the vast majority of the potential reading audience. Her work deserves to be read and her courage to write it embraced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1618TAIDP7VQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439187002#wasThisHelpful","R1618TAIDP7VQF","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Lying With the Dead' is an incredibly insightful, eloquently written novel emoting all the existential angst and nihilism that one could hope for. Author Michael Mewshaw peels off virtually all the old, festering scabs of familial dysfunctionality that will cause the reader to wonder about the nature of relationships, community and our inherent longing to be understood and loved.Obviously this is a hard hitting book which one has to be in the mood for to really enjoy. Thankfully Mewshaw is such a a talented wordsmith that he has the uncanny ability to soften the overall dark, depressing nature of the material by the sheer genius of his writing.

"Robert Kroese's ""Mercury Rises', the second book in his madcap trilogy, is a clever, humorous and mind altering journey into, through and beyond the mundane fabric of reality. I haven't read anything even remotely similar to it since the 'Illuminatus' trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea way back in the early '80's. Yes, it's been that long!The first thing you'll notice when you begin this most improbable literary journey is how adept Kroese proves himself to be at inserting both religious and mythological entities into the time-space continuum. They may be immortal, they may be powerful, but they are tangible and in more ways than one they are surprisingly like us. Their effect on humanity and the world in which we live is concrete, recognizable and immediate. You're in for a mind altering read involving a strange and intoxicating blend of real places you know of or have visited, supernatural beings you may or may not believe in and an impending Apocalypse none of us want to think about. All this and lots of related fun stuff!

"'Hell and Back Again' will affect each viewer on an individual, very personal level. It's not a film that one would consider to be enjoyable or entertaining in the traditional sense, but it will be a film that you will be glad you watched. The story line is at times fascinating and educational, other times mundane and boring and still other times surprisingly insightful. Oddly enough what segments of the film you would designate to each of these three categories will vary largely dependent upon what you're looking for in a war story. Because the film moves back and forth from the Afghan battlefield to life back home in the USA the audiences personal preferences between these two aspects of the story will determine the rise and fall of ones interest level.However what ties the film together is the interior processes operating within the soldier the film focuses on. His psychological journey is at the heart of 'Hell and Back Again'. It's not an easy journey and it's not always comfortable to watch. But it's an important journey and that's what ultimately holds the viewer to the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8SBIRL0ALTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TZFZD8#wasThisHelpful","R2I8SBIRL0ALTZ","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hearing the word `cancer' associated with yourself, a family member, close friend, or just about anybody for that matter strikes more fear in the heart and mind of a person than any other word.  So much so that if you're like me you wouldn't even consider reading a book about it unless someone you know and love has had the misfortune to be diagnosed with this disease.However despite my personal dis-ease with the subject matter I decided to go ahead and read `When Cancer Hits' by Britta Aragon just in case the need for a little knowledge and understanding should arise. I must say that I believe I picked the perfect book to acquaint myself with the world of the cancer patient. As both a cancer survivor herself as well as losing her Father to the same disease Britta has taken the experiences and knowledge gained through the heat of battle and has shared what she has learned in this wonderfully written, amazingly comprehensive 334 page paperback.Britta's grasp of the enormity of the situation is actually quite astonishing as she discusses every phase and aspect of what lies ahead for patients and their families. When you talk about exhaustive guides you definitely would have to include this one. The author doesn't just cover the more overt considerations such as the possible changes in physical appearance, physiology, mental and emotional issues, medicines and medical treatments and routines. She moves into the minuet, generally overlooked areas of concern (i.e.: exterior and interior environment, hair maintenance, wigs, make-up, cosmetics, etc..) that at first glance might seem quite trivial, but from the vantage point of the patient are most likely immensely important.If there's one thing that Britta will make the reader fully understand is how battling cancer impacts every facet of one's life. When it comes to keeping up your strength and remaining emotionally positive absolutely everything is significant. Honestly I can't think of anything that the author has failed to include. `When Cancer Hits' is the book that everyone prays they'll never need but should certainly own just in case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W6GIW0II4HZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982917503#wasThisHelpful","R2W6GIW0II4HZF","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone has seen the all too frequent news clips showing throngs of angry Muslims shouting ""Death to the Great Satan"" and burning the American flag in the streets of some faraway desert kingdom and yet we know nearly nothing about these people and what really motivates them to act in such a manner. We think they're crazy, fanatical and exploited. How do we bridge the ever widening gap between us and them? Is it even important to try??Ken Ballen's book `Terrorists in Love: The Real Lives of Islamic Radicals' is an amazing read that takes the reader away from the all too familiar sights and sounds mentioned above and presents a face to our would be assailant. Ballen brings the reader face to face with those who would do us immeasurable harm and presents surprisingly intimate and poignant glimpses into the beliefs, feelings and motivations gathered first hand from would be martyrs.

"The recent 2011 film `Limitless' is not only a fast paced, technically mesmerizing cinematic experience but surprises the audience with ever an accelerating journey into contemporary modes of power, persuasion and mind expansion. I was sucked in immediately, but lost a little interest halfway in when it appeared to be drifting away from the internal, speculative ""hidden powers of the mind"" theme and evolving into a mundane action/adventure film.

"Watching films dealing with the theme of the Holocaust are somewhat a necessary evil. ""We must never forget"" is not just an overused slogan, it's an existential imperative. Yes, they are definitely difficult, often times traumatic emotional experiences for the viewer. So much so that one actually feels guilty afterwards admitting that they enjoyed the film. Somehow using the word ""enjoyed"" sounds out of place, callous, or more appropriately blasphemous. Atrocities of this magnitude must be studied, understood and endured, but enjoyed?So keeping in mind the above mentioned sentiments I would like to recommend the 2011 film `Sarah's Key'. Though a fictional tale, the foundation of the story deals with the true account of Frances collaboration with the Nazi's in gathering up the Parisian Jewish population in the infamous Vel d'Hiver Roundup. As one would expect from a film of this nature the events are horrific, heartbreaking and intense. And as far as happy endings go, the wise viewer should be looking more for a little personal insight and hope rather than any rainbows and unicorns.In my estimation the Holocaust theme alone makes `Sarah's Key' worthy of one's time and attention.  However add to that the simple fact that this is a thoughtful, well told, tale perfectly paced to keep the audience focused and fascinated from beginning to end. The acting is wonderful especially little Melusine Mayance as Sarah Starzynski and Kristen Scott Thomas as Julia Jarmond. This is a story that will stay with you. It will make you think, make you reflect, make you ask yourself what if?

In other words, yea I enjoyed the movie but don't really care to sit through it again. It's kind of a surprise since I enjoy all the major actors and actresses in the cast (and there are a lot of rather well known ones in minor roles), the storyline is well paced, the dialogue witty and the subject matter something that most working adults out there can relate to on some level. Hasn't everyone hated their boss at one time or another?Yet with all those positives going for it I found `Horrible Bosses' lacking that indefinable something necessary to transform a good film into a great one. Well worth a viewing, you'll definitely get a laugh or two from this one. But will you look forward to a repeat viewing? I doubt it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBT7Q8PJJZF9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005I64U66#wasThisHelpful","RBT7Q8PJJZF9N","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me begin by saying I have not read Lisa See's book upon which this film is based, hence I'm not in the category of other reviewers who disliked this movie primarily because of its deviation from the novel. Translating a work of art from one medium to another is a difficult task at the very least and it comes as no surprise to discover that a person who loves something in one medium is seldom pleased with its appearance in another. Personally I think a film should be judged solely on its own merits, like it or dislike it for what it is, not for what you thought or hoped it would be.Having said that I would like to convey how much I loved this film. Director Wayne Wang instilled `Snow Flower and the Secret Fan' with the same depth of emotion and sensitivity that made his `Joy Luck Club' such a moving and memorable viewing experience.The storyline moves neatly back and forth between two sets of Chinese women living in different times (Lily and Snow Flower in 1829 China, Nina and Sophia in present day Shanghai). Though time and place differ, the shared cultural and spiritual bonds formed by their mutual `vows of sisterhood' are identical and timeless. Bingbing Li plays the parts of both Lily and Nina and Gianna Jun the dual roles of Snow Flower and Sophia. Both story lines are engaging but clearly the Snow Flower and Lily tale is the more important of the two. Nevertheless the present day friendship between Nina and Sophia is essential to the intent of the film, providing not only context to the earlier friendship but a cultural bridge between past, present and future. In other words, while everything around us is constantly changing what's really important in life remains the same.I strongly recommend this film; the storyline, dialogue, soundtrack, visuals and cast all make for a well spent evening of viewing entertainment. The only warning I would level is to say that this is, like `Joy Luck Club' a chick flick so gentlemen view at your own risk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RRTOWPBNWIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KG4CUS#wasThisHelpful","R35RRTOWPBNWIN","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"`Making a Meal of It: Sex in Chinese and Western Cultural Settings' is not a book someone would randomly pick up for a little light reading before falling asleep, nor is it a wondrous tale of fantasy and adventure. If you're looking for something to pass the time or escapism look elsewhere, if on the other hand you're looking for a detailed, meticulously researched and comprehensive study examining the differences between the sexual beliefs, attitudes and practices of Chinese and Western culture than this is the book for you.Obviously this is not a book for the average reader. I would guess that the primary target audience for this information would be academics, therapists, adults in a culturally mixed marriage or those contemplating one. If you fit into either one of those two categories I think you'll find this book invaluable. On a larger, much broader scale this 353 page volume would be a helpful and insightful tool for those in such occupations as family counselor, therapist, minister working within culturally diverse congregations and sex education teacher.If the sexual divide between East and West is an area of interest for you than `Making a Meal of It' is the place to begin. Author Jui-shan Chang has certainly done her homework and has provided the psychological, educational and religious communities a valuable resource that should come in handy in their work. It would make a wonderful text book as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C9HKZC8XY77C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1432768212#wasThisHelpful","R2C9HKZC8XY77C","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thor was one of my favorite Marvel comic superheroes growing up so the release of the 2011 film `Thor' was greeted by much long overdue enthusiasm.  While it didn't live up to all my pre-conceived expectations (whatever does?), I found it to be an overall satisfying viewing. ""Overall satisfying""..., what the heck does that mean? Kind of a wishy-washy endorsement but let me add that this was my first viewing assessment. Sometimes you instantly fall in love with a film (which wasn't the case here). However other times an initial lukewarm acceptance of a film may begin to become more fully appreciated several days later, which is exactly what happened to me with this movie.First Impression: I had been impressed by the visuals from the beginning, particularly the sequences in Asgard, Home of the Gods and the frozen world of the Frost Giants. I also thought Chris Hemsworth lived up to my mental image of the mighty Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely amazing. However I found the storyline rather weak and a little bit to comic bookish, particularly the dialogue (imagine that, complaining about comic book dialogue in a film based on a comic!). There just didn't seem to be enough residual `food for thought' in the production to warrant more than one viewing.Change of Mind: For a movie I thought I was over and done with I surprisingly couldn't get it out of my mind. Images of Asgard, the Rainbow Bridge and the brash and unbridled Thor stayed with me, replaying random scenes from the film before my mind's eye.  By far the most powerful image of them all was the face of Loki. Those haunting eyes, that regal strut and the aura of impending chaos surrounding him was intoxicating. Wow, it took a while but I finally came to the realization that I really loved this film after all. Now I can hardly wait to watch it again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I55REWFJAZBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034G4P80#wasThisHelpful","R3I55REWFJAZBS","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me the long awaited film `Captain America: The First Avenger' about one of my favorite childhood comic book superheroes turned out to be a somewhat bittersweet experience. I probably shouldn't have expected anything less since ones expectations always surpass what one ultimately receives. You see I wanted nothing less than total immersion into an imaginary world where good and evil are plainly marked, heroes and villains wear memorable garb and the action and adventure comes at you non-stop.  Now that I think of it, a little bit of nave idealism, justified revenge and romance should be thrown in just to spice things up even more.From a technical point of view the film meets or excels all my expectations, I honestly can't find any fault with the final on-screen product. The visuals are superior, storyline solid, soundtrack memorable and the overall aura of a WWII America comingling with a surreal occult, Nazi universe is just short of miraculous. Yea, I guess I liked it. And what about the cast you ask? No problems here either. Who wouldn't love Chris Evans in the role of Captain America and immediately fall in love with Hayley Atwell in the role of the Captain's love interest Peggy Carter. Then of course there's the incredible Hugo Weaving in the role of Johann Schmidt (aka: Red Skull), Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (Iron Man's father). There's definitely loads of quality talent throughout.At this point you might be wondering why I described my initial viewing experience as ""somewhat bittersweet"" since I've had only positive things to say about the movie. The reason is that the film disappoints on one level which for me is the most important of all. I like to call it the repeatability factor. For me the most important quality in a film is its ability to instill within the viewer the unquenchable desire to watch it over and over again. It has to be able to `click' with the audience in such a way that always leaves one panting for yet another viewing. For me `Captain America: The First Avenger' just doesn't connect with me on that level. It does however cause me to look forward to the next screen appearance of the good Captain, maybe that was the filmmaker's prime intention all along.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7JIK9N41RHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IZLPKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1T7JIK9N41RHI","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 2010 film `Submarine' is in my opinion one of those ""could have been films"" that just didn't quite reach its potential. The story-line captured my full attention at the beginning; a coming of age movie examining the internal thought processes of a sensitive young Welsh boy (Oliver played by (Craig Roberts) as he deals with feelings of acceptance, peer pressure, love, a quirky, dysfunctional family and the always presence knowledge that when all is said and done we are all alone in the world. It had kind of a Woody Allen feel played out against the enchanting Celtic landscape of Wales.There were so many ways to go with this film, so many possible avenues to explore. Maybe that turned out to be the problem. After wetting the audience's appetite with a well thought out entrance into Oliver's world populated by school mates, love interest and parents the filmmakers had to decide what aspects of Oliver's world to focus on. In my opinion that choose incorrectly.I thought his life at school was by far the most interesting. There was an early sequence of events involving his participation in bullying an overweight girl for the sole purpose of winning favor with peers and his future girlfriend. His feelings of guilt and the moment of personal self examination that followed the incidence was touching and possibly the best moment in the film for me. Surprisingly the film suddenly veered off in another direction, a missed opportunity in my estimation.Ultimately what I see as the main problem was the character development of Oliver. Initially I found Oliver to be an intelligent, introspective and likeable young man I could easily identify with. To be sure, he was someone who didn't always make the right choices, but did nothing out of malice of forethought. However as the storyline and his persona developed those intelligent and introspective qualities displayed early in the film had given way to something more in keeping with perverse pathological tendencies and paranoid-like behavior. In other words he was no longer likeable. That's when I found myself waiting for the film to end. To be fair everyone is attracted to different personality types, this one just wasn't relatable to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVHZ9WF78O4R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C7SXMS#wasThisHelpful","RVHZ9WF78O4R8","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Are you searching for a guru, some special, enlightened being waiting to guide you through all your emotional heartaches, psychological complexes and spiritual doubts? You know, someone who can cut through all the mundane distractions of everyday life and lead you to a pure and profound way of existence?If you answer ""yes"" to my question than may I suggest you begin your quest for self discovery by picking up a copy of `The Guru Question' by Mariana Caplan. Almost immediately upon beginning to read this amazing book you will become aware of the fact that Caplan (PhD) knows what she's writing about both from the vantage point of a consummate scholar as well as that of an ardent seeker of spiritual truth.  The author writes with a delightful blend of clarity, honesty and humor, weaving the story of her personal journey of awakening through the prism of first-hand experience and formal education.  Her ability to recognize, organize, analyze and present the vast array of subtle shifts constantly at play in such volatile, constantly evolving relationships is uncanny and fascinating.Needless to say I have fallen in love with this book and consider it a valuable tool for self discovery and personal inventory. Definitely a wonderful resource for those who at one time or another will find it necessary to look for guidance as they walk the spiritual path laid before them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CW9GD9G8EUMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604070730#wasThisHelpful","R2CW9GD9G8EUMA","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Synopsis: What do you good for a good time in a society without television, radio or any of the other distractions that help us pass time. Just think, a world where nothing new ever happens; no new faces to encounter, no vacations to look forward to and no hopes of a different future awaiting somewhere in the future.Such is the sunless, underground world presented to the reader in Keith Hartman's fast paced 141 page book `The Buried Sky'. The story revolves around a likeable, independent young boy named Calvin and his friends Tink and Goldilocks. Somewhat of an outsider, Calvin has grown weary of the usual pursuits and collective interests of the general population. He was never really interested in the activities of the Drama Queen (think of Thespians, not Drag Queens), nor the Chosen (religious fanatics) and now even the sexual distractions don't hold his interest as they used to. Yes day to day life isolated and unchanging is maddening, but the radio-activity awaiting on the surface made anything else an impossibility.However things were about to change for Calvin, a murder and an ensuing mystery were about to lead Calvin on a search for truth that would not only discover the identity of the murderer but forever change life in their post-apocalyptic world.Critique: Author Keith Harman has created an intelligent and enjoyable world populated by well rounded, believable characters.  `The Buried Sky' is easy reading and fast paced enough to hold the attention of young readers while having enough depth and underlying allegory to keep and older, adult interested as well.  This would be the perfect choice for someone looking for a little something to pass the time while traveling or waiting at the doctor's office. Of course you can read and enjoy it at home too.

"The Timex T736S Dual Alarm Clock Radio with Time Projector and Jumbo Display is an amazingly light, attractive item that has a lot more bells and whistles than a non tech individual like myself generally requires. The time projector and dual alarms are excellent features and I definitely appreciated the both the large time display and the adjustable brightness feature. I like being able to see the time from across the room when I'm awake but also like a dark room when I'm sleeping. Here I get to have it both ways. But I think my favorite is the environmental sounds feature and battery back-up system.The only slight negative for me is a aesthetic one dealing with maximizing the use of available space. The clock is much thicker than it needed to be. The 18 function buttons located at the top could have been arranged in a more efficient manner, thus slimming down the device so that it wouldn't need quite as much room on your desk or bedside table. Other than that I'm satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XEJCYOBMAEQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FVS8W8#wasThisHelpful","R1XEJCYOBMAEQB","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Tete and the Moon' is a light-hearted and sensual story of a little nine year old boy named Tete (Biel Duran) who wants to be treated the same as his newborn baby brother. Unable to get his Mother's attention and affection away from her new bundle of joy, Tete decides to go in search of a surrogate Mother.Tete asks the moon to provide him with a loving female. When a beautiful French dancer (Mathilda May) and her husband arrive in town Tete is certain she's the one he's been looking for. However convincing her won't be easy, not only does he have to deal with her husband, but another local teenager is also in hot pursuit of the enticing Estrellita.This is definitely not for the prudish, or easily offended. There is quite a bit of frontal nudity in this film. However if you're open-minded and have a good understanding of European humor you will appreciate this erotic little comedy as much as I did.

"Let me start out by saying that I'm not a fan of the original 1981 film `Arthur' starring Dudley Moore. There are a number of reasons for this but probably the biggest is that I don't generally enjoy movies with storylines focused on excessive drinking and alcoholics. This is especially true for films within the comedy genre. Having that said, you can imagine that seeing a mediocre 3 star rating overall on the 2011 remake of `Arthur' starring Russell Brand would only reinforce my decision not to view this one.Fortunately I watched the film before checking out its Amazon rating and I have to admit that I absolutely love it! Russell Brand is amazing as the man-child Arthur and while the image of a loveable drunk is not my forte he definitely pulls it off.  I also loved Helen Mirren as Arthur's lifelong nanny and surrogate Mother.  Brand and Mirren play off each other beautifully and their relationship is edgy, witty and poignant.What ultimately ties it all together and makes this a 5 star film for me is the hilarious, laugh a minute dialogue. Just about everything that comes out of Russell Brands' mouth is funny, unexpected and memorable. You know, the kind of material you want to write down so you could use it yourself in the future.  I was already a Helen Mirren fan before watching this film but was undecided on Russell Brand. Now I'm a fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSMST3KGNCUW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HO6I42#wasThisHelpful","RSMST3KGNCUW0","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Am I Really a Christian' by Mike McKinley is a concise, insightful, honest and surprisingly refeshing reassertion of the essential core beliefs of Protestantism and the standards by which we can truly know whether or not we are really a Christian. McKinley's straightforward, unapologetic approach to the subject matter leads the reader on a no frills, step by step methodology of self-examination that ultimately leads to a fuller understanding of ones personal, spiritual journey and ultimate eternal destination.Obviously this books target audience is the practicing Christian. It's designed to encourage and enbolden the faithful as well as admonish and reinvigorate those who have become apathetic or fallen away from the faith. 'Am I Really a Christian' succeeds in accomplishing those goals and will serve well as a evangelical tool.*On a personal note let me say that my own personal belief system is immensely different from the one discussed here, however I do appreciate the manner in which the author presented the material and made his case.

"After a 32 year wait I finally sat down and watched the 1979 cult film classic 'Monty Python's Life of Brian'. With the wait over I can honestly say I was neither surprised or disappointed, nor particularly amused or insulted. It was in fact pretty much what I had expected. Maybe I just don't get British humor, or maybe it's a problem with the heavy British accents. If I hadn't already been familiar with the religious context on which this satire is based I would have found large portions of the film all but unintelligible. Aside from the translation problem I found the truly funny moments in the story to be few and far between.Memorable Moments:1-The stoning bit was hilarious,2-The singing on the cross was a clever touch and3-All the re-occurring joisting and one-liners between competing Judean liberation groups was amusing and probably the only thing that keep me watching.There were a few other good moments here and there but not enough to persuade me to endure a second viewing.

"The 1999 TNT original film 'Purgatory' is a unique and throughly enjoyable watch. Much like the classic 'Twilight Zone television series a specific time period and a seemingly ordinary place serve as the setting for an extremely unorthox tale. The time period is the American Old West, the place a small, off-the-beaten-path town known as Refuge. It is here that the world we know intersects with another and things are seldom what they appear to be. When a gang of outlaws ride into town they think they've come upon a place ripe for the picking and decide to take over and do as they please. Again, in the town of Refuge things are not exactly what they seem to be.If you're the kind of person who enjoys a good western, a quirky, out of the ordinary storyline and can appreciate a little morality tale as long as it's not preachy than this is the film for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YE9STGA145SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007OY2OO#wasThisHelpful","R1YE9STGA145SA","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found the film '127 Hours' to be extremely difficult to watch, particularily so since it's a true life account. I began fidgeting early on in my viewing and as the storyline inched closer and closer to the inevitable event I began losing eye contact with the screen, staring down at my dog or getting up and going to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. As I said, this was an extremely difficult watch.Having openly revealed my lack of fortitude to millions you would probably expect me not to recommend this film. Well, that would definitely be true in the case of small children, the film is far too intense and disturbing. Furthermore if this movie was only about the extreme events that occurred in the life of outdoor enthuasist Aron Ralston (played brilliantly by James Franco) for no other reason than pure shock value and financial gain I also would not recommend the film.However there is another dimension to this tale of unbelievable horror that needed to be told. Exactly what is this other dimension of which I speak? Well you could call it mankinds inate biologically induced will to survive, or man's ability to tap into a higher source or divine power in times of desperation, or quite possibly a hands on discourse on the timeless processes of karma and destiny.I made it through to the end by tuning into the internal dialogue going on in Aron Ralston's mind during his unbelievable ordeal. His thoughts, feelings, memories and future aspirations are laid out before the audience. Past, present and future converge and focus on one spot and moment in time and space. That point of convergence being the place where Aron's hand, rock and cliff meet and all that was, is and may yet be hang in the balance. An entire universe of possiblities will be determined by what is about to take place. As Aron so succintly put it, ""this rock has been waiting for me my entire life"". Yes it has and what he does next will determine everything!Amazing film if you're up for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1467F7KIHLQUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041KKYDI#wasThisHelpful","R1467F7KIHLQUG","A141HP4LYPWMSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141HP4LYPWMSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently started making jewelry, especially earrings. I purchased this to organize my ever expanding earring collection.For the price asked, I wasn't expecting something of extremely high quality. That's a good thing, because this isn't the sturdiest of stands. The feet are actually rubber tubing that you slide onto the stand when you get it. I don't have a problem with that per se, but because of that, the stand wobbles a bit.

"I purchased this at the recommendation of an Etsy seller to glue a cabochon into the tray of a blank cuff bangle bracelet.It worked great - I let it set overnight and the cabochon seems to be quite sturdily glued into the tray. So it was very effective for what I needed it for. Just one thing to note: It has a very, very fine long metal tip at the nozzle which is designed for fine rhinestone work. The tube does leak quite a bit when you're using it, so be sure to have something guarding your work surface. Also, I found it very difficult to replace the cap due to the long metal nozzle. After a few tries, I got it to go back on, and I wiped away any excess glue from around the cap.I don't know if they have this glue with a nozzle made for gluing larger surfaces, but if they do, I'll be buying it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJCSXNLUMVZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YQDX86#wasThisHelpful","R2MJCSXNLUMVZS","A38YDXWC0WCO4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38YDXWC0WCO4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just started making my own earrings and bracelet, and wanted an array of jump rings on hand depending on the size of project I was working on.This is a great kit. It has six different size jump rings and the ring tool to help keep them steady while opening them up. They came in what is essentially a 7 day pill organizer (awesome reuse), which keeps everything neat and organized. I ordered them in silver, and am using them mainly with earring and bracelet connectors. I am not having any problems with them tarnishing or changing color, though if I used them for larger products, who knows?One thing to note... I have not found the ring tool terribly helpful. I'm not sure if I'm not using it properly, but I have found that the rings don't stay put very well. I have had more success using my jewelry tool and a heavy duty cuticle nipper together.

"I was somewhat hesitant to spend $30 on a broom and shovel. Despite my misgivings, I really needed a good sweep set because all the ones I had been buying were always bad in some way: Either the brooms were too short and I got a backache using it, or the dustpan wasn't level with the floor and debris slid underneath it. However, seeing as this was made by Oxo (I'm a huge fan of their kitchen gadgets) I figured I'd just take the plunge.It was a great decision. I love this set! The broom has an extendable handle, which is great because I'm tall. No, the extended handle isn't terribly thick or sturdy, but it doesn't really need to be to serve its purpose. The best part of this set is the dustpan, which not only is nice, large and level with the ground, but the top comb to clean the broom is ingenious! If I only have one gripe, it's that I wish the comb had denser, closer together bristles. I think it would help get the dust bunnies out even more.That aside, however, this is exactly the kind of set I've been needing and I found it worth the extra money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AGQWNQ5BD1HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9WK5P8#wasThisHelpful","R2AGQWNQ5BD1HY","A38YDXWC0WCO4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38YDXWC0WCO4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was looking for a red slide, and the price was amazing. I was super excited to get them.I was disappointed because they just didn't work. The length was fine, the instep fit well, but the insole was so, so narrow - my foot just hung over the edge, so whenever I walked I could feel it digging into my arch. Additionally, the silver accent part (along the side and the heel) is actually made of plastic, and it arrived a bit scratched up.So while they would have been comfortable if the width had been right, they just didn't work for me.

"I live in an apartment where the bugs think they are welcome to enter my home whenever they feel like it. You'd think they had a hand delivered invitation they way they pranced in and out! Nervy little buggers. I've especially had trouble with earwigs, all around the inside of my front door. Not anymore, thanks to Ortho Home Defense.I sprayed the odorless liquid outside my apartment (and my neighbor's, for good will). I sprayed around the front door, along the concrete foundation, around the side of the building - anywhere I could think bugs would enter. After the first application, the number of earwigs actually seemed to increase around my door. So, I applied it again to the same places, but used even more spray. Well, that did the trick.I haven't seen nary an earwig or spider since the second treatment. Ok, maybe I did see one spider inside, but I sprayed it and that was that. That sucker was deader than dead, and quick. But I haven't seen an earwig in almost a month (knock on wood).I can always call my apartment community's office and order professional extermination. However, if I'm too busy to wait for them to come, or have a sudden infestation of gross, exotic bugs, Ortho Home Defense works great, and is a wonderful thing to have on hand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WG5JT35RP2ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CQMKHK#wasThisHelpful","R2WG5JT35RP2ZK","A38YDXWC0WCO4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38YDXWC0WCO4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although they are hit or miss with how they fit me (more miss than hit), these pumps were just what I was looking for, so I took a chance.When I received them, I was satisfied with the quality. The leather is soft, the heel is a manageable height, and the strap fits around my ankle with no problems.

"I used to by the Costco brand of bags, when you could find a box of 90 for less than $20. However, they have gone up in price online (shipping is just too expensive), and I no longer live near a Costco, so I decided on these instead.The price here currently is decent for 50 bags. They are smaller than the previous bags I liked, but that is not an issue since these are the ForceFlex; meaning, they are very strong, they flex, and you can fit more into them without fear of breakage.

"I had such enormous hope for these sneakers. I have been trying for months to find the perfect, well balanced, all around great sneakers for very light jogging, walking and maybe some basic exercise. I'd heard good things about the brand and decided to give it a go.Sadly, these shoes were just not for me. They are very cute looking, and I love the color & design. However, they fit absolutely strangely in a way I'm not used to. The width was great, as was the length. I loved the wide toe box. However, the insole is much, much softer in the heel than the rest of the shoe. Therefore, every time you walk, you can feel your heel (and just your heel) sinking in. I didn't know if this was normal, so I contacted the company via their website chat option. Their representative who responded did not seem to know and seemed somewhat disinterested in assisting me in general. When I asked him if that was normal, he just said ""yes"", but would not elaborate or tell me why it was, nor did he recommend a different shoe model to me.I decided to give them a go anyway and wore them for 10 minutes outside... just a trip to the mailbox and a quick walk around the block. Within 5 minutes, not only my feet and legs hurt but my lower back as well. So, with great sadness I had to return them.I must say that I know I'm a heel striker, so apparently these are shoes not for people who walk the way I do. Additionally, I have a high arch and there is no arch support (I'm guessing that's due to the zero drop platform). Maybe this these sneakers are perfect for some, but they just did not work for me. I will keep searching for the perfect athletic shoe.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MMK8KZHTIFP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0R94HS#wasThisHelpful","R2MMK8KZHTIFP2","A38YDXWC0WCO4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38YDXWC0WCO4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't have the best luck when it comes to slippers. I specifically like the mule style, but usually find them to be too short, or too shallow in the bridge thus hurting the top of my foot.Luckily, these slipper are neither. They do fit a little wide, but I actually quite like that. They are very snug and warm, and fit true to size (see photos I've attached). The heel is more rigid than other brands, giving each slipper more structure, which is a plus in my book. The thick rubber sole makes them appropriate for around the house, or a quick trip to the mailbox. The suede is what causes them to be snug at first, but they do appear to be loosening up. The insole isn't terribly thick, but since most slippers are the same, I'm fine with that.They are to new, so it's early to attest to how durable they'll be overall, but so far, so good.

"I have been looking for a set of solid silicone cooking utensils for a while. I had several spatulas with the plastic handles, and had trouble keeping the inside (where the rubber fits on to the handle) clean. Even when used in the dishwasher, water would seep in there and cause discoloring/cleanliness issues.I saw that this Ouddy set looked exactly like another set I had been eyeing, but cost $7 less. Why? I can't imagine. The dimensions are the same for them and they both have a temperature limit of 480 degrees. The ratings for this were good, so I thought I'd take a chance.I am very glad I did! These silicone utensils are exactly what I have been looking for. The quality is seemingly very high - thick and sturdy. The red color pops on my counter top (I have them sitting in an empty Arborio rice container with red glass marbles at the bottom for weight). With proper care, I imagine they will last a long while.The one thing to note, at least with mine.. the holes in the spatula had some slight edge overlap with tiny slivers of extra silicone.

"I have very thick, long, wavy locks. It's always been a challenge to keep it healthy, moisturized and frizz free. A few years ago, I discovered that I had a sensitivity or allergy (not sure which) to the silicones that the majority of shampoos contain. I noticed a significant bald spot on the back of my head that, while easily covered by proper styling, sent me into an obvious panic. I was in my 30's, surely this couldn't be happening to me? So, after some research and trial and error, it became apparent to me it was the silicones causing the problems. Once the silicones were cut, my hair grew back.So began an extensive search for shampoos and conditioners that did not contain silicone. I never expected it to be SUCH a challenge! Interestingly,  most shampoos & conditioners available in the US contain silicones (you can tell because the ingredient ends in ""cone""), while the majority in the UK, France and abroad do not.I found a couple low end brands that didn't have it. Generally, I found that the scent never last very long and they left my hair really dry. I found a relatively well-known, higher end brand that contained many different types of oils (mainly olive), but that left my hair feeling greasy much more quickly than it should. I was at my wits end, about to submit to a life with shampoos I hated.Enter Elucence Moisture Benefits Shampoo & Conditioner. I am absolutely ecstatic that I discovered this brand. Wouldn't you know it? It's a UK based company. The products smell heavenly (like peaches & cream). They don't dry out my hair, instead leaving it soft, bouncy and conditioned (but not greasy). Best of all, they are silicone free so my hair is immensely healthy!Elucence may be a hard brand to find, and maybe a bit more costly, but it's well worth the trouble and expense.

"UPDATE:Ok, so I have had this pan since the end of February... almost 4 full months. Sadly, I had to change the 5 stars I had previously given this pan to 2 stars. The reason: It warped. Yet another deep jumbo fry pan that has warped on me. I purchased this pan to replace another one that had done the same thing. This one has popped ""up"": the spot in the center on the bottom raised up, so any cooking oils/liquids fall to the perimeter of the pan, leaving the middle without any.To anyone who may be wondering, I am a cook and take excellent care of my cookware. This WearEver has never been put hot into cold water (a reason why some pans warp). I always wash it by hand, and use silicone utensils when cooking.I think this is common with aluminum pans. This is aluminum, and my previous pan was as well. I think the thing to do is spend money on an All-Clad (not Limited, but one of their higher end lines), or Swiss Diamond. When I purchased the WearEver, money was tight. However, I'm going to pony up since quality cookware is an investment, and the good ones should last you a nice long while.ORIGINAL REVIEWI needed a new 5 quart pan to replace another ""name brand"" cooker that had warped at the bottom, thus making it unusable. This one looked nice, and the price was right, so I gave it a chance.So glad I did! Here are the pros thus far:* Gorgeous pan. Glossy, shiny, sexy candy apple red in color. I love the side pouring spouts.* The elegant, shapely handle is dual riveted for strength and designed for proper air flow while cooking.* Helper handle helps stabilize pouring when pan is full* Lid is very well constructed with thick glass with pouring holes in two places* Non-stick coating seems durable and hasn't scratched as of yetI've only used it several times but as of right now, it is holding up well thus far. While it's not terribly high end, it doesn't have the price tag, either. It is a nice pan at a decent price, and so far is worth the purchase.

Even without a pizza stone, this pan makes great pizza - even moreso when it's been seasoned a bit. The crust is nice and crisp, and everything bakes evenly.For the price, this is a nice pizza pan that should last you a long while. Very much recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CX82SUZ5AYXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017WN890#wasThisHelpful","R1CX82SUZ5AYXI","A38YDXWC0WCO4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38YDXWC0WCO4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I do try to watch what I eat, deep frying is a rare instance in my kitchen. However, once in a while, the need arises and I was in search of a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil.

The mesh is very fine, which will be great for what I plan to use it for (mainly for removing gnocchi from boiling water).

"I purchased this knife set at a special sale last year during the holidays. I figured due to the KitchenAid brand name and an amazing price (about 50% off), I was getting a bargain. Now, here I am 3 months into ownership, and I am glad I did not pay full price for them. They have been a disappointment.First, let's start with the good things about it:* The knives are very sharp. They have cut through everything with ease. They are much sharper than my previous set.* Nice block. It is a very attractive silver gray and looks very classy on my counter top.* Triple riveted full tang handle. Not nearly as good as the full hidden tang of my favorite Royal Doulton bread knife, but it's not bad.That being said, these knives stain SO very easily. After almost 3 months of daily use and gentle washing by hand, the have stained. Not even just the rust spots, either. They look like water spots, though I can't imagine how this has happened. Please see the photo I posted of the stains.So even after quickly noticing the inferior quality of this knife set, I chose to keep it because the knives were sharp and I didn't pay too much for it. If you are going to have to pay full price, however, I recommend considering another brand because these aren't worth the money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSRS8SGTN03FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RFJH1C#wasThisHelpful","RSRS8SGTN03FX","A38YDXWC0WCO4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38YDXWC0WCO4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been through many measuring cups. First, several plastic ones. They all cracked at some point, either the handle or the cup itself. So, I moved on to glass cups.I had previously purchased a similar (but different brand name) glass measuring cup to this one at a local big-box home & kitchen store. After only about one month, I noticed that the red writing on the side was fading off in the dishwasher. Now, after about 3 months, I can barely read the measurement lines.So, I decided to take a chance on this Pyrex cup. I've had it for several months now and I am happy to say that the lines are still nice and bright, even after numerous runs through the dishwasher. It appears very sturdy and heavy duty. I have had no issues whatsoever. Granted, I don't generally use it for anything but cold liquids, but I think that it would hold up to whatever I used it for.All-in-all, this is worth the money.

The grip on the back is amazing, and really hold so they don't slide around under your feet.  The upper side is textured just enough to not be slippery, and they are definitely waterproof.  They fit with limited space between the original curve or the car floor and mat, just enough to make them easily maneuvered into place.

"Whole family enjoyed this thoroughly! I have three kids, 8, 5, and 2, and we were all captivated.  It has a wonderful twist, where as in the original there is the Rat King, this is Nazi's (as bears in her imagination).  The little girl is her own heroine, along with her brothers, mother and a friend.  She 'visits' her father in a POW camp(though it's a dream), and helps him keep hope and faith.  It's a great way to introduce young children to history, and it isn't too graphic or scary(and my kids can be a little overly sensitive, we watch mostly just Veggietales).  The one tense part is a close up of the Nazi bear's sharp teeth, but young Clara is triumphant.  The dancing is wonderful, the costumes beautiful, and the storyline caught me completely off guard in the best way!  I am sure that this will be a yearly family favorite, and I would recommend this to ANY family!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HXWGUKCTEMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7VMPMG#wasThisHelpful","R14HXWGUKCTEMY","A370LEGDL7SL3N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370LEGDL7SL3N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Still the same great white chocolate flavor and smoothness of the original. The new bar is simply thinner and easier to break than the old square. Another plus is that it melts faster! Before, two thick rectangles in a square was 1 ounce, now it's four thinner rectangles that make an ounce. It also contains no hydrogenated oils like other brands, which was my biggest  draw. Cocoa butter is the second ingredient behind sugar, with a little milk and flavors. We used ours to cover pretzels and make peanut clusters.

"Writing a fundraising letter is easy. Lots of people do it every day.Writing a GOOD fundraising letter - one that grabs the donor’s attention, touches her heart, and motivates her to give - now that’s hard work. And it happens a lot less often.Jeff Brooks (disclosure: a longtime colleague and friend) has been writing the best kind of fundraising for many years. He knows what sets fundraising copywriting apart from every other kind of writing. And fortunately for us, he’s willing to pull back the curtain on the counterintuitive world of fundraising to help you focus your fundraising where it should be focused … not on your organization, not even on your cause … but on your donor.Jeff takes the guesswork out of writing by explaining how to tell a story effectively, how to build a compelling offer, even what to do when a problem feels too big to solve (“How can my $25 cure cancer?”). Along the way, you’ll learn why fundraisers write in that style that makes English teachers cringe, why humor and symbolism almost never work, and how to defend your work to your director, board, or client.Jeff is a great writer, but also (and also) a great teacher. Whether you’re new to the discipline or have been in the field a long time, I’ll bet you will learn a lot from this slim book, and gain a new appreciation for the value of your work. I know I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6DCZJEL5WI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1889102555#wasThisHelpful","R3O6DCZJEL5WI2","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptical about both the quality and the comfort of this shirt, and was pleasantly surprised. It's still just a basic blue T-shirt, but as such items go, it's not bad at all. One thing I was concerned about was that the high percentage of polyester in the construction (40%) might make this feel like the plastic-y shirts I wear for working out - fit for purpose, but not something I grab just to get dressed. But in fact, this shirt doesn't feel a lot different from many of the 100 percent cotton T-shirts I have. This is on the thinner/lighter side, but so are many of those other, often more expensive, shirts. If you're looking for something like this, don't be spooked by the price or the fact it's not a name brand.

"I have to admit I don't get the horological fad of both men and women wearing huge clunky watches. I wear this two or three times a week, and honestly, the most noticeable thing about it is its weight. It is certainly an attractive watch, but not one I've made a regular part of my daily routine.I would point out a few problems. The watch face is white, with gold Roman numerals and gold and silver gears. The hands are also white with gold edges, which means the hands do not stand out against the face at all. Threading the band is complicated - at least it was for me. I worked on it for some time, though my wife wants me to point out that once I handed it to her, she figured it out instantly. ""Instantly."" Also, because of the large metal parts and hinge in the clasp, the band does not lie smoothly against the wrist was would other types of bands. The fit is always slightly distorted (and uncomfortable) because of a roughly inch long piece of metal against the inside of your wrist. Finally, because this watch mechanism is an ""automatic self-wind"" that depends on the wearer's movement to keep ticking, if you're like me and only wear the thing once in a while, you'll have to reset the time a lot.This watch isn't going to replace my iPhone as my principle time-telling device: Even when I was wearing this, I found myself taking my phone out of my pocket to find out the time (though granted, that may just be because I'm out of practice wearing a watch). This is an ornament - like all expensive watches, or watches that want to look expensive, are - and as long as I keep that in mind, it's satisfactory enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TPPVO4D85FNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXHKG6#wasThisHelpful","R2TPPVO4D85FNB","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I have a beard, a tube, can, or jar of shaving cream or soap tends to last me a long time. That's a good thing in this case, because I like this foam-free shaving cream a lot. Like the name says, the fact that my face isn't covered in suds or lather makes it much easier to negotiate the beard line or other places I want to get right by sight, instead of just by feel or muscle memory.

The sound quality is decent, but lacks the immediacy and clarity of either in-ear or cover-the-ear models.

"Although not explicitly intended as a companion volume to editor Sonja Tiernan's 2012 biography Eva Gore-Booth: An image of such politics, I think that's how this impressive collection functions best. Certainly my copy of the biography now includes, next to mentions of or quotations from Eva's writings, my annotations of the relevant page numbers in the Political Writings. Making those connections would have been easier had this book listed the writings by title in either a table of contents or an index (many are sub-indexed under media type: ""articles by Gore-Booth,"" ""pamphlets by Gore-Booth,"" etc.), but they are listed chronologically under large umbrella topics.This book would be impressive enough if it were just a collection of Eva Gore-Booth's writings: Since many of those works, particularly from Eva's early years in trade-union activism, were topical pamphlets not intended to have a long lifespan, finding those works and reprinting them here is itself an achievement. But the book includes a useful introduction, and each of the three main parts includes the editor's scholarly review of the content and context of Eva's work. As the frequent appearance of Tiernan's own name in the listing of ""Selected Works about Eva Gore-Booth"" at the back shows, Tiernan must be the preeminent expert on Eva's life today. This book isn't just an appendix to the biography, but an important addition to the historical record in its own right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZU1TIDW7FU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0719097681#wasThisHelpful","R3MZU1TIDW7FU0","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many people, I imagine, I came to know of Eva Gore-Booth through reading about her sister, the Irish revolutionary Constance Markievicz. I think Countess Markievicz a very interesting historical figure, but for reasons I still can't quite define, I find myself fascinated by Eva Gore-Booth. Sadly, while probably about a dozen biographies of the Countess have been written in the last 80 years, there appear to be only two treatments of her sister's life at any length: 1988's dual biography Eva Gore-Booth and Esther Roper: A Biography (Valient Women Series) by Gifford Lewis, and this book by Sonja Tiernan. This latter book is a remarkable book, and was completely worth the eagerness with which I waited for it to come through the door. I recommend it highly.Eva Gore-Booth is unquestionably a challenge for the biographer. Unlike her sister, who loved to put herself on center stage figuratively and literally, Eva by temperament as well as health tended to keep herself in the wings. While active in, and indeed central to, many of the causes most important to her, that nature often caused her to be overlooked at the time, and forgotten since. Compounding the difficulty, Eva kept her private life very private indeed, and many of her personal papers were destroyed or returned to her family following her death. Even after the impressive and thorough degree of research Sonja Tiernan did to prepare this biography, then, Eva remains something of a cypher on the personal level.In that earlier biography, Gifford Lewis states that a further reason Eva is often overlooked is because of the alleged difficulty in describing, or as we would say today, ""labeling,"" her relationship with Esther Roper. Eva and Esther met in what sounds a lot like a case of love at first sight, and remained together until Eva's death thirty years later -- indeed, they remain together still, buried under a common headstone in a London churchyard. Lewis argues at some length that the two were friends, collaborators, each other's inspiration ... ""life partners"" in every sense of the term except the physical. Theirs was a ""passionate,"" even ""ecstatic"" friendship, Lewis says, but they were emphatically not lovers. At considerably less length but with compelling logic, Sonja Tiernan says ""yes they were."" This may be a question we never get an answer to, but personally I find Tiernan's argument more persuasive.Where this book really shines is in the analysis of Eva's public work: her life as a union organizer, suffragist, feminist, and antiwar activist, as well as a poet, artist, and religious and sexual reformer. In all those fields, although she was a tireless worker and excellent organizer, Eva's principal tool was her pen, and Tiernan analyzes both Eva's deeds and her words in satisfying detail (I strongly encourage you to read this book with a copy of The political writings of Eva Gore-Booth, which Tiernan edited, by your side: Nearly all the works quoted in the biography are printed in full in the latter book, and are definitely worth reading). I was particularly interested in Eva's work in opposition to World War I and in support of conscientious objectors (readers also interested in this topic should check out Adam Hochschild's To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918, a well-told history of British opposition to the war, although -- perhaps in confirmation of challenge I described above -- Eva's name does not appear in its pages). The other topic I was particularly intrigued by was Eva and Esther's work with Urania, the journal they founded to promote feminism and ""unconventional views regarding sexuality and gender"" (p. 227). One of my standards for measuring the worth of a book is how many other things that book inspires me to read. My to-read list is a lot longer now as a result of this biography -- starting with trying to find a decent copy of Eva's Collected Poems. (I'm just not sure if I can trust all these $15 reprint volumes.)I hope this book and the Political Writings succeed in bringing a bit of attention to the life of Eva Gore-Booth. She deserves not simply the reflected light of her acclaimed sister, but a spotlight of her own in the literary, political, and social history of both the UK and Ireland. Sonja Tiernan, in turn, deserves thanks for reminding us of that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KM3EL3IBUGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0719082323#wasThisHelpful","R26KM3EL3IBUGH","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I handed this case off to my wife for her to use on her iPhone 6, and her verdict is much like that of other reviewers here: The leather is a nice touch, giving a sort of sophisticated look to the phone and a comfortable enough feel in the hand, but it doesn't add very much protection to the unadorned phone. But how much protection you really need depends on your use case, I guess, and so she's pretty satisfied on the whole. The case fairly soon started to show some wear on the lower corners, and that continues to be the most visible sign of use. But she likes the bright yellow, which stands out nicely when you're looking for your phone across a room or in a dark briefcase. It's not exactly armor, but maybe that's not what everyone needs.(Edited a couple of months later to add: My wife has now officially retired this case with the ruling, ""It looks okay, but the materials wear out too soon and look bad as they do."" It's hard to disagree. After about five months of use, the leather is separating from the plastic case all along the left side and on the upper right corner.

"There are a lot of things I like about the iPhone 6, but one of my favorite improvements is that it no longer spontaneously crashes when the battery meter reaches 20 percent or so (a ""feature"" of the iPhone 5 that was not unique to me). That makes an external battery case like this one less essential for daily use, at least in my case, but still a very good thing to have for travel or other long days away from a plug. The brushed black finish is pretty sharp to look at and comfortable to hold, although obviously the battery adds noticeable weight.

"I bought this book and the second title by the author, I admit, because I was intrigued by the idea of a murder mystery series set in Sugar Land, Texas, a community just south of my home and where I've spent a fair amount of time. (The fact that the author, like me, lives with ""two badly behaved pugs"" also helped.) What kept me reading, though, was the well-crafted story and an ending that didn't give itself away too soon.One of the intriguing things about this book was that I didn't actually like our narrator Walker ""Bear"" Wells very much. There was a lot about how he related to other characters that I found unpleasant -- and not in a curmudgeonly-but-ultimately-endearing way like, say Inspector Morse. The fact that other characters called Bear on this behavior from time to time helped, though, and reassured me that first-time novelist Stephanie Jaye Evans hadn't fallen into the trap of creating an idealized superhero as her lead character. Bear is a very fallible man.The other thing I found interesting is that Bear is not really attempting to solve the murder in this story. He's content to let the Chesterton-reading Detective Wanderley do that. Instead, Bear keeps -- as the back cover blurb puts it -- finding himself and his family wrapped up in the mystery. There's a lot more I could say about this, but it could cross the line into spoilers.One final point to note, since this is ""A Sugar Land Mystery,"" is how nicely the author captures the atmospherics of suburban Houston -- which is to say, there basically *are* no atmospherics. Fort Bend County is the most ethnically diverse county in America, and this shows up in a few ways on these pages. But readers from other parts of the country who might expect a whole lotta Texas flavor here may be disappointed -- the front-cover blurb from Susan Wittig Albert about ""down-home Texas twang"" notwithstanding (I would recommend the pre-sword and sorcery Tres Navarre novels of Rick Riordan, set in San Antonio, for readers looking for that sort of thing; start with Big Red Tequila). Detective Wanderley sports an admirable collection of boots, and Bear himself is practically royalty, having once been a starter on the University of Texas football team, but on the whole Sugar Land is pretty standard-issue suburbia, and that in fact is reflected here quite accurately.As usual, my to-read pile is pretty huge, but I'm looking forward to getting into Safe From Harm (A Sugar Land Mystery) as soon as I can, and then keeping my eyes out hopefully for a third title in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A80YSTXNLH5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF5KDHI#wasThisHelpful","R2A80YSTXNLH5K","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I've been a fan of Will Thomas' from the first time I picked up the initial Barker and Llewelyn novel in 2006 (shortly after I met Thomas and his family, entirely by coincidence, in a London pub; in the interests of disclosure I'll say I haven't been in contact with him since), I hadn't realized quite how much I'd missed the pair until the second or third chapter of ""Fatal Enquiry."" After that, I pretty much read straight through to the end with minimal interruptions. Readers who've been drumming their fingers waiting for this latest addition to the series will find a lot that's rewarding here, and a lot that pays off the wait. But as many other reviewers have suggested, there is something different about this Barker and Llewelyn title that makes it, in some key ways, a big departure for the series.As I've noted in most or maybe all of my reviews of earlier Barker and Llewelyn books, Will Thomas' standard approach is to put us in a setting that's probably relatively recognizable to most mystery readers -- late-nineteenth century London -- but then carries us into much less familiar segments of that era's society -- Irish revolutionaries, Chinese immigrants, London's Jewish community, and so on. (Of course, being Scottish and Welsh respectively, Barker and Llewelyn are also outsiders to a fair degree.) ""Fatal Enquiry"" has very little of that occasionally unsettling blend of familiar and unfamiliar. That's because in this book, Barker and Llewelyn are not master and student trying to catch their criminal prey, but are themselves the prey, marked for destruction by Barker's oldest and most dangerous foe, Col. Sebastian Nightwine.I really liked the way the premise of the story was introduced in chapter one, with Barker's police friend Poole coming to tell him a VIP had requested Scotland Yard's protection from a potential attacker ... the attacker being Barker himself, with Nightwine the VIP. After that, Barker and Llewelyn's world collapses around them ... quickly, disorientingly, and by this series' standards, quite violently. Characterization sometimes felt a bit too ... ""too."" Barker and even Llewelyn a bit too superhuman, Nightwine a bit too Moriarty, with his fingers on every lever of power. The one ""character"" who came out beautifully well-defined and evocative was, as always, London itself.I think we learn more about Barker in this book than in the rest of the series put together. Readers following the series will want to read this one for that reason alone, I think, but even with my reservations noted above this is a good entry in an excellent series. I've found Will Thomas' work to be the Lake Wobegon of mystery series: all the books are above average. By that standard, even a title that some may find disappointing is still worth reading. It's definitely enough to make me start drumming my fingers waiting for the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4ONOY48MGGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQ67V04#wasThisHelpful","R1P4ONOY48MGGK","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEADCritics cited on various other websites seem to have dismissed ""Jo"" as a collection of cop-show clichés. I don't think it's quite that simple. Certainly creator/writer/producer Rene Balcer, writer and showrunner of the original ""Law & Order"" and other parts of the L&O universe, and his team made use of some familiar (and useful, and largely successful) building blocks from L&O days. I might arguably describe that as lazy writing, but not, on that basis alone, as bad writing.I'm an L&O fan, but I was attracted to this by the fact that my favorite actress, the magnificent Orla Brady, plays the Anita Van Buren/Don Cragen role as ""Commissaire Béatrice Dormont."" My first thought was that this would be ""Law & Order: Rive Gauche."" It wasn't quite that, although the familiar elements mentioned above range from the wisecrack at the fade into the opening credits, to the detective estranged from his adult daughter in part because of his own demons and addictions, to the Ell-Tee with lessons hard-won from years of sobriety. There were probably many more. Episode Six nods at the L&O universe with a guest appearance from Sam Waterston (not playing Jack McCoy). I imagine nearly everyone who knows L&O was hoping, as I was, they could contrive to get his character and series regular Jill Hennessy's into a scene together. Episode Eight, which turned out to be the final one of the series, places the show entirely within the L&O universe with the appearance of a well-known recurring character from one of the spinoffs.I didn't have a problem with the plots, but I did find the dialogue surprisingly wooden sometimes. Tom Austen's lines in the earlier eps, especially, often seemed very awkward (again, this isn't about his performance, but about the writing). Some critics evidently said the show didn't do enough to highlight the Paris scenery. I thought, on the other hand, it did a good job of demythologizing the City of Light and making it a city of actual people.For me as for some others, the big question mark was someone's decision to have all of these allegedly French people (with the exception of Jean Reno, who really is French) speak in terrible, flat American accents. Having to listen to Orla Brady swallow her natural Irish accent in order to deliver lines like ""Well, you need to get up there and show `em how it's done"" or ""This two-bit drug dealer..."" while sounding like she was from Akron or something was one of the true crimes in each episode. On the other hand, Jo had a memorable bit in Episode Five: ""He was looking at her the way a man looks at a woman. He's the warden. He should be looking at her the way a grocer looks at oranges."" Even Lenny Briscoe couldn't have gotten away with a line like that.Be sure to note the wonderfully atmospheric score by Danish jazz artist and composer Thomas Hass Christensen. Reminiscent of Miles Davis' minimalist score for Elevator to the Gallows (The Criterion Collection) (""Ascenseur pour l'échafaud""), it really helps set the mood for the series.On the whole, I liked ""Jo"" and thought future series, had there been any, could have had a lot of promise. This is a weird little satellite orbiting on the outer edges of the L&O universe, but it was not in the least an unpleasant place to visit. Even though only eight episodes were made, it's good to know we'll always have Paris.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CW3IB6DYCLEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CVVH2IY#wasThisHelpful","R3CW3IB6DYCLEH","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the 1994 publication of the scripts of three plays that premiered together in London in March, 1993. To quote the Times Educational Supplement review that forms the foreword to the book, ""'A Love Song for Ulster' chronicles the history of a family from the arranged marriage between John, a stolid, decent Protestant, and Kate, a beautiful, tempestuous Catholic free spirit..."" At the premiere, Kate was played by my favorite actress, the magnificent Orla Brady (Mistresses, Proof), while Brendan Coyle (later Masterpiece Downton Abbey's ""Mr. Bates"") played both John and their son Boyd (the playwright specified that both roles should be performed by the same actor).Kate is a wife and mother, and as the TES review says, the trilogy is the story of several generations of her family. But the family is also metaphor for the history of Northern Ireland from the partition to the then-contemporary peace effort. Each family member or supporting character essentially stands in, as best  I can tell, for various Ulster populations and/or political opinions. John and Kate's house -- all three plays are set entirely within the house's walls or near exterior -- becomes a representation of Northern Ireland itself, with Kate's children and various outsiders battling for control. I was particularly moved by the central relationship between John and Kate themselves: two people who, although forced together against their will, eventually develop mutual respect and even love, only to have what they built fought over and destroyed from both inside and out. It's ambitious storytelling, and from the reviews printed on the book cover it sounds like it was well received. Certainly I found the story compelling. I don't know if ""A Love Song for Ulster"" is ever performed anymore, but I'd enjoy a chance to see it -- particularly if the original cast were to reprise their roles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R43PNYBWAVXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1854592602#wasThisHelpful","R2R43PNYBWAVXB","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know about ""tranquility"" or islands of serenity or any of the other cosmic virtues claimed for this water bottle, but I can absolutely attest that it performs its function of holding water admirably. The top unscrews in two places — a wider mouth just above the top of the soft blue lining, and then a smaller one just below the circular handle. That makes this easy to fill with ice and liquid, and then easy to drink neatly. The ring on top makes this easy to carry, and the bottle is somewhat insulated too, so drinks stay cold. The bottle is a bit wide for many car cup-holders, which is a minor complaint, but otherwise I like this bottle a lot and use it almost daily.

"I watched this for free last night on Amazon Instant Video, and I still think the price was too high. To borrow, with apologies, from the previous reviewer of a decade ago, even if you like Mia Sara, you will not enjoy this film.Mia Sara became my favorite actress a long time ago, and held that position even as she became, to use her own phrase, ""mostly retired,"" her work became more sporadic, and someone else ascended rapidly to become what I could call ""my favorite actress who isn't mostly retired."" As consolation, if any were needed, Mia has also become a favorite poet: google the phrase ""Mia Sara Writes"" or take a tumbl with ""where to find Mia Sara"" and I think you'll be favorably impressed.Sadly, there was not much favorable or impressive about ""Shadows in the Storm."" Reviewers on IMDB describe this as writer-director Terrell Tannen's attempt at a neo-noir, and that seems accurate to me. He didn't succeed, though. The plot matches the broadest description of a noir plot, that being the story of a man who makes a bad decision and then is helpless to prevent the consequences of that decision from destroying him. And the setting in the California woods did remind me of parts of Out Of The Past [HD]. The near-constant darkness and rain worked too. But unlike the typically convoluted, even indecipherable, noir plot, I figured out what was up here very, very quickly. I expected to be squicked by the idea of a romantic pairing between 21-year-old Mia Sara and 51-year-old Ned Beatty (see also 28-year-old Mia's character being sent to seduce 62-year-old Michael Caine in Bullet to Beijing), but it did make sense in the context of the plot, while their one un-graphic and un-sexy sex scene only lasted about 20 seconds, which seemed true-to-life for a man in Ned's condition. And there's at least one plot hole in the resolution that even someone with eyesight as bad as Thelonious Pitt's (yes, that's Ned's character's name) should have been able to see through.Still, Mia is luminous -- not only herownself, but because for most of the movie she's in white sweaters or dresses that seem to glow in the murky woods or interiors. When she suddenly appears in a black leather jacket in bright daylight, you know something has changed. This was a tough movie to watch for several reasons -- and also to listen to, O bad '80s soundtrack entirely disconnected from the mood of the film. At one point late in the story, Mia's character is sitting in a motel room watching the noir classic D.O.A. -- specifically, the scene where Edmond O'Brien is told ""You're already dead."" Sad that that should have been the most dramatic moment in this film.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CVOWPV2DENHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Y38DG2#wasThisHelpful","R1CVOWPV2DENHS","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On the morning after George P. Bush scored a decisive victory in the Republican primary race for land commissioner in Texas, and when his father Jeb is already showing up in some polls as a frontrunner for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, it's clear that the Bush family's place as America's preeminent political dynasty is as secure today as it has ever been. That makes ""Family of Secrets,"" even though it's a few years old now, very far from (to use a Clintonian term) ""old news."" In fact, it may be getting more important.Russ Baker is an experienced and perceptive investigative journalist, and is very aware -- as he notes in his final chapter -- that in exploring the ""powerful forces"" surrounding the Bush family he is skirting the bounds of ""conspiracy theory."" Some would say, and have said, he crossed those bounds. But he has amassed some pretty powerful evidence behind his revelations. Going well beyond the popular images of George H.W. Bush (""Poppy"") as the genial but ineffective and out-of-touch preppy and his son as the bumptious, inarticulate ""decider"" whose strings were pulled by Cheney and Rumsfeld, Baker also doesn't settle for what you might call the next-level of Bush ""revelations"" (""Prescott Bush ran businesses for the Nazis,"" etc.). Instead, he covers a remarkable amount of ground across three generations, showing how the Bush family, and Poppy in particular, were and are central to political and business interests that have dominated the American state for half a century or more.By coincidence, I was reading ""Family of Secrets"" more or less simultaneously with Stephen Kinzer's outstanding The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War. Although the Dulles name appears only passingly in ""Family of Secrets"" and the Bush name, from what I recall, not at all in ""The Brothers,"" the two families have a lot in common. Each occupies that spot on the Venn diagram where big business interests, U.S. foreign policy, and the world of intelligence, espionage, and covert action converge. Almost a decade ago, in reviewing Tom Wicker's marginal George Herbert Walker Bush: A Penguin Life (Penguin Lives Biographies), I wrote ""George H.W. Bush strikes me as an interesting historical figure whose legacy (like J.Q. Adams' or William Howard Taft's) will be seen as coming from someplace other than his years in the White House."" I'm now convinced by Russ Baker that Poppy's primary legacy -- aside perhaps from his raft of children and grandchildren -- will be his integration of electoral politics and intelligence tradecraft -- an integration that affects, and to some degree explains, so much of the nature of the modern American state. In fact, many of Baker's most important discoveries concern Poppy's long and intimate connections with America's intelligence elite -- long predating his brief service as CIA director.In that final chapter I mentioned above, Baker writes that he thought of titling this book ""Everything You Thought You Knew Is Wrong."" Not many people like books -- or the writers of books -- who threaten their certainties in that way. I encourage you to take the risk and give this book a close reading ... not only for what you'll discover about America's past, but even more critically, because of what it means for our future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XS382W06I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002T45028#wasThisHelpful","R12XS382W06I4","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find it slightly hilarious that the box instructions for using this on hair say something like ""apply from middle of strand to end."" Given how short my hair is, application is kind of an all-or-nothing affair. I'm finding that about a quarter-pump, or even slightly less, is a great amount for keeping hair neat and under control without looking like I got into either my dad's Brylcreem or my son's ""sculpting gel"" (disclosure: Dad didn't use Brylcreem, and I don't have a son). I've also used this as a beard-treatment, and while my beard again might be too short to get the full ""nourishing"" benefit, it does at least smell nice.And finally, I also use this as a moisturizer from time to time. Obviously — since it's an oil — it will leave a more ""oily"" feeling on the skin than the moisturizing lotions I currently use from Dove or Aveeno. When once again used sparingly, though, this oiliness is noticeable only to the touch, not to sight. And again, it does smell nice.I don't use this on either hair or skin on a daily basis. More like a couple of times a week. So think even a two-ounce bottle will probably last me for some time. Given what a nice and versatile treat this has turned out to be — particularly for keeping hair under control when needed — that makes the price much more palatable than it would be if I was burning through this quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXU4VA1XUQU3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUF29WU#wasThisHelpful","RXU4VA1XUQU3K","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Amazon's recent decision to set a time limit on Vine reviews means a clock is ticking behind you as you read. For I think the first time, I'm posting a review of a book I haven't finished yet. So far, ""Wilson"" is a very readable look at the life of a man who few today remember was, and certainly seemed to think of himself as, a Southerner. Although he served as governor of New Jersey, as well as president of Princeton, and so is sort of officially remembered as being ""from"" that state, Wilson was in fact born in Virginia and raised in various parts of the South -- including spending the years of the Late Unpleasantness on the CSA side of the lines -- and studied at both Davidson College in North Carolina and the UVA law school, although he left both before completing his studies. Author A. Scott Berg is doing a fine job showing how Wilson's early years in the South, as well as the influence of his Scottish and Scots-Irish ancestry, shaped the man, both in general terms and on race relations and other specific issues.As president, of course, Wilson has much to answer to history for -- I'm far from the only person to see his decision to embroil the US in World War One as central not only to sowing the seeds for the second war, but indeed for the red and brown revolutions that followed WW1. He is thus, arguably, the man most responsible for the sanguinary course of the rest of the twentieth century. Wilson's messianic sense of himself is only beginning to show so far, though it is interesting to note that Berg's chapter titles (""Ascension,"" ""Eden,"" ""Sinai,"" ""Disciples,"" ""Gethsemane,"" and so on) as well as his decision to head each chapter with a Bible verse, seems suggestive of more than simple Scots Presbyterianism. Even if I'm not reading this as quickly as the invisible forces shaping the Vine program might prefer, this is been pretty rewarding so far and I'm looking forward to what comes next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VR9RN7GJNGZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159215#wasThisHelpful","R3VR9RN7GJNGZH","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a relatively recent convert to the virtues of safety razor, tub of shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce is my pick), and badger brush, I'd been looking for a small travel brush to carry with me on my infrequent trips. This little tool from Baxter of California is a fine choice. The way the brush screws onto the case to form the handle is clever, while the fact that the lid securing the brush inside the case has a hole on top to help drying and air flow may be downright ingenious. The first few uses reveal a certain badger-y scent to the bristles, and I've noticed one or two falling out into my tub of cream, but both of those are standard for any badger brush and not excessive in this case. And the smell of course diminishes with use. Be sure to dry the brush thoroughly after use and I expect to get a lot of use out of this.

"""Triumph and Tragedy"" may be something of a cliché in book-titling (at least it seems that way to me), but ""My Promised Land"" is one book where that descriptor is really deserved. Author Ari Shavit does an excellent, and moving, job describing how, as he sees it, the triumphant accomplishments of Zionism and early Israeli independence have been squandered by Israel's tragic turn to becoming an occupationist, imperial state. The ""anyone who..."" endorsement may be equally clichéd, but I believe anyone who is interested in Middle Eastern politics, Israel, or the Jewish people and their history could find much food for thought here.Shavit weaves a great many strands together in these pages, so it's hard to summarize all he discusses in his review of Zionist settlement in Palestine. His profiles of Jewish settlers, pioneers, entrepreneurs, and others who helped build the young nation create a complex but informative picture of what it means to be Israeli.At the same time they were tilling the soil, draining the wetlands, and building new lives in a new land, however, the settlers all too often overlooked or ignored the Palestinian inhabitants, Shavit argues. In fact, the line some Zionists used, ""A people without a land for a land without a people,"" wasn't even remotely true. As the book progresses, Shavit introduces us to more and more of these Palestinians -- including Palestinian Israelis -- and the dimensions of tragedy underlying the triumph begin to take shape. In many ways, the centerpiece of the book for me was the chapter ""Peace, 1993,"" describing the time that year when Shavit brought a 70-year-old Palestinian friend back to the site of Hulda, his ancestral village destroyed in the 1948 war. Before then, Shavit recounts, Jewish and Palestinian residents shared a respectful, if not intimate, coexistence. Then, during the war following the Israeli declaration of independence, the Jewish army shelled the village, driving out his friend's family and all the other residents. ""It is precisely here,"" Shavit writes, ""...that the Jews crossed the threshold between the commune's olive groves and Jamal Munheir's fields and entered the forbidden. For the first time in eighteen hundred years, Jewish soldiers employed a large, organized force to take another people's land.... Here, by the old well of Hulda, we moved from one phase of our history to another, from one sphere of morality to another"" (p. 251).As I said, the scope of Shavit's work -- drawing on his decades as an active journalist -- is quite broad. Interviews range from Palestinian refugees like Jamal Munheir to leading Israeli writers, politicians, and scientists, including some of the ones who created Israel still-officially-nonexistent nuclear weapons. More than anything else I can recall reading, ""My Promised Land"" made clear the dueling forces in Israeli history and society -- the pioneer spirit contrasting with the contemporary desire for less work and more play, the contrasting dreams of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews coming to their promised land, the idealism and the realism, the desire to create a new world and the inability to escape history. Yes, triumph and tragedy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24CBY1KUVSPWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385521707#wasThisHelpful","R24CBY1KUVSPWM","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We already had a similar in-car charger from another retailer in use in our car, but this Belkin unit beats it hands-down and immediately became something we got into the habit of using almost every time we get into the car. As other reviewers have mentioned, both plugs in this Belkin charger work to charge iPhones or iPads, whereas on our other unit, only one does. Also, the other unit came with a charging cord that's something like 12 feet long, which is a little ridiculous for in-car use. The much shorter Belkin cord seems much better suited for this use, long enough not to be constricting, but not so long as to become a nuisance. Because of where the charger is plugged in, I don't get to enjoy the cool blue light that much, but even that is helpful when I do need to unplug a cable or just reach into the storage area where the plug is located.

"Two comparisons. probably pretentious, come to mind for how to describe ""Class A: Baseball in the Middle of Everywhere.""

Now, I don't have a problem with that per se: I think it's an interesting way for Mann to have framed his work, and also saved him the problem of trying to describe -- and us the tedium of having to read about -- a whole season of Class-A baseball. Still, anyone expecting this to be a book ""about"" baseball and baseball games is likely to be disappointed.The other comparison is to the work of George Plimpton, in that Lucas Mann makes himself very much part of the story he's telling. In this case, he isn't a ball player, though he has personal experience as a high school player and lifelong fan. Instead of reportorial objectivity and distance, Mann makes himself part of the Clinton fan community (especially the serious fans known as the ""Baseball Family""), and -- though he never quite succeeds -- also tries to be buddies with the players, managers, and coaches. This leads to a lot more personal reflection, personal insights, and recounting of personal history than you're likely to find on, say, the sports page. It also made it difficult for me to get beyond about page 200 of the book.Clinton, dwarfed by the local ADM plant that evidently fills the air with pollutants, struck me as a depressing sort of place, the town a shadow of its former self. Minor-league baseball has some of that air about it too, with the arrogance and self-assurance of players on their way up contrasted with the desperation or resigned inevitability of those on their way down or, maybe worse, not on their way anywhere. Even the team name, ""LumberKings,"" derives from a long-gone era in the town's history. The managers are once-promising players who years after their own brushes with stardom, as Mann memorably puts it, still wear pants with elastic waistbands to work every day. Even the play-by-play announcer dreams of getting out of town the way the better players get to. Baseball brings some life into the community, but also seems to add to the cloud of desperation. Its an interesting balance, and even though I never entirely connected with Lucas Mann or the people or place he was describing, I do admire his attempt at describing it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6Q53B4760U6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307907546#wasThisHelpful","R6Q53B4760U6O","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I requested this item pretty much solely for one reason: to use as a wifi repeater here in my office, where my iPhone and iPad often lose their connection with the wireless router on the other side of the house. I can't comment on the other functions this device can perform, but I can note that as a repeater, it works pretty well. Setup was complicated a bit for the reasons other reviewers have explained, most notably a heavy use of IT jargon in the installation and troubleshooting documents. But once I navigated through that (and a minor security-settings issue that was my fault, not the device's), I did get a strong signal that my iPhone and iPad latched onto immediately.The problem then became that my laptop, which is also in the office and on the wifi network, began to generate ""self-assigned IP address"" errors and dropping its connection. None of the several solutions offered on the Internet fixed this for long. I will note that the TP-LINK's box says the product ""is designed for use with tablets, smartphones and handheld game consoles,"" so maybe the laptop put too heavy a load on the device? I don't know about that. But I've since hit on the substitute idea of using this as a wifi repeater for when I'm in the backyard with one of my devices -- no laptop there. I plugged this into one of my house's exterior outlets and again, it worked great with my phone. I do not leave it plugged in outside all the time, obviously. Only when I'm outside myself and need it. But that's a use case where this fits the bill just fine.

"It may be true, as Daniel Cappello notes in the introduction to this attractive and useful book, that ""schools outside the Ivy League, including the so-called 'Ivy Plus' universities (such as Stanford, Duke, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Chicago), actually provide a more rigorous scholastic experience than their Ivy counterparts."" Nevertheless, the Ivy League, he argues, retains ""an unquantifiable distinction factor that eludes empirical educational value and worth. ... To some extent, the old-school idea of the Ivy League continues to define it, and is one that Ivy Leaguers still cling to. It is also one that looms large in the popular imagination."" It's this ""old-school idea,"" the ""unquantifiable distinction factor,"" that Cappello attempts to define for the Ivy League colleges. He paints what struck me, as admitted outsider who's paid but brief visits to only three of these campuses, as fine individual portraits of eight very different schools, yet also shows what they have in common -- what sets ""what might be seen as one of the most successful and singularly American brands"" apart from other schools.Cappello starts with the Big Three: Harvard (""the Ivy's Ivy""), Yale (""the classic Ivy""), and Princeton (""the preppy Ivy""). He then moves on to Brown (""the hip Ivy""), Dartmouth (""the rugged Ivy""), Columbia (""the urbane Ivy""), Penn (""the entrepreneurial Ivy""), and finally Cornell (""the Ivy for every man""). Each chapter is colorfully illustrated with an assortment of historic and contemporary images, including campus landscapes, portraits of alumni and current students, and classic athletic programs. His text not only describes each school's history, but also its current character and distinctiveness. Among the topics I found particularly interesting were his discussion of Brown as what someone else described as ""the daycare center of the Democratic Party"" and preferred school of Hollywood and Euro-elites; Columbia's close ties to neighboring Harlem; and the ""discreet, almost philosophical nonchalance"" of Yale and its students. Readers who, like me, are interested in the ""Ivy League"" style of dress, and have studied relevant books like Ivy Style: Radical Conformists, Take Ivy, or The Ivy Look: Classic American Clothing - An Illustrated Pocket Guide will be pleased to know that Cappello hasn't stinted in this area -- particularly in the chapters on Yale and Princeton.Again, though, I return to the beautiful photos. This could easily be described as an Ivy League photo album, and you could certainly browse it as such. But then you'd miss the very good writing that goes along with the colorful and well-chosen images, and that would be a shame.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4BQJ2PF5S6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1614280096#wasThisHelpful","RT4BQJ2PF5S6B","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""Tipsy in Madras,"" Matt Walker and Marissa Walsh take the several pages about drinking sprinkled through The Official Preppy Handbook (""TOPH"") and expand the idea to an entire 200-page book. The pastel design on the cover even recalls the red and blue madras pattern on the original. While this is clearly derivative of the original ... who cares? ""Tipsy in Madras"" is an entertaining, well done, and also quite practical look at the lost world of preppy imbibing.Like TOPH's famous ""Preppy Value System"" of consistency, nonchalance, charm, and the rest, Walker and Walsh propose some preppy-drinking guidelines, including availability (ie, did the drink exist in the '80s?), archaism (did it exist *before* the '80s?), efficiency (""the drink with the fewest ingredients is the preppiest""), and so on. As they describe various drinks, they helpfully include information on who drank it then, who's likely to be drinking it now, how to accessorize, and more. It's often these suggestions that are the funniest part of the book, but it's all pretty good. Whether you want to re-live those long-lost days at cottage, campus, or club during the Reagan administration in book form, or are looking to recreate them more energetically with a few carefully-selected bottles, finding a copy of this and adding it to your bookshelf isn't a bad idea at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQDOLM6M4AHW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399529853#wasThisHelpful","RQDOLM6M4AHW5","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When my wife and I left the New York City area for Texas early this year, I knew there would be things I'd miss and things I wouldn't. Pretty much at the top of my list of things I wish I was still in town for is the Ivy Style exhibit at the Museum at FIT. So I eagerly awaited what I hoped would be the next best thing, the publication of this book. Now I'm of mixed opinion. Parts of this book, like the curate's egg, are excellent. Other parts are quite good if not as obviously relevant to the topic. Then there's what felt like filler.Importantly, this book is not ""about"" the FIT exhibit: There are many beautiful photos from the exhibition, but not enough to make up for not having been there. ""Ivy Style"" the book is meant to accompany the exhibition, and cover the topic in near-academic style. There's some serious analysis going on here, a long, long, *long* way from The Official Preppy Handbook.The centerpiece of the book is a wonderful interview with Richard Press, grandson of the founder of J. Press and himself a former president of the business. His words more than anything else laid out the fundamentals and evolution of Ivy style. Bruce Boyer's excellent chapter on the intersection of jazz and Ivy in the 1950s is fascinating and important reading, while Masafumi Monden's look at ""Ivy in Japan"" highlights where the flame is perhaps burning most brightly today. Patricia Mears' historical overviews tie things together well.Other chapters were more problematic for me. Peter McNeil's ""The Duke of Windsor and the Creation of the 'Soft Look'"" was an interesting look at one of the great icons of classic men's style, but despite the author's efforts seemed only tangentially related to Ivy style. The next chapter, ""Ivy Britannicus"" by Christopher Breward, was similarly interesting but even less relevant. (To repeat, both chapters are worthwhile reading on their own; I question their inclusion here.) Bruce Boyer is an excellent author -- I admire not only the chapter mentioned above but also his book about my particular idol, Fred Astaire Style. Yet the chapter here consisting solely of excerpts from Boyer's Elegance: A Guide to Quality in Menswear, especially a very, very long section on tweed, felt like filler. And, apart from Mears on the birth of Ivy style, this collection of excerpts is indeed the longest chapter in the book. Throughout, one more pass by a copy editor would probably have helped: There are more than a few errant apostrophes, for instance, and an egregious description of Alan Flusser as a ""menswear doyenne"" (p. 165).There's one final problem with ""Ivy Style,"" one that guaranteed I couldn't give the book more than four stars: As other reviewers have noted, the typography is bad, bad to the point of near-unreadability. A small, sans-serif typeface printed in medium grey on glossy stock pretty much ensures illegibility, and it sure did here. Captions and endnotes are tinier still. These layouts may have looked pretty to the designers at FIT and Yale University Press, but I hope the authors protested against the abuse their words were forced to endure. My eyes certainly protested at trying to read them.On the whole, though, there's a lot that's satisfying about ""Ivy Style."" Certainly, the book and exhibition is probably the first time (and maybe the last?) that this style of dress has been blessed by such substantial curatorial attention. For devotees of the style, this is essential reading despite its flaws (overlooking illegibility is a pretty big ""despite""). Historians of fashion or socio-economic signifiers could get a lot out of it too. Like Ivy style itself, this book won't appeal to everyone. But those who see the virtues of the style will appreciate the virtues of the book, too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21Q2GN4FQZDO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300170556#wasThisHelpful","R21Q2GN4FQZDO8","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a Dallas Cowboys fan pretty much since childbirth. Landry, Staubach, and the late-'70s team roster were icons of my childhood. Even today, I remember the combination to my gym lock by recalling the Cowboys players who wore the relevant jersey numbers. Watching the great documentary ""Full Color Football: The History of the American Football League"" (sadly not yet available on DVD) a year or two ago, however, turned me into a partisan of the old AFL, and so, despite knowing the outcome of the drama, I found myself rooting for the success of Lamar Hunt and his Dallas Texans in the ""ten-gallon war"" to be Big D's marquee sports franchise. That's how entertaining and engrossing this fine book by John Eisenberg is.The mention of ""Full Color Football"" is not entirely coincidental. Eisenberg's earlier memoir, Cotton Bowl Days : Growing up with Dallas and the Cowboys in the 1960s, landed him a spot in front of the ""Full Color Football"" cameras discussing the Cowboys-Texans clash. It was that experience, he writes, that convinced him there was a book in that story.And what a book it turned out to be. Eisenberg relies on interviews he conducted for the earlier book as well as new research and interviews, and so while there are lots of football games recounted in these pages, there is also an insightful, and inside, look at what was every bit as much as business war as a sports one. Lamar Hunt and Cowboys owner Clint Murchison are the central figures in what must have been a peculiarly Texas-style feud. The two men had very different personalities and styles, yet each was a recognizable *type* of Texas millionaire of their era. The two men were able to drink whisky and eat steaks together (Hunt once famously leaped out of Murchison's birthday cake, which Murchison found hysterically funny) while each simultaneously plotted to bankrupt the other, or at least drive him out of their mutual hometown. For some time, it was by no means clear which team would ultimately claim the heart of Dallas fans: The Texans had by far the better record in the early years, but the Cowboys faced tougher on-field competition in the more established NFL. As I said, even knowing the outcome, it was a pretty absorbing story.This book could easily have been longer: The discussion of the AFL-NFL merger proposal seemed to come almost out of nowhere, and after that the rest of the story felt a little rushed. But Eisenberg's emphasis is on the years when the Texans and the Cowboys battled for the hearts and wallets of Dallas' football fans, each trying to establish pro football in a land where the college game was unquestionably king, while also trying to smother the other team in its cradle. On field and off, it's an entertaining read. I recommend it especially to my fellow Cowboys fans, but more broadly to Texans, football fans (and there's admittedly a pretty huge overlap there), and fans of a fine story well told.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZP7X3R4VSTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547435509#wasThisHelpful","R1QZP7X3R4VSTK","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Horseman at Midnight"" could be described as a cowboy novel, as a modern Western, or a hymn to vanishing rural California. And it excels as all of those. But I see the book as primarily a novel of bloodlines, of lineage, and of how the relationships and influences that move back and forth across generations affect a man and color his life and choices. Author Jameson Parker's novel works on the most basic and essential level: it's a very good story. But it's that deeper level that makes this a book I'll remember for a long time.When elderly horse trainer Matt Sullivan describes a horse to Grady, he almost invariably does so by recounting the horse's bloodline. ""A lot of people believe, and I guess I'm one of them, that when you breed a horse, the qualities you're going to get come from the grandsire. And granddam too. But it all skips a generation,"" Matt says. ""Maybe it's the same with humans."" Similarly, nearly all the characters in this book are shaped to some great extent by the influence of their father and grandfather. Matt and Grady are the most obvious examples, but we see it in ranchhand Mike and druglord Antonio too. Late in the novel, police officer Isaac Sullivan, Matt's son and Grady's father, meditates on families destroyed by drugs, kids who see their parents' lives of addiction, violence, and crime and follow in their footsteps, and wonders ""When will it ever stop? Three or four generations down the line, like in the Bible?""Yet if we're shaped by our bloodlines, we're not slaves to them. When Mike refuses to take part in the drug-fueled debauch of a young girl, his decision saves his life. But later, he makes a different decision, and the consequences drive the second half of the novel.Book titles don't happen by accident, and I've been wondering what ""the horseman at midnight"" means. The obvious answer is that the horseman is Matt. But interestingly, the one instance of the word in the text -- thank you, Kindle search function -- describes, not Matt, but the great love of his life, Patty (""she was a hell of a horseman,"" Matt says). The one time action takes place at midnight, it's when Matt and Grady make the grisly discovery that ratchets up the tension for the rest of the book. Later, reflecting on his new relationship with his grandson, Matt wonders whether ""his profound happiness in this moment had been preordained by a sequence of events that began when a slim young woman [Patty] rode a little dun filly into an arena in Fresno."" In Parker's American Riff, all the major characters are men, but the story is set in motion by the long-ago actions of an influential woman. Here, too, almost all the characters (including a ""boogery"" yellow horse who plays a big part in the story) are male, but Matt wonders whether life is unfolding as it is because of what a woman did decades ago. Is the title horseman Patty?I'll stop the amateur lit-crit there and spare you my other theories (#2 involves Paul Revere). The key point is that while ""The Horseman at Midnight"" really is a great modern cowboy novel and all those other things, I was most affected by Parker's exploration, celebration, of how love and family entwine through generations, and how we're shaped by the lives of people we barely had a chance to know. As Matt continues to reflect in the moment of ""profound happiness"" quoted above, ""there was, for once, only this moment of joy, as if some generational schism had been briefly breached and all, in both directions, father, grandfather, deceased great-grandfather and beyond one way, son, grandson, unborn great-grandson and beyond in the other, as if all were united in a small, sweaty boy in an old-fashioned Nevada-style Stetson...""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJAICXOSTM3NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076Z6JZC#wasThisHelpful","RJAICXOSTM3NZ","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg in 1863, keynote orator Edward Everett spoke for over two hours. Abraham Lincoln then spoke for barely two minutes. Later, Everett wrote to the president, ""I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.""Out of interest or necessity, I've read a lot of books about nonprofit fundraising. Books for writers and designers, books for nonprofit staffers and board members, books for volunteers or one-person shops -- but like Everett at Gettysburg, none of those books, some quite long, have come quite ""as near to the central idea"" of direct-marketing fundraising (some haven't come anywhere *close* to as near) as Jeff Brooks has in the brief but powerful ""The Fundraiser's Guide to Irresistible Communications.""Now, here is where I disclose that I know Jeff Brooks. In fact, we've worked together for some sixteen of the last 20 years, usually with him as creative director on projects where I was the writer. But this is a completely uncompensated endorsement. And what my vantage point lets me tell you is that the ""real-world, field-tested strategies for raising more money"" Jeff discloses here are the real thing, empirically verified by thousands of mail packages, e-mail appeals, radio specials, and other fundraising tools he has employed and mastered over the years.Most of those other books go into more detail, with appendices of sample letters, chapters on creating a marketing schedule or long-term donor maintenance. But none of them capture the *spirit* of effective fundraising, or convey that spirit quite as entertainingly, as Jeff does. So much of what makes good fundraising effective is counterintuitive. The good fundraiser has to set aside her preferences about what looks best, or sounds best, or is the ""right"" way to describe a problem or a program or a solution. Instead, she must be willing to inhabit the mind of the donor, and be able speak to that donor in a special, even unique, way. Many of those other authors resent that fact. Jeff celebrates it. There are lots of great lessons in these pages (as I said, I've been doing this for years but my copy of this book is still filled with underlining and notes -- just like a good appeal letter!). But the most important lesson may be that whether we're in-house or work for a partner agency, we as fundraisers have the privilege of helping donors build the world they want to live in. Embrace that lesson, and put it to work in the ways Jeff describes, and your communications will be irresistible too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27NOO24QFEVHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1889102024#wasThisHelpful","R27NOO24QFEVHJ","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Last Jeffersonian"" is a biography, but it's a biography with a purpose: This is author Ryan Walters' attempt ""to point out what we in the conservative movement, as well as the nation as a whole, can learn from"" Grover Cleveland, a president contemporary historians have consigned to the memory hole (p. xvii). Walters argues Cleveland should be honored not only as ""the last Jeffersonian,"" or the last great president, but as ""perhaps the greatest statesman in American history"" (p. xix).Instead of telling Cleveland's story chronologically, Walters moves topic by topic, showing how Cleveland was a man of remarkable honesty, hewing faithfully to consistent Jeffersonian principles of sound money and noninterventionist, nonredistributionist government, an opponent of class warfare, but a consistent friend of the taxpayer. In 1887, for example, Congress appropriated funds for relief of drought-stricken Texas farmers -- an act that would hardly get a second glance today. Cleveland vetoed the bill, writing, ""I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution, and I do not believe that the power and duty of the general government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering, which is in no manner properly related to the public service or benefit."" Rather than being burned in effigy, Cleveland was praised. Even the Houston Daily Post, in the heart of the afflicted state, called it ""a very proper veto"" of a ""clearly unconstitutional"" bill (p. 34). Following the veto, private charities stepped in and ultimately raised over $100,000 in private donations (in 1887!) to help the farmers, ""more than ten times what Congress [had] sought to appropriate.""On the international stage, Cleveland again stuck to a Jeffersonian line that seems sadly foreign (so to speak) today. In 1893, for instance, the American planters and other interests who dominated the economy of the Kingdom of Hawaii (whom Walters oddly calls ""outlanders""), backed by the American minister resident and American Marines, overthrew Queen Lili`uokalani and established a provisional government. Benjamin Harrison, the equally-forgotten president sandwiched between Cleveland's two terms, rushed an annexation bill into the Senate, but couldn't get it passed before Cleveland's reelection. Cleveland withdrew the treaty, sent a fact-finding mission to Honolulu, and ultimately decided the coup was an improper exercise of American power. Though he originally argued ""the only honorable course for our government to pursue"" would be restoration of the monarchy, he eventually backed away from that and settled for recognizing the provisional government. When Hawaii was finally annexed a few years later, Cleveland wrote ""As I look back upon the first steps in this miserable business, I am ashamed of the whole affair"" (p. 114). Walters paints Cleveland as an opponent of imperialism and ""nation-building"" (he opposed early efforts to get the US involved in the Cuban revolution) but an advocate of the Monroe Doctrine and a believer in a strong national defense.Refreshing as Cleveland's focus on honest republican governance, noninterventionist foreign policy, and sound economics are (what modern politician -- save one -- would describe taxes as ""extorted,"" as Mayor Cleveland did in 1882?), it's when Walters begins to apply Cleveland's example to today that I, as I imagine many of Jeffersonian persuasion might, had to part company. The author rightly chastises modern neocons for the warfare state, an aggressive foreign policy, and their devotion to ""war as a means of national policy to destroy tyranny and forcefully impose democracy around the world"" (p. 124). Yet he falls in line with them in portraying China as the Next Threat, even noting that ""George W. Bush did very little to confront China"" (p. 122). We cannot ""allow a thuggish regime like Iran to possess nuclear missiles [or] send warships to our coastline"" (p. 159), Walters writes, though it's apparently okay for us to send warships to China's coastline -- a policy that resulted in the April 2001 Hainan Island incident, which was in fact one of America's most serious confrontations with the PRC in decades. ""Quod licet Iovi...,"" as William F. Buckley used to say.Where I really have to question Walters' interpretation of the Cleveland model, though, is in his discussion of how war should be waged once it becomes inevitable. ""We must no longer allow silly and unwise Pentagon lawyers to determine how our men and women fight,"" he writes, ""nor rely on the restrictions of international rules of conduct written by European bureaucrats,"" which I take to be a reference to the Geneva Conventions. ""We must fight,"" he concludes, ""as we did in the days of World War Two"" (p. 161). FDR and Truman, he writes approvingly, ""did what was necessary to win ... [and] concerned themselves first and foremost with the overwhelming destruction of an enemy, which generally precludes further aggression, as we saw with both Germany and Japan."" It's hard to imagine that ""the last Jeffersonian"" would endorse the immolation by fire and radiation of hundreds of thousands of civilian noncombatants. But then, I also didn't expect to encounter the phrase with which Walters begins an earlier paragraph: ""Dick Cheney, a man I greatly admire..."" (p. 158).Walters looks to the Tea Party to return conservatism to a more Jeffersonian line, writing that ""if [Cleveland] were alive today, he would certainly join the grassroots crusade of action against an overbearing federal government"" (p. 162). It's always problematic to speculate how a historical figure would react to contemporary events (a lesson conservative admirers of Winston Churchill could also learn), but it is instructive to note how the Tea Party reacted when the opportunity arose this year to support the most Jeffersonian major-party presidential candidate in several lifetimes. They embraced Mitt Romney instead.Oh well. There will be plenty of time to re-read the historical sections of this book before 2016 rolls around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R179QCGFHR3B0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449740502#wasThisHelpful","R179QCGFHR3B0O","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a modestly-sized collection of what you could broadly call ""New Age"" music, and I generally put it on when I need to create an environment conducive to concentration and moving the cursor to the right. ""What's Real"" from Silentaria fits into that New Age category too. But when I put ""What's Real"" on, I found myself concentrating as I desired ... and then realized I was concentrating on the music, and not on the work I thought I would be doing. On the whole, I think that's a good thing, because it shows how complex, interesting, and even involving this music is.Although ""What's Real"" as a whole can be called New Age, there's actually a lot of genre-bending happening here, and that makes individual tracks harder to classify. Some are meditative -- I remember thinking during one such track, ""At this point, Kitaro would have dropped in a soaring electric guitar solo; I'm glad Rixa White [the mind behind Silentaria], didn't."" But then, another track (particularly ""Deceived"") will be full of those very electric guitars. Electronic, acoustic, sounds from nature, and even voices -- both natural and computer-generated -- weave together in a complex tapestry.The project's website says ""Silentaria is inspired by the Wholeness and Emptiness philosophy."" Unfortunately, Googling the Wholeness and Emptiness philosophy mostly returns pages saying ""Silentaria is inspired by the Wholeness and Emptiness philosophy."" I'm sure there are levels and angles at work here that aren't entirely coming through to me. It's certainly an intriguing concept album, and one that will repay more listenings, whether for setting an atmosphere or as something to really dig into.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217YT6FYKAFKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SVSD2U#wasThisHelpful","R217YT6FYKAFKL","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never heard of ""Gentry"" before some of my favorite style bloggers began discussing this book a few months ago. But that's hardly surprising: Gentry ran for only 22 issues between 1951 and 1957. But what a run! Positioning itself as ""A Guide for the Civilized Male,"" Gentry is far, far from your stereotypical 1950s men's magazine. This book serves best as a monument to the vision of the magazine's founder William C. Segal -- a man interesting enough that Ken Burns has turned his camera upon him (Seeing, Searching, Being: William Segal - Three Films By Ken Burns). But there's also a lot of just plain interesting reading here for the ""civilized male"" (and the women who love them?) in 2012 and beyond.In its early years, ""Playboy"" magazine (Playboy was born roughly in the middle of Gentry's run) was known for promoting Hef's vision of bachelor culture -- not just women, but art, jazz, and a stylish pad. But Playboy seems positively parochial compared to the range of interests of the Gentry man -- interests which, I hasten to add, do not include prurient photographs of women, at least not in this book. If the Playboy man was a swingin' young bachelor, the Gentry man could have been his wealthier, better educated, and probably married older brother, a man of more diverse tastes, more widely traveled, and more comfortable in his preferences with less need to impress others with his hipness.With sections devoted to ""Style,"" ""Home, Cars, and Travel,"" ""Food and Drink,"" ""Sports,"" ""Art and Culture,"" and the still-valuable ""What Every Man Should Know,"" this book covers a lot of ground. And it does so not only by reprinting words, but by recreating the original layout as those articles appeared in Gentry magazine. You come away from this book with a strong sense of what the magazine must have been like. For aficionados of classic men's style, a bygone approach to journalism, students of the era, or guys trying to get a handle on the era their fathers or grandfathers grew up in, ""The Gentry Man"" has a lot to offer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K48SS1XWLLXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062088475#wasThisHelpful","R1K48SS1XWLLXR","A3AUL23GMCOP2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AUL23GMCOP2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Firstly let me say that the build quality on this camera is top notch. Now it is made to be an indoor camera, so do not expect it to be placed outside. It will not withstand the elements for sure just based on the seams in the plastic. It is however built very well for an indoor camera and comes with the mounting hardware to either flush or swivel mount it to the ceiling.It comes with everything you need to get started, whether you decide to install the software on a PC or if you decide to download the free Hootoo app for your phone (the route that I chose). The instructions are clear, concise and had me up and running in very little time.What can I complain about? Well, the only thing that really got to me was the length of the power cable. It is only about 3 feet long, which I know can be made longer via an extension cable, but I feel it should be at least 6-8ft long depending on where you mount it. As it stands I will either have to install an outlet on the ceiling or run some form of extension from the existing cable.I really love that this camera captures in several qualities, with sound and has the ability to use infrared to give you night vision. It really works! I would suggest this to anyone looking for an indoor solution to their monitoring needs, whether it be for baby monitoring or otherwise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TXZT533VDYIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017NNTYR6#wasThisHelpful","R1TXZT533VDYIE","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:44 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Upon opening the package for these headphones, I was greeted with a nice, hard-side canvas zipper case which held these headphones along with the accessory package included. The included accessories seem to be of decent quality, and I like the inclusion of the 3.5mm to 1/4 inch adapter. I am not totally sure what the stereo to L/R mono adapter is for, but it's included anyway!As far as the build quality on the headphones, you are looking at a mostly plastic build with ""metal"" looking accents. Mind you, the plastic construction looks nice but I have had other headphones in the past constructed like these that broke at the earpieces prematurely. I will not pass judgement on these yet, but will update here if I do see the same issue arise. The headband is well padded, and these really feel comfortable being worn for long periods.These are designed to offer the user an immersive listening experience while also giving them the capability to have active noise canceling when they need it. As far as sound quality goes, these are on par with most BT headphones. I used the ultimate headphone test to check the specs, and was able to get a 20hz to 18khz frequency response range, and the treble side did break up a little as it got up into the 17 to 18khz range. The overall sound was not bad though, and music/talking came through boomy, being heavy on the bass.The active noise canceling feature is switchable, which I thought was cool because it means you don't have to use it if you don't need to. This function worked as expected and I am not sure what else to say about it honestly.Using these as wired headphones works quite well too, and offers the user an option if the batteries are running low. Speaking of battery, I used these for several hours straight out of the box without getting a warning, so I am thinking that the claimed life on these is not too far off. I will make sure to respond on here if that turns out not to be the case.Overall I would say if you are in the market for a decent set of noise canceling headphones, and want the bonus of having BT connection then these are not a bad choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HWVGQOEXTRR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WFG3UW#wasThisHelpful","R2HWVGQOEXTRR5","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:09 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Upon opening the box on these, I was immediately impressed with how nice these headphones looked. The metal padded headband, metal accents, super padded ear muffs and the really nice ribbon cable were all nestled nicely in a really sturdy zipper case. Once I removed them from the packaging I noticed how positively the earpieces stayed in place, allowing for 90 degrees of movement but holding firm wherever I placed them. The adjustable headband also has very resistive, independent motion to extend these headphones out for large heads like mine. The adjustments are even delineated to give you an idea of how far you have adjusted them.The included 3.5mm ribbon cable is tipped with metal plugs on both sides, and a small 3 button remote on one side. These buttons work perfectly on my Macbook Pro and iPhone 6s Plus to control volume, ffwd/rwd, play/pause and phone answer/release.Now let's talk a little about sound quality. I use the Ultimate headphone test website to see how headphones perform, and ran these though the same gauntlet to gauge how they sounded. The company claims a 20hz to 20khz frequency response range and I was easily able to achieve that using the test site. The spectral flatness was good, with a little more tendency towards the bass frequencies. All frequencies were clear to my ears and the drivers seemed pretty well matched up. The Bass Shaker test did not phase these driver either. The only oddity I got with them was during the center vs twisted test where the sound used for the test caused a little bit of a rattle sound in the headphones. In real use (hours of listening to music of all types) I did not experience this rattle, but I thought I would mention it anyway.Overall I would say if you are looking for a good set of cans that are affordable, you can't touch anything in the price range that is better!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22L8WUXXUYVWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VWS71O#wasThisHelpful","R22L8WUXXUYVWR","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:16 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Think of this as a way to charge many of your USB items in one place. Whether you buy this to set on a counter (the included suction holder will keep it in place) or if you are thinking of integrating it into a larger system, this is a great choice to charge just about any USB chargeable item you have. I was able to charge an iPhone 6s Plus, Sony a6000, Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD and an iPhone 6 with it with no problem. That is enough for me to love this item.The idea is that it will detect the item attached to it and output the proper amperage to charge it at an optimal speed. Now, keep in mind that the unit is limited to 10A per the manufacturer's specs, so if you have several high powered items attached the charging will slow down.The build quality is nice with the outside being mostly soft-touch plastic and the ports mating tightly with all USB cables I plugged into it.Overall I would say if you are looking for a way to intelligently charge up to 6 USB items at once then look no further!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FN0QC4CEPALA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R2FN0QC4CEPALA","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:52 Mins I received these to test and review, so made a short video talking about them.I have been wearing a metal wedding band for 11 years now, and I have not had much issue with it (mainly because I work behind a desk). However, I can definitely see the danger of someone who works with their hands having metal wrapped around their finger tightly. I have heard horror stories of people losing or almost losing fingers due to unexpected occurrences on the job.The idea behind these bands is to be safer for those situations and also to look good doing it. While these do not look like metal bands, they have a nice look and will serve the intended purpose well. They stretch enough that no matter what happens you should be able to remove this band, and the color selection allows you some freedom with respect to style. There are no obvious seams on these bands and the grey one almost blends in enough to not get questions in an office atmosphere (I got questioned quite a bit with the black one).They fit true to size for me (I am a 10 and the 10s work fine), but YMMV.Overall I would say if you are looking for a safe way to wear a wedding band this is a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GE58R78WBMQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6DZBIQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GE58R78WBMQF","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, I just received this today, and it is a wonderful tempered glass screen protector...However, the one thing that I was most excited about with this protector was the addition of the invisible circuits allowing touches at the top to be registered by touching the bottom of the phone.Well, that function works, but not exactly as I had thought it would. One of the most important things to be was being able to return to a previous app when moving to another one. That touch is usually done at the top left of the screen, and I thought that the protector would register there but it does not. It registers just below that, and for instance in the browser opens up the address bar and pops the keyboard up. Now that is convenient but not what I expected. I guess I was confused by the description, so I just wanted to make sure I posted here my finding in case anyone else was in the market. Honestly, for the price it's a great standalone glass protector. The hidden circuitry just adds a nice bit of convenience for a large phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YKPXG4C4AOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014STECQG#wasThisHelpful","R39YKPXG4C4AOY","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The driver is facing upward and can get pretty loud considering this thing only stand a few inches off of a table. The bass is boomy and the highs are crisp without being tinny. The mids are decent, a little muddy at time, but way better than you would expect from a wireless speaker in my opinion.Overall I would say that if you are in the market for a bluetooth speaker then this is a great entry to consider!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZKQYY4MUBU5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SDNW2Q#wasThisHelpful","RZKQYY4MUBU5P","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:20 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.So I want to start this review by saying that I wanted this to be my favorite case for the iPhone, and it really almost was. There was only one glaring thing that kept it from being perfect, but I will get to that in a moment...Let's talk about the good!Slim...okay REALLY slim!! This case fits the iPhone 6 like a glove and looks smashing on it! The soft touch plastic is easy to hold and just hugs the phone like no other case. I love the way it feels in the hand.Bottom coverage...So, most slim cases do not offer bottom coverage of any kind to facilitate the case snapping on the phone. Well, Willnorn decided to go a different route and left the bottom coverage intact but added a couple of vertical slits to help get the case seated. They work and it helps to create the ""completed"" feel of this case.Ok, the one bad thing. Every single cutout on this case was AWESOME, with the exception of the camera cutout. I expected something like what I saw in the photos, but I must have gotten a bad one because it looks pretty awful. In fact, I am quite sure I got a bad one because the other reviewer on here that posted pictures show a much better cutout around the camera. I believe that mine must be a fluke, but I wanted to tell you anyway just to be sure you knew.Overall I would say that if you get one with a good camera cutout this will be the absolute best slim case you can get for your iPhone!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OV7AHNFHN2XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168CIZSC#wasThisHelpful","R2OV7AHNFHN2XN","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:51 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Huawei is a maker of high quality Android phones and wearables, so it was only natural for them to start making accessories.I have tested quite a few BT speakers, and I can say that this one ranks highly among them for originality and sound quality. While the driver placement is very similar to many offerings on the market (the upward facing type) the ""floating"" controls on the top side offer a design element that I have not seen on any other BT speaker. They are suspended directly above the driver on a touch sensitive panel. No clicking buttons here, they actually light up when they are touched to let you know that you are making contact and they actually work pretty well. Just underneath those buttons is a dark color cone that protrudes downward towards the driver which lights up like a slow heart beat while the speaker is turned on. The ""pulsing"" signal speeds up when an incoming call occurs.Speaking of calls, the sound quality on call is great, I am heard well and I can hear callers just fine. The range is like any other speaker, around 30 feet and the output on this thing is LOUD.Overall I would say that if you are in the market for a nice looking and sounding BT speaker then look no further!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7O36F5ZN2KCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SGN7B4#wasThisHelpful","R7O36F5ZN2KCD","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:55 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.I have tested many bluetooth headphones and these are unique in that they are tailored towards children in both design and one specific sound feature. They limit the output to 85 decibels when using the BT connection, meaning that your kid's ear should not get damaged while listening with these headphones. The looks are really nice, and I could easily see kids at just about any age up to mid teenage years using them. They will even fit my fat head, although the muffs are too small for my huge ears...The battery claims to get you 10 hours of use, which is right around average for BT headphones, but one cool thing is that if the battery runs out you can use the included 3.5mm aux cable to pump sound through without using battery power. The mic picks up my voice well and I can hear the caller on the other end very well. The buttons on the side are intuitively laid out and are positive feeling when clicked.Overall I would say that if you are in the market for over-the-ear headphones for your kid then look no further!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SWT1LWSC3UB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CLDSQK#wasThisHelpful","R3SWT1LWSC3UB0","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I mean these compare easily with the likes of BOSE, Klipsch, or any other really nice earphones.The bodies of these buds are made from metal and are precision machined to look slick and are polished silver. The red logos and plastic accents offset the silver nicely and the black ribbon cable is a nice looking touch that give these earbuds a truly luxury feel.As far as sound, I ran them through the ultimate headphone test and as far as frequency response they fell within the 16hz-22khz range easily. The sound is balanced across the whole range as well and these things just pump out great sound for music! As far as call quality, these are crystal clear for hearing and for being heard.The buttons on the inline remote are clicky and easy to find. The volume controls and multi-function buttons all work as expected with both iOS and Android devices.Overall I would say that if you are in the market for a truly high quality set of In Ear Monitors that you can use with your phone then look no further!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHRH0BCO812H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0162C1P9O#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHRH0BCO812H","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:36 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Firstly let me say that I generally do not prefer bulky cases unless they are for a particular situation (i.e. a waterproof case for swimming). This case is certainly situational in my book, only because I usually keep my phone in a rather slim case and carry a small wallet. However, after carrying this for a bit with the cards I usually carry (I don't carry much), I can see the appeal of having an ""all-in-one"" solution. If you only need to carry around 2-3 cards, or a couple folded bills and a card or two, then this is a very classy and functional way to do so.The leather stitching is very well done and there are no loose or frayed ends, and the leather itself just has a high quality look and feel. The vintage brown color looks great, and everything about the case looks quality. There are even markings on the outside where the volume buttons are. The actual case which holds the phone is of a slim plastic type, and it is brown to blend in with the leather. I feel like overall you are getting a fair amount of protection mainly due to the leather shroud surrounding your phone.Overall I would say that if you are looking for a simple, leather wallet case for your iPhone 6/6s then this is a great choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQHTJM3D5WI6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW0NIAK#wasThisHelpful","RQHTJM3D5WI6U","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 6:49 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.I have not had a ton of experience with RC boats, so I cannot speak from a position of authority. However, I have to say that this little boat was really fun!! I charged the battery up fully and got about 25 minutes on the water before the battery was low. The boat itself is made from a nice looking plastic, and it houses a large electric motor and a steering rudder system along with a receiver for the radio controller.The controller is very responsive and easy to use, even for a newb like myself. Please see the video for proof of that. The included stand is really cool for keeping the boat on a shelf when not in use, and it actually looks really cool sitting up there! The included nose cones are really nice if you happen to have rocks or logs that the boat may run into.One really neat feature about this boat is that it will not work unless it's in the water. There is some sort of way that the system senses water pressure in the cooling system which makes it power on. The trim controls on the remote are super helpful if you want to get more throttle sensitivity or correct the steering on the boat.Overall I would say that this is a really cool little boat that will give you lots of fun on the water!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TN0PFCRTMGEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1ZTCUE#wasThisHelpful","R2TN0PFCRTMGEK","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:40 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.This pair of BT earphones are one of the better looking sets that I have reviewed....and I have reviewed quite a few! The body is made from some form of aluminum alloy and the ends are a really nice, brushed silver color. The canted earpieces are very comfortable to wear for long periods and the bud/hook combo fits nicely into my big ears.Never fear, if you are not ""Dumbo-eared"" like myself, there are several bud and hook sizes to choose from in the package to accommodate you. Also included are a Micro USB cable for charging and a nice mesh bag to store everything in. Speaking of charging, these phones are supposed to last in standby up to 350 hours and anywhere from 5-7 hours of use. I took them straight out of the box and put a few hours on them without charging and they are still good to go. So, I basically believe the battery claim for now.As far as audio quality, these sound as good as almost any other BT headset that I have tested, which is to say that they sound great for music and phone calls. The mic is good and I can be heard well on the other side.Overall I would say that if you want an affordable 4.1 BT headset that looks quite nice, then look no further!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HD2HNQRY4OEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0137PYO2Y#wasThisHelpful","R2HD2HNQRY4OEJ","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:12 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Firstly, I wanted to say that I am not a big fan of bulky cases, so I went into this review a bit biased against this offering. That said, I believe that this is the nicest, best looking version of a waterproof case that I have reviewed yet.The body is very slim considering the protection that it offers and installation could not be easier. I did the water test with the case containing a piece of paper only to make sure there were no leaks and then put it on the phone to ""wear"" it for a few days. Again, I am not a big fan of bulky cases, but this one is certainly slimmer than many other waterproof cases.The design of the front is nice as well since the plastic continues further onto the front than some others. The buttons are still very easily actuated and the unique twist-style button for the mute switch is really cool. The door on the bottom which covers the lightning port is tight, but still fairly easy to open when needed and all cables I tried fit into the port just fine. There is a screw on gasket covering the headphone jack, and an extension which screws on at that point to allow waterproof usage of earphones.The worst part about this case in my opinion is the front screen cover. Most all waterproof cases use it, and I just don't like the feel. There can also be a rainbow-esque oil slick appearance under the protector where it touches the screen. However, this is true of all waterproof cases I have ever tested, on up to the most expensive.Overall I would say if you want a really sleek looking, but protective waterproof case then look no further!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7NDMF1TAVAI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OGA41O#wasThisHelpful","R7NDMF1TAVAI8","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is advertised like it's the popular drug from the film ""Limitless"" but it is certainly not that....at least not when I took it.What I can say is that I did get a boost with respect to focus, drive and mental state while using this supplement. I quickly ramped up to using 3 at once as I generally have a high tolerance to things, but would suggest that anyone taking these follow the instructions to ensure you are using the proper amount for you.At the end of the day this is a non FDA approved dietary supplement, so make sure you know what you are putting in your body (the ingredients are here on the page) and give them a shot if you are looking for a boost in the brain department.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSU7YMLN53Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLFYP02#wasThisHelpful","R3KSU7YMLN53Z0","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:20 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Let me preface everything I am about to say with the fact the I am a total new when it comes to drones. I have always thought that they were cool, but never ventured into learning about them much. When GPTOYS wanted me to test and review one, I just had to check it out.Well, I was not at all disappointed with the flying capabilities of this little guy. I guess I should say ""little"" as it measures almost 16"" across at its largest point (with the blade guards installed). The entire body is made from a really thin, lightweight plastic and the 4 motors are also quite light. There are cool LED lights on the underside and on that neat looking red directional indicator on the top.Included in the package was the remote (Which looks super high tech, lol), two batteries (supposed to give you 8-15 minutes each per charge), a USB charging cable (had to use tape to keep the end together), 4 extra props, a 4GB micro SD card (for the built in camera), a USB card reader, and a screwdriver for working on this thing.I did not use the remote full capabilities whatsoever. I literally took this thing out and started trying to fly it. It was rough going at first, but after a few minutes I started to catch on and could get the drone going pretty much where I wanted it to.As far as the camera is concerned, the quality of the video could be alright as long as you are flying straight an not panning to fast. I found that it was quite jerky while I flew it, but that could have been more about my flying skills than the camera itself.Overall I would say that this is a great way to get into drones without dropping a lot of dough. The company has parts listed in the manual so it appears that you can get replacements as you need them so I see no reason to give this one a shot if you are in the market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLOH6JFRFS5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI7QILG#wasThisHelpful","R3KLOH6JFRFS5Q","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:45 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Firstly, I have to say that I am drawn to thin, minimal cases. I really like the style of the iPhone, and don't want to put a case on it, but am realistic to the fact that I am not the most careful person and have dropped my phones many times. That said, I need a case on my phone, and am always looking for a great minimal case that can still offer some protection.I believe that this case offers the best of those worlds yet! There are thinner cases out there, but this one is a great balance between protective and slim. The soft touch plastic back is complemented with patterned sides that offer an immense amount of grip. The buttons are not raised on this case, and are smooth to be differentiated from the patterned areas. There is a good cutout for the mute button and it is easily reachable. The camera cutout is precise and looks quality against the phone.The logo is not overdone in my opinion is striking against the black color.The only negative I have on this case is the top part (when looking down at the screen) is made from a glossy style TPU. I wish they had carried the soft touch plastic all the way around the case as I feel it looks more quality than that glossy stuff. However, this is just a personal opinion and I can still say that this is one of the best compromises I have found yet for a slim case that actually does some protecting!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IIH3B6Y3WP3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONI0FCS#wasThisHelpful","R2IIH3B6Y3WP3C","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:53 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.I was a bit skeptical on this case as I usually do not like multiple pieces being attached to the phone. I am usually in the camp of people who like snap on, slim cases or heavily protective and waterproof cases (depending on the outing). When I was given the opportunity to test this case out, I was intrigued.Let me say that I am impressed with how precisely the cutouts are done and just how form fitting this slim plastic case is. The buttons are all easily accessible and the cameras are both fully usable. This case hugs the phone body as well, making it feel like you are holding a grippier version of the naked phone. I really like this as the iPhone is probably one of the best feeling phones out there right now, IMHO.The inclusion of a tempered glass screen protector is a great bonus and makes the whole package feel more quality. The fact that it covers the entire rectangular area on the front of the phone is really cool and makes the transition from the case to the screen less ""bumpy"".Overall I would say that if you are looking for a case that will provide a little protection and keep the phone looking pretty darn sleek then check this one out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQGBULW8FXL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01445UR9U#wasThisHelpful","R2NQGBULW8FXL7","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:57 Mins I received this unit to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.There are a ton of different bluetooth headsets on the market right now, so choosing can be difficult. Honestly, there are probably many ""right"" choices you can make. This headset tries to look professional and give a sleek, minimal appearance that will appeal to some. But does it succeed?In my opinion, absolutely!! The muted black plastic body on the aural units is very well-made and the few buttons on the device have a nice ""click"" to them when pressed. Speaking of buttons, there are only 3, a power/phone answer button, a vol + and a vol - button. The nice thing is that these buttons are located on one of the earpieces, which allows for the cord to just be that...a cord. Many other entries into this market use a small ""block"" located on the cable to house the buttons and mic, which for some might be alright and other will be an eyesore and nuisance.The sound quality for phone calls and music are great for a bluetooth headset and the earpieces do stay in the ears well with the included ""hooks"".Overall I would say that this is a very sleek looking entry into the bluetooth headset market, so if that is what you're looking for then check these out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S2YTVIL2X17M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OVP09Q#wasThisHelpful","R1S2YTVIL2X17M","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:54 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.I recommend watching the video I made to see how this case works in detail, but suffice it to say that it is quite protective and still looks good. It is a bit more bulky that the thin fare out there, but this thing looks as though it will handle drops extremely well. The outer shell is made of a semi-hard TPU with a leather inset on the back. The front portion is a hard plastic with a built in screen protector. I got some oil marks on the screen when it was installed, but that could have been my laziness in cleaning the screen before installing the case. There is a hole cutout for the home button, so Touch ID is unaffected and overall I would say that if you want to have a protective case that can double as classy, then this is a great choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H3E7Q70GKW59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K4LOXS#wasThisHelpful","R2H3E7Q70GKW59","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:02 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.I am one of those people who carries around an external battery to charge my phone on the go. This is a great way to avoid having to do that, while getting battery life and protection at the same time. I tried this out on my wife's phone and it extended the battery life for an entire extra cycle. It would bring the battery from almost dead to 100%, which is just great! The case itself is not bad looking, the soft touch plastic is my favorite part.It's a two piece affair with a kickstand and one power button with indicator LEDs to tell you how much of the external battery life is available. This mates well with an iPhone 5s, even with a tempered glass protector on the screen.Overall I would say if you need more battery life and a case, pick you color and roll with it! This is a cool case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4LWJQSCUA37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVG5A7E#wasThisHelpful","R2X4LWJQSCUA37","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:09 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.I did realize how large this shower head was going to be by looking at the picture, it's a beast!! It is a really nice chrome material and feels well made. The rubber tips are precision and offer even water distribution.I do not have a true vertical exit for my shower, so had to test this on a wall mounted pipe, and the pressure is not really meant for that in my opinion. It will work, but not to the level that I like it to. Now, I do have a hose and was able to suspend it vertically and I can see how this head would be perfect for that application.Overall I would say if you need a large shower head for the vertical position then this is a great one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZHQ33APCENL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8SK7Y4#wasThisHelpful","R22ZHQ33APCENL","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:37 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.This is a very convenient cable! That's the biggest draw for it in my mind as you can use it to charge, pass data and add USB items via OTG (if your mobile device supports it). The ribbon cable is sturdy and very rubbery feeling, and the ring for hanging on your bag is equally rubbery feeling. While the full sized USB port is not in use it can store the other end of the cable to keep it more compact and easily carried. The plugs all fit tightly into the devices I tried (Nexus 7, Samsung Galaxy Tab 8, Galaxy S6 Active and Kindle Fire) and all worked as they should. I was able to read flash drives to the devices that had OTG capabilities as well.Overall I would say if you need an OTG adapter why not get this instead so you have the versatility of a charging and data cable if you need it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2449467F89BOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z92YKVE#wasThisHelpful","R2449467F89BOY","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:26 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.When I received this camera in the mail, I was just amazed at the build quality. The all metal body, heavy duty mounting plate and arm and the very well made camera module were all very impressive. Speaking of the camera, this thing outputs 720P video in full color during the day and in black and white at night (using infrared sensors).There are several cables coming from this camera, the power cable, ethernet, audio in and out, 5pin alarm system cable and a reset button cable. The power adapter that comes with this unit has a fairly short cable with it so make sure you are mounting near a place where you can actually plug it in (or run an extension).This camera can be controlled from your home Mac or PC and recorded video can be saved to your hard drive via the wifi or wired connection. Speaking of wifi, this unit comes with an extended range Wifi antenna to give you enough boost to catch your home network with ease.Also, you can access this camera via your mobile device on Hootoo's camera app. This app will let you check the footage from the camera and also pan/tilt/zoom the camera to see what's going on all around.I could easily see this being used for business purposes or for the very security conscious home owner.Overall I would say that this is a very nice IP Surveillance camera that you should look into if you want something tough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I1FFR4AYI2PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ATLLUS#wasThisHelpful","R2I1FFR4AYI2PA","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I listen to a lot of music from my phone so being able to blast it over my car stereo is great!One thing to keep in mind on this unit though is that it has no on/off switch. You have to unplug it to turn it off (or just turn your car off).

This is not one of those mounts. Oh man does it hold to the dashboard! I usually prefer to use the windshield because the suction cup tends to hold better there, but that is not the case on this unit!I can use it on both the windshield or the dash with no problem at all!! The phone holder used the standard button release and geared ratcheting system to tighten down on your phone. Also, there is a good bit of foam on the inside of the cradle to keep a grip on your phone without scratching it.Overall I would say if you are looking a mount that you can ACTUALLY use on your dashboard then look no further!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTWYGT6P9C1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU446S6#wasThisHelpful","R3UTWYGT6P9C1F","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The vent mount is very secure, and as long as you figure out the best way to get it on to your vent without causing the vent to sag down then you are golden!

I mean I know that over-the-ear headsets are larger, but this one has some size, haha. So, the first thing I did was place it on my head and wow is it comfortable! There is plenty of adjustment, even for my fat head so I imagine most anyone will be fine with it in that regard.Now on to connections....You have three total connections on this headset, a stereo 3.5mm plug, 3.5mm mic plug and a USB plug. In fact, I stated something incorrectly in my video review. You CANNOT use the USB plug for audio through this headset. Only the 3.5mm plugs work for that so keep that in mind if you only have a single plug for both mic and output.How does it sound?? On my PC it was great! I have a better sound card, and that probably helped it some. I also plugged just the 3.5mm stereo plug into my USB interface for guitar and it puts out great sound for that as well.Overall I would say that if you are looking for an affordable gaming headset then this is a great choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O2GO4R2GUG53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EZ1JUU#wasThisHelpful","R1O2GO4R2GUG53","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:42 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.Ok, I am not the type of person who usually wears much in the way of head gear. I may sport a ball cap every now and again, but for the most part I let me locks flow.Getting ahold of these cylinders of very soft and stretchy fabric made me thing again! You can use these for so many types of head wear and otherwise that I just couldn't help but try some of them out. You can see in my video where I modeled a couple of the styles described in the book, and there are so many more that you can do with these garments.The material feels like a really nice t-shirt and I can imagine that using these when out in the sun would be great for keeping sweat from your eyes.Overall I would say that if you are looking for a unique head wear solution then look no further!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AMQQKF5DCBVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWYV308#wasThisHelpful","R1AMQQKF5DCBVV","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:54 Mins I received these sleeves to test and review, so made a short video talking about them.Wow!! These are probably the most robust knee sleeves I have ever used. The stitching is top notch and the 7mm thickness of the neoprene really makes a difference in the level of support you get from these knee sleeves.I do not participate in heavy squatting, so I cannot comment on how they work for that, but I did use them for walking, running, and basic weightlifting with no complaints whatsoever. I can say they provide a level of support unsurpassed by any other thinner type knee sleeves I have used in the past.I have a bad knee, so do have experience with all types of knee supports. I can honestly say that these are very well-made and do absolutely work for supporting the knee.Overall I would say if you are looking for a very heavy duty set of knee sleeves, measure out your knee circumference and order a set of these!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P67V3OYX49R0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW2O5MC#wasThisHelpful","R3P67V3OYX49R0","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:56 Mins I received this item to test and review, so made a short video talking about it.This bag was made to hold your cellphone when going as deep as 10 meters underwater, but I find it also useful for documents like your passport and maybe cash and credit cards. This bag is just so easy to use, with two clamps that keep the bag sealed when closed down.I will say that you MUST do the waterproof test (i.e. put a paper towel in the bag, close it and submerge it for at least 30 minutes) to make sure that you are all set. If that paper is dry then you are good to go! This is a very simple device that provides great peace of mind.The phone screen functions just fine through the bag, just remember that underwater the screen won't work as water make capacitive screens not function.Overall I would say if you are looking for a simple waterproof bag that just works, then look no further!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EZELNWD2SVTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105F3DCG#wasThisHelpful","R2EZELNWD2SVTU","A22VB1WFCA7JD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22VB1WFCA7JD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So My 5 year old daughter had long thick curly hair with a sensitive head when it comes time to removes the knots from her hair it becomes a very hard time with a yelling and crying child. I tried many things from detangler gels to leave in conditioners to creams and tried many types of brushes. Until I came across this one. I got it at a really good price and said to myself let me give it a try can't hurt can only help. This morning i went to untangle my daughter's hair knots and I was amazing on how little I found my daughter complaining. I don't know wheter its the shape or the probes on the brush but It actually helped. my only thing with it is that it doesn't have grip holds on the side so when i used my hand to put detangler cream on my daughter hair the brush slipped right out of my hands but no worries a little towel wiped my hands and the brush was perfectI sometimes get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who ask that I provide an unbiased review.

"I am highly impressed with this product. I have very dry skin that even peels and this product makes my skin feel amazing. It is the first moisturizer I have used that has actually helped heal my dry skin. It also doesn't feel greasy or heavy. It has this light soft texture to it. The other thing I noticed is you can use it in your eye area with no irritation or burning. Which is a huge thing for me as I get dry patches under my eyes.

"Alien Isolation could have, and should have, been a better game than it is. Like most others I loved it... for the first ten hours. But unlike most others (only fifteen percent of those who start it ever finish AI) I played it through to the end. Twice! The good things about AI are that you'll have to think to survive its challenges.  It's definitely intense and immersive. And whoever did the artwork hit a home run.  There are moments of beauty in AI.  But along the way I learned a few things....1. There are bugs in the program!  LOTS of bugs. I played AI using the Xbox 360 so I can't speak for the other systems but this thing has bugs galore.  I'm trying to figure out if the programmers didn't have time to fix AI's many bugs -  or were just incompetent.A. In Mission 14, ""The Descent"" the ladder in the Apollo Core refused to raise into position and allow Ripley to climb down into the reactor - even after reloading from the previous save point. I had to play the entire mission over from the start. This is a very difficult mission too and it took way over an hour to replay it.B. In my second go at AI the flashlight quit during Mission 12, ""Synthetic Solution"" and never worked again. This became a problem later on.C. Also in my second go, while climbing out of a floor duct Ripley was jumped by the Alien, who hadn't registered on the motion tracker (more on this later). I pulled her back into the duct as fast as I could, but the Alien made the ""prepare to die!"" screech... then the slaughtered pig squeal - and Ripley didn't die. ???Strange....However, the floor panel I needed Ripley to exit was now DOA. I crawled her around through the duct work to the opposite side of the room and was able to exit a floor panel there - and discovered the Alien had left the building. Where shortly before it'd been a killing field I was now able to walk her around with complete impunity! The sound fx channel died too - though the music soundtrack was still playing. However, when I saved at the next save station things returned to normal again.Strange....D. When you killed one of the human antagonists, if they had a revolver it would be left floating in mid-air over their dead body.E. In Mission 10, ""The Trap"" there were large machines in a room, that only partly loaded. They just sat there... winking spectrally whilst Ripley sneaked around trying to evade the Alien, which is hot on her heels in this mission.F. If you think Ripley's carrying a specific weapon, e.g. the flame thrower, you might want to think again: because when the Alien comes screeching towards her you may find the revolver popping up in her hands instead of the flame thrower. This will  happen whenever she acquires a new weapon; the weapon you thought she had gets pushed down the weapons queue and the new acquisition takes its place. But the controller is so touchy it often will select the item next to the one you thought you were selecting. Whatever the reason, you have to check her ""weapon of the moment"" frequently to avoid an ugly surprise.G. In Mission 18, ""Tomorrow, Together"" during my second play through, Ripley's arms caught on fire and she ran around this way for 6-8 minutes. While it was pretty funny it interfered with game play because I couldn't see well through the flames whenever her arms were raised.Unfortunately, it's just a buggy game. If you look into the various glitches reported by AI players you'll see and hear some pretty weird stuff.Along with the bugs in AI, YOU... GET... ROBBED!Some of the reviewers here have mentioned that aggravation - and they're right. For example, the motion tracker will suddenly not alert you to the Alien that's lurking directly ahead. Oops! Time to re-play the last ten minutes....  Proponents say it only registers motion, therefore the Alien must not have been moving. Well, the Alien was far behind Ripley a few seconds ago - now all of a sudden it's howling down the hall towards her.  And Ripley gets eaten again. And again... and again... and again....... Oh well, what's another hour or two of life wasted?In my opinion the way the Creative Assembly team scalds its customers by arbitrarily changing their game's rules is the worst thing about AI. Worse even than the bugs. Sometimes the tracker works... sometimes it doesn't. The Alien that was behind Ripley a few seconds ago is now ahead of her - or is it still behind her... or above her... because the motion tracker has gone MIA.Should you send Ripley into a duct to hide and the Alien comes in after her you might as well throw a Twinkie at it as use the flame thrower. And there are times when just a short blast from the flame thrower sends the Alien scurrying; yet at other times you can unload on it for three or four seconds and it still kills her.The game sticks it to you like that. The Alien pounces with no warning. And let's say you learn to retreat down a hall pointing the flamethrower backwards, because the Alien attacked Ripley from behind the last three tries; it'll then attack from the opposite direction... or drop down from an overhead duct. And there's only minimal auto-save in AI, so when Ripley dies, and she dies a lot, you have to replay from your last save point - which may take half an hour if you're new to the game.One point about the save stations: stop and check the floor map often - both to see where Ripley is and where various objects of interest lie. The most important objects of interest are the save stations - which look like phone booths of old. If you miss one, or God forbid, more than one, it means that when Ripley is killed you'll have to replay everything from your last save point.  Depending on how many save stations were missed it could easily add another hour to your replay time.  Save as often as you can.  If you save on entering a room remember to save when leaving the room - or AI will make you pay for that oversight.Lest I forget - when you do have to replay a section after Ripley is killed, or when the game moves from one mission to another, the reload can take over a minute.Then there are the slow moving Working Joes... who become world class sprinters when closing the last few feet. Similarly, the Alien closes whatever the distance in milliseconds. When you're trying to hoist the flame thrower into position to blast it, Ripley goes into slow motion. You'll do better holstering it, turning to face the alien, then unholstering it to try to get a blast in before it kills her.  I swore a lot playing AI.  Probably more than I did my time in the Navy. I woke my wife up one night swearing at it - and she was fifty feet and two closed doors away.And be forewarned about unreliable game guides. None of them by themselves are much help. What I learned to do was use three guides: the VGFAQ walk through, available on Youtube; the floor maps at Steamcommunity.com; and the Primagames walk through. All of them at once.  But even then there are places where you get disastrously bad info.  I had to stop play several times and figure out what went wrong.Once you become familiar with the game you'll do best just following the path cursor. The path cursor is a bar at the top of the motion tracker screen. It moves around, pointing out the direction you need to send Ripley. But it doesn't always work and will often ignore rooms full of stuff Ripley needs to build up her inventory. And it sometimes leads straight into an ambush.I have to marvel at all the good reviews given to AI. I can only assume most of them are by people who haven't played it through to the bitter end; or even more than the first few hours. I played it through twice - forty to fifty hours total - and liked it less the more I played it. I started out thinking, ""What an awesome game!"" But after completing it the first time, reckoned it just three stars. After my second play through, (and that was on ""easy"") I decided that because of the Hollywood chicanery, programming bugs, weak script and the lame grand finale, (with comically indestructible and homicidal Aliens swimming through outer space, still trying to kill Ripley) that when all's said and done, it's a two star game.I really wanted to like AI. I even played it through twice hoping this would resolve some of the aggravations I experienced the first time. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be. For me at least AI was a long, grueling, frustrating slog - with no payoff that justified the pain.  When it was over I felt like someone who'd run a marathon only to find out their paperwork got lost.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYV8LAS9WVWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I19TXIM#wasThisHelpful","RFYV8LAS9WVWF","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've had ours for five years now and it's always started and got the job done.  But I do yearly spring maintenance on it and discovered it has some design flaws.1. The mounting bar for the shaft pulley guard is situated directly over the crank case oil bolt.  It was a chore to change the oil because of that stupid oversight. I fixed the problem myself but it should have been noticed and addressed before it got out of design.2. The bigger problem.  The gas tank is plastic - molded in two halves.  During the third year the two halves separated somewhat - with a crack of about 1/8 inch finally developing at one end of the seam.  It spilled a lot of gas and you couldn't fill the tank all the way up because it'd leak out a cup or more of gas onto the bed. Even at half full or so it still leaked quite a bit at first. If I hurried I could just barely finish my lawn before it died.  Eventually I sunk eight small wood screws through the lips of the upper and lower halves - which pulled the seam back together.  That eliminated most of the leakage problem but I still can't top it off.3. There are sharp edges here and there which you have to be aware of or they'll nick you. You shouldn't have to be warned about stuff like this.Other than these problems it faithfully starts, runs, mulches and mows like you'd expect.  But considering our Toro's problems and looking at all the negs here I don't think we'll be buying another one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S7CD3EW3OIKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001XFBBI6#wasThisHelpful","R3S7CD3EW3OIKK","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think it's safe to say Nick Drake was a musician of genius.  Five Leaves Left came out when he was only 21 years old. An amazing effort for someone so young. FLL is an album that appeals on different levels: lyrics, voice, guitar work. Unfortunately Drake never had a producer worthy of his gifts and some of the songs on FLL sound as if they were recorded in someone's apartment.Lyrics. Drake's lyrics are refreshingly literate, mature and unpretentious for a 21 year old man of that time (1969). His meanings are often obscure, but he comes up with good lines and you are given things to think about. He references nature a lot, in a traditional hippie way, but even here he's restrained and matter of fact. A shadowing melancholy is apparent in FLL.  By the time of Pink Moon it had become very apparent.Voice. Drake has/had an elegant, soft, velvety and recognizable voice. He even sounds English. Posh English as a matter of fact - which he was, his family being of the posh class. His range is very limited however, probably not much more than an octave; and you won't hear any dramatics from him. I suspect this was one of the reasons his albums had such limited appeal while he was alive. But his voice was a nice though understated complement to his guitar playing.Guitar. Simply put, he was beyond good on the guitar. His songs revolve around that fact - and he knew it. His voice had its limits, his lyrics were thoughtful but in an understated English way.  His guitar was the star. Particularly his use of unusual modalities and chord progressions.  This isn't immediately apparent but a few bars into River Man and you find yourself saying, ""Oh, that was well done!"" That was his main genius: to find a guitar line off the beaten path and explore it well. His words and voice were like leaves floating on the bubbling stream of notes pouring out of his guitar.  He was technically gifted too.  Drake's playing is clear, clean and rhythmic. Finally, he could sing while playing his complicated guitar lines. No small feat there.As I mentioned earlier his producer (and back up musicians) for the most part did him no great favors. If you listen to Drake playing alone he sounds better than with all the strings, saxes and flutes thrown into the mixer. He would have benefited greatly having a producer who knew how to make his music rattle the china now and then. Had FLL been a Nick Drake solo effort I'd give it five stars.

The kettle boils quickly and the beautiful blue light adds a nice zen to to our daily coffee.When working night shifts, I like to turn off the kitchen light and watch the water come to a blue boil in the dark - as my soul resigns itself to what lies ahead.However I foresee some issues that'll probably develop down the road... or one's existential path in this case:1. The beautiful blue light will probably have a brief journey.2. The on/off thumb switch appears frail and needs to be treated contemplatively.3.

"I'm sure these would be considered ""premier"" quality sheets in China, but in America they're only ""adequate"".Here are the issues I uncovered with this set: 1. The piping you see in the accompanying photo is only on the pillow cases.  The top sheet just has a plain old stitched seam.  Not a deal killer, but kind of deceptive. 2. The pillow cases are short.  They should be about four inches longer to cover the pillow ends.  Plus there's some kind of inner flap in them.  If the flap were bigger it might cover up the pillow ends; but it's too small to do the job there.  As things stand, all the flap does is demand to be tucked under when the pillow is put in the case.3. Although the sheets are advertised as ""1800"", this too is a deceptive sales gimmick.  They might be 600 count at most.  4. Furthermore, there were noticeable production run oil stains on the set I got.  These were fairly small and washed out after a couple of washings but were another reminder that quality control isn't really on the list in China these days.However, they are a nice color (brighter than the ""Calla Green"" in the photo), fit pretty well and are soft and comfortable.

"The Schecter Stiletto is just a beautiful bass - both to look at and to hold.  It feels smooth and satiny in a way that makes you want to run your hands over it.  The satin gold hardware is very fetching too.  It has a high dollar look for a mid range priced bass.  Imho, whoever designed it hit a home run.And at 7.7 lbs. it's the lightest of all the basses I've owned.  The difference is something you appreciate immediately.Mine arrived ready to go, with the action set low with no buzz.  The round wound strings that came with it were fine, but I like flats and bought some GHS strings to put on it.  These were the second set of GHS strings I've put on an instrument and I have to say I'm very impressed with them. In both cases the action seemed to be lower than before.  It plays easily - like one of those fabled basses at Ebay that supposedly play themselves. The frets were all cut properly with no ends sticking out.  The neck is small and thin; about like an Ibanez.  And being satin finished too, like the rest of the bass, is very fast.  I have medium sized, squarish hands and for me it's a blast to play.I'm happy with my Stiletto's sound too.  It has a smooth, melodious tone that goes from a deep, sonorous bass to high, bright treble with no hiccups anywhere that I can find. I'm really impressed with how much treble you can squeeze out of it.  The pots are smooth and silent too. Everything about this bass is smooth and attractive in my opinion.  If I had to find fault with it the only thing I could come up with is that it's too pretty to take on the road.If I were allowed to keep only a couple of my basses, the Stiletto would be one of them.Update, September, 2015: I like the Stiletto even more than I did at first. There have been no problems at all with it. I'm playing it more than any of my other basses now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EERPTB77B6E2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002CZVO6#wasThisHelpful","R2EERPTB77B6E2","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not long ago you could find great stuff made in China.  I've got lots of nice things around here that were made in China.  Unfortunately, those happy days are fewer and further between.  There's been a change over the past couple of years: nowadays you're taking a gamble when you buy something made there.  This fireplace tool set has been a rude reminder of that fact.  If I'd known beforehand it was made in China, I wouldn't have bought it; or at least paid so much for it.The set looks very nice when viewed in the photo here, but it's been a disappointment. To start, the broom is disaster.  It won't stand up to the rigors of even one fireplace sweeping without falling apart.  The bristles fall out of the head just from waving it. They break easily too.  And there's some sort of tiny, stem-like plant matter that falls out, leaving a copious mess that must be vacuumed up.The tool stand isn't straight either.  As it stands on the hearth, mine leans about 5/8's of an inch out of plumb.  I'm going to have to work on it to make it stand up straight.  Call me old fashioned but I don't think you should have to work on things you buy new.The handles too are welded to the shafts in an indifferent manner and there are some angles at joints where things should be straight - but aren't.  More work....When seen from ten feet away it looks good enough; but if you're someone who likes to use your fireplace I recommend you pass on this set.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HSXHEVNMK8Z6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KV2SHE#wasThisHelpful","R1HSXHEVNMK8Z6","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After Life is a fast and easy read that contains much helpful and comforting information.  However, author Michael Brown is clearly a devotee of Medjugorje and his reasoning is suspect at times as a consequence. There are many passages wherein he cites Medjugorje.The Medjugorje apparitions are a series of supposed apparitions that began taking place in the former Yugoslavia some thirty years ago.  Many odd claims have issued forth from the mouths of the so-called seers.  Some of them much at variance with Catholic doctrine.  As just one example, Brown claims on pg. 11: ""Heaven is an incomparable joy, and one day most of us will reside in it.""This is pure Medjugorje.  But Jesus, numerous popes and countless saints and doctors of the Church have said the exact opposite: few will make it.  As just one good example I could use: ""Indeed a multitude shall be saved; but compared to the multitude that is damned they will seem to be only a few."" - St. John Vianney.I could go on a long time with similar quotes from other saints, popes and doctors.Still, for the most part the book is good and towards the end Brown grows very eloquent. I'd like to have given After Life another star but were it not for the final beautifully written chapters I don't think it'd rate four stars.For those interested in better treatments of our after life destinies I'd recommend, The End of the Present World, by Fr. Charles Arminjon; and Purgatory, by Fr. F. X. Schouppe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QMH0OXX84XP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1579181554#wasThisHelpful","R1QMH0OXX84XP9","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And not just ""for the $$$"".  It looks, feels, plays, and sounds better than basses I have - and have had - that cost a lot more. So, in this case I actually got more than I paid for.  This can happen when you're buying a guitar or bass these days.  You don't have to go for the big name brands to get a great  instrument.  And there are some really nice budget friendly basses that'll do everything the high dollar ones do. My Fender and Ibanez basses my look a little cooler, but I'm grabbing for the Yamaha most of the time now. It's lighter, sounds just as good if not better, and is sweet playing.The split p/up configuration is adaptable and has the balls to go wherever you want it to. The p/ups are very meaty for such an inexpensive instrument.  They don't need to be replaced at all.  The strings were fine but I stuck some Dean Markley cryo's on it. They sound good and stay in tune better than others. I've noticed I rarely have to tune this bass - unlike my Fender basses, which require it every time you pick one up and then several times afterwards.  A Leo Quan Badass II bridge is next on the list.  The neck is nice and smooth and fairly thin - about like an Ibanez - and fits my average size hands well.Some have said this is a great starter bass.  I totally agree.  But it's a great bass for advanced players too.  I'm not a professional musician but I'm confident it would hold its own on stage.  It's solidly built too and feels like it would stand up to life on the road.If I have any complaints it's that the fret ends could have been finished better.  They're ok and they won't chew up your fingers but you can feel them a little when you're playing.  Especially down close to body.As with many items made in China it's important to be aware of the quality control issues there. Given that this is a Yamaha you'll probably do ok buying it here.  And Amazon has a good return policy. But you might want to consider buying one from your local music store just to make certain you're not getting a Chinese lemon.Hope this review helped.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSY3RXW2EMZ53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00861CEAE#wasThisHelpful","RSY3RXW2EMZ53","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought People Who Knew Jesus hoping it might be the one, with a similar sounding title, I regret not buying back in 1987. I should have saved my money.Within *one page* of opening this book I began finding errors such as: ""How could an uneducated man like John, described as unlettered or even illiterate in the Acts of the Apostles (4:13) create the highly sophisticated literary and spiritual masterpiece represented by the Fourth Gospel?""In Acts, Sts. John and Peter were brought before the Sanhedrin and accused, among other things, of being ""uneducated"" men; not ""illiterate"" as the author claims.  Sts. Peter and John were very knowledgeable about Jewish scripture. ""Uneducated"" in this sense means they hadn't studied in a rabbinical school - and the rabbis at their trial were accusing them of this.On the very next page we find this gem: ""The evangelists were not eyewitnesses to Jesus' life.""Except for St. John, and almost certainly Sts. Mark and Matthew; and not unlikely, St. Luke as well. Those familiar with liberals' interpretations of holy writ will recognize the ploy: attempt to undermine the historical foundations of the bible - especially the New Testament. Once this is successful, everything becomes open to debate.On the next page there's this dreck: ""Eventually what began as a Jewish movement became Gentile Christianity, and since the victors write the history, ""The Jews"" - especially the Pharisees in the Synoptic Gospels - become the enemy and are represented as seeking to kill Jesus.""What Sommerville attempts to do with that bit of nonsense, and elsewhere in his book, is shift the blame for Jesus' death from the Jews to the Romans: actually calling the Gospels ""anti-Semitic"" along the way! Yet, when He was brought before Pilate, Jesus specifically stated the greater sin was that of the Jews. The Romans definitely crucified Jesus - but only after Pilate, who'd repeatedly tried to release Him, was howled down by a bloodthirsty Jewish mob whipped into a riot by the rabbis. ""He came unto His own and His own received Him not.""Sommerville also denies the doctrine of Original Sin, declaring it the result of St. Augustine mistranslating some key words in St. Paul's Letter to the Romans; and that the Catholic Church has perpetuated the error ever since. First, St. Augustine spoke Greek very well. He mistranslated nothing. And even if he had there would have been such an immediate uproar he'd have been forced to correct it. In any event, although he remains influential to this day, Catholic doctrine was never decided by St. Augustine.Sommerville isn't stupid and it's clear he actually studied his subject in depth and detail. Yet he commits numerous unforced heresies on just the first three pages of this tome.  After even an hour's worth of reading one begins to grow tired at the rapid pace of them all. He's not an ignorant man - he's consciously deceitful.It should come as no surprise that this anti-Catholic heretic taught philosophy for many years at the ""Catholic"" colleges, Fordham - and Xavier of Cincinnati....I'm only a layman but I could easily have written a much longer review on all the errors spewed in just the first twenty pages of People Who Knew Jesus, but vita brevis.  Rather than waste any more time (and precious shelf space) on this repugnant book, it's going into the circular file tomorrow.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R279AGU577TI84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589661419#wasThisHelpful","R279AGU577TI84","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first listened to Off Duty I liked it, but maybe not as much as some of 480E's earlier stuff: The Album, Nocturnal, Round Three....  But I've listened to it many more times now and like it better with each listen. It's now become one of my favorites - maybe *the* favorite.Generally speaking, Off Duty has a somewhat cooler, more thoughtful vibe to it than the other 480E cd's - and Rob Deboer's bass playing is more muted than it has been in the past; at least in some songs. But it still has nice, strong melodic lines and plenty of those spacey 480E effects you love to hear. It will probably have the strongest appeal to more cerebral chill fans. But that could be said of all of 480E's catalogue: everyone I've known who likes them strikes me as being pretty smart.I was listening to Off Duty a couple days ago and my son, who's also a fan, dropped by and asked what I was listening to. I told him to guess.  After a few seconds he knew who it was - even though I've got tons of cd's of every kind of music. 480E just has a distinctive sound. It's hard for me to say which of their cd's is my favorite because they all have a different mood. Off Duty is something that would go well with a glass of Canadian Club, falling snow and a picture window with a good view for any UFO's that wander by.As always with 480E, you don't have to wait long before the music incorporates a spacey new sound or heads off in an interesting direction.  One of the things I've always liked about them, apart from the cool jazz is the attention to detail they put into their productions. Even their first effort, The Album, was mature and polished. Off Duty won't disappoint anyone here either.Special mention must be made regarding the addition of flutist Bill McBirnie to the line-up: a wise decision in my opinion.  McBirnie is a fantastic jazz musician whose clear and fluid playing nicely accentuates the cool and intelligent flow in Off Duty.Strongest tracks (imo): The Walker, Sandbar, Vaporized, SpunWeak tracks: none","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXT2VG8VO8QLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GYNH3E#wasThisHelpful","RXT2VG8VO8QLI","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cool looking and well made size 68, M35 helmet that'll have your friends wanting to try it on.  Camo scheme is flat white paint, sprayed over spruce boughs and needles, with a feldgrau base. Mine looks a lot like the one in the picture. The liner is comfortable and sturdy.Unfortunately, what you see here isn't what you'll get. The helmet IMA sells is a *low profile* helmet. What this means is when you put it on a table and measure the distance from the table to the front visor, it's only 15/16"".  Real German WW2 helmets have a visor that's 1 1/2"" off the table. In order to accomplish this the skirt was shortened.  The differences become apparent when you compare one of these helmets to the real thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROB1XOA824TC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00655BYMM#wasThisHelpful","ROB1XOA824TC8","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing you need to realize when you learn you've got bed bugs is that you don't have a battle on your hands - you're in a FULL BLOWN WAR.Bed bugs are very tenacious insects and they show signs of climbing the learning curve. You're going to have to annihilate them or they'll come back. Getting rid of them involves work and commitment. Fortunately, once you finally get rid of them, they're loathe to return. Diatomaceous earth will get the job done but if you want to succeed you have to be smarter and more persistent than the bed bugs.I first learned we had bed bugs when I saw something like a brown pill bug, but a lot faster, charging at me across the sheets. I squashed it and it exploded in a dime sized blood stain. I realized to my disgust that we had bed bugs - and that was the reason for the small red marks on my wife's and my arms and legs. We had what I'd consider a small to moderate infestation - maybe 200 bed bugs total (for every full grown adult you see there are about ten smaller ones in various stages of development). We learned a few things along the way:1) Forget about pesticides. PESTICIDES DON'T WORK WITH BED BUGS! Bug spray doesn't work. Bug bombs don't work. Pesticides just drive them into hiding... for a while.2) Alcohol kills them, but only a few at a time. The survivors scamper off into more remote hiding places. Extreme cold kills them too but has to be applied in such a way that none are missed. Heat kills them VERY well. Bed bugs can't stand temps above 115 F for more than fifteen minutes. Exterminators are now using 200,000 BTU heaters to heat houses, apartments and rooms to 140 F for an hour. Bed bugs can run but they can't hide from heat. But thermal extermination is expensive and doing an entire house can cost over $5,000. Diatomaceous earth kills them too. It's the cheapest way to get rid of bed bugs - but you have to be thorough, persistent and systematic. DE won't kill them immediately as it's not a pesticide. It takes a couple days to start working - and it takes a while to get them all.3) You're the bait! Bed bugs love us and take great risks to suck our blood. Many of them die in the effort. They're most active between the hours of three and four am but they'll change their schedule to whatever yours is if need be.When I discovered we had bed bugs I bug bombed and sprayed them. But it quickly became clear that while they didn't like it, it wasn't killing them. That's when I finally understood we had a lot bigger problem on our hands than I first thought - our own personal hell.  Fortunately for bed bug sufferers the Internet has lots of information about how to fight them. Maybe too much.  After a day spent studying the problem I came up with a plan: diatomaceous earth.Diatomaceous earth comes in two grades: pool grade, which is poisonous to people and pets; and FOOD GRADE, which is the stuff you want to use. It's very light and powdery, about like flour. It contains tiny, glass-like shards that work their way into the soft spaces of insect exoskeletons, cutting them up and causing them to dehydrate and die. Bed bugs don't seem to recognize it as a mortal danger and once it gets on them they can't get it off.We dusted diatomaceous earth all around the bed, on the mattresses, underneath the bed and in the bed frame screw holes and any crevices, on the headboard, rails, legs and everywhere else. Then I dusted behind, inside and underneath the bedside tables and dressers, along the baseboards, in all the drawers, etc. Everywhere a bed bug might hide. Trust me, they're very good at hiding and if you make life hard for them around the bed they'll move their base of operations to a further corner of the room and bide their time.We also put plant pot saucers filled with diatomaceous earth under each bed leg. This is real important because once you've defeated the ones hiding in your bed the only way those lurking elsewhere can reach you is by passing through it. As much as possible turn your bed into an island surrounded by an ocean of diatomaceous earth.Use double sided tape around all the bed legs, on the headboard, etc. They won't try to cross it and will in fact turn back around as soon as they encounter it. What you want to do is create choke points that force the little buggers to have to pass through diatomaceous earth in order to get at you.Mattress covers for the top and bottom mattresses. These are very important. Bed bugs like to hide in mattress seams - and in the hidden recesses of box springs.  Leave the mattress covers on for a long time too because they can live up to a year without feeding; and check the covers periodically to make sure there aren't any holes or tears they can climb in or out of, because they will definitely find them.  Also, if you've got anything: dust ruffle, sheets, blankets, bedspreads, etc. that touch the floor, take them off because bed bugs can and will use them as an avenue to get to you.Light colored sheets - to see them better. The nymphs are light tan colored, tiny, and a lot harder to see than the adults - which are 3/16 of an inch long and dark brown. Dark sheets show up the little ones better. Light sheets show up the bigger ones. Also, after nibbling on you they poop little black spots. If you see these showing up on your sheets it's a good sign of bed bug infestation.  I went with light green sheets which worked well as I could see both adults and nymphs, and any poop spots. Dark sheets hide their poop stains, so avoid them. Also, it's a good idea to wash your sheets daily for the first week or two because these things are laying eggs like crazy.We got everything out from under the bed and put ALL our clothes, bedroom stuff etc. that bed bugs could hide in, into black garbage bags, then sealed them and put them out on the back patio to heat up for a couple hours in the summer Sun. Black garbage bags absorb the Sun's rays and turn the insides into an oven. I measured the temp inside and it was 132 F! If it's cold when you learn you have bed bugs you could probably use a blow dryer on low setting. You just have to get the temp in the bags up to 115 F for fifteen minutes.  Eggs take longer to kill but they can't survive 115 F for more than an hour. The more heat you create the faster they die.Vacuum your floors - 3-5 times a week for a couple of weeks or more depending on how many there are. You want to suck up any eggs that have fallen to the floor or any bed bugs that are crawling around. Concentrate on the spaces under and around your bed and base boards. If you've got hardwood floors it'll make your job easier as there are fewer places for them to hide and you can see them, and signs of them, better. Also, if you have a canister type vacuum it'll give you an idea of how many you're killing. Re-apply the DE as necessary. I used a paint brush and turkey baster. DE's very powdery and floats like dust but it doesn't take much to cover a large area.  Some have complained about how dusty it is, but ask yourself this: what would you rather have to deal with, a little dust or bed bugs?Even after all this we were still getting bitten - though much less. We found a few hiding between the new mattress covers and killed them. A few days later we were bitten again. Taking the bed apart we found a half inch hole in the mattress cover surrounding the box springs. It had some little black poop stains near it. The bugs that'd been trapped inside found the hole and came out to feast. We sealed it with some scotch tape.We next found some crawling up a table lamp cord and marching across the bedside table!  I've no doubt they were headed for the sheets that were brushing against the table. I moved both bedside tables a foot away from the bed then thoroughly dusted the table tops, cords, electric receptacle boxes (which they use as hideouts), etc... but we still got some bites - though less than at any time in a month. We then took the bed apart and using a flashlight, magnifying glass and dentist's mirror, searched every nook and cranny.  Sure enough, some were hiding in screw holes. We'd already treated the bed frame and screw holes with diatomaceous earth, but it hadn't stuck to the tops of some of the screw holes... and that's where they were hiding. I killed these and we put the bed back together.About a week went by without any bites but we were still suspicious and took the bed apart again. Lo and behold two adolescents were hiding in a small worm hole in one of the slats. I killed these and prayed we were finally nearing the end our disgusting problem. But just to be sure we took the bed apart and thoroughly inspected it weekly another four or five times. By now we were familiar with every nook and cranny of our bed.  We also checked all possible hidey holes around the bed. All told we spent around a month and a half in our bed bug war and the mop up missions... BUT WE WON THE WAR! And we've been bed bug free since September 2011.We didn't think we'd ever get bed bugs but we learned better. They're everywhere now. If you're waking up with unexplainable red marks, and/or your sheets start showing little black spots, you need to ACT FAST.  At the first sign of an infestation take your bed completely apart and INSPECT EVERY INCH OF IT: mattress, frame, inner box springs, headboard, legs... everything. A flashlight and magnifying glass are helpful here. You may be shocked at how many you find. You can vacuum them up and/or squash them with paper towels.  Squashing them is messy but hydrogen peroxide will clean up any blood stains. Toothpicks work well on the ones hiding in crevices and holes. You'll learn to be impressed by how cleverly they hide. Don't go light on the diatomaceous earth either - this really is total war.Once you've cleared your bed of them the ball's back in your court. But you can still pick up eggs on your feet and carry them back into the bed - thus the importance of vacuuming religiously.  If you go a week without getting bitten it shows you've made progress, but the war ain't over yet. Many are still lurking around, so you need to keep checking for them. If you go a month without getting bitten you've probably won the war but it's a good idea to leave some diatomaceous earth in the plant pot saucers under the bed legs, and along the baseboards too, for several more months - in case some are still hiding out.  And inspect your bed a few more times too, if only for peace of mind.I might add that if any of your family, friends or visitors report bed bugs at home - or at work - you should immediately buy some diatomaceous earth in anticipation of when they show up at your place. Pre-emptively dust your base boards, especially in the bed rooms, because they use base boards as highways and hideouts. Most of them stick pretty close to the bed but for some reason some go solo and you can find them anywhere in your house.I can only surmise that the people who neg diatomaceous earth are less intelligent and/or persistent than bed bugs. Or maybe they're exterminators. Who knows? Diatomaceous earth is a real deal killer for exterminators if it's used properly. It just takes a while to get them all.The key to defeating bed bugs is to understand you're up against a wily and resourceful adversary who's not going to leave without an ugly fight. A hit and a miss doesn't work with them. The sooner you get started the better because the more there are the harder they are to get rid of. If you decide to go with diatomaceous earth you learn their habits and hideouts. You make life at your place dangerous for them and kill them off by percentages in a series of running battles until all are gone. There may be multiple battlefields: your bed/mattress, framework, under your bed, the baseboards, bedside tables, chairs, blanket boxes, behind picture frames, electric boxes, loose wallpaper, lamps, dresser drawers and everything that's in them, closets, curtains, etc.  Like I said, the main thing is to first get them out of your bed and turn it into an island sanctuary; then go on ruthless search and destroy missions for any others.Remember... you're the bait!  But by using yourself and your loved ones as bait you'll lure bed bugs into a diatomaceous deathtrap. It's a great feeling to be able lie peacefully in your bed again without worrying if you're being silently stalked.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT0GZ8N0W23WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QJBVH8#wasThisHelpful","RT0GZ8N0W23WN","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book at the urging of a friend who trains with Wes Cole in Tulsa and has lost weight using his method. My problem's not really fatness or unfitness. I just seem to hit a wall where I can't lose any more weight, hard as I try.  Willpower's good, but only to a point: it can help you lose some weight but it won't keep it off.  What makes me think this book will work is that Cole's program is greater than just losing ""x"" number of pounds.  It involves developing healthy dietary, exercise and mental *habits* that'll help you get into better shape and health - and keep you there. Thus the title: Healthy Habits.At the core of the Healthy Habits program, and something that makes the book unusual in my view, is a series of four ""cycles"" as Cole calls them that last about six weeks each.  Each cycle incorporates a program of diet and exercise to burn flab and build up stamina and strength. On completing a given cycle, you take a self test that lets you know if you're ready to move on to the next. The cycles are slowly progressive - you gradually build up habits you can use in the next cycle.Cycle one is mainly about the importance of getting rid of refined sugar from your diet, and how to do it. Americans are hugely addicted to refined sugar and the average person eats about 150 pounds of it a year. Unfortunately, it has no nutritive value whatsoever and gets stored in your body as fat. Worse still, it leaches out essential vitamins and nutrients that you need to function. I'd heard refined sugar isn't good for you but never realized before just how contrary it is to good health. Basically, you'd do better starving because refined sugar's worse than nothing. After a lifetime spent eating it we don't even realize how addicted we've become. Not only that, sugar's a hidden ingredient in lots of foods, even those that are touted as healthy. Manufacturers slip it into all kinds of stuff. Cole goes after refined sugar like public enemy number one.  He tells how to eliminate it from your diet and gives a list of sugar alternatives with their relative merits. Interestingly, it seems that once you beat your sugar jones, it starts to taste bad - even to the point of making you nauseous.The fitness component to this cycle involves doing stuff that you already enjoy doing. This is an important point with the book: you don't have to kill yourself doing stuff you'd rather not. You can burn lots of calories doing things you actually like to do.Cycle two is about eating healthier, and getting the right balance of proteins and carbohydrates in your diet. Recipes for healthy eating are given. The fitness component involves expanding on your exercise routine.Cycle three is about eliminating certain fats from your diet entirely while reducing others; and decreasing your sodium intake. Along with refined sugar, there's lots of fat lurking in our cupboards. The book discusses these in  some detail (especially Trans fat and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil), and ways to purge them from your diet. The reader's encouraged to read food labels to see just how much hidden sugar, fat and salt their food actually contains.  Here I think the book could have been improved by giving some examples and instructions for reading food labels, but it's not hard to learn. More recipes for healthy eating are given. The fitness component discusses upper level activities like group sports, charity runs, etc.Cycle four gives instructions about calorie counting - and its importance for people who really want to be slimmer. The first three cycles were about losing weight while becoming fitter, this cycle is about keeping the weight off and keeping fit. The simple math is that if you want to lose weight you must burn more calories than you take in (to lose a pound a week you need to burn 500 more calories a day than you eat). To maintain stasis it's necessary that you eat no more than you excrete.  Apparently lots of people can't wrap their brains around calorie counting, but the way Cole describes it it's really not hard, just an acquired skill you'll be able to do in your head before long. There are sites on the Internet that do much of the grunt work for you. The fitness program of this cycle offers types of advanced exercise regimes.For me, Healthy Habits was a very fast read. Especially given that it's a weight loss book. Cole has an accessible, conversational style; like he's lifting weights next to you in the gym. There are lots of interesting observations based on his experience as a strength and conditioning trainer that make sense. One thing he repeatedly emphasizes is the importance of group exercise, be it  jazzercize, Judo or jousting.  Solo exercise routines rarely endure - as all the dusty Bowflexes and Nautilus equipment in America's garages attests. There are just too many interruptions for you to concentrate on exercising properly. Plus, humans are by nature social beings. The four Healthy Habits cycles seem to me very reasonable. You build up over six weeks until you're ready to graduate to the next cycle.  And if you fail to pass one of the self tests in order to graduate, you just back up a couple weeks and proceed again.Update, Oct 2012: I've completed all the cycles spelled out in Healthy Habits and IT WORKED!  I'm holding in at an average of 156 lb's now.  One thing I learned from the book is that although I wasn't over eating, my sweet tooth got the better of me about once a week and I'd demolish anything sweet in sight. That seems to have been the key for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RED0Q61XKOD6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590136276#wasThisHelpful","RED0Q61XKOD6U","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this kneeling chair a month ago and have come to the conclusion that it's just an uncomfortable ride and there's no way around it. I got mine because of low back pain that was exacerbated by the old chair.First: the padding in the kneeler is inadequate at best.  The wooden frame makes itself known after just a few minutes and after an hour my knees are screaming. I'm not all that big either - 5'9"", 165 lbs.  It'd probably be more uncomfortable for people bigger and heavier than me. Also, my aching knees are continuously sliding forward on the kneeler and I have to wiggle back up every couple of minutes. This is because the kneeler nearly parallels the floor - it needs more of an upward angle but it can't be adjusted.The seat has problems too. It's pretty hard and in my case at least needs to be a little more parallel to the floor - but it can't be adjusted either.  The back rest is adjustable but it has only three settings - none of which fit me. There's a high/low adjuster underneath the seat that I've monkey'd with a dozen times but to no avail.  It just trades one discomfort for another. My back pain has let up somewhat, but now my knees hurt and are growing callouses.  Getting up to walk after an hour or two in this thing has me feeling like I'm 90 years old.In a nutshell here's what's wrong: we're not all the same size!  To make it comfortable the kneeler and seat need more padding and some way to individually adjust them. In my case the back rest is pretty much useless, except as a head rest when using the chair as a recliner.If you're anywhere near my size I highly recommend you not buy this.  Shell out the extra $$$ for a better kneeling chair. One that you can personalize to your body... with thicker padding. It hasn't been too expensive a mistake but I'm looking for something else.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38U7NJYLMJAWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TMHWN2#wasThisHelpful","R38U7NJYLMJAWU","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This little drum auger does a good job on small clogs that are halfway close to the drain.  But here's the caveat: it comes with a thumb screw (which secures the snake when the drum is spinning) that screws into a cheap, very easily broken plastic nut.  Click on the pic and it'll expand the image where you can see it better. The thumb screw/nut is the achilles heel of this thing.  Be very careful: don't overtighten the thumb screw or it'll split the nut. And if you're using an electric drill to power it don't let the thumb screw bang into anything when the drum is spinning - as that'll break the nut too.  If the nut's broken it's pretty much useless. Your only recourse then is to pull the snake out of the drum, jam it down the drain with your bare hands and hope you get lucky.  What I learned to do was replace the thumb screw with a half inch long round head machine screw and then use my fingers to tighten and loosen it.  Now the screw can't be overtightened; and if it hits anything while spinning it's only a glancing blow.Also, when using a drill keep the drum pretty close to the drain because the snake can tangle itself up if there's too much exposed.  Manually advance the snake a few inches at a time until hopefully your drain starts flowing again.

"Koyaanisqatsi made an artsy splash when it came out in 1983, but for reasons now lost I couldn't make it to a showing.  Twenty seven years later I finally got my wish.I wanted to like Koyaanisqatsi, but was forced to realize it hasn't aged well. Godfrey Reggio shows a very good eye for dramatic shots, but then works them to exhaustion.  The time lapse scenes of people scurrying around like harried ants grew wearisome after two minutes, let alone ten.  The movie's metaphor of modern life as a hotdog highway, with people as the hotdogs, was soon made abundantly clear, but Reggio seems uncertain of his audiences' intelligence and just pounds this thought into their collective skull.Likewise, Phillip Glass's score became an exercise in repetition that eventually began to grate on my ears.  To be fair Glass captures the atmosphere of the movie and the repetition in the score is a faithful reflection of the cinematography. Given the singularity of Reggio's vision he had no other option.Koyaanisqatsi would have been great as a fifteen minute short subject; but like having a guest who overstays his welcome, I was relieved when it was over.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKECJQI1OCUJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000068OCS#wasThisHelpful","RKECJQI1OCUJB","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...but not this time.  Thirty years ago I couldn't wait for the next installment of Shogun to appear on tv.  Perhaps times have changed, or I've changed, but whatever's changed, thirty years later I wonder why it was so wildly popular.Frankly, the script was wooden.  After hearing Richard Chamberlain say, ""Thou art beautiful and I love thee!"", or ""Hai, Toranaga-sama!"" for the hundredth time I was about ready to do something more productive... like grab a beer and watch the cars drive by.  The dialogue just came across as stilted; particularly in the interactions between Chamberlain's (Blackthorne/Anjin-san) and Yoko Shimada's (Mariko) characters.I realized Richard Chamberlain is just not a good actor.  His emotional depth and breadth is very limited.  Granted the role was probably a difficult one to pull off, and he was given some pretty lame lines, but Chamberlain wasn't remotely up to the job.  His facial expressions ran the gamut from A to B: A. Perturbed look... eyes narrowing.  B. Flinty smile.The interactions between Chamberlain's Anjin-san and the Jesuit priest, Father Alvito, are absurd.  Their relationship see-saws between invective and admiration without any explanation; and the dialogue between them verges on farce.  Curses of, ""You heretic!"" and ""Damn you to hell, priest!""  are interspersed with scenes of gum swapping cordiality.Another thing: Lord Toranaga (Toshiro Mifune) would perform a bizarre dance before his men in which he'd wave a fan at them while stamping his foot and shouting, ""Heeyit! Heeyit! Heeyit...!""  No explanation was given for this.  One assumes that in some mysterious way it put his samurai into a fighting mood.Lastly, it would have been nice had English subtitles been used during the Japanese segments to help the viewers sort out some of the action.The good things about this movie were:The Japanese actors (especially Toshiro Mifune) who all came across convincingly - at least when compared to the European actors. The sets, which were beautifully done; and the costumes, which were beautifully done.  One qualifier here: the Jesuits in Japan did not wear saffron colored robes, they wore black robes as they always have.Finally, the director of Photography, Andrew Laszlo, did a fine job - both indoors and outdoors - of capturing the drama and poetry inherent in such a story. In spite of the opening scene with the shadow of the cinematographer's helicopter shading a 16th century ship, IMHO he was the secret star of Shogun.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW0NQ3HSU7P88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000A2ZNX#wasThisHelpful","RW0NQ3HSU7P88","ABFFDYA1JFW7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABFFDYA1JFW7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to give this five stars for the following reasons:(1) Solid Teak: This stool is SOLID. It weighs 24 pounds because the genuine teak is so heavy.(2) Design: The Asian design (with the curved bench top) is the most comfortable stool you can find. In addition, the triangular base provides maximum support in all planes for considerable weight and shifting weight. The legs, being solid wood (instead of just legs) are perfect for moving the stool around when you are sitting on it and still maintaining stability.(3) Height: The height is perfect for using around counters in the home, or, other places. I bought this because I need a stool that provides proper height for using microscopes and working at my potting bench in my greenhouse. This provides the perfect height for using it on most counters between 30"" and 34"" in height (most home counter heights).(4) Water resistance: Since this is made of teak you can use it indoors, outdoors, wet or dry. I have to admit I am not fond of the finish (because it will fade, peel or wear over time). I would rather have had an unfinished stool so I could treat it with Tung Oil. However, this finish will look good for years out of doors (even with exposure to UV and water), or, it will look good indefinitely if you just use this indoors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35R7UN719GVDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003M15FEU#wasThisHelpful","R35R7UN719GVDX","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to give this item five stars.I have a modest sized greenhouse (about 200 square feet.  It is imperative that I provide moisture throughout intense dry summers in the Southwest, with high UV from high altitude sun.  In addition, even with sunshades, the temperatures in my greenhouse will reach 127 degrees (F) in mid and late summer.  It is imperative that I provide both moisture and cooling for plants I keep in the greenhouse year round (and cooling for myself).First of all, whoever designed this had on their thinking cap.  All of the material are of either stainless steel or high strength molded polypropylene.  The polypro is highly UV resistant, heat resistant and strong.  It will stand up to the rigors of outdoor UV, moisture and temperature extremes.There are no nozzles to clog.  The mist is emitted from the fan blades themselves.  This insures that the mist is propelled away from the unit (up to 20 feet) to avoid uneven moisture accumulations around the unit.You can control the amount of flow easily by just regulating the amount of water you are feeding to the unit (I bought the direct feed model).This model is very, very economical.  It only draws about 1.8 amps.  Most of the power for the unit comes from the water pressure if you purchase the direct feed model and just hook it up to a hose.  In addition, it only consumes about 3 gallons per HOUR (on its maximum setting) of water.This model will easily humidify 600 square feet, and, cool 300 square feet.  I can leave all of the windows open in the greenhouse for ventilation and this still provides adequate cooling and humidification for my plants (and for me).The direct feed, portable model can be moved fairly easily (to your house in the winter for example).  All you need is a faucet, an outlet and bracket to hang the unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TURRICBXR7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00816QH84#wasThisHelpful","R16TURRICBXR7D","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Notwithstanding its minor shortcomings, this pan is perfect for making yogurt or cheese.First, it is made of stainless steel.  This is a pre-requisite for preparing foods that involve gestation of bacteria.  This is easy to clean, it is easy to sterilize and it is very durable.Second, the aluminum encapsulated bottom is what you need for careful temperature management.  Aluminum is a soft metal (like copper) so it conducts heat very well.  Applying heat to the bottom, from any source, the heat will spread quickly all across the bottom and a little way up the side.  When making yogurt and cheese, you have to hit 110 degrees fairly accurately and this helps you do that with a small amount of heat from either a gas or electric stove.Third, the handle is of rolled stainless steel, which means it is hollow - that means the handle will stay relatively cool even if you are heating the contents of the pot to a high temperature.Fourth, the heavy glass lid is ideal for protecting contents from accidental contamination - it allows you to see the contents if it is covered, and, the lid has a small (nicely grommeted) hole in it to relieve steam and allow insertion of a thermometer or temperature probe so that you can monitor the temperature of the contents.Fifth, the price is fantastic compared to other forms of a pan.Sixth, the pour spouts on either side of the pan are very accurate and allow you to pour small amounts into small jars or other containers without any spill or mess.Seventh, this is a large pan and allows you to easily make up to two quarts of cheese or yogurt so that you don't have to make multiple batches.I shopped around, and bought this and I am glad I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YZYLEOBUXD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00061U43Q#wasThisHelpful","R5YZYLEOBUXD6","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not food or fertilizer.What this is, is a live culture of the four basic types of micro-organisms that are necessary for plant health, growth and maintenance.I agree with the other reviewer.  The company that is marketing this has done a very poor job of providing users with the information they need to use this effectively.All plants need four types of micro-organisms around their root systems to extract and store nutrients (such as nitrogen) from the soil.  The four types are:  fungi, bacteria, protozoa and nematodes.  There is a complex interaction between these microorganisms, and plants, to maintain healthy soil.  Teaming with Microbes: The Organic Gardener's Guide to the Soil Food Web, Revised EditionThis culture provides all four types of micro-organisms.This culture is most useful when you are trying to re-establish soil structure (after heavy fertilization or use of chemicals, or drought, or augmentation with compost, etc.)  It will re-introduce the necessary micro-organisms into your soil that plants need to extract basic food from the soil (nitrogen and carbon, especially).  Just as we need pro-biotics in our digestive system to digest food, plants need these micro-organisms to ""digest"" raw materials in the soil into forms that the plant can assimilate.  This concept is known as ""bioavailability.""Couple of pointers on using this.  First, if you are smart, you will culture this yourself before using it.  When I received it I examined it for live organisms under a micro-scope.  It is a live culture.  I cultured it in two disposable petri dishes just to make sure.  It yielded a substantial culture within ten days.To use this, you want to add about 40 ccs (two tablespoons) to a gallon of water, and, just water your plants around the base so that the water and the micro-organisms get into the root system.  You can also use this to inoculate your plant roots when planting or potting them.  If you are planting or potting flowering or fruit bearing plants or trees, you should also consider inoculating the root system with a small amount of mychorizzae (a benign fungus that vastly increases root system efficiency).  Mycorrhizae Inoculant (Earth Ambrosia/Earth Nectar) - 32 OunceThis stuff is expensive so, to stretch it out, I culture my own after I've bought the bottle.  I use a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask.  I add about 100 cc of ordinary water, 75 cc of the stuff in this bottle, and about 75 cc of ordinary molasses or sugar.  I let the flask sit in a warm (not hot) place for a week or two and the result is about 8 ounces of the stuff in the bottle - which is enough for adding to four gallons of water.  (You don't have to culture it yourself - you can just buy the stuff and use it straight from the bottle, but, I don't like paying this manufacturer because they rip you off on the shipping fees, and, don't offer any support).Get this stuff into the root systems of your plants and it will help them maintain a healthy root structure so that they can draw nutrients from the soil.I use it because I have some of the worst soil in the world and I need to bio-activate it after adding iron and organic material (compost) to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7HRBRE6CK79M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TM97NA#wasThisHelpful","R7HRBRE6CK79M","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film has very, very little content.  It is mostly conjecture about Einstein's relationship to his wife and their relationship.  In addition, the production and filming are accurately described as ""amateur.""The premise of the film is that Einstein's first wife was the real discoverer of his theories of special relativity and space-time.Mileva was a physics student with Einstein.  He married her, and, during their second year of marriage, after the birth of his son in 1905, he published his four *now famous) papers on physics.It is clear in history that Mileva edited his papers before he submitted them to Max Plank.  However, her own correspondence and journals show that the seminal ideas in Einstein's papers were inspirations that he had entertained long before ever meeting Mileva.If you like revisionism, then this is a interesting speculation based work of entertainment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LOS924RMTMR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055MQSKY#wasThisHelpful","R2LOS924RMTMR1","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was impressed with the quality of the design of this sifter.First, at 4 cups, it's just about the right size for any baking or cooking.Second, the bottom of the sifter is slightly funneled so that you have a good chance of getting the sifted material into a one cup (or larger) measuring cup.  (I think this is great since the secret to most recipes is to sift the material many times - this is especially true for soufflets and cakes).Third, the stainless steel makes this a snap to clean, and keep clean.  It also doesn't allow flour or powdered sugar to stick to it so much that you can't shake it or knock it off with a few raps of your hand).

"I'd give this documentary five stars except for the poor quality of the soundtrack (the music is obnoxious and drowns out the commentators and the narrator - there are no subtitles).This documentary is very, very well-written.  It covers many of the moral, political and military issues of the time.  The re-creation of the battle scenes is some of the best that I've viewed.  The re-creations give you a real sense of the hardships and tragedies endured by the troops.The documentary seems to be fair and balanced, exploring the views and beliefs of both sides in the conflict (North and South).  The well-written narration illuminates many of the historical forces that shaped the world-shaking conflict.  For example, much of the brutality visited by the North on the South, at the end of the War, arose simply because everyone was despondent over the War and wanted it to end.  As the CSA still had over 150,000 troops in the field at the time of Appomattox (Lee's surrender), the War could have continued indefinitely.The documentary accurately points out the terrible attrition on both sides of the conflict (over 500,000 died on both sides) and the drastic efforts of leaders, on both sides, to try to end the conflict by decisive battles.There is a balanced, and erudite exploration of the moral and legal issues of slavery in the South.  There is also a very-well written episode on the efforts to reconstruct the South after the War, and, the political battles fought over the issue of whether to punish the South for the insurrection.In all, this is one of the best documentaries I've viewed on the Civil War.This makes an excellent background for understanding the political events which are the focus of Steven Spielberg's recent film: Lincoln","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDHZEAZQD9RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086IMN80#wasThisHelpful","RHDHZEAZQD9RC","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great innovation for baking.I bought this to make Czech Rakvičky (which is one of the items shown in the photos).This is a hybrid between a metal pan and a silicone mold.The advantages are that the silicone mold for the bars is flexible.  Once you have finished baking, you can easily pop the bars out of the pan from below.  The silicone is a non-stick surface and you don't have to worry about toxins from scratched teflon coatings.  The bars come right out without having to use any kind of coating on the inside of the molds.In addition, the silicone mold has a rigid metal ring around it, with metal handles, so that when you are carrying the pan to the oven, or taking it out, you don't have to deal with the silicone flopping all over the place.

The footage does not spare us from the grim realities of the War, but, accurately portrays its horrors and the incredible courage of the sailors who faced long odds.It is difficult to find a more detailed and accurate account of the war in the Pacific than this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R117XX0ZZYQN2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XJM7T2#wasThisHelpful","R117XX0ZZYQN2G","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in the semi-arid Southwest of the U. S.Humidity is usually down around 10-30% most of the years.  In the cold, during the winter, the air is even dryer.  These provide soothing relief for a dry throat, or even a sore throat.These drops come in convenient packaging, and, if you buy three of them, they are economical.  I can keep one package in the car, one at home, and one at the office.The taste is very pleasant (I love Wild Cherry) and the soothing quality of these drops is very high.  Ludens has been making throat lozenges ever since I can remember and their excellence shines through in this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V21ABQ0A0OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HF1B74#wasThisHelpful","R1V21ABQ0A0OK","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to agree with the reviewers who found this DVD to be somewhat limiting.There are some great CGI reconstructions of the Parthenon as it existed in ancient times.  However, except for that, much of this DVD focuses on modern Greece.  Much of it is little more than a travelogue.The photography is beautiful, but, there was little footage of the ancient Greek structures for which most people seek out documentaries on Greece.In all, I would not again pay the price for this DVD.

"I bought this because it seemed identical to an oil can that my father used in the 1950's.To my pleasant surprise, this can is manufactured with the same made-in-usa quality as the ones my father used.Here are the reasons I like this oil can:First, it is made of heavy gauge metal.  I don't have to worry about leaking oil all over my car or tractor because of cheap materials that won't stand up to an honest working environment.Second, it is made in the good-ole U. S. of A.Third, the bottom is both crimped and welded so that this can will still hold oil if I drop it, accidentally run it over, keep it on my tractor where there is significant vibration and shock, or use it in demanding work situations.Fourth, the trigger mechanism is driven by a heavy gauge spring.Fifth, being made of steel, instead of plastic or cheap metal, if I dent it, ding it, drop it, or stress it, it won't break, and, if something on it does break, I have a chance of fixing it instead of having to throw it away.The paint on the outside of the can is thick metal enamel and it was primed before it was painted.  This is a can I can keep outdoors, in handy places where I need it the most, without having to worry that it will corrode beyond usable limits.This can is made the way ""they used to be made.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R254MVCGK5U3GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004YK6X#wasThisHelpful","R254MVCGK5U3GW","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really pleased to find this album on Amazon.My family originated in Prague.  When I was young we shared many Czech carols at Christmastime with my grandparents and family.This album is a classically arranged collection of authentic Czech Christmas carols.  The accompaniment is by prominent Czech classical musicians and vocalists.Each of them are beautiful, and, well-performed.  The arrangements are not only professional, they are delightful as well.All of the Carols are in Czech, and, the vocals are performed by native Czech speaking performers.The quality of the performances on this compilation is very, very high.  The quality rivals Der Wiener Sängerknaben (Vienna Boys' Choir) collections.Czech music and culture faded into the background after WWI.  We lose sight of the fact that Prague was THE center of arts and sciences, in Europe, during the renaissance.  This album is a reminder of centuries of Czech music that have delighted those in search of the Christmas Spirit.The title means:  ""Czech Christmas Jewels""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DV2JRMXJPQEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JJV2F2#wasThisHelpful","R2DV2JRMXJPQEM","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Four and a half stars.There are a lot of reasons to give this binder five stars.First, it is a definite improvement over previous vinyl binders because it uses a non-stick vinyl.  The vinyl cover will no longer absorb ink from the pages of copies.Second, the ring mechanism is also an improvement.  You need very little pressure on the tab in order to open and close the rings.  However, the rings are still rounded and tend to bend the pages a little when the rings are full.Third, it has four transparent pockets - two on the inside of each cover.  These are great for including cd-roms, DVD's and index pages.Fourth, it is easy to slip a cover sheet on the outside of the front cover so that you can easily label the contents.  There is also a transparent strip on the side of the binder that is transparent so that you can easily insert a spline information paper on the side.Fifth, the binders are relatively lightweight.I would have given these five stars except they are not as ""heavy duty"" as I had hoped.  When they are full of paper (they will take almost a full ream) they tend to bend.However, I think this is still the best binder out on the market today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MQI349UTF4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LNP9XY#wasThisHelpful","R26MQI349UTF4X","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned two of the 3TB Hitachi drives for over a year.  They are quiet, reliable and inexpensive per TB.I purchased this as a third drive for my Apple Mac Pro.  The access (read speed) is seamless on my Mac Pro.  For my main drive, I am running a 300 GB Intel SSD which is, of course, very fast.  I recently moved by iTunes library to the Hitachi to free up about 50 GB on my SSD.  Once I moved the music library for iTunes, there was no noticeable difference in the access speed for the Hitachi from the access speed for the music on the SSD.The read speeds are everything I expected and the drives have performed flawlessly and reliably for over a year.In addition, while running the SSD and three of these Hitachi drives, there is almost no noise from the cabinet from the operation of the drives.

"This series is one of the finest treatments of Western Art and Art History that is available in multimedia.  It is a series that appeals to both experienced art historians, and, persons who want an introduction to art history.This second episode focuses on the cathedrals and churches constructed in Europe from the tenth century (Romanesque period) to the High Gothic period.  It shows how the Middle Age architects used the Roman principles of architecture and engineering, and how they refined Roman building techniques, to create the extraordinary cathedrals and churches of the Middle Ages.  This episode not only focuses on the cathedrals of France and Spain, but, also on the Norman spread of Romanesque architecture to England.  In appreciating this episode, it helps to have viewed the first episode in the series:  The Classical Ideal, but, it is not necessary to view the first episode in order to appreciate this one..The episode focuses on the development of the High Gothic cathedrals in Chartres and St. Deny (in France) and the perfection of the High Gothic cathedrals in England after the Norman conquest.The series then continues, in the next episode, to show the extraordinary contributions that Italian artists made to art and architecture during the Early Renaissance period.  The Early RenaissanceI really enjoyed watching this series.  I own the DVD set, but, found that Amazon's digital download provides better resolution for HD tv's than a progressive scan image from the 1989 DVD set.  Art of the Western WorldMichael Wood (see below) has taken a unique approach to art history in this program.  Instead of telling a story of art with arcane analysis, he presents a series of presentations by art experts that explain Western Art, from the Greeks to present day, in the context of the historical realities in which the Art developed.This series follows a companion book of the same title (although the book is not necessary for viewing the DVD).  ART OF THE WESTERN WORLD From Ancient Greece to Post ModernismI highly recommend this series as an excellent overview of Art History in the West that allows us to understand, not only Art, but, its origins.For those of us who have viewed Michael Wood's documentaries, he needs no introduction. For those of us who haven't, here is a brief summary: Wood has produced over 100 documentaries in this thirty year career as a journalist, scholar and broadcaster. Each of them brings history alive. Much of his focus, in his documentaries, is on dispelling myths and misconceptions about history. His documentaries are scholarly, yet fascinating to even the average viewer. He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, the Royal Society of Arts and the Society of Antiquaries. He is a governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company and a Pro- Chancellor of the University of Staffordshire.Trivia: Wood's charismatic presence on the screen and his looks are appealing especially to women. He was humorously dubbed ""the thinking woman's crumpet"" by British newspapers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X2MQRW4BOO0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NF00B4#wasThisHelpful","R2X2MQRW4BOO0O","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was one of the first historical publications on Mesa Verde National Park.  It was published by the U. S. Department of the Interior in 1937.  There are no photographs or illustrations.  It was intended as a reading pamphlet for those who were visiting the Park in 1937.It is not very readable.  Nevertheless, it contains valuable information on the history of Mesa Verde, especially the history of its pre-columbian inhabitants (now generically known as the ""Anasazi."")There is a valuable timeline for the indigenous cultures in inhabiting Mesa Verde that also includes a dateline for the post-columbian discoveries at Mesa Verde.There are interesting descriptions of how Mesa Verde appeared to visitors only forty years after the cliff dwellings were discovered.Also of interest, are the anthropological commentaries on the surrounding ruins at McPhee Reservoir and what is now known as ""Canyons of the Ancients National Monument"" (formerly: ""Hovenweep"") which are strewn across the plains from Mesa Verde to the Utah border in Southwest Colorado.In all, though there are no photographs, the commentary is helpful in understanding the relationship of the Mesa Verde inhabitants to the Chaco Canyon civilization in New Mexico.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE67BEVHAQ4AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XZAJ4A#wasThisHelpful","RE67BEVHAQ4AH","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was impressed with the quality and attractiveness of these dividers.First, the dividers are heavy card stock (about 150 lb).  The tabs are mylar coated so that they will stand up to repeated fingering and referencing.Second, the mylar tabs are very colorful and it is easy from the index page to find the documents you are looking for in their particular divider.  This is particularly useful when you are trying to help people find documents, using the index, over the phone or during a presentation (i.e. ""turn to document number 15 with the lime green tab"").Third, the first page of the index is 8 1/2 x 11.  You can easily run it through a printer, or, make photocopies of it on a standard copy machine.The colors are bright and arranged in the order of the spectrum.The listing is not clear, and the photographs in this listing don't show it, but the tabs are numbered instead of lettered.  This makes it easier to identify documents if your index contains more than 26.I would have given this five stars except for Avery's template.  It took a significant amount of time to locate the template on their website, fill out e-forms in order to get it mailed to us by email, and save it from the Avery email to our computers.  The template itself is temperamental, and, doesn't give you full WYSIWYG.  The template requires modification in order to use it in Microsoft word and be readable on the index sheet.  The template is programmed to provide centered entries using only 10 pt type (which is barely readable on the index sheet).  In addition, the template doesn't fully display the text and the line entries.  We had to type the entries several times, adjust the line spacing, and modify the margins in order to get a professional looking index sheet.  You can find the template on Avery's website by searching for the Avery form #:  600088 (which is printed on the lower right corner of the index page).On the positive side, the template works with MS Word for either MAC or Windows.Notwithstanding the expense for these, and the difficulties with the template, if you must make a professional multi-document presentation, these are the best, most attractive, and most professional indexes available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWH8PWPIZ2KZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IBVK#wasThisHelpful","RWH8PWPIZ2KZD","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is pretty good stuff.  At this price, for five pounds including shipping, it is also a real bargain.Gardening is a mystery to some people.  I am one of them.  However, I am learning.This is the stuff to use if you have flowering bulbs that aren't flowering, or, that you would like to flower.  Actually, this stuff will help any plant produce flowers.For example, I planted a half-dozen beautiful bearded iris last fall.  They came up this year.  Divided (multiplied) and grew very nice healthy green leaves and stalks.However, not one of them flowered.That is because bulbs need a LOT of Phosphate to produce flowers year after year.  You have to add phosphate in almost every soil condition to keep them flowering after the first year.This stuff is (1) cheap; (2) and has large beads.  It is the same stuff that large companies add to ordinary fertilizer to encourage blooming flowers.  All the big companies do is use a dye to turn this stuff a pretty pink, The Scotts Co. 1009501 Scotts Rose & Bloom Food, or a pretty green Miraclegro Bloom Booster 1.5#, and they charge you three times as much for the dye and the pretty packaging.The large beads are particularly desireable for garden flowers because they take longer to dissolve than the other brands with smaller beads.To get bulbs to flower in any season you need to add this stuff to the soil right around the bulbs the year before.Loosen up the soil around the bulb (being very careful not to injure the bulb), mulch it with compost and manure (especially cattle manure - (chicken manure can be too strong)), and, add about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of this stuff around the bulb.  Water it well and it will help the bulb produce prolific flowers in the Spring.MORE IS NOT BETTER.  Triple super phosphate, in about six months, will oxidize into phosphoric acid.  This is exactly what most flowering plants need to flower.  Roses and grapevines love the extra acid.  However, too much phosphoric acid can burn plants.  Go easy on the application of this stuff.  No more than a teaspoon or tablespoon spread around the base of the plant's stem.Renew the phospate around the bulbs every year.The best way I've found to store stuff like this is in half-gallon mason jars. Jarden 68100 6 Count Wide Mouth Canning Jars They are airtight, water tight, and, they are really handy.  One half-gallon mason jar will hold just about one package of this stuff (4 lbs.).  (Stay away from jars with plastic lids.  The plastic will freeze, break, won't stand of the Sun's uv, and will just break apart if you store the jars outside for any period of time).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUCENRUM7J8BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ACPOIA#wasThisHelpful","RUCENRUM7J8BD","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All the big companies do is use a dye to turn this stuff a pretty pink, The Scotts Co. 1009501 Scotts Rose & Bloom Food, or a pretty green Miraclegro Bloom Booster 1.5#, and they charge you three times as much for the dye and the pretty packaging.The large beads are particularly desireable for garden flowers because they take longer to dissolve than the other brands with smaller beads.To get bulbs to flower in any season you need to add this stuff to the soil right around the bulbs the year before.Loosen up the soil around the bulb (being very careful not to injure the bulb), mulch it with compost and manure (especially cattle manure - (chicken manure can be too strong)), and, add about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of this stuff around the bulb.  Water it well and it will help the bulb produce prolific flowers in the Spring.MORE IS NOT BETTER.  Triple super phosphate, in about six months, will oxidize into phosphoric acid.  This is exactly what most flowering plants need to flower.  Roses and grapevines love the extra acid.  However, too much phosphoric acid can burn plants.  Go easy on the application of this stuff.  No more than a teaspoon or tablespoon spread around the base of the plant's stem.Renew the phospate around the bulbs every year.The best way I've found to store stuff like this is in half-gallon mason jars. Jarden 68100 6 Count Wide Mouth Canning Jars They are airtight, water tight, and, they are really handy.  One half-gallon mason jar will hold just about one package of this stuff (4 lbs.).  (Stay away from jars with plastic lids.  The plastic will freeze, break, won't stand of the Sun's uv, and will just break apart if you store the jars outside for any period of time).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18F02ALZPPV2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JEQQDO#wasThisHelpful","R18F02ALZPPV2G","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are many reasons to respect this film.This film was a made in 1969 - a time in which nudity and sexuality in film were relegated to the category of ""pretentious smut"" in grindhouse ""art"" theaters.This film is an early exploration of human sexuality at a time when exploring our sexuality was still ""taboo.""  Many people didn't experience this period in our history.  This was one of the first films released in the U. S. to (tastefully) depict full frontal nudity, lesbian encounters and the healing powers of intimacy.The film is about the mystical powers of intimacy that heal and empower individuals.  There are only four characters in the film.  Each of them represent one of four archetypes in the symbolism of the Tarot.  Mysticism (beyond organized religion) was also a taboo subject up until the early seventies.  For example, the principal character is a young (""smokin' hot) woman who is sexually independent, confident in her sexuality, and, engages the other three characters in intimacy.  She is represented by the ""priestess"" in the Tarot.  The Tarot is fairly described as a map of human consciousness expressed in universal (and timeless) anthropological symbols.  The Tarot Handbook: Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols.The young boy in the film (just coming of age) is a metaphor for the ""magus"" (magician or transformer) in the Tarot.  He is young, innocent and mercurial.  His archetype represents the power of innocence and youth to transform.  There was an entire film from the period, with Anthony Quinn, that was devoted specifically to this archetype.  The Magus (with a young Michael Caine and Candice Bergen).Typical of films directed and written by Radley Metzger, this film focuses on human sexuality.Metzger was not permitted to make films like the Likerish Quartet in the U.S.  However, in the more receptive venues in Europe, he had the freedom to add to his list of pioneering art films in the area of human sexuality.  At the time, in the U.S.,  Metzger was considered a director who exploited nudity and explicit sex scenes as perversions.  His list of films (many of which are now highly regarded and respected) include: (Therese & Isabelle) (exploring tenderness in lesbian intimacy) Therese and Isabelle; The Image (exploring sado-eroticism and BDSM) The Image; and Camille 2000 (exploring the emptiness of meaningless sexual relationships (sex without intimacy)  Camille 2000 (Extended Version).These were forbidden subjects in U. S. film in 1970.Although many viewers considered the nudity and sexual encounters in the Lickerish Quartet as ""shocking"" back in 1970, the film is tasteful and tame by today's standards.  It's not a film for prurient interests.  It is a view of how tenderness and sexuality can combine, in our relationships, to heal and allow us to grow.Why did Metzger include ""shocking"" nudity and sex scenes in his films?  There are two reasons.  First, he was a genuine avant-garde of artists who believed that human sexuality was something positive for humanity, instead of something salacious to be hidden in dark rooms.  The word ""lickerish"" means ""lecherous, lustful or lewd"" - the film shows that sexuality is a healing power that can transform, instead of being a burden to our consciousness.  Second, Metzger wanted his films to be widely viewed to bring our sexuality out into the open - the nudity and explicit sex made the films commercially viable by attracting more (sexually active) viewers.Metzger's films are now regarded as innovative masterpieces instead of grindhouse smut.  The prurient sex scenes in the film distract many.  However, underlying all of his films, there is a tender view of male and female sexuality and its mysteries.In one of the scenes, Sylvana Ventrurelli (the ""priestess"") is seeking out the young man.  She finds him on the roof of an old castle, waiting for her.  She says that it was difficult to find him given the many staircases and passageways of the old castle.  She didn't think she would find him.  The innocent young man (the magus or transformer) responds that on his way to the roof, he had ""left a thread of hope to guide her through the labyrinth.""""A thread of hope to guide us through the labyrinth"" of human intimacy is Metzger's legacy to us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QRHYAUGTYQIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004D8P23K#wasThisHelpful","R3QRHYAUGTYQIS","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Briffault's book was one of the most important pre-war (WWII) works of literature regarding the Nazi defile of Europe, and, the subsequent totalinarianism of the Soviets under Stalin.  Briffault, a physician, wrote Europa in 1935 to try to ""wake up"" the world as to what was happening in Germany under National Socialism.The book was intended to ""wake-up"" the world as to the dangers posed by the meteoric rise of National Socialism in Germany, and, the attending military buildup.This novel contains some social commentary that is considered politcally incorrect in our (post-revisionist) modern history.  Much of the novel, however, follows the social philosophy in the original edition of Alduous Huxley's ""Brave New World Revisited.""  Brave New World and Brave New World RevisitedI do not recommend the modern day printings of Huxley's ""Brave New World Revisited.""  They have been edited by revisionists to exclude much of Huxley's brilliant analysis of the forces that lead to WWII and Nazi domination of Germany and Europe.  Only a first edition, or, editions published prior to the 1970's, of the books, are accurate as to Huxley's insights into history.For a more erudite and mainstream treatment of Briffault's sentiments, expressed in this novel, try reading the wonderful ""Lanny Budd"" series by Upton B. Sinclair (Nobel prize for ""The Jungle"").  Although Sinclair was considered a socialist in pre-war literature, and, actually ran on the socialist ticket for governor of California, his views would be considered ""moderate"" in our current political climate.I highly recommend this edition of Europa, Huxley's ""Brave New World Revisited"", and, Sinclair's ""Lanny Budd"" series to anyone wanting a realistic portrayal of the unrevised history leading up to WWII and the devastation of Europe.Sinclair's first novels in the Lanny Budd series are readily available World's End (First Volume of Lanny Budd series), and, are still Five Star reading.  Sinclair's ""Dragon's Teeth"" (the third book in the series) won a Pulitzer for his education of American audiences as to Nazi aggression and atrocities prior to our entry into WWII.  Dragon's Teeth(Sinclair's ""Lanny Budd"" series was (at least at one time) the most prolific series of novels ever written.  It comprises some three million words, and, extends over 11 volumes (over 11,000 pages)).""History repeats itself . . . that's one of the things wrong with history.""  - Clarence Darrow","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTS12ZW772A8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J7273O#wasThisHelpful","RTS12ZW772A8S","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to agree with the other reviewer.Pure tung oil is irreplaceable as the best wood preserver.  I've been using the ""Real Milk"" oil, which I buy by the gallon, for almost seven years.  I've used it on cedar, teak, and redwood and just about every other kind of wood).  For example, I have a cedar pergola over my hot tub.  I live at 7,000 feet - the UV, wind, low humidity combine to destroy wood.  I treated it with one dilute coat of tung oil (diluted with citrus solvent Real Milk Paint Citrus Solvent - 32 oz.) and it has barely faded over six years of exposure to extreme outdoor conditions.I did the same with an unfinished teak rocking chair.  Teak Rocking Chair With Gently Sloped Seat Curved Lumbar Support Solid Brass Fittings & Constructed of Java TeakAfter five years out on my porch, it still retains a flat golden color and shows absolutely no sign of aging, cracking, drying or fading.I learned that it is best to start with an unfinished surface.  If the wood is a soft wood (like redwood or cedar) you might want to give it a quick once over with an orbit sander (medium or fine grit).  Then I mix the pure tung oil with an equal amount of citrus solvent.  (You have to be careful not allow this mix to freeze or the oil will crystalize).  I give the wood a heavy coat.  It usually takes about 24 hours for most woods to absorb the mix.  The citrus solvent will simply vaporize, leaving the pure tung oil in the wood's pores.Another good reason to use citrus solvent with tung oil is that it leaves an FDA surface - meaning it's completely non-toxic to living things.  I used it for an expensive bee hive (made from cypress) because bees are very sensitive to toxicity (cypress is also non-toxic to living things).  They are thriving and the hive still looks like the day I treated it with the tung oil.I always keep a gallon of this stuff around, with a gallon of the citrus solvent, as it will treat, seal and preserve any wood (without petroleum distillates).Most finish products on the market that claim to be ""Tung Oil"" finishes are not.  Be very careful.  Most of them only contain about 20% or so of tung oil.  The rest is usually shellac, varnish or other  products mixed with a little tung oil.  If your objective is the natural beauty of your wood, and, to preserve it even in extreme conditions, then you cannot find a substitute for pure tung oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7DO9QJETQPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RO1PJC#wasThisHelpful","R2R7DO9QJETQPD","A3B4G8FF8VC1V3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B4G8FF8VC1V3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After the deaths of two husbands and a fiancé, Claire Saint-Ange is branded the Widow Spider in her coastal Maine town. Tormented by threatening phone calls and desperate to prove her innocence, Claire hires a P.I. But her attraction to the rugged investigator poses an even greater threat. She can’t risk losing someone she cares about… not again. Never again.  Two tragic losses cause federal agent Michael Quinn to submit his resignation, but he’s forced into one last gig—spend Christmas investigating the widow’s connection to her last husband’s drug smuggling. Uncovering this lovely, mysterious woman’s darkest secrets should be just an assignment, but her gentle soul and passion break down his walls and make him long to believe in her innocence.  The frozen Maine landscape, deadly attacks, and shocking revelations test Claire and Michael at every turn—but it's the blazing desire between them that threatens their very lives.The attraction between the MC's is almost immediate.  Even though ""Quinn's"" mind battles that attachment.  Everything points to her being the Widow Spider, not an innocent. But as time goes on, more mysteries, more attacks manifest.  Its confusing for both of them because nothing seems to fit together, they just can't connect the dots.  The whole town hated her, snubbed her, supected her, accused her. With very little real proof against her.  There was an exception or two but the hatred was well demonstrated.  There were plenty of twists and turns and people with their own agenda's in this story.  It did start out kind of slow in the beginning, and I wasn't sure if I was going to like that but I'm glad I continued because it was pretty good.I wanted to talk about one of Quinn's supporters in the story.  Cruz is Quinn's swaggering,  handsome but good hearted friend and partner.  He adds to the story in the times that he shows up.  He likes women and they like him and he has a good sense of humor.  He also backs Quinn as much as he can.I liked the addition of french but even better the meaning explained in the story as you read along.  Some authors that I have read don't always do that.  In addition there is sharing of their differing cultures, especially during Christmas.It looks like Cruz gets his own story, which is good because he wasn't in this book all that much.

"Philippe Toussaint takes his roles seriously: New Orleans Missing Persons Detective, First-born Son, Protector. When his only niece is abducted, he'll do anything to secure her safe return. With few clues and limited time, he seeks answers from every resource, no matter how far-fetched.Intensely private artist Claire Davenport fears the worst when a frightened teen girl shows up in her dreams and her most recent paintings. Now, her secret dream paintings are playing out in real life. She wants to help but fears her psychic ability will be exposed, forcing her to relive the devastating events that caused her world to implode.Can she trust Philippe to keep her secret so that she can protect her own safety while working with him to save the innocent teen girl? Can Philippe set aside his doubts to work with the unwilling artist?Claire never expected to fall in love, especially not with such a prominent man. She is certain she can never be safe in Philippe's upper crust, public world, despite his promises to love and protect her. The case is only the beginning of their problems.Can Philippe protect the woman he is falling in love with and her secret? Can Claire find a way to fit into his elite society life? Will betrayal and fear destroy their dreams of love?What a hellacious life Claire has lived because of her ""gift"".  It all started when she was a normal 8 year old.  When it was discovered, she became an instant outcast, especially when her dreamscape came to pass.  It was the total opposite for  Philippe who was a part of the warm, outgoing, beloved Toussaint family.  I found it sad that while hugging was almost as natural as breathing to them, Claire had difficulty remembering when she had been hugged last.  That emotion and others were well shown in the story.  The friendship between Philippe and his detective friend and partner Geo, was good; at times juvenile, in a good and funny way though.  He was practically a member of the family, with sparks shooting off him and Philippe's sister, Delphine.  Now there is a story I would like to read too (Unwind My Love).  With such a large family, both natural born Toussaints and adopted ones there will be plenty of future stories to be had.  Now back to Claire and Philippe's story...the tension between the two of the was good.  It was going to take a lot for Claire to really trust him.  And let's face it, he blew it a few times.  He was handsome and sexy but he was a clod more than once when it came to relating to Claire  He also hurt her more than once, although he didn't mean to.  The pressure and guilt about not being able to find his niece was part of the problem in the beginning.  The sexual tension between the two had them jumping into bed pretty quickly before they really got to know each other that well on other levels.  The connection between the MC's was there, now they just had to work their way to seeing if it could be more.  There will be more problems to complicate things of course, but this is a story about romance as much as it is about the mystery of where Alexis is and if she can be found....alive.I really liked the story being set in New Orleans, it was a good setting without being too detailed.The damage that was done during the flooding was woven into the story without taking over the story.Just wanted to mention I'm not a fan of  psychics but this story didn't dig too deep into that.  The story idea is what called to me, so I took a chance on selecting this book.

"Billionaire Luke Devereaux gets what he wants and what he wants right now is to bring down the shady organization threatening his family. Teaming up with the FBI is his only option--even if that option comes in the sultry Evelyn Price, the ice-princess who's all business.  Refusing to be distracted by the sexy, rich playboy, Evelyn forces herself to stay focused on the case, gearing up for the criminal takedown of her entire career. As the enemy closes in with Evelyn as its next target, it's up to Luke to keep them out of danger. The more they work to protect each other, and fight for control, the harder it is to resist their undeniable attraction. And the one thing Evelyn has learned from working with him is that Luke Devereaux gets what he wants.Yes, Evelyn Price is a tough, professional FBI agent who has an instant and continuous dislike to rich boy,  Luke  Devereaux.  And he is more than happy to return those feelings since he feels the same towards her.  She just wants to get this job done and move back to Texas ASAP.  In New York on temporary assignment, she hates the city almost as much as she dislikes Luke.  It sounds like her investigation should be fairly simple except for running into one dead end after another.  Things between Luke and Evelyn start to heat up when they are forced to spend more time together.  All as part of the investigation of course.  There are plenty of twists and turns and some unexpected betrayals in this story.  I have to admit it had me guessing all over the place.  One of the difficulties stems from Luke needing to be in control and Evelyn refusing to give up much control.  This is her assignment and he's the civilian here; and a part of her job is to protect him.  That part doesn't set well with Luke at all. There was plenty of action, when different sets of villains go after our MC's.  There is also a sex scene or two in the story. Secondary characters were well done in this story.  Luke's assistant, Cali is whip smart and plays an interesting part in the story.  She also comes up again in an excerpt from the next book, "" Taming the Boss"".

Every time they turned around they found out about another possible half-brother or sister.  In this case,  it will give the opportunity to write stories about the remaining siblings.

"The GPS episode in the beginning was a surprise, it startled me and made me laugh out loud!  Then I fell headlong in love with both of the Main Characters.  Kate had quite an unorthodox idea when it came to gaining her freedom of choices in her life.  When I began to read the story I remember thinking this is a pretty good story idea, I hope it comes up to scratch and I don't get disappointed.  I wasn't.  Of course a few things happened that were somewhat predictable when it came to how the upper crust treated Noah but it was a believable part of the story.  The author did a really good job of drawing me into the emotions of both Kate and Noah. They were from different words but yet had some similar pain and insecurities.  They ARE married and that thing about marriage in name only, wasn't gonna happen.  They were way too attracted to each other for that, so of course there are some sex scenes to the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4I2JS5J7F1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8SCJCS#wasThisHelpful","RA4I2JS5J7F1E","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After her music career crashes and burns spectacularly, Juliet Langley is forced to turn to the only other business she knows: food service. Unfortunately, bad luck strikes yet again when her two-timing fiancé robs her blind and runs off with her best waitress. Flushing what's left of her beloved café down the toilet with her failed engagement, Juliet packs up and moves back to her college stomping grounds in Nashville to manage an old friend's coffeehouse. At first glance, it seems as though nothing's changed at Java Jive. What could possibly go wrong? Only that the place is hemorrhaging money, the staff is in open revolt, and Juliet finds one unlucky employee dead in the dumpster out back before her first day is even over.  The corpse just so happens to belong to the cook who'd locked horns with Juliet over the finer points of the health code. Unimpressed with her management style, the other disgruntled employees are only too eager to spill the beans about her fiery temper to the detective on the case. Add to the mix a hunky stranger who's asking way too many questions, and suddenly Juliet finds herself in some very hot water. If she can't simmer down and sleuth her way to the real killer, she's going to get burned.The ""Redheaded She-Devil part of  Juliet's personality made me smile.  Another fire-cracker personality is Gertie.  She's the family member that helped raise Pete, Juliet's friend and owner of the cafe.  She has a heart of Gold with a dirty mouth at times.  She actually said a few funny things; dirty but funny.And the funeral that Juliet went to?  Now, generally its not nice to say but it was a hoot.  Not your typical one by any means but I have to say it made me laugh out loud!!I liked Juliet so much that I think I enjoyed her and her interactions with people the most.Sure the story started out a bit slow but then it took off and there were plenty of twists and turns to the story.  But I also think Juliet would make a great, best friend!  Pete was a really good friend and he worked well with Juliet; her often over the top responses were something he handled really well.  They had a cute relationship/friendship.  His girlfriend hated ever minute of their closeness.  Seth was a person to really watch out for, he was a bundle of handsomeness mixed with lies, secrets and surprises.  Is he one of the bad guys? There were several other interesting secondary people in the story and a major twist in the end of exactly who the Mastermind of evil was.By the way I liked the colorful, eye catching cover.I received an ARC via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R288A2QB1KF19Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOYNDKK#wasThisHelpful","R288A2QB1KF19Z","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading Book 1-"" Kidnapped Cowboy"", (which I enjoyed)  I wanted to read this book and find out how love captures Brandon, The Ogre of Lone Tree.  What an interesting but mean tag was attached to him.  It was a hurtful one that just seemed to follow him everywhere.  His cheating ex did it to hurt him and not many people took the time to look beyond the nickname.This was a charming but somewhat predictable story.  Part of the charm is seeing the softening that was always in Brandon, coming to the surface when he's around Megan.  Brandon's brother and fiance Caitlin were also quite a bit of the story to of course, being family.  You know that a train wreck is coming when it comes to part of Megan's past, you just don't know how its going to show up.  Megan has been open and honest about all of her painful past, and she's getting ready to tell the last piece.  Of course, you know it isn't going to happen soon enough and that's where the train wreck comes in.  But I'm not telling the how or the what, if you want to know, you'll have to read the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CGTQT7R9OBSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFZPEAW#wasThisHelpful","R3CGTQT7R9OBSK","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Conflicted over marriage and motherhood, Mary of Rumah has been resisting her family’s efforts to arrange a marriage. After her best friend dies in childbirth, Mary decides to escape her painful memories and embark on an idyllic life on the Sea of Galilee. But she rethinks her plan when a strong, quiet stonecutter captures her interest. Cephas isn’t as shy as she first supposed. And he intrigues and challenges Mary in ways no man has before, forcing her to confront her fears or risk losing a lifetime of adventure and happiness with…The Stonecutter.The Stonecutter is a companion novella to The Herod Chronicles Series. The story takes place between Book one The Warrior and book two The Barbarian.What a charming, sweet, with challenges story.  Mary has been through a lot but still she remains someone who's not afraid to speak out for those she loves and cares for.  Yes, even though she is brave, she still does struggle with other fears and still has nightmares.  Some of those come from the time she was kidnapped; a very fearful time.  I like during one of the crises when she was trying to help, Cephas  told her,""You are braver than you think.""It turns out that Cephas has a better understanding of Mary, than she thought.  Part of that I think is because while he was quiet, he was also observing her.  While he was gentle, kind, and had a great sense of humor, he also didn't let Mary push him around.  Smart man, she began to respect him when she saw that.  I liked both of them and they had some lively conversations too.  Since I have read both of the other stories before (The Warrior, The Barbarian) it was nice to re-visit some of the Family.But its also what I consider a good stand-alone book.I really liked the cover of the book.

"Jonathan Ramirez values his law practice and doesn’t believe in commitment, especially not to Isabella Cantari, a sassy young woman, who seems to attract trouble wherever she goes. Sicilian vendetta, fake husband, and an irascible matchmaking grandmother complicate Jonathan and Isabella’s lives. Can love conquer all?Wow, the action started right in the first chapter, within the first few paragraphs!  Bang, right off the bat, what a great way to start.Isabella Cantari, was exactly as described, spunky, sassy and skilled.  Her love of her family didn't prevent her from being her own independent self.  It felt like I got to know her a bit better than I got to know Jonathan.  Their attraction was obvious to the reader but I wish there was more time to dig a bit deeper into his personality.  But still, this is a Novella so that makes it short on time.  And after everything is said and done I think the author did a pretty good job of it.  That Jonathan was attracted to and cared about Isabella did come through really clear.  At times he was almost half afraid of her but that still didn't change the fact that he wanted to pursue her.  Oh, another thing that made him hesitant to chase after her was his boss/ her brother had told him strongly that she was off limits.  And Isabella's grandmother Nonna?  I can see where Isabella got her spunk and zest for life.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR9MWI1MWLS5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165XCILO#wasThisHelpful","RR9MWI1MWLS5B","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked this story and even as I read it, I also knew it probably wasn't for everyone.  Why?  Because it shows faith and reliance on God in action.  Not everyone wants to read that or likes to even.  But I did and also found that I liked the personalities of both Katie and Karl.  They were sweet, faithful and  both people of integrity.  Their lives had changed so much since they left their community but there were still some good things that remained unchanged too.

"Brooke Hammond leaves England determined to make a success of the Louisiana plantation she inherited. Only one obstacle stands in her way--a devilishly charming, infernally arrogant obstacle named Travis Montgomery, co-owner of her estate. If Travis marries and produces an heir within the year, Moss Grove will be his--unless he marries Brooke. Seducing Travis and then sending him on his way should be simple, but the searing desire Brooke feels in his presence presents an unexpected complication.  Travis took his father’s dilapidated estate and turned it into a profitable enterprise, and no woman is going to claim it from him. So begins a contest of wits and will, where temptation and torrid kisses are the weapons of choice, and surrender the ultimate prize. But for two worthy opponents, winning the battle may mean losing everything that matters.  Travis took his father’s dilapidated estate and turned it into a profitable enterprise, and no woman is going to claim it from him. So begins a contest of wits and will, where temptation and torrid kisses are the weapons of choice, and surrender the ultimate prize. But for two worthy opponents, winning the battle may mean losing everything that matters.I found this book to be A Good Read.  One of the interesting elements of the story was learning about the running of the plantation.  You get to learn about what it takes to grow and process sugar right along with Brooke.  It was interesting to watch Travis, a man who didn't have any feelings about any woman suddenly be caught off balance with Brooke.  Oh, he didn't show it to her that much but people who know him began to see some of it.  A neighboring friend,  Jeremy  who owns a plantation too  is the first to needle Travis about it.  He thought it was uproariously funny.  The battles between Brooke and Travis were fun to watch, they both were so determined.  He was determined to run her off and she was busy telling and showing him that he was never getting rid of her.  Both of the MC's had rough upbringings but its Brooke's past that is waiting to bite her in the butt.  I kept waiting to see how and when that would happen.  The author didn't disappoint and that wasn't the only drama going on.

"-Eva-Marie is the daughter of Chicago’s biggest drug producer.David is the son of Chicago PD’s Chief of Police.These two fall for each other without knowing that they are each other’s greatest enemy. They have society against them as well as their parents, and their situations threatening to tear them apart. Will their love be enough to defy the odds against them? Told from both characters’ point of view and set in the state of Illinois in 1950, The Improbable, is a compelling romantic novel that pushes the envelope of the typical love story and will keep you hooked until the very last page.I liked this story although at times it felt like it moved at a slower pace.  I think that this  book is probably more suited to 18+YA audience. One of the things I did notice pretty early on is that Eva-Marie and David shared at least one thing in common.  Disapproving and controlling parents.  The control that Eva-Marie's parents (especially her father) had is almost complete, and kind of hard to take.  Her mother is controlling as well but in a more sneaky, underhanded way. David's father is straight in your face control.There is a secret that Eva-Marie's family is hiding and that is mentioned fairly early on.  So is the words that the clock is ticking.  That made for a mysterious setting and as bit by bit more is revealed, I kept thinking how is this going to end well for these two young people.  Add a creep level when you consider Eva's pseudo boyfriend, Ray.  Now there is an unlikable stalker that there ever was.  I hated how Eva had to ""suck up"" to Ray when she really hated being around him.Something that also added to the story  was David's hair trigger temper; I liked him but he sure had some surprising episodes or anger.  Could it not only be because of his mother's death but also the repressed anger against his father?  That makes sense to me.This story did have some twists and turns and a few surprises that kept me reading.  I wanted to know how it was all going to end.  I do have to admit that at times it was kind of hard for me to get through though.  I pointed out the positive first, but also knowing there was a bit of the downside too.

But when they finally begin to find some ways to work together, they end up removing a huge chunk of that evil.It looks like there is another book in the series, but I'm not sure whether or not I am going to continue.

"BOOK REVIEW- FIRE & ICE-Bailey Wilde is the oldest sister--and the one who takes care of everyone else in her family. But after her sisters marry and move away, her little homestead becomes bleak and lonely, especially during the long winter months. In a moment of weakness, Bailey agrees to a wild plan concocted by her neighbor, Gage Coulter.Gage is an honest man, but he didn't make his fortune by being weak. He won't break the law, but he'll push as hard as he can within it. Five thousand acres of excellent grazing land is lost to him because Bailey's homestead is located right across the entrance to a canyon full of lush grass. Gage has to regain access to this land--and he's got to go through Bailey to do it. So he makes a proposal...Can these two independent, life-toughened homesteaders finally loosen up enough to earn each other's respect--and maybe find love in the process? I liked this whole series and was so hoping this one didn't disappoint.  Good news. I loved it.  Bailey was one tough cookie but then she had to be.  Life and her father had not been kind to her.  Of course, I had read about her in the other 2 books about her sisters.  But in this one, we got to see more of what made her tick.  Both Bailey and Gage were interesting people.  They had some similarities but also just enough differences to make it interesting.  Fire & Ice was a good description of the two of them, making the title perfect for this story. When they weren't battling each other, there was plenty of other trouble to be dealt with.  There was some twists and turns that kept the story going in a way that I just seemed to fly through the story. It kept me interested.  After awhile, Bailey began to see that under Gage's hard ways was a good man.  She wasn't a woman who trusted easily especially men, any man.  Baley's Pa was one mean, manipulating man, who really didn't value anyone but his dead son, Jimmy.  Everything and everyone was supposed to bow to honor him and leave a heritage all about Jimmy.  One thing that I found difficult to swallow was Gage, when it came to being a gutless wonder when it came to his mom. I t added to the story but made me want to smack him in the head.  Its okay, it does get dealt with at the end, but not before Bailey suffers more; something she really didn't need.  Insults are insults even when they are wrapped up in so called kindness. Faith in God also played a part in this story but without being heavy handed about it.I received a free copy of this novel from Bethany House Publishers as part of their book review program, and I am under no obligation to write a positive review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J62O2R80P745/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012H0ZTJW#wasThisHelpful","R3J62O2R80P745","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this story; it was pretty good. Both Shane and Annabelle were such great people, you just wanted to have them have a HEA. Of course there are plenty of misunderstandings guaranteed to hear things up. Some of the writing is humorous of course. Like when Annabelle referred to her relationship with growing plants..she had the ""black thumb of death.""I loved the fact that Annabelle wasn't going to settle for less than the best when it came to relationships. She's already been through the gauntlet of never being enough others, either not wanting her or trying to change who she is. She wants a man who will adore her; adore her like Khatar does. The romance part of the story was good. It was rocky at times which made it interesting. Half the time they get along really good and then Shane opens his mouth and puts his foot in it.One other thing I liked was, when a problem came up Annabelle dealt with what she could and the rest was in her words, ""Problems for another day.""It was fun to watch goodhearted Shane who had his agenda of what he needed to get done. His agenda meets Fool's Gold and he gets sucked in to what they need and finds out in the long run-he likes it.The animals at the ranch are so part of this story that I would even call them good secondary characters. Khatar (the horse) was one of those interesting characters. And the pony, Reno? That whole adventure made me smile, since Shane hated ponies. We also got to get a closer look at Priscilla the elephant and what she needs. Shane's mom was something else and she was unique to say the least.

"I really liked this story.  It was intense, emotional, with lots of action.  Oh, and plenty of dysfunction in Cooper's family.  Also with quite a few of them in law enforcement in one form or another.  The brothers definitely knew the meaning of havng each others back and lived it.  Jessa was smart and tough and didn't back down from much.  She might not have been quite so smart when it came to the adopting of her son but she loved him fiercely.  This story had PLENTY of twists and turns and red herrings.Yes, there was also a developing romance in the midst of Jessa and Cooper doing everything they can do to protect Liam.  There was also a few secondary stories adding to the tension.On a side note- I'm not sure the author was aware of how much she used the word, ""huffed"" in the story.  It was a little distracting after a while.  Maybe that's just me, maybe it didn't bother other readers.There is also an excerpt from another book included. ""Way of the Shadows"" by Cynthia Eden.

"-Louise Stark left her small Texas home town during high school and vowed never to look back. Unfortunately, she has no choice when she is called in to settle the estate of a great aunt she hardly knew. With her best friend Siena Remington in tow, she reluctantly takes a trip across the country and back into her past—planning to return to her fast-paced Manhattan life as quickly as possible.Brady Williams leads a life filled with adventure, danger, and fame as the star bronco rider in a traveling rodeo. Proud of his reputation as the sexiest bad boy in Texas, he knows he can have any woman he wants. So why can’t he get his mind off straight-laced Louise, the girl he shared his first kiss with back in elementary school? And, more importantly, how can he convince her to stay in Jefferson long enough to give him a chance?Louise and Brady are about to find out that no amount of distance can stand in the way of two hearts that fit perfectly together.I found this to be a light, enjoyable story.  Louise wasn't very eager to return to her hometown; it just reminds her of a lot of painful things.  Brady is part of that pain but she's also torn because she's still attracted to him.  She wants to freeze him out, forget about him, basically ""not go there"".  Too bad Brady has a whole different idea about that.  She's the one he's always cared about, and she got away without him getting a second chance to make things better.Siena is a really good friend, who really is looking out Louise.  She sees potential in Brody and also she can see how much the two them mean to each other.  There just has to be a future for them doesn't there?It would have been nice to go a bit deeper with the story but its a novella so there just wasn't time.

"Two murders have rocked the city of Houston. Are they the work of a serial killer, or is a copycat trying to get away with murder?That is the question facing Special Agent Bethany Sanchez, who is eager for her new assignment in violent crimes but anxious about meeting her new partner. Special Agent Thatcher Graves once arrested her brother, and he has a reputation for being a maverick. Plus, their investigative styles couldn’t be more opposite: he operates on instinct, while she goes by the book.  When hot leads soon fizzle out, their differences threaten to leave them deadlocked. But an attempt on their lives turns up the heat and brings them closer together, and a third victim might yield the clue that will help them zero in on a killer. This could be the case of their careers . . . if they can survive long enough to solve it.Thatcher had an interesting way of pointing out that it was hard to get a handle on his new partner.  ""Getting her to loosen up was like shooting blanks at a moving target.""  That one made me smile.  The two main characters really did have different styles, and it made for some interesting situations and conversations.  I did enjoy that.The tension of trying to find the murder is well done but I just wanted to smack Bethany in the head a few times.  Why?  Is it really her brother that is sending her threatening texts, could it be connected to her case?  Yes, this had been his pattern with her before, so she never bothered to check.  She felt she would deal with this personal matter later.  Not very professional but also a bit understandable I guess.  She's a very private person and keeps her FBI life and her personal family business separate.  Still, those texts made me hear warning bells.  This story had a lot of action, tensions and plenty of twists and turns.  Bethany's dysfunctional family was also an important part of the story.  Bethany loved her family but she loved God more; so that put her on the outs with her family.  Because she had to do the right things and that didn't include enabling her brother in his evil ways, but standing up for what was right and truth.I have read a different book by this author.  I really liked it so when the opportunity to read this one came up, I grabbed it.  While I liked this one, its not my favorite of those I have read so far.  I'm still interested in reading more by this author though.I liked how her Acknowledgements  page said a lot about the quality of realism to the story.

"This book had a slow start; most of that time was spent developing the background story of both Emma, and Malcolm . Also it was a time where Emma was trying save both Malcolm and his brother's life. Cailean was also severely injured in a fight at the brothel. They are hidden away there as they are attempting to heal. That alone is quite the unusual part of the story. I wasn't expecting that, but it definitely added to the story. Bess, one of the prostitutes, has set her eye on Malcolm. She's been with him before and is certain he's hers for the taking, because who could resist her? The top woman of the house. Malcolm isn't interested in being in her clutches. So of course, you can see where the trouble is going to get worse can't you?Malcolm has seen a few others in love, so to his way of thinking it must exist. It's just that he's never experienced it and thinks he probably never will. No woman has ever captured his heart, he's been with many women and then left them without a backwards glance. After each encounter though, he felt more empty and defeated. He longed to love and be loved, he just didn't even seem to realize how much he wanted to feel what other men did.Emma had skills as a healer, which normally she tries to keep hidden from strangers. Her friend and mentor Clementine had suffered for it. She did pass on her skills with herbs and medicines to Emma though. Emma lived in fear of someone thinking her skills made her a witch.I liked the accurate observations that Malcolm had about Emma. That she didn't let blindness overcome her, had compassion for strangers, and had courage dealing with bullies. He admired that about her and so did I. He also found her to be a challenge because he had always relied on his good looks and charming expressions when it came to women. It didn't work with her, she couldn't see any of that. Besides that, she listened and she ""saw"" things deeper with her ears that others often missed.Of course this isn't just about the attraction between Emma and Malcolm. People died, powerful people died the night of that fight and they are coming back for revenge and no one is safe from their plans. That part of the story starts to heat up and was interesting as well.I received a free copy of this book through Goodreads-  First-Reads program in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW15KCNLOF5HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455519529#wasThisHelpful","RW15KCNLOF5HD","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hawaiian born Karma Aneko, high-end divorce attorney, is pulled from the ocean just before drowning. Officer Joe Porter is on his third transfer since an undercover drug bust nearly killed him. A hero even when off-duty, Joe fishes the woman from the angry waves, knowing he’s caught trouble as soon as she spews salt water all over him. She never planned on being so close to the sea again, but Joe challenges her to take another look at her tormented childhood from within the safe circle of his arms. She is strong enough to accept his past while seeing the man he’s become. Their undeniable attraction overcomes logic, daring them to believe in love at first touch.Karma was a unique character, raised by (really being neglected by) kooky parents, she was alone most of her life.  Except for Paolo, who she loved fiercely and lost to the sea that she HAD loved.  After that she rejected everything of her heritage, goddess worship, and trusting anyone enough to let herself love again.  She even rejected parts of her name and called herself K.I liked how fierce she was at times, especially how Joe & K. first met.  She had a super-professional appearance and attitude but no matter how hard she tried to hide it she did care about people.  Joe, was the perfect balance to K., he had strengths that helped her. Therapy had helped him a lot because like he said, he used to have a bad attitude, a hot temper and fast fists, most of it a carryover from the undercover work.I liked the part of the story about K's client, the reason she was even there.  It added to the story.  As did the enemies looking for Joe, from his past uncover bust that went bad.I would say that I liked this story with some reservation.  Mainly, I'm not a fan of stories with other god's and goddesses in them.  On the plus side, it was done tastefully, didn't go into it too deeply and was a necessary part of the story.I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZU6IOF5MRCT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYBGPHA#wasThisHelpful","RZU6IOF5MRCT5","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-Brook Eden has never known where she truly belongs. When her friend Justin uncovers the fact that she is possibly a missing heiress from Yorkshire, Brook leaves the sun of the Mediterranean to travel to the moors of the North Sea to the estate of her supposed family.The mystery of her mother's death haunts her, and though her father is quick to accept her, the rest of the family and the servants of Whitby Park are not. Only when Brook's life is threatened do they draw close--but will their loyalty come too late to save Brook from the same threat that led to tragedy for her other?  As heir to a dukedom, Justin is no stranger to balancing responsibilities. When the matters of his estate force him far from Brook, the distance between them reveals that their friendship has grown into something much more. But how can their very different loyalties and responsibilities ever come together?And then for a second time, the heiress of Whitby Park is stolen away because of the very rare treasure in her possession--and those who can save her still aren't sure who to trust.Yes, there are plenty of people with various motives.  The servants at Whitby Park are slow to trust Brook.  And at least at first they don't make her transition easy.  Of course, there had been so many other, false, pretenders who claimed to be the long lost daughter and heiress.  Brook's father, and their developing relationship was enjoyable to walk through.  The long standing friendship between Brook and Justin was so sweet and enjoyable to witness. Brook was so vibrant, charming and impulsive.  Justin is more the cautious, steadying influence.  Even though he is the one who taught her some of the things that English society would frown on.  Like riding astride, driving a car, shooting a pistol to name a few things.  Of course things begin to change when Justin realizes he is crazy in love with her.  He is agonizing with the thought that she still thinks of him as a brother.  Could it ever be more than just that?  It looks like it might if they ever get through all the misunderstandings and are just honest with each other.  Messing things up even more are the mysteries; some long-standing and some more recent.  Answers are coming but you will have to stay the course until the end to find out what they are.By the way, this is a clean romance.I received a copy of this book via Bethany House in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZEY92CPUFDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012H0ZS70#wasThisHelpful","R2KZEY92CPUFDE","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Different.  That's the first words I would use to describe this story.And Randi?  I loved her. Anyone who has read any other of my book reviews would understand why.  She's smart and smart mouth, quirky, funny, loyal and also multi-talented.  Oh and she's totally focused; the only reason she's on this circus ride is to find her Dad.  She gave up so much to do this, including a husband who just didn't get it.  That wasn't the only reason for the divorce but it definitely was a major factor.  She's also so smart that she figures out quite a few things about Mitch fairly early on.  She ends up giving him headaches, often.  It was mentioned in the book that she often felt there were 2 people in her head.  One of them was a thrill seeker.  That is part of the explanation of all of the Extreme Sports she does.  In the story it also turns out that many of those qualities she also gets from her Grandmother, on her father's side.Mitch it turns out is also able to drive Randi crazy, he isn't afraid to toe to toe with her.Oh, Randi's Journal causes problem after problem but it also plays a part at the end of the story, where there is a twist coming.  One of the funniest things is when Randi asks if maybe she should print her private journal  since almost everyone has grabbed it without her persmission and read it.There is plenty of action in this story as the adventure continues.  But you will have to read it to find out what happens:Does Randi really travel back in time?  Does she go alone or does Mitch go with her?  Does she find her dad and find out what happened to him?  What kind of trouble does Randi get into ?  (because yes because she is a Trouble Magnet and she likes it that way)  What happens between Randi and Mitchell?I was given a free copy of this book, in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZS2H0WK545U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014C7AQBO#wasThisHelpful","R3DZS2H0WK545U","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After Meri Darrow is suddenly fired from her dream job and leveled by a mystery illness, she retreats to her family's beach cottage. Neighbor Rob McLain knows brilliant but nave Meri is up against powerful biotech interests that could crush them both. But that's not why this intense attraction scares the hell out of him.  Meri has Rob pegged as an ambitious charmer. He's more interested in profit than innovation, more about appearance than substance. Rob wants the privileged life she rejected long ago, right down to the showy villa above Laguna Beach. Though tempting, he's overbearing and definitely not her type.  Rob is determined to watch over Meri, even risking his career. Now she realizes her attempts to do the right thing have only brought fear and death, putting Rob and his little boy in danger. The best thing she can do for them is walk away.This story was slow starting and I often found that it seemed to keep that slower pace through out. I kept waiting for more to happen. There was a friendship building between Rob, Meri and Luke during that time. I have to admit that for the most part I liked Rob but there were quite a few times that I didn't . Those were probably the times he acted selfishly, like a steam roller Both of the Main Characters are interesting, as well as interesting in the challenges that they face. Rob's son Luke of course is charming and mischievous. He also really runs Rob through the gauntlet when it comes to getting into trouble. Like people said, Luke is faster than greased lightning; he's a toddler so of course that's to be expected. Rob's mother Betty Jo, was a nice addition.It seemed that the action started picking up at around the 80% part of the book. Some of the mysteries start to be exposed and the villains a little bit more in the open.

"For thirty-five girls, the Selection is the chance of a lifetime. The opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. To be swept up in a world of glittering gowns and priceless jewels. To live in a palace and compete for the heart of gorgeous Prince Maxon.But for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare. It means turning her back on her secret love with Aspen, who is a caste below her. Leaving her home to enter a fierce competition for a crown she doesn't want. Living in a palace that is constantly threatened by violent rebel attacks.Then America meets Prince Maxon. Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she's made for herself—and realizes that the life she's always dreamed of may not compare to a future she never imagined.This is the first book in a Series, something that I forgot when I started reading this book. So, of course I was somewhat dismayed when it didn't finish in this story.The author did a really good job of painting the picture of the people of this culture. A very clear line between the ""have's"" and ""have not's"". America's caste is somewhat near the middle, although she has had her share of hunger, lack and worry. Her boyfriend, Aspen has it so much harder and almost works himself to death helping his family. And he often goes hungry so that his family can eat. America smuggles left over food to him when she can. That's bad enough, but there are other caste of people who have it even worse than Aspen. Then, there is the Prince. Maxon really has no idea of how people suffer in his family's kingdom, he's been so protected. That's not something that is that hard to believe.  As the story unfolds you find out that Maxon has so much more to offer than the stiff formal person he appears to be. . America had a kind of culture shock when she went from the plainess of her families life to the richness of the palace. One of her main goals though was to still remain herself. Now, that's something that she really does do pretty well. And along the way, she makes friends because of it. And yes of course, enemies too, because this is a competition where winner takes all.On the downside is that the story is slow moving at times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GXLTPA522TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006564VQC#wasThisHelpful","R16GXLTPA522TV","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the local preacher, Gideon Fraser often talks about the many virtues of a good marriage, but that doesn't mean he has the slightest inclination of claiming a bride of his own. No, he's been burned before, by greedy women who only want the prestige and money the Fraser family name can provide. When his mother's devious matchmaking results in his unexpected wedding, Gideon looks at the beautiful face of the woman who has sworn to be his and wants nothing to do with her. But Gideon is in danger of losing his heart until he discovers the truth. His new wife lied to him...about everything.Ruby Haller needed a husband and fast. A treacherous man promised her the world, took her virginity, and left her without a father for her unborn child. When her father, the town minister, found out she was expecting a child, he offered her hand in marriage to the meanest man in town. Becoming a mail-order-bride appeared to be a safer choice. But instead of a rancher, she ends up the wife of a stubborn, bull-headed preacher and he's none too pleased when he discovers her duplicity. Worse? The local town beauty, who had been courting him for years, is determined to make her life a living hell.But Angel Springs, Colorado is a small town that can inspire big dreams. It's nearly Christmas, and as these two hearts heal, a holiday miracle just might be within reach.This is a sweet, homey, story.  Gideon's mother, although loving came up with that such a manipulative plan to marry off her sons to women that they don't know.  Yes, there has been communication but not between the sons and their prospective brides.  What a set up for failure.  Well, if even not failure but troubles for sure.  One point in his favor is how loving his family is.  But they are strangers, trying to build a marriage; one that quickly develops trust issues.  Its a clean story, with tensions from other people that quick brings more trouble between them.  Ruby hasn't been shown very much love in her love, at least not the healthy kind.  She doesn't share at first that her father is a preacher and one of the worst kind.  So, when Ruby sees Gideon in action she isn't sure that his kindness is real.  And even as she begins to trust it a little, she still isn't sure that she won't get tossed aside.  I enjoyed the fact that Gideon's mother was so quick to step into the gap and become Mama to Ruby, as well as all of her new ""daughters"".  She had a warmth and caring that Ruby so desperately needed.The woman who has been chasing after Gideon, married or not, was just the perfect Villainess of selfishness and nastiness.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQRJX4C54SBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JLMQBU#wasThisHelpful","R3NQRJX4C54SBY","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This story was okay, couldn't help liking Adaryn who was like a spunky wild child.  Not something that generally would be a good thing in her new life as a slave.  While her captor, Aaric is more like the absent minded professor.  He's often clueless when it comes to handling Adaryn.  He knows he should be a lot tougher with her but kindness is so much a part of his nature.I also agree with another reviewer that there isn't much on the romance angle.

"Firefighter Cole Taylor is the man everyone looks up to at Firehouse 9 in downtown Spokane. He's been at the department for ten years and has no fear when it comes to dangerous situations.Megan Taylor, Cole's wife, is a stay-at-home mother of their two boys. She was everything Cole ever wanted in a woman and the perfect wife any man could ask for until one day when she decides to leave Cole.  Cole has fought hundreds of fires in his lifetime, but he had never tasted fear until he came to fighting a fire in his own home.A Story of Hope.  I liked the fact that the author wrote this in such a way that you could really see the trial that they went through as a husband and wife.  He was honest in the fact, that while we are Christians, we don't come out of the womb knowing how to walk it.  Other people might expect it, but God doesn't.  That's why he brings it to our attention and through other people, as was mentioned in this book.  Reading the Bible and praying.  His friend, Micah was such an inspiration,  not claiming perfection or being abusive with his faith.  He was a great friend and  mentor to Cole.  Someone that we could all use in our life; he just kept encouraging and pointing back to Jesus.One of my favorite things spoken in the book was relating marriage being similar to fire.  ""That each one is different and when you're up there amongst the flames and things are heating up, you'd better have faith in God if you hope to keep the fire under control.""The struggle between Cole and his wife Megan, was reflected pretty well I thought.  Also how it affected their young sons, was shown too.  Cole and Megan were both lost in their own ways, they just didn't know how bad it was until things began to hit the fan in their lives.Heck, Cole didn't even realize there was a problem until Megan left. This is something that in real life I have heard more than once. That the man thought everything was fine. I guess that also says something about us as women too.  We stuff a lot of things, instead of trying to work it out.  I'm not saying that's always true, but often enough.  Some of that comes from the culture that we grew up in, both men and women.  I liked God's approach better.There is a Sneak Peek at the book,""The Perfect Cast"" at the end of this book.There is a really sweet dedication in this book.

"Bighearted and easygoing, Luc Jennings is falling behind in a family of serious overachievers. While he may be decent enough at snowboarding to turn pro and rack up some sponsors, he's never topped any podiums--unlike his friends Z, Ash, and Cam. Luc's always been head over heels for Cam Bradley, but she's never seen him as anything more than a friend. Now, after years of coming in second, Luc can't take it anymore--especially if it means watching Cam chase another guy.Cam hangs out almost exclusively with dudes, and that's fine by her. She'd much rather be shredding at the Olympics than primping in the mirror. Cam's wildest dreams have a way of coming true--except when it comes to getting her longtime crush and best friend, Z Michaels, to notice her. Then her mother suddenly shows up after being gone for, like, ever, and Cam's whole world comes crashing down. Desperate for a place to lay low, she turns to the one person who's always had her back.Try as he might to move on, Luc could never leave Cam hanging. He lets her crash at his place--and it isn't long before she winds up in his bed. With Cam running scared and her icy facade starting to melt at last, Luc's determined to finally win the only prize that matters.Okay, here's the deal.  I think this story is for a younger audience, YA maybe.  EXCEPT, oh my gosh there's the language and all the sex.  There sure is an awful lot of the F*** word.  Not sure this is something that I would want one of my YA chldren (?) reading.  Although its probably something they would read.On the plus side, if you are a sports fan, escpecially snowboarding you probably will enjoy that part of the story.  Also the friendship between the two MC's was good.  Luc was so crazy in love with Cam.  And Cam was so totally clueless about it.  Talk about two people who care so deeply about each other and are both so petrified about being rejected by the other.  This is such new territory for the both of them.I also had a really hard time with the idea that Cam's mom shows up YEARS after she just walked out on them and her father and 6 brothers just expect Cam to offer open arms to her?  They can't understand why she's refusing to welcome any contact?  Really, are people that dumb?  Yes, I guess they can be and in this story I guess they were.  I just didn't get that part.  No mention of why they all were so easy to forgive the mother either.  I didn't get that part.By the way, good title.

"Skye Titan's wealthy father thinks he can still dictate his daughter's choice in men. Now widowed and a single mother, Skye isn't the yes-girl she once was. Especially since the love of her life is back in Texas after eight long years. He won't like the answers to the questions he's asking. About why she left him at the altar. And about her eight-year-old daughter.  Former Navy SEAL Mitch Cassidy comes home to find nearly everything different. His wounds from battle have changed the way people treat him. His cattle ranch is suddenly organic. But time hasn't touched his desire for Skye--or the sting of her betrayal. Forget lip service. He's asking that luscious mouth of hers to reveal the truth. But will Mitch be able to put the past aside to help Skye get out from under her father's thumb...and help himself recover from a broken heart?This story I found was okay, there was a lot of angst, feelings of betrayal and lost time.  An emotional ride.  It was good to hear their story after having read some in the other books.  Is it my favorite of the series?  No, I don't think so, but it was pretty good.  Why do I say that?  It was pretty good when the author showed the ""rage"" that Mitch was going through.  Rage at Skye for having no backbone, for dumping him to do her father's bidding, for being with another man instead of him.  Rage at the loss of his mobility, adjusting to a new way of walking.  Rage at how his ranch had changed almost beyond his recognition while he was gone. Yep, a whole lot of rage.  And Skye I kept waiting for her to grow her backbone too.  And it does happen, you have to read the book to see the how and why of it.  Skye's daughter was a nice addition to the story too.

"Dana Birch vowed never to put herself at the mercy of a powerful man. She became a deputy so that she could take care of herself and protect those she loves. Especially her best friends, the Titan sisters.Twenty years ago, Garth Duncan swore revenge on Jed Titan for abandoning Garth and his mother. Now he's back to fulfill that promise, even if Jed's daughters get caught in the crosshairs. All that stands between him and his goal is Dana, her gun and a growing passion that can't be denied...I really liked this book.  Having read the previous ones (about Skye, Lexi and Izzy)  I really wanted to get to this one.  I was hoping that evil, Jed Titan would finally get his.  I was also wondering if Garth was really going to destroy his half-sisters or if they were going to be able to stop him.  They were just meant to be collateral damage but still there were painful attacks against them.  He wasn't trying to kill them, he just wanted to wipe out everything that the Titans had. At the end of the last book with Izzy, she had come up with an unusual way to win against Garth, when it came to his attacking them.  I wanted to know how they plan to make it work, and if it does.  And will it be completed in this book?  Plenty of twists and turns in this battle and it keeps you wondering if Jed was really going down this time.The sisters were each so different, but also so funny and smart.  Dana is one of them; not by birth but by heart.I found it to be a totally satisfying read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AUHYH1JGBO86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00850B73G#wasThisHelpful","R1AUHYH1JGBO86","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Reckless Love of God, pastor and church planter Alex Early pulls you in close to ask if you've ever really considered what it means to say ""Jesus loves me."" God's love for us is real--he feels, knows, and even suffers on our behalf. Nothing will change your life, your goals, and your relationships faster than being captivated by this reality.Whether you grew up as a Christian and have forgotten this essential truth, or if you're hearing it for the first time, you need to be reminded--and assured--of the simple, amazing, mind-blowing fact that God loves us.The author does bring up the main question that Christians bring up in their thoughts from time to time.  Its something that they often struggle with at some time or other.  It all boils down to the fact that we often need the reassurance that God loves us. But a really  great example of how we often interact with God is given in the Introduction.  Here it is (in part) : ""We are content to stand across the room, trying desperately not to make eye contact with the God who ""wants to dance"".We don't want to be vulnerable and open but we still long for Him.Also mentioned by the author is that this is a book for those who have been crushed by legalism.  He mentions others that will be impacted by this book (Everyone)  but that one really stood out.A really great question was asked.  "" Does God Actually Feel Things?""  Now, I already had my thoughts on this.  And this is what that thought is:  that scripture says often that he does.  Several scriptures are used in the book to answer that question as well.  Another point is that Jesus is not just a prophet who leads people to God but that he also shows the exact nature of God.  I'm just going to point out a few other things mentioned in the book without hopefully giving too much away.  I don't want to give so much of the book away that it makes it feel like its not necessary to actually read the book.  I liked how it was explained how sometimes people will get in our personal space making us uncomfortable.  He called them ""Close Talkers"".  He feels that God is one of those close talkers, lovingly invading our space, so we can  be hearing and feeling his presence.  I agree and like the term he used.Okay, my last example:  Jesus is not in love  with some future version of you or what you used to be. He loves you right where you are.  Now, that ought to settle a lot of issues right there (if we will just believe it)I've been a Christian for awhile and a title I would give this review would be ""Nuggets and Things to Remember"".I was given a copy of this book via Bethany House in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IKDYRWOI13PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764213571#wasThisHelpful","R3IKDYRWOI13PO","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good emotional read.  Okay I am now officially hooked by another Series by Susan Mallery. I read Book #3 first. That one was about Izzy and Nick, called ""Straight from the Hip"". So since I liked that one so much, I read the info on this book and decided to give this book a try. It was so good with the continuing drama of the Titan family and the ""business plan"" between Cruz and Lexi. Love them and leave them Cruz. No, wait a minute that isn't quite right. Cruz is the ""have sex with them and leave them guy"".OK, that's not something new, I've read some books with that similar kind of guy. Cruz was just a bit deeper than some of them. And Lexi? She's never been enough for anyone. No matter how hard she tries, she just can't seem to get her father, Jed's attention, let alone his love. He's cruel, and manipulative and any love he has is for his Titan empire. Her sisters show up in this story but now I want to read abut the sister I missed, Skye. And their friend, Dana and also their half brother Garth.Time for me to read on and catch up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U5KTNPUHG97U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084ZZOAE#wasThisHelpful","R1U5KTNPUHG97U","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first non-Fool's Gold story by Susan Mallery that I have read.  Loved it!  Loved Izzy even when she's wrong, she's got 'tude plus.  She was going to need it.Some of the other people in the story were enjoyable too.  The one that I got to see the most was Nick's assistant Aaron.  The flashy, goodhearted but also at times  tough gay man of the story.  He helped hold things together at the Ranch.  Garth the half brother had quite the game of vengeance going.  And Jed, the father?  The more you read about him, the easier it is to hate him.  He'd sell anyone down the river, just to safeguard his fortune.  Daughters included.  Speaking of daughters, Izzy's sister's have their own story I'm sure but they have more of supporting role in this book.  I didn't really feel like I got to know them all that well.  Their own stories are in other books I'm guessing.The clashes between Izzy and Nick  were interesting and at times verbally over the top.  Izzy had some good comebacks when it came to verbal fencing, with Nick and whoever else got into her area.  The story had some twists and turns and betrayals.  Oh, and romance and some sex too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15AFHB9MFYUYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373773838#wasThisHelpful","R15AFHB9MFYUYF","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Grace Beiler was only a girl, she was married off to an older Amish man in order to save her family's farm. Years later, she finds herself newly widowed and a mother to a young son. She has finally fled her sad past and plans to settle into a quiet life in Pennsylvania.  As soon as she arrives, she captures the attention of Seth Wyse, the most eligible bachelor in Pine Creek. Seth is candid about his feelings for her, and for her son Abel, but Grace is determined to protect her heart. Her determination falters when her brother-in-law reveals the troubling contents of her late husband's will.  Seth offers Grace his hand in marriage, and thus a means of escape. But despite his having saved her from another loveless marriage, Grace is slow to trust her new husband. And as the months wear on, Seth wonders if he has made a mistake. But God is quietly at work in their hearts, and Seth and Grace soon discover that threads of grace bind them together in a tapestry rich in hope and love.This is a book that I was drawn to and wanted to read for awhile.  That made me nervous.  Why?  Because I didn't want to be disappointed.  I'm glad to say that I wasn't.  What a great story.  I also have to mention though, that I might need to take a small break from reading different Amish stories.  I've read several over the last week and although I really liked this one, there were times it was a little hard to read of some of the cruelty that Grace endured.  All under the umbrella of the duty of teaching godliness to someone.  Nope, it was flat out evil from a brutal husband  The author did a really good job in the beginning chapter.  She showed a young, beautiful, hopeful 18 year old girl being forced into  marriage with a scummy old guy to save her family.  He then proceeded to crush any life or enjoyment out of her from that point on.  Oh, you don't read about that in the next chapter because then you go into the story 9 years later.  But the drama of what her life had been is released over time, which I thought was well done.  The information wasn't excessive but enough to really help you get the picture pretty clearly.Seth was a breath of fresh air in this story, incredibly patient with both Grace and Abel.  He wasn't perfect, but he loved her from the start even before their marriage he couldn't keep his mind off of her.  She just never gave him the time of day.  Of course she did the same with any other man, but he just wanted a chance with her.  The opportunity came as the book blurb says, but its not easy in any way as they start off together.  Grace is afraid to trust and even wonders if his kindness is real or some kind of a ploy.Her son Abel was well drawn as well likable even showing his challenges and gifts in the world.The addition of Seth's loving family was good too, they were so supportive.Bishop Loftus was a relief.  A more godly, kind example of a bishop of the faith than those I read about in previous stories.  Yes, there were rules but there was also grace and mercy shown too.There is a HEA but everyone worked for it.On a final note, I really enjoyed the various, examples of grace that were mentioned and illustrated in so many different ways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KROKUYP6VIBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2AG4EO#wasThisHelpful","R3KROKUYP6VIBE","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've also wondered about Jo (the woman who owns her own bar in town) and when I would be reading more about her story.  Its in this book as well.  These people were mainly dealing with things about their past, kind of interesting that it was a main theme with them.In the past Tucker was burnt by a love for a woman who wasn't Nevada.  Only time showed him that it was more obsession on his part.  Still, it made it clear to Tucker that love was destructive and for chumps.  Now, he wanted no part of it.

And when she visited Fool's Gold?  All I can say is that I liked some parts of the story better than others.

"As the oldest daughter in an Amish family, Sadie's life was mapped out since the day she was born. But when her parents unexpectedly die in a buggy accident, her life goes into a tailspin. Determined to keep her parents' legacy alive, Sadie works harder than ever to provide for herself and her younger sisters.However, the bishop is unwilling to let a young woman manage the property and business all on her own. He gives Sadie two choices: marry his son, Aden, or relinquish the business and land to the community. Not willing to give up on her dream, she weds Aden, resigning herself to a loveless marriage.But while working with Aden at the store, Sadie realizes he isn't the same boy who had betrayed her in the past. In fact, she begins to look forward to the time they spend together, getting to know the man with a kind heart and gentle smile. Just when Sadie starts to let her guard down and perhaps develop feelings for her new husband, several dangerous secrets are revealed. Now everything Sadie has worked so hard to protect is threatened, and she must find a way to save her family--and herself.What an emotional story. The tensions were well done.  Aden's father was in a position of power and authority; a position that he ruthlessly abused.  Just as he abused his son's over the years.  He used religion as a weapon and there didn't seem to be anyone who could stop him.  Part of that is because all of the secrets of their family life was hidden and anyone on the outside thought he was a man to be admired, respected.  But like in most cases that I've seen, so many secrets just hide evil and allow it to grow.  The Bishop was a hoarder and greedy too.  Alongside of cruelty; never a good mix.This was really a different kind of Amish story  but I really liked it.  It was well written and just drew me in.  And because I could see things through Aden's eyes in the story, as his input was shared, I was so hoping for a HEA for him.  Also for Sadie because she had so much responsibility on her shoulders, she was also grieving AND also had so much resentment towards Aden and his brother Sol.  Some pretty major things to work through.  I liked some of the secondary people as well. including Sadie's sisters.  They all added to the story.I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250NSXCRUXXLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWOH4EY#wasThisHelpful","R250NSXCRUXXLF","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lady Miranda Hawthorne acts every inch the lady, but inside she longs to be bold and carefree. Approaching spinsterhood in the eyes of society, she pours her innermost feelings out not in a diary but in letters to her brother's old school friend, the Duke of Marshington. Since she's never actually met the man she has no intention of ever sending the letters and is mortified when her brother's mysterious new valet, Marlow, mistakenly mails one of the letters to the unsuspecting duke.Shockingly, this breach of etiquette results in a reply from the duke that soon leads to a lively correspondence. Insecurity about her previous lack of suitors soon becomes confusion as Miranda finds herself equally intrigued by Marlow, a man she has come to depend upon but whose behavior grows more suspicious by the day. As the secret goings-on at her family's estate come to light, one thing is certain: Miranda's heart is far from all that's at risk for the Hawthornes and those they love.What a great story.  Adventure mystery, humor and romance.  Spies, twist and turns and a beautiful but bratty sister (Miranda's).  I totally fell in love with both of the main characters.  They sent sparks off of each other and truly valued who each other was; as they got to know each other.  Miranda's brothers Griffith and Trent were interesting people too and added some smiles to the story.  Especially Trent when he was whooping with laughter at some of the situations that Miranda found herself in.  In fact, not only the brothers caused me to smile. There were plenty of other times where that happened too.  There were plenty of other interesting people that surrounded Marlow.Those letters that Miranda wrote on the (in)famous blue paper were a nice touch.  She poured out her heart on them, never intending anyone to every see them.  Often writing to her secret friend Marsh, especially after her mother scolded her once again for her unladylike behavior.  I remember reading that her first sit down scold started at 5 years old.  Poor kid.  Her mother pretty much suffocated her natural exhuberance with her sermons of, ""A Lady never does this.."".  But the real Miranda was still there, just contained.  A Lady never shows her anger...wel Marlow pretty much lit the fuse to her anger and the real Miranda started surfacing.  It sounds like her ""angelic? sister could have used a few lessons like these.In the end all the villians are rounded up; the ones that had been striking from their different positions.All in all, what a great romp.I received a ARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IKG70K0O2196/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LYXSRA#wasThisHelpful","R2IKG70K0O2196","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought that this was an okay story.  I really didn't enjoy it quite as much as I thought I would.  Although I liked both of the main characters, it got to feeling a bit vanilla when it came to their story.  Really can't put my finger on it exactly. I guess I agree with another reviewer that it just seemed to be somehat flat  between Charity and Josh.  The town was good and all but the story just didn't pull me in like I expected.

"I got to re-visit one of my favorite fictional towns- Fool's Gold!  And for a story I really wanted to hear.  And it sure didn't disappoint!!""Paper"" Jack, the one who wrote checks but didn't want to get personally involved.  That's why I'm calling him Paper Jack.  On paper, he looked good but he really wasn't there for the long haul.  Larissa was the exact opposite, she always lead with her heart.  And she knew Jack her friend.  She knew that he wanted the the most beautiful woman in the room..for fifteen minutes (of sex/relationship) and then he was done.  She ought to know, she had to help select enough exit gifts for those women.  I liked the banter between Jack and Larissa, they made me smile.  For example Larissa wanted to talk to Percy about protected sex and he finally said he would -right after he finished banging his head on the wall.  She said he always said that but she'd never seen him do it.His response?  Some things are done better in private.See what I mean?  There is even more, good ones.  Not an overload but I enjoyed them.  For a guy who didn't want to be there for anyone, he put it best in his own words -that  he was a sucker for Larissa.  She needed help?  He was there to help with her ""rescues""or to rescue her.Larissa's mom, sure opened up a can of worms with her""oh so not innocent ""talk with Jack.  That started a run a way train in a direction once started was one that both tried to stop.

When the wagon carrying them falls under attack, each sister is picked up by a different man.Anne-Marie, the middle sister, is saved by Creed Walker, a Crow warrior. It's loathing at first sight, but with bandits on their tail and a cache of gold to hide, Creed and Anne-Marie need each other. Will they learn to put aside their differences and trust each other--and God? And can their growing faith turn their lives around?This story was okay and the main characters were interesting to say the least.  Creed was also working with a black man named Quincy, who had his own quirks.  Quincy was an honest man, who was humorously terrified of each new outlandish ""plan"" that Anne-Mare came up with.  And I guess, he had reason to be, it did add humor to the story though.  They needed her plans because they were ingenious though risky.  They always seemed to work out but sometimes there were glitches, because Anne-Marie just seemed to be a trouble magnet.  Or at least that is what Creed thinks.  Creed is also known to his blood brother, Bold Eagle, as Storm Rider and there is interaction between  them and the tribe.

"Having grown up in San Francisco, Calder Brumen is drawn to the ocean, and he's spent his life trying to capture the beauty of the Pacific on canvas. Over time, he has become obsessed with painting the image of a dark haired mermaid named Gaire, and Calder struggles to explain his devotion to these portraits to his best friend. When Calder finds sandy footprints leading to the edge of his bed, he suspects that the haunting siren is real.Pursuing the truth, Calder is dragged into a murderous, underwater plot that could destroy them all. And he must choose - is the possibility of a lifetime with Gaire worth risking death for himself and everyone he loves?Loved, loved this story. It just seemed to draw me in and I felt like I just zoomed through it. Before I knew it the story was closing. A very good closing with the possibilities of more adventures ahead. I would be interested in reading more of those adventures, especially if they continue in the quality that I experienced as I read this one.Calder was such a great main character, one that his friends thought just might be going slowly out of his mind. He had a dream woman and he painted pictures of her. They thought he was obsessed with an unreal woman and needed to search for a real one instead. The main friend is Mike, who he's been close to since childhood. Mike believed in him before anyone else ever did. Gaire is the woman of his dreams/his muse but she's so much more too. What that means begins to unfold in the story in an enjoyable way. Mystery, murder, attempted murder, love, lost history, developing gifts and evil are all rolled into this story. Oh and also Mike is being beguiled by an evil non-human woman. Nice touch. Nothing good is going to come out of that romance.Another nice touch is what Calder's name means. Both his first and last name have meaning that it turns out plays a part in this story.Nice cover too...seemed to stay true to the description of the main people in the story.

"Small business owner and metalworks artist Damon Brand finally has his future in sight when his past rattles into town in a broken down car stuffed with designer clothes and sky high heels. The last time he saw Jess, he declared his undying love. In return, she stranded him by the side of the road, taking his boots, pants and the tattered remnants of his heart.So much for the bright lights of LA. Failed actress Jessica Palmer arrives back in Cherry Lake, Montana homeless, destitute, and desperate. She's hoping her grandfather will let her have her inheritance early so she can make a fresh start--anywhere but Cherry Lake. No deal. She has to stay for six months and get a job to prove she's matured. Not easy in a town where she flamed all her bridges in order to flee a wild child reputation and her high school sweetheart.With every door that's slammed shut in her face, Jess grows more determined than ever to prove she's changed, even if it means she must turn to her first love, Damon, for a job at his gas station. Surely 10 years is enough time for him to forgive and forget?This story was an emotional one.  There were plenty of wounds to go around when it came to Jessica (Jess) and Damon.  I liked both Jess and Damon, even as different as each one was.  Jess was the flighty appearing one.  She felt deeply but also had  deep insecurities.  Damon was the intense, hardworking, responsible one.  She brought light and fun to things and Damon was so busy he almost had no time for fun.  I had to give Jess credit for grit staying in THAT town.  Yes, I know she was desperate but man there were some humiliating times for her.  She did rise to the occasion many times, often showing her own unique style.

When a twist of fate takes Julian's sight from him, Patience returns home hoping to make amends for not having faith in him. Pity is the last thing Julian wants from anyone, especially his wife, and it's his turn to question her sincerity. Now, Patience must convince her husband that she's come home for no other reason than love, even if it means arranging a highlander's seduction. Reckless Rockwoods, #3I liked this story.  Julian and  Patience fell in love deeply, quickly but without knowing each other all that long.  Julian knew what he wanted and he pursued her relentlessly until she agreed to marry him.  As you can tell from the book blurb,  they didn't exactly get a HEA right after that marriage.  Oh they did have some days of joy but tragedy swiftly struck.  Julian is caught in some lies trying to his honor about keeping a friends' secret. It is a secret that comes back to bite him, literally.  Before accidents that befell them, Patience had already gone through the stress of being introduced to her father-in-law who hated her  She wasn't a full blooded Scot and she hadn't produced an heir yet either.  He continually taunted her every chance he got.  Someone else who taunted her there was her self elected rival,  Una, a nasty piece of work who wanted everything Patience had.  She wanted Julian and she wanted to be part of the high rank that came with him..  Una was also the choice of her father-in-law, so that made it even worse.  Although I liked both of the main characters, there was a time or two when I wanted to clunk their heads together!  In love, but pure stubbornness; so afraid to let the other really know.  So afraid to get hurt again.  I do love the spunk that showed when it came to being a Rockwood.  It showed up a few different times and in one case it helped save her life.  The saying in the Rockwood family was, that a Rockwood NEVER backed down from a challenge.  Challenges were something that they thrived on.  Good thing too; there were plenty of those.An interesting introduction to ""Forever Mine"" was included at the back of this book.I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BU0RPP4JN35E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VYOZUM#wasThisHelpful","R2BU0RPP4JN35E","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jori Garrison trains dogs for Warrior Wolf Pack, which provides service animals for disabled veterans. Four years ago, she was wrongly convicted of a crime--thanks to her no-good ex- fiancé. Now she just wants to live her life in peace with her beloved dogs. No men, no complications. But it's hard to play it cool when a lethally hot male is on her tail--and the attraction is fierce, mutual, and dangerous....PRIMAL FORCELauray ""Law"" Batisse is a Military Police veteran who was wounded in Afghanistan. Haunted by the loss of his K-9 partner in combat, he's reluctant to accept a service dog named Samantha into his life. But once he meets her trainer--the gorgeous Jori Garrison--he can't fight his primal instincts. And neither can Jori. This sexy alpha male might be the only man strong enough to unleash her desires. And when unseen enemies start hunting them down, he and his new K-9 partner might be her only hope...to survive.Wow, what an intense book. Loved it.  Definitely an adult read, mainly because of sexual action and some blunt language.  The saying about ""No man is an Island"" never met Law Batisse.  Both Law and his half sister, -- had been raised in a really strange way, without much real love, compassion or kindness.  What happened after that in wartime had only made that worse.  He didn't need anyone or anything; his walls were up monumental in height.  But then he met Jori and while all the walls didn't come down, she did manage to sneak in a bit.  One thing was that she could make him laugh at the same time that he thought he never would again.  He wanted her and afterwards pushed her away, for her own sake of course.  I thought the author did a pretty good job  when it came to making the reader almost feel what Law went through with some of his challenges.  Both the PTSD, panic and his loss of leg and use of prosthesis challenges.  I liked the three different P.O.V's in the story.  You might be thinking 3?  Yes, Law, Jori and Samantha (Sam) the  Service Dog.  I really enjoyed Sam's addition to the story a lot.  I didn't count the cat because there weren't too many thoughts there.  Another thing Law told himself was that he didn't need any useless, fluffy Cheese Doodle dog.  Such an unmanly dog to be saddled with.  Something that also caught my attention was how Law was described in one instance, ""he reflected the primal instinct of a survivor"".  I talked so long about Law but I really can't leave out Jori.  What a great heroine, loving person with so much hope for her future until she was set up to take the fall.  Years got stolen from her because of it but she was pulling herself into a better life as best as she could.  Then she met Law as a service dog trainer through Warriors Wolf Pack and her life was never the same again.  I really liked Jori's part in the story as well as some of the training information that was included concerning the Service Dogs for veterans.There is an Epilogue to the story.  It was good but I was hoping for more of course but it did end well.Now, I'd really like to read more in this K-9 Rescue seriesI was given a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK7778MZGCJ8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UG65NPK#wasThisHelpful","RK7778MZGCJ8S","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Britain caught up in WWI, Jack Benningham, heir to the Earl of Stonebrooke, has declared himself a conscientious objector. Instead, he secretly works for the Crown by tracking down German spies on British soil, his wild reputation and society status serving as a foolproof cover.Blinded by patriotism and concern for her brother on the front lines, wealthy suffragette Grace Mabry will do whatever it takes to assist her country's cause. When she sneaks into a posh London masquerade ball to hand out white feathers of cowardice, she never imagines the chain of events she'll set off when she hands a feather to Jack.And neither of them could anticipate the extent of the danger and betrayal that follows them--or the faith they'll need to maintain hope.A slow developing story.  Jack wasn't exactly what/who Grace thought he was.  She had her back up though when it came to those who refused to do their part in the war effort.  She giving Jack that white feather both helped and hurt Jack but he never forgot her.  Grace matures throughout the story as she begins to learn more about what others have to go through in the real world unlike her somewhat sheltered world.  Most of that came about as she goes to work helping made sure war horses have the food supply that they need.  The women that she meets at that farm not only make a great addition to the story but also help open her eyes.  Over time she gains some real girlfriends. There were a few twists and unexpected turns in the story that were good.  I liked both the main characters, Jack and Grace.  And even Sir Marcus as a secondary character was good.  The ending satisfies.For those that want to know, yes, God is also a part of the story.  A few scriptures and forgiveness being a part of it too.  It doesn't come across as preachy though.I was given a copy of this book via Bethany House in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JXT9DEFP7F1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764211617#wasThisHelpful","R2JXT9DEFP7F1C","ACVNKHUOX3QWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACVNKHUOX3QWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is based on the German text.Max Weber's main thesis is that Protestant religious ideas (its ethic) exert a certain influence on the spirit of capitalism.This relationship can be seen in the rationalization of economic production processes and its outcome: profit.His thesis is an attack on Marx's theory that ideas or beliefs are only a superstructure of the real living conditions, namely the relationship between the owners of the means of production (capitalists) and the proletarians who are forced to sell their labor force. Weber tried by this book to prove that (religious) ideas also had some influence on human socio-economic conditions and that Marx's theory is not fully or always valid.One of the crucial paragraphs in Weber’s book is the following: ‘Nur ein Erwählter ist fähig, Gottes Ruhm durch wirklich gute Werke zu mehren. Und indem er sich dessen bewuszt ist, dasz sein Wandel auf einer in ihm lebenden Kraft zur Mehrung des Ruhmes Gottes ruht, nicht also nur gottgewollt, sondern vor allem gottgewirkt ist, erlangt er jenes höchste Gut, nach dem diese Religiosität strebte: die Gnadengewiβheit. So absolut ungeeignet also gute Werke sind, als Mittel zur Erlangung der Seligkeit zu dienen, so unentbehrlich sind sie als Zeichen der Erwählung.’ (Only a chosen one is able to increase the glory of God by truly good works. And as he is conscious of this, that his way of life is based on a force inside him which increases God’s glory, not only willed by God, but mainly provoked by God, he attains the highest good for which his religiosity is striving for: the certainty of mercy. So as good works are totally useless means for obtaining salvation, they are indispensable as a sign of election.’In other words, this is nothing less than predestination. But, predestination is a part of only Calvinist belief, not of other Protestant religions. Capitalism didn’t flourish in Calvinist, but in Protestant countries.There is another aspect (a real one, not in the head) of the phenomenon of Protestantism.During a long time about 75% of all outstanding monetary funds in Western Europe were in the hands of the Catholic Church, through the terrorism of the mendicant orders and the mandatory buying of indulgences by all Catholics (see Jean Delumeau). What has the Church done with this money? It built many Versailles (churches): a kind of Western Potlatch.The breakthrough came with Protestantism on the continent and with Henry VIII in England (G.M. Trevelyan). In the now heathen (non-Catholic) countries the entrepreneur could keep his funds and invest them in (new) businesses.One example: when Antwerp fell in the hands of the Catholic Spanish king in the 16th century, all merchants fled to Amsterdam and created there a golden capitalist age (for I. Wallerstein, the beginning of pure capitalism).As F. Braudel said, ‘it’s not religion, but the economy’, in other words money and investments.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A5JAZHHAIFU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140439218#wasThisHelpful","R2A5JAZHHAIFU9","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main theme of this highly emotional short novel is freedom, or better, the lack of freedom.The daughter of a school master becomes the secretary of a retired and disabled GDR apparatchik. He recruited her to type his autobiography, dictated in a pure ideological jargon. Both live in a privileged residential area for Party cadres in East Berlin.The apparatchik, who became a communist at the age of 17, justifies his political choice by his fight against Nazism. But, for his secretary, this is no reason to create, after Hitler’s defeat, a new dictatorship: a totalitarian State, tightly controlled by its secret service, the Stasi.The confrontation turns into violent emotional outbursts by the secretary, and all the more when she hears that the apparatchik was in no way a passive follower of the Party line. The retired ‘comrade’ becomes a real obsession and the typist dreams of strangling him.The electrifying emotional tension full of suppressed anger in this book can be compared with the atmosphere in M. Yourcenar’s novella ‘Coup de Grace’.Both are remarkable masterpieces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14QD12J4J7HA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0930523946#wasThisHelpful","R14QD12J4J7HA8","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The anthems on this CD shine through the nobility of the music and the genuine honesty of the written messages.The CD contains two sorts of anthems: ‘full’ anthems for a choir with or without instrumental support (here an organ) and ‘verse’ anthems where one or more voices enter into a dialogue with the rest of the choir.It contains also two Pavans by Thomas Morley: Passymeasures Pavan and Lachrimae Pavan. The latter is a setting by Thomas Morley of John Dowland’s instrumental work.The textsAll the text, except anthems 9 and 11, are addressed to ‘our Lord’.We find glorious jubilations, like ‘1 – Hosanna to the son of David’, ‘3 – All people clap in your hands, God is gone up with triumph’, ‘4 – What joy so true, high God most lovingly pours down His gracious benefits’, ‘7 – All laud and praise and let all men with heart and voice extol his majesty’ and ’17 – Alleluia, I heard a voice as of strong thund’rings’;but also ardent calls: for help in ’16 – Most mighty and all-knowing Lord, I am weak, unless thou point me out the way with thy wise spirit me directing, unto the devil I am made a prey, were not thy power me protecting’; for righteousness of the king (the king’s son) in ‘13 – Give the king thy judgements and thy righteousness unto the king’s son’, then shall he judge the people according unto right, and defend the poor’; for righteousness of the priests in ’14 – O Lord arise. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness’; and, for mercy in ‘2 – Give ear, O Lord, to hear a sinner’s careful cry and mercy grant to my sins’;and finally deep laments: ‘9 – Death hath deprived me of my dearest friend’ on the death of Thomas Morley, and ‘12 – When David heard’, the lament of David on the death of his son Absalom, who fought against him.The musicAs J. Freeman-Attwood states in his excellent introduction: the music of Thomas Weelkes is driven by sonorous textures, which are indeed impressive as in ‘5 – O Lord, grant the king a long life’ and in ’13 – Give the king thy judgements’. The melodic line always prevails, which makes the text more comprehensible than in other more complex compositions.Many anthems are a combination of monophonic and polyphonic styles, as in ‘2 – Give ear, O Lord’, ’4 – What joy so true’, ‘7 – all laud and praise’ or ’13 – Give the king thy judgements’, all with a discreet organ counterpoint. ’16 – Most mighty and all-knowing Lord’ is a pure monophonic work, also with an organ counterpoint.Thomas Weelkes uses in his polyphonic work imitations as well as echo plays. He embellishes his anthems further with appropriate text interpretations, like ‘joyfulness’ in ’14 – O lord arise’ and ‘rejoice’ in ‘3 – All people clap your hands’.This recital is sublimely sung by the Oxford Camerata under Jeremy Summerly.A must have for all lovers of Renaissance music.But, one regret: no translation of the texts, although the introduction is in English, French and German.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZ9EVLY9005S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001469#wasThisHelpful","RBZ9EVLY9005S","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book gives an appalling picture of life in the 17th -18th century (in France) and a most cruel portrait of a king (Louis XIV).The KingThe ‘Sun’ King was everything but sunny. His main preoccupation was his ‘glory’ and, for him, this glory could only be achieved through WAR. (‘War is undoubtedly the most brilliant way to acquire glory’, ‘to increase his kingdom’s power and prestige’). He was rightly called ‘the terror of Europe’.He sits at the root of ‘the fatal events of our times’ (E. Spanheim). During the Dutch war, many people were burned alive in their homes.Besides war, there were the BUILDINGS: ‘nothing indicates the grandeur and spirit of princes more than buildings’ (Colbert).His courtVersailles was a top location, but its main characteristic was stench through extremely bad sanitation (defecations and urinations in public inside the palace) and hygiene.For the courtiers it was a world of boredom: ‘one gets up early in the morning, one dresses oneself with care, one spends all day on one’s feet awaiting a favorable moment to get oneself seen, to present oneself, and often one comes back as one went, except that one is in despair for having wasted one’s time and trouble’. They were immensely ‘superstitious, backward and deluded’.The court was also a ‘bordello’ for all tendencies.The top classes were obsessed by power. The infighting to become the favorite of the King was deadly: ‘all at court would have given themselves to the devil for love of the King (Primi Visconti)’. The court was full of ‘jealousy and spite, intrigue, ambition and avarice’.Those who got ‘in the sun’, but risked to lose it, turned to poisoning, Satanism, infanticide, black masses, black magic with the hope to improve their prospects (again).His countrymen, religion, the clergyVersailles was the power centre of France. But, what about the rest of the country?The common people lived a wretched life, full of penury. They were crushed by the oppressive weight of taxes … to be spend for the ‘glory’ of the King.Religion had lost its attraction: ‘faith is extinguished in this country to the point where not a single young man is to be found who does not choose to be an atheist’ (the Duchesse d’Orléans). The first estate, the clergy, was corrupt, celebrating black masses on the stomachs of naked women. Priests cut a child’s throat and collected its blood in a chalice. The blood took the place of sacramental wine.’Ultimately, the king backed away from the scandal, because his mistress was most probably involved in the affair. Moreover, it was very bad for France’s international reputation.This book gives an astonishing portrait of the highest classes (the first and the second estate) and of one the most beautiful buildings in a European country in the 17th-18th century.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPMD45U1H7HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0753817845#wasThisHelpful","R1NPMD45U1H7HF","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ‘Missa’ by J. Clemens non Papa on this CD is based on his motet ‘Pastores quidnam vidistis (Shepherds what have you seen?’. Besides this motet and its ‘parody’ ‘Missa’, the CD contains three other exemplary motets for the style of the composer.Text of the motets‘7 - Tribulationes civitatum (The trials of the cities)’ is a call for mercy: ‘Lord, have mercy on us; we have sinned like our fathers (not ‘father’s’ as in the translation)’.‘8 - Pater peccavi (Father I have sinned)’ is based on the story of the Prodigal Son: ‘I am dying of hunger. I will go to my father and say to him: use me as one of your labourers’.‘9 - Ego flos campi (I am the flower of the field)’ is an excerpt of King Solomon’s Canticle of Canticles. The accent here lays on ‘sicut lilium inter spinas (like a lily among thorns)’, the motto of the Marian Brotherhood of ‘s Hertogenbosch for whom J. Clemens non Papa wrote this work.‘1 - Pastores quidnam vidistis (Shepherds what have you seen?)’ celebrates the birth of Christ.MusicJ. Clemens non Papa’s music shines by its impressive fluent polyphonic sound waves through a ‘transparant imitative counterpoint’ (P. Philips).I do not fully agree with the comment ‘while reducing the precise meaning of the words to a position of relative unimportance’. J. Clemens non Papa’s first aim is indeed the generation of beautiful melodic lines. But, there are a few clear examples of text interpretation, like the mood changes in ‘5 – Sanctus and Benedictus’: an extravert Sanctus and an introvert Benedictus are both followed by a vibrant ‘Hosanna in excelsis’. There is also the gripping call ‘Domine, miserere nostris’ in ‘7 – Tribulationes civitatum’ and the accentuation of ‘sicut lilium inter spinas in ‘9 – Ego flos campi’. The latter motet uses imitations and echo plays.There are very rare rhythmic changes: only at the end of ‘3 – Gloria’ and in ‘5 – Sanctus and Benedictus’.Although the sound mix of the voices in this recital has been criticized, I find the singing of the Tallis Scholars simply sublime.This CD with an excellent introduction by Peter Phillips and a translation of all the texts in four languages (English, French, German and Italian) is highly recommended to all lovers of Renaissance music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3O8I8CRS30L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005ATD1#wasThisHelpful","R1H3O8I8CRS30L","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his novel ‘The Life of Rossini’, Stendhal states that music can only have an effect on man if it excites his imagination and produces images which are similar to his passions. For Stendhal, as for his great admirer F. Nietzsche (‘The Birth of Tragedy’), art (especially music) should be a consolation against the sorry state of the world. Art (music) should be a solace, by providing a ‘view of happiness’, because when man spots a glimpse of happiness as in a dream, he immediately gets a glimmer of hope.After a long period of inactivity due to exhaustion (40 operas in eighteen years) and a deep depression, G. Rossini composed his 'Sins of Old Age', excerpts of which are sublimely played here on this CD. The majority of the poems (not always of high quality) are written by Emilien Pacini, a French civil servant responsible for censorship of drama performances!The 'passions' in this recital are love, (lack of) money, holidays, idleness, birth (the child) and death (the tyrant).In matters of love, happiness is only found in '14 – The Lovers of Seville': 'Love is there: let us fly! Happiness awaits us'. In other texts, love means misfortune and death, as in '3 - The great coquette’: 'the love I inspire, this burning desire. I can only make fun of it. Woe to all lovers', and in '2 - Romeo': 'I follow you into the grave'. We find the same scenario in '9 - Farewell to life': 'Loving you was life itself. And now you tear it from me. Your ungrateful heart forgets me, to die is my only desire', and in '10 - Sighs and a Smile': 'you ungrateful, listen to the lover who sings to you. A word of love will console a desolate heart, or else I die of love for you'.As for those who need money, happiness is a chimera: '4 - A penny': 'Do you know what is suffered by a blind man torn by hunger? Death would be less hard to bear than this endless night. A penny, a penny, a penny'; in '11 – The Tyrolean Orphan: 'The humble orphan child is so hungry. And for a little piece of bread she stretches out her hand.', or in '5 – The song of Zora': 'But I have to entertain you, earn my salary. So Zora will smile, dance and sing. When to weep in quiet on my own is often better.'In '8 - The Lazzarone (The Lay-about)' happiness rhymes with idleness: 'Besides the azure waves to sleep under a clear sky, is the delight of Lazzarone'.The commemorated holidays are: New Year in '1 - Toast for a New Year', hunting in '12 – Chorus of the democratic (!) hunters' and Christmas in '6 - Christmas Eve'.We find the theme of the lovely child in the lullaby '7 - The Children's Bedtime’: 'My son, swift-passing rose, on your mother's breast, death flees far away from you.' But death is all too present in '16 - Mourning' on the death of G. Meyerbeer and in '15 - The Song of the Titans': 'War! Massacre! Carnage! Sons of Titan, be bold! We must punish such insult with our avenging arms! Death to Jupiter!'In these 'Sins of Old Age', G. Rossini exhibits again his amazing palette of pure melodies, octave jumps in the chant, crescendos, abrupt silences and changes in rhythm and tone; in two words: expressiveness and vivacity.Real jewels are the song '6 - Christmas Eve' with its sublime evocation of a night atmosphere and '9 - Farewell to life', an elegy on a single note (for the chant, not for the piano melody). We should remember that a similar composition has also been written by H. Purcell.This recital is sublimely interpreted by the Chorus Musicus under the direction of C. Spering.All texts as well as the introduction are translated into English and German.A must for all lovers of classical music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXMW84K7LKZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000005W2R#wasThisHelpful","R1YXMW84K7LKZ2","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The compositions from the years 1340 – 1440 on this CD are exemplary for the dawn of polyphonic writing in England and France.The lyrics are religious as well as secular texts.The textsThe religious texts are mass excerpts (Gloria, Sanctus) or praises of the Virgin Mary, like ‘13 – Speciosa facta es (You are beautiful)’ by J. Donstable or ‘7 – Ther is no rose of swych virtu’ (Anon.) and the lullaby ‘5 – Lullay, lullay’ (Anon.): the announcement to Mary by the archangel Gabriel.Openly partisan religious songs are the appeal to the Virgin Mary, ‘2 – Singularis laudis digna (Worthy of unique praise’ (Anon.): ‘Let the wars of the French cease, and let their land come to the English’, and the thanks to God, ’16 - The Agincourt Carol’ (Anon.): ‘Almighty God he keep owre kynge, His peple, and alle his well-wyllynge, And give them grace wythoute endyng’.Praises of the loved one and of the Virgin Mary are combined in ‘1 - Vos qui admiramini / Gratissima virginis species (O you who admire / O most beautiful figure of a virgin) by P. de Vitry.The loved one is also highly praised in ’12 – Quam pulchra es (How fair art thou) by J. Pyamour: ‘let us go forth into the field; There I will give thee my loves’.But, when one talks about war, many ‘languish thus in a strange country’ as in ‘3 – De ce que fol pense (A fool’s plans)’ by P. des Molins.In ‘9 – Las, que me demanderoye (Alas, je me demande)’, F. Lebertoul feels ‘great joy and gladness, seeing that I perish all alone’.The musicThe vocal music on this CD shows, in comparison with the fluent sound waves of an Orlandus Lassus, rudimentary counterpoints and fixed rhythms.Real highlights are the scores for medieval harp solo, brilliantly played by A. Lawrence-King: ‘4 – De ce fol pense’ (after P. des Molins), ’10 – Le gay playsir’ (Anon.),’11 – Le grant pleyser’ (Anon.) and ’15 – Je vous pri que j’aye un baysier (I ask you for a kiss)’ by R. Loqueville.‘7 – Ther is no rose of swych virtu’ (Anon’) stands out with its slow flowing melody as does the carol/lullaby ‘5 – Lullay, lullay’ (Anon.).This extremely well researched recital should not be missed by all lovers of medieval music.Translations of the texts and the introduction are only in English.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11PE1XKFU83HS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003097AG0#wasThisHelpful","R11PE1XKFU83HS","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much ink has already been spilled on this seemingly enigmatic film by Luis Buñuel. Hereafter, an attempt to analyze some of the obvious and hidden aspects of this masterpiece.The film uses two notions of the word ‘phantom’: specter (menace) and illusion.The film also plays on many levels: political, religious, social, mental / physical, symbolical, psychoanalytical.PoliticalThe slogan ‘Down with liberty’ is heard at the beginning and at the end of the film. Its message is clear.First, we witness a staging of the famous Goya painting ‘The Third of May, 1808’ where Spanish prisoners, shouting this slogan, are shot by the French Republican army. 'Down with liberty’ means here 'Down with the French Republic’ and its sans-culottes, the defenders of the progressive motto ‘Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'.At the end of the film, the spectator vaguely hears a crowd (apparently a manifestation) which shouts the same slogan. The film was shot during a period when the Communist Party in France still had important political and social clout, especially through its trade union. This party was at that time heavily influenced by a totalitarian state, which was fundamentally opposed to certain freedoms, including political ones. 'Down with liberty' means here also 'Down with the French Republic'.Religion, JusticeReligion (Catholicism) was (is) also threatened by liberty and the sans-culottes. The viewer assists at a desecration of a church and of holy bread by the French Republican army. In addition, for L. Buñuel, representatives of the Church are corrupt: in the film, monks play cards and drink alcohol.A sniper kills people indiscriminately in the street, apparently to sow panic among the population; so, it's a provocation (an utmost topical issue). He is condemned, but the sentences of the judges are not respected. To the contrary, the sniper is set free and congratulated by the judicial administration and by part of the population: down with liberty of justice.Physical and mental lifeA challenging aspect of the movies by L. Buñuel is the dissociation between the physical (time, space) and mental (sentiments) reality.One can see a perfect example of this dissociation in another film by L. Buñuel (An Andalusian Dog), where a father slaps his son, followed by the text 'thirteen years later' and the action continues. In other words, in a split of a second (the slap) the son becomes thirteen years older (psychological time).This dissociation is (perhaps) an explanation of the sequence of the film where a girl disappears while being present. She is physically present, but not mentally for her parents.IllusionFreedom is an illusion in matter of instincts (like for the animals of the zoo). In this regard, scenes of sexual deviances are constants in the films of L. Buñuel as are dream sequences. Other psychoanalytic elements in this movie are anal fixation (a dinner where the guests are sitting on a toilet) or a split personality (the two prefects at the end of the film).Liberty as an illusion is the basic outline of the screenplay: the journey of the characters is all the time disrupted by unforeseen encounters, accidents or bad weather.The end of the film is a shot of an ostrich head, as if L. Buñuel exhorts the spectator: don’t put your head in the sand like an ostrich, but do face head-on the (hidden) reality as the bird on the screen.Se non è vero, è molto ben trovato ?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NPYT3WNSHJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007WFYC0#wasThisHelpful","R8NPYT3WNSHJU","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rarely has a journey into madness so convincingly and so brilliantly been filmed. Luis Buñuel's directing and the playing of the actors, Arturo de Córdova and Delia Garcés, are simply magnificent, as was his crew, with Gabriel Figueroa as primus inter pares.The obsessions (jealousy, suspicion, greed) of the main character of the movie burst into plain paranoia in one of the most hilarious/dramatic sequences ever shot in the history of the motion picture. The end comes as a shock when the main character appears in a most unexpected disguise. Luis Buñuel used shocks (an eminent trick of the surrealists) time and again in many of his movies in order to derange and provoke the spectators.Of course, the main intrigue of the movie is a variation on the age old male nightmare of raising unknowingly the offspring of other men.This bright movie is a must see for all movie buffs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PUTJYMB12Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=7885723283#wasThisHelpful","R2PUTJYMB12Z0","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD presents excerpts of recitals by the ‘Collegium Aureum’, the ‘Cantus Cölln’ and the ‘Schola Cantorum Basiliensis’ published on other CDs by DHM. As explained in the excellent introduction, the CD shows marvelously the contrast between the ‘Musica reservata’ (polyphonic music for the musically literate) and the more ‘simple’ dance tunes for the ‘common’ people. However, all the scores here are highlights of Renaissance music.Some of the dance tunes by the composers-printers T. Susato, J. Moderne, P. Attaignant, C. Gervaise and P. Phalèse have a more intimate tone (P. Attaignant), but most of them are rhythmic monophonic appealing melodies.The ‘Musica reservata’ contains secular and sacred (excerpts of the ‘Missa in duplicibus’ by G. P. da Palestrina) works.Examples of secular music are madrigals by O. Lassus, G. de Wert, L. Marenzio and B. Pallavicino, as well as German songs by the lesser-known German composer L. Lechner, a pupil of O. Lassus.The music by Lassus (on poems by Petrarch and P. de Ronsard) and by G. P. da Palestrina stands out by its heavenly sound waves and splendid imitations. ‘Udite, lagrimosi spirti d’Averno – Hear, tearful spirits of Avemus’ by G. de Wert shines through its elegiac mood.The songs on texts by G. B. Guarini (Il Pastor fido – The faithful Shepherd) are love laments.For L. Lechner, ’17 – Ein Musicus wollt fröhlich sein - A musician wants to be cheerful’, nothwithstanding his song ’18 – Ach Lieb, ich muß dich lassen – Oh my love, I have to leave you’. He assimilated perfectly Lassus’ musical style.The excellent introduction (in English, French and German) summarizes the all important political, religious and intellectual developments during the 16th century.Unfortunately, there are no texts in the accompanying leaflet. But, they can be found rather easily on the Internet, except the songs by L. Lechner. One has to buy the original CD DHM RD 77182.There are also program errors: the No.s 9 & 12 (not 10 &11) are texts (excerpts) of ‘Il Pastor fido’ by G. Battista Guarini. The madrigals by Luca Marenzio (No.s 10 & 11) come from his ‘Il settimo libro de madrigali a 5 voci’.This CD is an excellent introduction to all kinds of Renaissance music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQO6T6EJYPJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000061LZ#wasThisHelpful","RIQO6T6EJYPJW","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As E. Schreurs states in his excellent introduction, Petrus Alamire was a pseudonym for a German music calligrapher, who lived in the Low Countries (Antwerp and Mechelen). One of his manuscripts is the ‘Chansonnier’ of Margaret of Austria held in the Royal Library in Brussels.The excerpts of this manuscript on this CD are centered on two main topics: religion and the popular (also because of its text) Flemish love song ‘Myn hert altyt heeft verlanghen naer u’ (My heart has always longed for you) by Pierre de la Rue.The textsThe main theme of the religious songs is a call for mercy: ‘1 – Kyrie eleison’ by M. Gascogne; ‘2 – Heaven’s favour/Our help’ by J. Mouton/A. de Févin: ‘In praying to you, we intercede for ourselves, grant that by your mercy we find swift succour’; ‘5 – Agnus Dei’ by A. Willaert: ‘have mercy on us, grant us peace’; ‘6 – Salve Regina’ (Anon.): ‘turn your eyes of mercy towards us’.The main topic of the profane songs is death: ‘3 – Ah grief’ (attr. Josquin Desprez), a mourning song on the death of Emperor Maximilian I; ’13 – Filled with grief’ by J. Desprez, are ‘the last words of Dido’: ‘I yield to you for my remaining days’; ’14 – Within this tomb’ (attr. P. de la Rue) is a mourning song on the death of the ‘green lover’ (a parrot); ’15 – Sweet things of his’ by M. de Orto: ‘receive this soul and release me from these cares’; and, ’12 – Even further’ (Anon.): ‘come to where my fate is set’.The main theme of the love song ‘My heart has always longed for you’ by P. de la Rue is also ‘death’, the fear for the end of a love affair : ‘therefore, my love, do not fail me’ (the translation of ‘lief’ in the accompanying leaflet should be ‘my love’, not ‘love’ (= liefde)).The song ‘4 – May the mother flourish’ by P. Moulu is an ode on music and on many Renaissance musicians with the wish, ‘may the rhythmic melody of musicians thrive’.The musicThe main score in this recital is the intimist/melancholic love song ‘9- My heart has always longed for you’ by P. de la Rue characterized by its slow imitations, like most of the other songs on this CD. Its melody is used in 4 other compositions: ‘1 – Kyrie’ by M. Gascogne, ‘10 – Celle que j’ay (The one I have)’ by C. Rigo de Bergis, ‘6 – Salve Regina’ (Anon.) and the most ‘modern’ adaptation for lute solo by H. Newsiedler (11).The songs of (or attr.) Josquin Desprez (‘3 – Ah grief’ and ‘13 – Filled with grief’) and the one by P. Moulu (4 – May the mother flourish) stand out by their fluent sound waves generated by the voices and the instruments.The instrumental pieces are more lively, like ‘7 – Maudit soy’ by H. Isaac; ‘8 – Autant en emporte’ by P. de la Rue, which is a version without voices of his song ‘Gone with the wind one kiss given, if the heart is not in it’; and, ‘Jam Sauche (Joyssance vous?)’ also by P. de la Rue.The only piece by P. Alamire is ‘17 - Tandernaken op den Rijn’, an instrumental variation on a Dutch song, which means ‘the city of Andernach on the Rhine’, where two girls speak with one another. The first one is crying because her mother forbids her to see her lover, while the other wished she had followed her mother’s advice, for she is pregnant now and her lover left her.Excellent interpretation by the ‘Capilla Flamenca’.Highly recommended to all lovers of Renaissance music, with one regret: translations of the texts are only in English.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R312HCUZJJUEGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000038I7X#wasThisHelpful","R312HCUZJJUEGZ","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Musica Antiqua of London presents on this CD a recital of French and English Renaissance music with songs and instrumental pieces by well-known composers (C. Gervaise, H. Isaac, T. Susato, L. Compère, C. de Sermisy or J. Clemens non Papa), but also by lesser-known ones (J. Lloyd, A. Brugier, Henry VIII), and by a composer (Doctor Cooper), on whom not one reference can be found on the internet.The textsThe songs are mostly lover’s laments, like ‘2 – L’Amour de moi’ (Anon.): ‘there is no such sweet thing as the gentle nightingale’; ‘6 – Farewell my Joye’ by Doctor Cooper: ‘you depart now and leave me all alone’; ‘9 – De mon triste deSplaisir’ by J. RichAfort: ‘l’amant qui est mort de deuil’; or, ‘12 – Dont vient cela’ de C. de Sermisy: ’Why is it fair one, I beg you that you no longer seek me out?’.A. Willaert’s call for sex (’10 – Baisez moi’) becomes in the hands of P. Certon a tryst (‘10 – J’ay le rebours’), which ends in ‘my sadness is not so great as secret’; but, for J. Clemens non Papa (‘10 – Au joli bois’) the end of the tryst is more hopeful: ‘I will be your love’.Carpe diem is the advice of the optimistic ‘4 – Le cuer est bon’ by C. de Sermisy: ‘for ever live without care’.In ‘7 – Allons fere nos barbes’ by L. Compère, a barber shop provides more than a haircut because the barber is a lady. But, Henry VIII turns the song into an instrumental ‘7 – En vray amour’. Moreover, he uses the lament by J. RichAfort to give a moral lesson in (‘9 – Pastime with good company’): ‘for idleness is chief mistress of vice all’.The musicA melancholic mood flows through the lover’s laments. But, the original melodies are turned by A. Brugier (‘2 – L’Amour de moi’) into splendid and joyful variations, by T. Susato (‘12 – Basse dance et reprise’, ‘4 – Reprise’) into popular dances and by P. Attaignant (‘10 – Pavane’) into a processional dance.Some instrumental pieces are more lively rhythmic scores (1, 2, 4, 7 – Henry VIII, 10 – P. Attaignant, 11). They end with the adaptation by T. Susato (14) of ‘La Bataille’ de C. Janequin. Others are more heavy-hearted are (3 – H. Isaac, 5 – C. Gervaise, 12 – T. Susato and 13 – Fantasia by P. van Wilder.The scores 1, 2, 4, 9 - Henry VIII, 10, 11, 14 are made of fine melodic material, with discrete counterpoints between voice and instruments in 2 (Anon.), 4 (C. de Sermisy), 6 (Doctor Cooper) and with echo plays in (‘8 – Fa La Sol’ by W. Cornish), in (‘10 – Au joli bois’ by J. Clemens non Papa) and in (11 – Four consort pieces).The counterpoint between the voices in (‘7 – Allons faire nos barbes’) creates an impression that there are many clients for the barber shop!The interpretation by the ‘Musica Antiqua of London', with angelic singing, is simply sublime.This splendid recital is a must for all lovers of Renaissance music.One regret: translations only in English. Moreover, (9 – De mon triste deSplaisir) is not translated, but the english translation can be found on the CD ‘All the King’s Men – Music for Henry VIII’).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36MM4AXST4VP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000027PRQ#wasThisHelpful","R36MM4AXST4VP2","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD contains rarely heard chamber music for two pianos, partly written by not well-known composers like the Armenians Alexander Arutiunian and Arno Babadjanian. All the pieces are superb musical compositions, with at least one real masterpiece: the Suite for 2 pianos, Op. 6 (1922) by Dmitri Shostakovich.As R. Weitzman states in his excellent introduction, the Suite for 2 pianos was written after the sudden death of the father of the composer. A motive of obsessive ringing of bells crosses through the four movements: a forceful melody with brisk tempo changes, a defiant ‘Fantastic Dance’, a magical nocturne and a virtuoso finale with funeral moods.The ‘Concertino for 2 pianos op. 94’ is a brilliant display of pure melodic material with tempo and mood changes.The ‘Suite for 2 pianos’ by A. Khachaturian is based on themes from his ballet Gayaneh, transcribed by A. and M. Gottlieb. It begins with a remarkable osttinato remembering the Sabre Dance, followed by a beautiful Romance and ending with a Ravellian waltz.The ‘Armenian Rhapsody’ by A. Arutiunian and A. Babadjanian is based on splendid folklore tunes.The interpretation by Seta Tanyel and Jeremy Brown is simply masterful.This CD is a must have for all lovers of classical music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JMALIB59I3YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000AEL#wasThisHelpful","R3JMALIB59I3YS","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This splendid recital contains very well-known pieces (or astute arrangements of those) as well as rarely heard baroque tunes.Well-known pieces are the excerpts of ‘The Danserye’ by T. Susato, the Trumpet Voluntaries by J. Clarke (The Prince of Denmark’s March) and J. Stanley (Trumpet Tune), the Prelude in D from the ‘Te Deum” by Marc-Antoine Charpentier (the Eurovision theme), the Contrapunctus IX from ‘The Art of the Fugue’ by J. S. Bach or ‘The Trumpet Tune and Ayre’ and the ‘Music for the funeral of Queen Mary’ by H. Purcell.Those are all brilliant and very appealing tunes, with H. Purcell’s funeral music capturing perfectly the mourning mood.Giovanni Gabrieli’s ‘Canzona per Sonare a 4 – La Spiritata’ shines by its virtuoso and radiant echo plays.Samuel Scheidt’s first three movements of his ‘Suite’ are more intimate melodies, but his composition ends with a brilliant evocation of a ‘Battaglia’ with vivid echo plays.Johann Pezel’s ‘Ceremonial Brass Music’ stands out with its solemn tunes and rhythmic changes (Bal, Gigue).William Byrd (not an ‘Anonymous’ composer as indicated on the verso) in his ‘An Elizabethan Suite’ switches between more intimate (The Irish Ho-Hoane, A Toye), vivid/virtuoso (Musicadin, The Irish Dumpe) and solemn (Alman) parts.The ‘Five Dances’ of Anthony Holborne excel by their melodic lines, vivid echo plays (2 – The Choise) and dancing rhythm (5 – The Faery Rounde).Matthew Locke’s ‘Music for his Majesty’s Sagbutts and Cornetts’ presents six different melodic tones: elegiac, rhythmic, solemn, pure melodic, intimate and vivid ones.The texts of the anthems in the ‘Music for the funeral of Queen Mary’ can be found on the Internet: www3.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Funeral_sentences_from_the_BCP.

"This CD is a compilation of the Currende Consort/Capella Sancti Michaelis recitals published by the Eufoda label, which I all highly recommend.The subtitle ‘Flemish courtly love songs’ doesn’t reflect exactly the content of the songs. Some scores are not that courtly at all.The textsThe first song ‘Hé, compaignons’ by G. Du Fay is a wake-up call … for all listeners. It is followed by songs about true love, amorous laments and blatant calls for sex.True love is dramatically expressed in ‘2 – La belle se siet’ (The fair lady sits): ‘if he is to be hanged, bury me by him, and so people will say: here was true love’. In ‘3 – Amours merchi’ G. Binchois thanks love, because love ‘surprised me with a very rich pleasure.’ In ’16 – Autant en emporte le vent’ (It’s all gone with the wind) by P. de la Rue: ‘only a kiss, if the heart adds not its touch, it’s all gone with the wind’.Most of the songs are amorous laments, like ‘7 – Ma bouche rit’ (My mouth laughs) by J. Ockeghem: ‘perverse, false and lying heart’, or ’21 – Je ne me puis tenir d’aimer’ by J. Desprez: ‘I cannot help but love you, who loves me not at all’, and ’25 – Cueurs desolez’ (Desolate hearts) by J. Desprez: ‘she wept in the night, among her lovers she had none to comfort her.’But, other scores are blatant calls for sex, like ‘9 – Es wollt ein Maegdlein grasen gahn’ (A girl wished to go to the meadows) by H. Isaac: ‘F.ck me, dear Peter’, or ’22 – Allegez moy’ (Relieve me) by J. Desprez : ‘relieve me just below the navel’, and ’19 – Si j’avoye Marion’ (If I had Marion) by J. Desprez: ‘I would take her to the woods to dance a giddy round.’The musicThe most expressive songs are the calls for sex: a big choir with furious imitations in ’22 – Allegez moy’ by J. Desprez, splendid recorder (!) variations in ‘9 – Es wollt ein Maegdlein’ by H. Isaac and good rhythm in ’19 – Si j’avoye Marion’ by J. Desprez.Some songs stand out with their beautiful melodic lines, like ‘2 – La belle se siet’ by G. Du Fay with echo plays, or ‘6 – S’elle m’aimera – Petite Camusette‘ by J. Ockeghem with a voice/instrument counterpoint. The laments by P. de la Rue (15 – Il viendra le jour désiré, 16 – Autant en emporte le vent) are very intimate songs with slow imitations, as is ‘3 – Amours merchi’ by G. Binchois.The instrumental pieces (5, 8, 11, 14, 24) shine by their melodic lines and vivid rhythm.The presentation of this CD is simply magnificent with splendid graphic material and with excellent comments by J. C. Cabello and D. Fallows.All texts are translated in Spanish and English. Notwithstanding the French title of the CD, the texts of the songs (which are actually mostly in old French) are not translated in French, only the introductions.This CD will mostly appeal to fans of Renaissance music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPYCJYA5MRHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000005SC2#wasThisHelpful","RNPYCJYA5MRHB","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This recital is composed of excerpts from the songbook of 1542, ordered by a fabric merchant from Bruges, Zeghere van Male.The nature of the songs and the instrumental pieces is rather intimate.The textsMost of the texts are lamentations and prayers by desperate lovers, like 'O cueur ingrate – O ungrateful heart' by J. de Hollande: 'Reviens vers moy, car sans prompt debvoir tu causera ma mort - Come back to me, if you don’t do it rapidly you will be the cause of my death', or 'Donna leggiadra' (Graceful Dame) by P. Verdelot: 'Non mi data morte' (Do not kill me).The recital also includes a Sanctus from the anonymous Mass 'C’est doncq par moy – It is thus by me’, 'a glorification of God (Laus Deo – God be praised) and of the Virgin Mary (O intemerata - O immaculate) by J. Desprez and a lament on the death of Josquin Desprez 'Muse, Jovis - Muse, Jupiter' by B. Appenzeller.However, this edition is not immaculate; e.g., the first word of the title of song No. 10 should be 'GhequeTst - Wounded', not 'Ghequest’. In addition, the majority of the lengths of the tracks listed on the back of the CD and in the booklet, are not correct.The musicThe compositions are based on slow melodies and imitations and rudimentary counterpoints.For the instrumental pieces, 'Chantons, sonnons trompettes - Sing, sound the trumpets' (Anon.), The 'Basse Danche - Low Dance' (Anon.) and 'Mille regretz – A thousand regrets' by J. Desprez / L. Narváez shine by their pure melody.As for the songs, 'Muse, Jovis – Muse, Jupiter’ by B. Appenzeller excels by its elegiac tone, 'Donna leggiadra – Graceful Dame' by P. Verdelot by its melodies (tres! repetita placent) and 'Resjossés vous' (Be happy) by J. Mouton and 'Qui l’ara, l’ara ' (Who will get her) by B.

"This remarkable recital of Flemish Renaissance music contains religious, secular and instrumental polyphonic music by two well-known composers, Nicolaas Gombert and Jacob(us) Clemens non Papa (Jacques Clément), and by a lesser-known one, Thomas Crequillon. Their music is characteristic (and sometimes outstanding) for the composition techniques of the 16th century,The textsThis recital contains religious classics like `Veni, Creator Spiritus' (4)', `Regina Coeli' (14) or excerpts of a mass `Kyrie-Gloria-Sanctus' (22).The satirical and vulgar song `Blaison du laid tetin (Blason of the ugly tit)' by J. Clemens non Papa is the counterpart of `Blaison du beau tetin (Blason of the beautiful tit)' by C. Janequin. Both poems were written by Clément Marot and the songs were published together!Other themes are lover's laments, like `10 - Amour au cueur me poingt (Love pierces my heart)' by J. Clemens non Papa, or `17 - Pour ung plaisir' by Thomas Crequillon: `for such brief pleasure I have had a thousand afflictions', or, trysts: `8 - Au joly bois (In the pretty wood)' and `9 - Jaquin Jaquet' with its puns, both by J. Clemens non Papa, and also, a blatant call for sex in '20 - Ung gay bergier (A jolly shepherd)' by Thomas Crequillon, but unfortunately `you even have not the lance to fit me'.The musicNicolaas GombertUnlike his secular songs with their slow imitations (also here in `5 - Triste depart (Sad farewell)', his religious music shines by its beautiful melodic sound waves with perfectly flowing imitations as in `1- Alleluia', `13 - Ad te levavi' and '15 - Tota pulchra est' (with an angelic soprano score). `14 - Regina coeli' is a brilliant 12-part polyphonic work with a sublime combination of voices and instruments.`6 - Plaisir n'ay plus (I don't have pleasure anymore)' is an expressive instrumental piece.Jacobus Clemens non Papa'10 - Amour au cueur me poingt (Love pierces my heart)' is a lover's lament with slow imitations and a rather rudimentary counterpoint between the voices and the instruments.The more satirical pieces like `7 - Blaison du laid tetin (Blason of the ugly tit)', `8 - Au joly bois (In the pretty wood)' or `9 - Jaquin Jaquet (Little Jack)' are composed with more vivid imitations and beautiful melodic lines.His instrumental pieces (`11 - Hortens (Exhorting)' and '12 - Forbons' (translation?) are more lively expressive pieces with appealing echo plays.Clemens non Papa's songs contain also astute musical text interpretations, like `baisés moy tant tant' in `8 - Au joly bois'.Thomas CrequillonHis laments are a mix of slow [16 - Crainte et espoir m'oppressent (Fear and hope oppress me), and 18 - Prestés moy (Lend me)] and more vivid songs [17 - Pour ung plaisir que si peu dure (For such a brief pleasure], while `19 - Las, je cognois (Alas, I admit)' stands out with its beautiful melody.In the vivid call for sex `20 - Ung gay bergier (A jolly shepherd)' the word `lance' is ironically accentuated.The excerpts of the Mass `Pis ne me peut venir' (Worse can't overcome me) excel by their rhythmic variations and their voices / instruments counterpoint.This recital is sublimely sung and played by the Capella Sancti Michaelis and the Currende Consort under Erik van Nevel.All texts are translated in four languages (French, English, German and Dutch), as is the perfect introduction by Ignace Bossuyt..This CD is a must have for all lovers of Renaissance music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8RRLZ5VOUD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NAH5AC#wasThisHelpful","R1D8RRLZ5VOUD5","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This splendid recital presents Renaissance music from England, Spain, France and the Netherlands, which was played at royal courts.The songs and the instrumental pieces are fairly representative for the lyrics and the music of the 16th century.The textsThe texts are love songs, like ‘10 - Con amores, mi madre’ by Juan Anchieta: ‘Love consoled me with more good than I deserved’, or ‘5 - A Robyn’ by William Cornysh: ‘for I find women true; In faith my lady lov’th me well’.Also, love laments, like ‘8 – De vous servir’ by Philip van Wilder: ‘how I might show clearly the great sadness I endure for you’; or, ‘20 – Amy souffrez’ by Nicolas Gombert: ‘don’t be so harsh to tell me that your heart suffers extreme sadness’; or, ‘22 – De mon triste desplaisir’ by Jean Richafort: ‘At your hands I suffer countless injuries with no consolation’.Other laments are about the way of all flesh in ’13 - Claros y frescos rios’ (Anon.): ‘trees who live and at the end die’; and, about bad fortune, like ’18 – Comment peult avoir joye’ by Josquin Desprez: ‘How can he be joyful who is held back by misfortune?’, or, ’19 - Faulte d’argent’ also by Josquin: ’to be short of money is the greatest misery’.There are also blatant calls for physical love: ‘1 – Hey trolly lolly lo’ (Anon.): ‘Let us make one, though we be twain’, and ‘9 – La Tricotea’ (attr. Franco Alonso): ‘My lady, for love’s sake, be mine’. The latter text is partly incomprehensible because of its mix of different languages.More comprehensible are the more ironical songs ’14 – Cucú, cucú’ by Juan del Encina’ ‘My friend, you must be wary at all time of being cuckolded’’ and ’23 - Et la, la, la’ by Ninot le Petit: ‘I went into our garden to pick some gillyflowers; there I found my best friend who had already picked them.’ ; or the song ’24 – Jan, petit jan’ by Jean L’héritier with the following advice: ‘Jan, if you have a pretty wife, look after her but show no jealousy’.The most elaborated song is ‘La Bomba’ by Mateo da Flecha. It is a small musical ‘salad’ about a shipwreck. The passengers are saved by another ship after a call for help to the Holy Virgin. But the author has still an ultimate warning: ‘For if there are dangers at sea, there are dangers on land and dangers in false brotherhood.’The musicThe songs by Josquin Desprez (18, 19), Nicolas Gombert (20) and Jean Richafort (22) are characterized by slow imitations.W. Cornysh (5) and Juan Anchieta (10) wrote beautiful melodies. More vivid melodic lines were composed by Ninon le Petit (23), Juan del Encina (14) and Jean l’héritier (24).But, the highlight of this recital is the lively ‘ensalada’ ‘La Bomba’ by Mateo da Flecha with its echo plays and text interpreatations (example: ‘moriré’).Of the instrumental pieces, the ‘Ungarescha’ (17) and the circle dance ‘Schiarazula  maruzula’ (25) (both attributed to G. Mainerio), together with the ‘Pavana la gaiette: Tordion’ (Anon.) shine by their ‘elegant simplicity’ (M.Levy).The songs and instrumental pieces are magnificently interpreted by the voices of ‘I Fagiolini’ and the viols of ‘Concordia’.All the songs are translated in English.This recital is a must for all lovers of Renaissance music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38H0AG2VG4Y4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005YCMP#wasThisHelpful","R38H0AG2VG4Y4M","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"J. M. Coetzee has always been an ambitious writer, tackling head on major human problems, be those on the individual or on the societal level.‘The Childhood of Jesus’ is in this way not an exceptional Coetzee book, albeit (again) a controversial one, directly (by what it says) or indirectly. It treats recurring themes in his work.First of all, this book is written in impeccable prose, and is a far cry from his Beckettian beginnings.The basic story is very simple: a man is looking for the mother of a very young boy (not his child) in a foreign country that is well organized for the integration of all foreigners who arrive at its shores. Those foreigners should, however, all be ‘washed cleanly’.On the individual and family level, the boy is an exceptionally intelligent human being. He is helped, protected and loved in an exemplary way by his surrogate parents. Are they better, or fitter, than natural ones?Being clever and (therefore) rebellious, the boy has big problems in the existing educational system.On another level, the foster father is a great fan of the frugal diets based on grain in his new country.On the societal level, the foster father becomes a longshoreman, unloading on his back vessels full of sacks of grain, real ‘bestial labour’. He proposes to mechanize the process with a crane. But, the crane is badly handled and hits him. Does this crystal clear image mean that technical progress is a curse for mankind? Because, it destroys jobs, because it makes men idle? As stated in the book: ‘I would not dream of disparaging the work we do. In the time I have spent here I have experienced nothing but comradely love. Imagine having to spend your days on a public bench with nothing to do.’ This is Kropotkin revisited.The grain silos are infested with rats. But those are left alone. A peaceful cohabitation with wild animals (rats) wasn’t a blatant success in the course of human history.The country has also a ‘nurse’ solution for man’s sexual drive.However, the main problem for the surrogate family is the education of the young boy. Being stubborn, the school administration is obliged to put him in a camp with a special regime for difficult children. Will the foster parents, ultimately, accept this authoritarian measure, or will they leave their new fatherland and search for a new utopia for their foster child?‘The Childhood of Jesus’ is a typical Coetzee book. However, as an introduction to his work, I would begin with less ‘utopian’ novels, like the masterpieces ‘Foe’ or ‘Waiting for the Barbarians’.I also highly recommend the movie ‘Disgrace’ by Steve Jacobs, based on J.M. Coetzee’s (also controversial) book and with a sublime John Malkovich in the main role.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QQQZIDZVW27W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143125761#wasThisHelpful","R2QQQZIDZVW27W","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oswald von Wolkenstein is a very original composer, even though he borrowed most of his melodies from colleagues, be they anonymous or not.Word-sounds are an essential part of his music, not only in order to create onomatopoeia, like C. Janequin, but to generate wordplays and to express his message in a memorable way.The textsThis recital covers a very wide range of themes. It contains a hunt song (7 - Tally-ho, companion), a drinking bout (9 - Let's make a lot of noise), a spring song with onomatopoeia (5 - May covers the earth), a dawn (lovers split at dawn) song (13 - Awake, my treasure), a war song (15 - At them), a quarrel between a farmer's wife and her maid (11 - Get up, Maredel), a song about his personal problems (16 - Through Barbary: `my prince is angry with me, because of the envy of wicked people), songs about physical love (4 - Joyfully: `mouth kissing mouth, tongue on tongue, breast on breast, belly on belly, skin on skin pressing eagerly all the time') and (8 - You, my heart's own: `her proud body removes all my sorrow'), a call for God's help (3 - He who hovers above us: `may He help me to fend off all my enemies') and, ultimately love (lament) songs (12 - Cruel lover, where have I lost you), (10 - Ah, this yearning, suffering) and (1 - A nobleman of high birth: `my longing and lamenting never swayed you').The musicThe melodies are mostly simple monophonic lines with sometimes rudimentary counterpoints. Some songs are very rhythmic, like the drinking bout (9), the spring song (5), the quarrel song (11) and the (16 - Through Barbary) which has also an Arabian flavor.The most original part of Oswald von Wolkenstein's scores is the word-sound-music combination, which generates a declamatory, theatrical style. Some of his songs (7, 12) are really short theatre plays, while (11) can be seen as the quintessence of a German operetta.All songs could be sung or played at weekly markets or on Sunday morning after mass by folksingers.The recital is magnificently sung and played by the New London Consort under Philip Pickett.All texts are translated in English, French and modern German.This CD, with its excellent introductions by David Fallows, Pia Ambrosh and Giampiero Bernardini, is a must have for all lovers of classical music","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4C28EVHH8FVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000004CYO#wasThisHelpful","R4C28EVHH8FVL","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This recital of religious music from the 15th century (and before) by nearly unknown composers and written down in `The Old Hall Manuscript', reveals a certain link in the history of Western music between the Gregorian and secular music.Nearly all the texts are catholic classics. The music is not very sophisticated: plainsong melodies with little rhythmic variations.The two songs which stand out are 22 - Are post libamina (At the altar after the libation) by Mayshuet (Matheus de Sancto Johanne) and 25 - Post missarum solennia (After the solemnity of the Mass) (Anon.).Song 22 is remarkable by its text and music. The text is an outspoken reflection on music and singing. A song should be `sweet harmonies, highly lyrical, with a joyful tone'. In the second part of the text (which is not sung on this CD), Mayshuet strongly admonishes singers: they should not seek `vain glory' and certainly not if their `skills fall short'. They should not be `mercenary men (who) change the best gold into base metal and sweet perfumed flowers into nasty smells. Such singers think not about God the man. You, hypocrites, you have never heeded the Holy Gospel.'Song 25 is less original: `we will with sweetly fluent voice sing songs requesting God the fount of all good things.'Both songs shine by their rhythmic variations: voice singing together at different tempi (fast and slow).The songs are brilliantly interpreted by the Hilliard Ensemble.All texts are translated in English.This CD will mostly appeal to all those interesting in the history of Western music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PH1TXIQGKVCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000006DDX#wasThisHelpful","R3PH1TXIQGKVCW","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The complete scores of the Italian madrigals on this CD have been assembled from different libraries by the musicologist Wolfgang Boetticher, who wrote a fine introduction for this CD. We can only fully agree with him: Lassus' genius provided `magnificent madrigalian images of ecstatic poetry' by Petrarca and other poets, `with detailed musical word-painting'.The textsThe madrigals, `Ben convene', `Ove d'altra montagna' and `Spent' è d'amor' are lover's laments, while in `Al dolce suon', the poet sees light at the end of the tunnel of his misery.For the French/Latin songs, `Lucesit jam o socii' is a drinking song, while `Voir est beaucoup' is a social exhortation: `to see is much, to keep quiet about it even more'.`Praesidium Sara' is a wedding song and `Bestia curvafia pulices' a curse of the flea (all words begin with the p of pulex (flea)).The texts of the four motets are, besides the glorification 'Gloria patri', far more important. `Beati pauperes' and `Beati pacifici' are excerpts of the Gospel of Matthew (5/3-8 & 9-12 - the Beatitudes), with `Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God'.`Da pacem, Domine' prays for peace, and `Domine, quando veneris' asks the Lord when he will come to judge the world?The MusicThe scores on this CD are all sublime masterpieces: magnificent sound waves with brilliant imitations, heavenly (de)crescendos and astonishing word-paintings. A few examples: `Ahi mi' in `Solo n'andrò' or `quiete fui' in `Praesidium Sara'.The singing is simply glorious and sublime, one of the best (if not the best) ever of Lassus' music.This CD is a must have for all lovers of classical music.One caveat: the texts are translated only in German. Translations on internet generate, however, acceptable results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K7JS7OZ6YAIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000SMB#wasThisHelpful","R2K7JS7OZ6YAIQ","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an astonishing CD, as the music, as well as the texts and the interpretation is concerned.M. Posch and M. Ambrosini point out in their excellent introduction that, the troubadours (of the southern part of Europe) were, in general, not wandering minstrels like the `trouvères' (of the North of Europe), but often held high social positions in society.The textsThe subjects of the songs, written in the `langue d'oc' (Provençal) or Catalan, are mostly ideal love, but also political (war), bawdy and religious themes.We see idealized love in the songs of Berenguier de Palou: 1 - `So much I love': `So if ever am held in your arms, so that both of us are of one mind' and 7 - `Such a lady': `noble and fair in demeanour'.Of course, love rhymes with sorrow and loss of liberty: in 11 - `When I see the lark move' by Bernart de Ventadorn: `she has brought death to me'. But, in 3 - `Now I can be satisfied with love' by Peire Cardenal: `Nor am I her captive nor her bond-slave, but I have escaped from her'.Love themes are mixed with war (the crusades) in 5 - `It is fine to sing' by Raimon de Miraval and in 12 - When the days are long in May' by Jaufre Rudel.Another aspect of love is `making love': in 9 - `Praise, now' (Anon.) `you shall not pass a day except on your back, so the abbot says'; or, in the alba song (a couple at dawn after a night together) 6 - `the birds were singing' by Ramon Lull.No wonder that some asks for mercy: in 10 - `Humble, sinful, accused and penitent' by Guiraut Riquier: `I have wasted my time in sinning. I seek mercy, mother of Christ'.The musicAll the songs and the instrumental pieces shine by their beautiful monodic melodies, as do the intimate (5, 10) as well as the more expansive laments (11, 12) or the fiesta exuberance about sex (9).The interpretation of the songs by the late Maria Dolors Lafitte is simply formidable as is the playing by Oni Wytars and the Ensemble Unicorn.Rarely has early Western music of the 12th and 13th century been served so admirably.All texts are translated in English.A must have for all lovers of classical music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XTE92GJ4A8TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000IX6O#wasThisHelpful","R2XTE92GJ4A8TV","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The piano works on this CD are all masterpieces, with their evocation of impressive changing moods, natural sounds and a shocking political event.As R. Schulz notes in his excellent introduction, for L. Janáček `notes mean nothing at all, unless they are steeped in life, blood and nature. Otherwise they are like playthings, quite worthless'.The piano sonata 1.X.1905 `From the street' is a dramatic musical evocation and reflection on a brutal political murder with a bayonet of a man who took part in a demonstration calling for a second Czech university. One hears the shuffles and the killing by a bayonet stab, followed by deeply emotional mourning.The piano pieces `On the Overgrown Path' can be situated, musically speaking, between F. Liszt's `Années de Pélérinage' or E. Grieg's `Lyric Pieces' and C. Debussy's piano suites like `Children's Corner'. They are pure musical expressions of human sentiments and life sounds.`In the Mists' is an imposing `impressionist' suite of 4 complex movements, while `Tema con variazioni (Zdenka Variations)' is a brilliant stylistic exercise.This recital of music by a very much underrated composer is magnificently played by Rudolf Firkusný.A must have for all lovers of classical music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R345KE99BJ1P2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=5550491273#wasThisHelpful","R345KE99BJ1P2H","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD is a perfect introduction to the music of Josquin Desprez. It contains religious as well as worldly works, with some of his generally best known scores, like El Grillo (7), Petite Camusette (9), Scaramella (5) and `La déploration de la mort de Johannes Ockeghem' (13).The textsThe texts of his religious songs are classic ones, like Ave Maria, Veni Sancti Spiritus, De profundis clamavi, in te Domine speravi. They are praises or calls for mercy and/or help.In `Absalon, fili mi' King David mourns over the death of his rebellious son.The songs about love are pure laments. In (8 - Mille Regretz): `I have such great grief that one will see shortly end my days'. In (10 - Je Me Complains): `I don't have news of him'. In (11 - En l'ombre d'ung buissonet): `I won't love you a grain'. In (12 - Je ne me puis tenir d'aimer): `Receive your friend when he is half dead'.The musicJosquin Desprez's religious music and love songs here are characterized by slow tempi and imitations, perhaps too slow for modern ears.However, in `La déploration de la mort de Johannes Ockeghem' those imitations turn into impressive mournful sound waves.Other highlights of this CD are `El Grillo' (7) with its bright onomatopoeias, together with `Scaramella' (5) and `Petite Camusette' (9) with their appealing rhythmic melodies.This recital is magnificently sung by the Hilliard Ensemble.All texts are translated in English, French and German.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REIQ535BCGE60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002SSH#wasThisHelpful","REIQ535BCGE60","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This splendid album seems to be focused on the religious part of Lassus’ work. But behind the religious varnish (7 – There once was a nun) one can find worldly themes of vital social relevance.TextsThe lyrics deal with nothing less than the cardinal themes of war and peace, life and death, love and aging, the powerful and the helpless, the rich and the poor, justice and injustice.War and peace: In 2 - Ad Dominum 'those who hated peace attacked me, a pacifist, without reason’. 'In 21 - Respicit Dominus: 'the wicked one is a prisoner of his own misdeeds’. In 20 - Veni, Sancte Spiritus 'you, who assembled all people in the unity of faith'.Life, death, love, old age : In 15 – O wine, wine is life. In 3 - Open deliciarum 'all delights of the world will soon come to an end. Death, sorrow and fear invade everyone'. In 9 - In ultima hora 'in the last hour all will perish'. In 13 - Passan vostri triomphi: ‘reigns come and go'. In 18 - Hola, Caron: ‘Love has killed me’. In 12 - Il grave età: 'the burden of old age is accompanied by pain, darkness and terror'.The powerful and the helpless: In 1 - Magnificat: ‘he has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted the lowly’. In 10 - Deus, which seeds: 'God be the refuse of the poor’.In this world full of bloodshed and misery one can become desperate: 8 - Timor et tremor: 'Fear and trembling have beset me’. But, one can also see a glimmer of hope: 6 - The cold and somber night: ‘the day unfolds its brightness and adorns this grand universe.'MusicLassus’ songs shine through their extraordinary polyphonic sounds (1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 20, 21), their brilliant imitations (2, 3, 6, 8, 12), their beautiful melodies, including the instrumental pieces (11 - ' Susanne un jour' in an arrangement of Giorgio Bassano and 14 - S'io fusse), and their musical interpretations of words and phrases. Some examples: 'tuba' (10), 'exaltavit’ (1), 'fugimi' (5), 'confundar' (8), 'risus' (9), 'mors, dolor’ (3).In (1), 'morietur’ is followed by a silence. In (13) the trumpets announce the Last Judgment. Song (4) is a beautiful lament; Song (7) a sarcastic parody of religious music and song (6) an admirable description of a sunrise.This CD, whose texts are translated into 4 languages (French, English, German and Dutch), also contains a piece of 3 students of Lassus.The songs and instrumental pieces are interpreted and played magnificently by the Capella Sancti Michaelis and the Currende Consort under the direction of Erik Van Nevel.

(2 - I do not wish, think or strive for anything but what is salutary for me), (4 - Hail Queen, to you ascends our call of exiled children of Eve).But, the most astonishing text of all is the litany `Litania Deiparae Virginis Mariae' (8) with `ivory tower, dripping honeycomb, sealed spring, well of living water, vessel that bring us bread from far away'.Also, captives don't sing (16 - we hanged our harps upon the willows.)While the Lord is the savior in the religious songs, in the worldly ones he is replaced by `the wine God': (14 - This wine rids you from all sorrow.)The songs about love are mostly laments: (7 - How could a heart live without pain when it remembers times of joy that can never return), (10 - You are fiery enough as a lover, my beautiful goddess, only not very faithful), (11 - that ruthless wild creature), (12 - An oppressive sorrow turned me to a senseless stone), (13 - Could I have but enjoyed your beauty for still longer, or else not at all).But, at least one man is happy that his love story is over: (9 - I sing, delivered of sorrow, of sweet and much loved liberty).MusicP. de Monte's music is a mixture of noble, slow, melodic sound waves created by voices and instruments (1, 2, 19, 20). The melodies and imitations in his laments (12, 13) create an atmosphere of real sorrow.A. von Bruck's drinking bout (14) impresses with its lively rhythm, while his (15 - Christ has risen) shines through its melodic line.Other highlights are the sound waves and imitations in (8) by J. Regnart, the remarkable mood of (6 - Adesto, dolori meo) by A. Utendal), the pure melody in (17 - Canzon) by C. Luython and the splendid sounds in (21 - Hodie Christus natus est) by L. de Sayve.This recital is sublimely played and sung by the Currende Consort and the Capella Sancti Michaelis under Erik Van Nevel.All texts are dutifully translated in 4 languages (English, French, German and Dutch)This splendid CD with some very rarely recorded tunes is a must for all lovers of classical music.By the way, there is another version of Psalm 136, 1-4 (here nr. 16) by Boney M.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDGPI7Z31UQRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EMT10E#wasThisHelpful","RDGPI7Z31UQRS","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This astonishing compilation of Italian, Spanish, Judeo-Spanish and Arab-Andalusian music, mostly written by anonymous composers, is a rare find.As E. Enrico notes in his excellent introduction, the music is a reflection on the exploration of new lands, on the defeat of the Moors in Granada, on the expulsion of the Jews and on the consolidation of the power of a catholic monarchy.The textsThe songs capture the spirit of adventure in the mappamundi (world map) songs (1, 16, 17, 18), of the Fall of Granada in (2) `Viva el gran Re Don Fernando' and (3) `Una sañosa porfía' (a furious conflict) by J. del Encina, of the forced conversion of the Moors in (4) `Improvisationes on Tres moricas m'enamoram' (I fell in love with three Moorish girls) by Diego Fernández, and of the expulsion of the Jews in (14) `El paso del Mar rojo' (crossing the Red Sea). `Ah, el novio no quere dinero!' (Oh, the groom wants no money) is a Jewish wedding song.The excerpts of the `Palace Song book' commemorate the Fall of Baza in `En memoria d'Alixandre' by J. de Anchieta. There are also religious (7 - Ay Santa Maria) and worldly songs. The latter about traditional themes like love in (12 - `Pase el agoa' - Cross the water) and in (6 - `Nunca fué pena mayor' -Never was there greater pain by J. de Urreda), or feasting in (13 - `Oy comamos y bebamos' - Today let's eat and drink) by J. del Encina.MusicAll these songs and instrumental pieces shine through their splendid homophonic melodic material, their adequate rhythms, vivid for victories or slow like for the haunting exodus lament (14). Arabian and Turkish influences mark the Judeo-Spanish songs (14, 15) and the instrumental piece (5) with its B'tayhi -M'saddar rhythms (slow with slight increases in tempo).The songs and the music are sublimely interpreted by the Waverly Consort using traditional instruments.All texts are translated in English, except (10 - En Memoria d'Alixandre) for which even the Spanish text is not available (and difficult to find on Internet).This splendid CD is a must for all lovers of classical music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQ0CSHSH2EQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002SK1#wasThisHelpful","R2UQ0CSHSH2EQ7","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This magnificent CD is a real discovery. It contains, besides music by P. Rogier, pieces by not well known composers, like G. de la Hèle, G. van Turnhout, P. de Manchicourt and M. Romero (Mathieu Rosmarin).The textsThe main themes are religion and its worldly counterpart love, with their praises, prayers and torments.The religious songs are excerpts of the mass by P. Rogier `Philippus Secundus Rex Hispaniae' composed on notes derived from the vowels in the title of the mass (! Schoenberg is not far away; but it was already done by Josquin Desprez before);There are also praises like '10 - Regina caeli' and `17 - Laudate Dominum' both by P. Rogier;and prayers/torments: `deliver me of eternal death on the fearsome day of judgment' in (16) by M. Romero; `have mercy on me' in (2) by G. de la Hèle and in (11) by P. Rogier; `let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications' in (8) by P. de Manchicourt.The Lord is replaced by the loved one in the worldly songs of praise: `to look into eyes that are so divine' (15) by M. Romero; `I saw my precious girl, like a dove' in (9) by P. de Manchicourt; `even when I am dead, my spirit will remember you' in (5) by G. van Turnhout; and `love follows beauty' in (12) by P. Rogier.Love's land is also sown with torments and sorrows: `I take pleasure in cruel death for you have wounded me"" in (4) by G. van Turnhout and `her beautiful eyes were every day a new burden' in (14) by M. Romero.Therefore, P. Rogier gives perfect advice in (13 -Lal Amour): `to live free of worries, flee from love if it is not requited'. `Physical love' is a main aspect of worldly love (not of spiritual love): `if he was too sleepy the right recipe would be to take a lover' in (7) by P. de Manchicourt and `my behind (not my `bottom', as in the translation) signals that you'd better be off' in (6) by P. de Manchicourt.The musicThe highlights of this recital are the appealing melodic lines of (5, 8, 13), the rhythms and imitations in (6, 7, 10, 14, 15) and the beautiful sound waves of (16, 17).The recital is magnificently sung and played by the Currende Consort and the Capella Sancti Michaelis under Erik Van Nevel.All texts are translated in 4 languages (English, French, German and Dutch).This rare find, with an excellent introduction, is a must for all lovers of Renaissance music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI1S7S3LWMZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EMT0ZU#wasThisHelpful","R3FI1S7S3LWMZ2","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This splendid CD contains the highlights of A. Willaert's (recorded) French and Italian songs and their remarkable texts.The textsThe most astonishing song is (1) `Qual dolcezza giamai', where the sweetness of the songs seduces the senses and the souls of those who hear them. `The air becomes serene, the sea is calm: Love reigns here.' In other words: music is love.The main theme of the other songs is love, all kinds of love and its torments.Eternal love in (17): `even when I am dead your spirit will remember me.'Pure love in (5): `Let's be merry, my darling'.Jealousy in (12): `because you are jealous, you are always near me.'Laughing out loud in (23): the mad little woman, she does nothing but laugh'.Sorrow in (9, 16, 22): `here I am now with only the wind in my hands.'A tryst in (20): `come without fear and don't bother to knock'.But also venal love, notwithstanding (2): `Love is neither beautiful nor to be cherished if it is obtained with money.'In (3) `In the market of Arras': `Girl, listen, you'll get some money'; in (8) `Nasty old hags set an ambush'.Yet, not everyone agrees to have full physical contact: in (19) `her friend gave her a kiss and ardently desired to play Love's games, but she replied: go water your violets'.Music(16) `Once I had a neighbour' is A. Willaert's most beautiful song (here intabulated by G. Abondante) and a highlight of Renaissance music, with its sublime melody and splendid timing of pauses.Other songs shine through their pure melodies (3, 7, 19) or their rhythmic melody (20, 23). There is also no lack of humor (15, 19, 23).The pieces are sublimely sung (with extremely comprehensible pronunciations) by K. Van Laethem and splendidly played by the Romanesque group. They caught the perfect rhythm and intonation of some of A. Willaert's most recorded songs: (8) `Vecchie letrose' and (15) `Cingari simo'.This magnificent recital, with also works by other composers, is a must have for all lovers of Renaissance music.N.B. the introduction contains some errors: `The versions for solo voice and lute of `A quand' a quand'haveva una vicina' and of `O mio bene' are intabulations of works by the Spanish vihuela player Diego Pisador' should be as follows: `The version for solo voice and lute of `A quand' a quand'haveva una vicina' is an intabulation by the Italian lutenist Giulio Abondante and the version of `O mio bene' an intabulation by the Spanish vihuela player Diego Pisador.' The original compositions are by Adrian Willaert.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6H9TA0XM048/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092YHITG#wasThisHelpful","R2C6H9TA0XM048","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This heavenly recital of songs and instrumental music of the Italian Renaissance contains compositions of well known composers, but also of not very well known or even anonymous ones.The textsThe themes of the songs are love, life and death, the woes of the world and music itself (7 – ‘I wouldst that you a song might sing’ by A. Scandello).The love songs are mostly laments, like 9 – ‘I cannot thee abandon’ by P. Cesena, but also stories of happy encounters (18 – ‘I shall return twice daily’ by P. Azzaiolo) or mighty outburst of happiness in 4 – ‘a thousand upon a thousand times each day I wouldst thee leave so sweet returning be’ by C. de Rore. As M. Materassi tells in his excellent introduction, this last text has been heavily parodied (supposedly, because people asked themselves: why not more?).The woes of the world and death are the subject of 1 – ‘I lived as an eagle’ by S. Lando: ‘midst plaints, sighs, pangs and pains go I forth all my life consuming and like a swan then shall I die singing’; in 13 – ‘Oh my sweet life’ by A. Willaert: ‘I suffer like snow beneath the sun’; in 3 - ‘The husband’s death’ by P. Cambio: ‘the husband’s death do I await. But I fear that I first shall die’; and in 6 – ‘Happy, contented spirits’ by V. Ruffo: ‘how parting doth us burden of such a lovely shepherd’.Music – HighlightsThe two instrumental pieces by anonymous composers, (2 – Canario) and (10 – Pavana della ‘La Battaglia’ inspired by ‘The Battle of Marignan’ by C. Janequin), shine through their expressive melodies.The pieces (7) by A. Scandello and (18) by F. Azzaiolo impress by their vivid rhythm, while the songs (3) and (11) by P. Cambio stand out with their changes of rhythm.The song (1) by S. Lando has a sublime melodic line.The interpretation by Roberta Invernizzi and the Academia Strumentale Italiana is simply sublime.This CD (all texts are translated in English) is a must have for all lovers of Renaissance music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0LF9PDK4J1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085W6VVC#wasThisHelpful","R1X0LF9PDK4J1R","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sublime recital contains many highlights of the French chanson of the Renaissance with beautiful melodies, sensuous evocations, brilliant imitations and echo plays and true laments.ThemesThe themes are love, eating and drinking (10) combined with prayers (17, 18), nature (3 - bird songs), and the most important theme of all, peace (23).The songs about love are mostly laments, like `nothing but bitterness, spite and torment all their life for poor, weeping lovers' (20). But, there are also high praises for the loved one, like `my sweet pleasure, my sweet dove' (21) and, of course, of the delights of `physical love': `then I made her lovely body dance, the dance of the happy hop' (16) or more scabrously: `your behind shall serve as a trumpet' (5).HighlightsFor the songs about love, `So long as I am in my prime' (8) by C. de Sermisy and `Good day my heart' (21) by Lassus shine through their beautiful melodies.Sorrow drips from `It is nothing but bitterness' (20) by C. Le Jeune and from `Beautiful one, who holds my life' (15) by J. Tabourot.Suggestive rhythms and imitations evoke physical love in `Come now Perrette' (5) by C. Janequin, `God's truth' (16) by Vassal, `A young monk' (25) by Lassus and `Margot, tend the vines' (12) by J. Arcadelt.`The song of the birds' (3) by C. Janequin displays bright onomatopoeias of bird songs. C. Janequin's work was considered by J. Huizinga as a symptom of the `decline' (of the Middle Ages), while, in fact, it constitutes a return to nature from the spiritual (after)world of religion.`Beauteous are crystal' (23) by Lassus tops them all with its appealing melodic line and its all important message of `Beauteous peace alone adorns the world'.All the French texts are translated in English without any censoring, although popular trivialities are converted into a more `respectable' vocabulary.This eminent recital is sublimely sung by the Scholars of London. It is a must have for all lovers of classical music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AETPA5J4DIBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000013ZX#wasThisHelpful","R2AETPA5J4DIBW","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album is a compilation of Renaissance music magnificently sung by different choirs, but mostly by the Huelgas Ensemble under Paul Van Nevel.It contains music by well known composers (Josquin Desprez), but also by less known names (Costanzo Festa, Serafino Dall’Aquilano).Unfortunately, the producer committed a deadly sin by omitting to publish the texts of the songs in the accompanying comment. Fortunately, they can (more or less easily, with a translation) be found on the internet.HighlightsOf the instrumental pieces, the frottola by F. de Lurano (8) shines through its beautiful melody.Another frottola ‘Quando ritrovo la mia pastorella’ (When I meet my shepherdess) by C. Festa is also a melodic highlight, yet not a moral one: you can make love to me, but only for money.Other highlights are the pure melody in ‘Tu solus qui facis mirabilia’ (You alone can do wonders), the onomatopoeias in ‘El Grillo’ (the cricket) or the beautiful sound waves (imitations and echoes) in ‘Miserere mei, Deus’, all by Josquin Desprez.But, by far the best part of this CD is the astonishing canon for 36 voices ‘Deo Gratias’ by Johannes Ockeghem. This sublime short composition alone is well worth the very modest price of this album.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17XXTDRT7DFH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F8DSGA#wasThisHelpful","R17XXTDRT7DFH7","A12A08OL0TZY0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12A08OL0TZY0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a well-made, heavy duty cord.I am using it to feed power to my Level I EVSE for my electric vehicle.I feed 12 Amps through it 12 hours straight almost every night.  Never gets warm.  Plugs are good quality on both ends.  It lives outside all the time and I don't see it having any issues being outside.They tell you not to connect an EVSE to an extension cord because in order to do it safely, you have to have a specific, minimum gauge of wire in the cord AND you cannot exceed a maximum length.  Most people do not understand this, and if you do it wrong you can easily set your house on fire, damage the charger, etc. Rather than explain all that, they just say don't do it for liability reasons.

"I was looking at this for the dog area.  Like everybody else, I'm trying to get my dog to ""mark"" somewhere different than his favorite spot.  You can get plastic versions for less money, or something that is basically made out of real, heavy-duty pipe fittings for hundreds of dollars more.This ""in the middle"" product is fine for what it is.  It just has to look real from across the yard and survive the elements.  If you inspect it closely, you will find that the metal is not real thick and the welding is rough and not particularly well done.  You cannot notice any of that from a distance.  It looks completely genuine out in the yard.I did carefully clean it (it arrives kind of filthy), got some clear coat spray paint and put several coats of that on it before I installed it in the dog run.  I also dug a little hole a few inches deep where I wanted it to go and filled the hole under the base with gravel to promote drainage, then filled the entire inside of the hydrant with gravel to stabilize it and keep it from getting knocked over in the wind.  I assume the (likely cheap) paint would not survive the elements and the ""use"" by the dogs very long otherwise.I imagine that with those extra steps it should survive outside a few years before I'll have to repaint it.  I suspect that it would fall apart pretty rapidly if you allow the paint to start peeling.  There is not a lot of metal there to loose any to rust.So yes, it is relatively cheaply made in China and the quality isn't amazing, but it is good enough that you can make it work with a trivial amount of additional work.  It isn't going to fade and crack because it is made of plastic, so I think it was a good decision to spend a little more for a metal version.  If you don't want to maintain this, you could get a cheap plastic one and replace it when it inevitably falls apart.  But that seems unnecessarily wasteful to me.  I'd rather just buy this and paint it every few years to keep it looking good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2U7O0U7QPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CW2PT28#wasThisHelpful","RT2U7O0U7QPK","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product should be called ""Giant Volume Knob"" because that is what it really is.  The description is so vague I wasn't sure whether I was getting a foot pedal that you used to switch back and forth between headphones and speakers like a guitar foot pedal or something.  That isn't what you get.The thing is about the size of a hockey puck in person and you will want to find an accessible place for it on your desk.You plug your headphones into a jack on the side of the hockey puck.  Then the black cord connects to your speakers and the green one connects to your computer's speaker or headphone jack.The entire top of the hockey puck is one big, physical volume control knob.  You end up setting it up so full volume flows out of the computer, then you adjust the volume level you actually want using this big knob, which is way easier than hunting for the setting on your computer.  No more getting your eardrums blasted out when you accidentally put on headphones with the computer volume all the way up.There is a nice switch on the side of the hockey puck that toggles between outputting the sound to your headphones or the external speaker.  You never have to plug or unplug your headphones again.  Nor will you ever have to mess with your sound settings on the computer again - instead you now have this awesome, big honking physical knob on your desk.Since constantly unplugging and plugging in your headphones puts wear on them, it probably means your headphones will last a little longer, or at least they will ultimately fail in some other way.The instructions are so bad you might as well not even look at them.  Fortunately, I just told you everything you need to know to set it up correctly.The product itself seems sturdy and well-made.  It doesn't feel like it is going to go skating around your desk or fall apart immediately.I am glad I spent a little more to get this vs. some of the cheaper options out there.  Once you realize that you are going to be using the knob and the switch constantly, you will be glad you got something that is pretty solid and seems well put together.I didn't really get that I was getting something that both controlled the volume and allowed me to keep everything plugged in constantly.  It is a big upgrade over awkwardly plugging things in and unplugging them constantly.  Assuming it holds up, it was well worth what I paid for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19NZ5W6K8DAN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TMTW6JI#wasThisHelpful","R19NZ5W6K8DAN2","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a lot of sketchy USB power packs out there.  This isn't one of them.It is a quality product that is solidly put together and works well.  I recently used it on an extended camping trip and it kept all of our phones and such powered up without any issues.  There are LED status indicators letting you know how much capacity is left and it even has a convenience flashlight built into it that would probably last weeks.If you are trying to figure out what size to get, here is a little help.  You can get little tiny chargers that are barely larger than a lipstick and basically have enough zip to maybe charge your phone once before they die.  Most of them only charge at the slower 1.0 Amp speed.  You can move up from there to chargers that are about as big as a deck of cards.  Some of them will charge at the higher rate that iPads and many modern phones prefer and some of them have enough zip to power up your iPad once or your phone a couple of times before they die.This is a significant step up from those smaller sizes, without an enormous increase in size and weight. Now you are looking at something that can recharge an iPad more than once or a typical, modern smart phone numerous times before it gives out.That said, this 16,000mAh size is just about as big a portable USB charger as you would want to actually carry anywhere.  It is small enough that it could live in your carry-on luggage without weighing you down too much.  It is a bit much for hiking unless you are going on a multi-day trip and really really need this much juice.The sweet spot for something this size is extended power outages, international travel in situations where you don't trust the local grid or there isn't one, etc.  It is not something you would want to carry around every day in places with a reliable grid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BL5R5KIBIUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2T7U90#wasThisHelpful","R38BL5R5KIBIUE","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That is annoying in a very quiet space, but not noticeable otherwise.So this is a fairly marginal desk fan that gets buy in like an office situation where you already have A/C and all you want is just a little air movement.  But even in an untaxing environment like that, it just gets by.If you are seriously hot or expecting this to do something useful somewhere where there is no A/C and you really want a stiff breeze - keep looking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSVC3HJ28HNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQPO6ZK#wasThisHelpful","RLSVC3HJ28HNQ","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had this cooler for a couple of years now and been very happy w/it.  It just came back from a 5 night camping trip.  We started out with 12 of those little bags of ice you get at the store and the cooler was full of food/drinks etc. on top of all that ice.At the end of the trip with temps in the 70s all week, there was still some ice left and the milk was still good.  I imagine in blazing heat or direct sun it would still survive a few days, although probably not 5-6.The only downside is the size and shape.  It is a good bit taller than the usual size/shape and so it may not fit in the trunk of your car.  I have a full-size pick up truck with a cover.  I can't put this in the bed with the cover closed - it sticks up too high.  If you are putting it in an SUV it will probably work, or if you want to put it in the back seat it will likely work, but it will not fit everywhere because it is so tall.  So take the dimensions and measure where you want to put it before you buy it to make sure it will fit.Minor downside is that the drain isn't completely flush with the bottom and so it is almost impossible to get 100% of the water out while it is full of stuff.Mine has held up pretty well and has been used a lot.  I am actually on here trying to find this same cooler in a lower profile design for my truck, that is how much I like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAY9I93PK0ZXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F6UJ5K#wasThisHelpful","RAY9I93PK0ZXO","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a well-made flashlight that throws an absurdly bright light at its highest levels while also using regular, AA batteries.The benefit of this flashlight is that now you don't have to fool around with expensive lithium cells or powerful but slightly dangerous rechargeable batteries in order to get a flashlight that is powerful enough for almost any real need with this.  It throws a nice wide pattern and on high it feels like it is lighting up the whole woods in front of you.I wouldn't hike with it - it weighs too much.  But for walking the dogs in a rural area after dark, where you want to be able to reach out and see whether that rustle in the woods is just a deer or is actually a bear or Sasquatch, it will definitely do the job.I went with the natural light version just because I hate that stark, unnatural looking ""cool light"".  It definitely does make colors look normal and more natural than some of my ""cool light"" flashlights.  If you are worried about the fact that you'll lose a few lumens over the other version, trust me, you won't miss them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJW7MUOZVISK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFBS4EW#wasThisHelpful","RHJW7MUOZVISK","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cleverly designed candle lantern.  The candles sit in little retaining cylinders with springs underneath them, so as the candle melts, the flame stays in exactly the same, ideal spot.  The flame is protected by glass so it works even in moderate wind and the three candles are apparently powerful enough together that you could eventually boil water by placing a container on the flat metal top of the lantern (although I have never tried that).  But while this design is clever, it is running on a technology that would be perfectly familiar to Benjamin Franklin.In today's modern world, is something that runs on candles practical?  Not really.  You can get an LED lantern that is smaller, lighter, more durable, gets much brighter, doesn't use expensive candles, and has no fire hazard associated with it.But I just returned from a five day car camping trip, and I barely used my big LED lantern, while this thing got lit every single night.The LED lantern got relegated to helping me do dishes or other task-based duty where I needed a lot of light.  But then it got switched off almost immediately in favor of this lantern, which ran from dark until bedtime.The harsh ""cool"" white light from a modern LED lantern just cannot compare with the pleasant, warm, soothing glow of this lantern.  I used this in conjunction with a few of the smaller UCO tea light lanterns and it made my campsite such a pleasant place after dark.  Hiking around the larger campground after dark, I saw LED lantern after LED lantern, and there was really no comparison in how much nicer my campsite was than those who had fallen for the latest technology.You go camping because you want to enjoy yourself.  This is a small luxury item with an absolutely huge payoff in ambiance.  This is one of the best things I bought for the most recent trip, and it is definitely coming with me on future adventures.Yes, you could also use it as an emergency light source, provided you put up enough of the relatively expensive, special candles it takes.  But it is probably not the most cost-effective way to handle that situation.  If you are just looking for a utilitarian light, buy an LED lantern and some extra batteries for it.  This is a lantern to use when you want more than just lumens out of your light source.  In that role, it absolutely excels.I would definitely buy the little protective neoprene sleeve for it.  Even then, it should be handled carefully.  The candles last a good long time, but buy them in bulk, they are much cheaper that way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DMQAEYR5I681/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F7B2AU#wasThisHelpful","R3DMQAEYR5I681","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the ""GI water bottle"" size, now made in sturdy plastic.  When you handle these, you realize that the government spent some time thinking about the ideal size/shape for a water bottle.  These are easy to handle, easy to fill, easy to drink from and can be tucked into the side of your pack or carried on your hip with an appropriate carrier, etc.The only thing wrong with them is the same thing wrong with all of these water bottles - they weigh a lot in comparison to the cheap, disposable water bottles that can be had for a fraction of the price and are durable enough to last through many many refillings.You also have to be careful about maintaining them - which basically means keeping the cap off when they are empty, so mildew etc. can't form on the inside which would then be hard to clean because of the narrow opening.

"I used these on a 5 day camping trip, in situations where the ambient humidity was often 90% or more.  Unlike my small microfiber towel I was using as a washcloth that I could never get dry, these things were dry EVERY MORNING.  Even when it rained the night before and they had been soaked by rain and only had a few hours of dry weather to dry out, they were dry enough to use comfortably at 6AM.When you get them, the fabric feels kind of weird, like it won't be absorbent enough.  But in practice it works just like a regular towel would.  They didn't get smelly after five days either.These weigh so little you can even carry a nice big, bath towel sized one with you without any meaningful weight penalty.  I also keep a smaller one in my day pack just for wiping off sweat etc. because the weight penalty is so trivial there is really no reason not to have a towel along.Sometimes you buy stuff on Amazon based on the glowing reviews and it turns out that the hype was BS.  This isn't one of those things.  If you are looking for a camping/hiking towel, just stop looking and buy these.

"I bought this for camping and hiking.  At first I really liked it.  It is not overwhelmingly huge like a lot of the G-shock watches and has a lot of nice features.  I particularly liked the barometric pressure trend graph.  When you are out hiking with no cell service to check the weather forecast, this will give you a hint as to the likely weather for the next few hours at least.Unfortunately, it did not fully survive its first, short camping trip.  The inside of the glass fogged, showing that the waterproof seal has failed.  The watch still works, but a sports/outdoors watch that is not waterproof is essentially useless.  At this point, you have to take it off if you want to wash your hands with it.  So much for 100 ft water-resistance.To be clear, this went on a few moderate day hikes and was never abused or subjected to any rough treatment.  It hasn't even picked up any scratches yet it is still so new.  The waterproof seal died with less than 30 days worth of time on my wrist.The motto of Spovan, the company that makes this watch is ""To Be Great"".  That motto is accurate, although not in the way they probably intended.  It could be great in the future, but it sure isn't now.So do yourself a favor - if you are thinking about trying to get a knock-off G-Shock watch to save a little money instead of a real one, learn from my bad experience and just suck it up and buy a watch from a manufacturer with an established reputation that knows what they are doing.  For this watch to fail after such a short time is inexcusable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BUXXODZZ1XEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMQJ3G#wasThisHelpful","R2BUXXODZZ1XEQ","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It took over a month, but the taste issue has finally receded to the point I can use it.  So do not buy this unless you can put in the time/effort required to get the nasty taste out of it.

"A flat, clean surface for preparing food, eating, etc. is not exactly something you find in nature very often.  While obviously an unnecessary luxury, it doesn't add a horrible amount of weight to your pack.  After dinner, it even goes into my tent at night as a mini bedside table for my glasses, book, flashlight, etc. (except in bear country).It is very nicely finished and very solid when you put it together.  There is no flex in it - it really is rock solid.Think of it like a TV tray that can be dissembled - that is about the size it has when it is together.  It definitely makes eating in the back country a little more comfortable.Two things I really don't like:(1) there is lettering on the top of the table and a QC look up code.  Both are permanently attached to the table - you cannot remove them.  That is ugly and really mars the otherwise pretty brushed blue metal finish. That is something I would care a lot more about if this wasn't just a piece of outdoor gear.  As it is, I can live with it.(2) the ends of the little feet that hook into the table are sharp and it takes some effort to assemble/disassemble the table.  So you have to be careful every time you take it apart or put it together not to scratch yourself.  You also have to be kind of careful putting it back into the little storage sack it comes with to make sure you don't rip the sack or scratch the table.  The design would be better if there were rubber caps covering the bare metal of the ends that clip into the table.  Once it is assembled, the sharp parts are hidden and it works great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKFNG4M5OMV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNMF49O#wasThisHelpful","RCKFNG4M5OMV6","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like it - the quality seems excellent.  The compression sack it comes with is high quality and it compresses down to a very small size.  It is fairly thin and fairly light, but does have decent heat retention.It is not some miracle however.  Think more like the performance of a single, heavy wool blanket without anywhere near the weight of one.It claims it would keep you comfortable down to 45F.  That is bunk - at least if you are sleeping in a t-shirt and boxers.  Think more like 55F if it is the only thing you are using to stay warm at night and you aren't wearing heavier clothes.So I think this is either (1) something you use by itself in the summer, letting you save a lot of weight vs. a traditional bag; or (2) in conjunction with a lighter weight summer bag to stretch that bag's performance into the shoulder seasons.I'm 6'4"" and I wish it was a few inches longer.  It basically just covers me on the long side with no slack.You should probably not store it long-term in the compression sack, and there is no larger bag included with it.For what it cost, it was a good purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RT3BG2B69W0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJFOAZK#wasThisHelpful","R2RT3BG2B69W0L","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I spent a while looking at the various choices for one of these heat reflective blankets.  What I wanted it for was for camping in cooler weather, to reflect heat back up from underneath me without having to drop big bucks on a big, heavy, zero degree sleeping bag.So that means I wanted it to be lightweight, tough-enough to hold up, and most importantly QUIET.  The little Mylar emergency blankets rattle horribly and those blue plastic tarps aren't much better.  Why I picked this one over some of the cheaper alternatives is that the backing isn't basically that same plastic material they make blue tarps out of.  Instead it is fabric.It isn't completely silent, but it definitely doesn't crinkle and crackle so much when you lay on it that it will make you insane.  The weight is also pretty decent - the tarp outside of the package weighs 320 grams on my scale.  It also packs down to a fairly small size pretty easily.  As for durability, time will tell on that.  It isn't super thick and so if you don't care at all about it making noise, maybe you'd be better off with one of those versions made out of the blue tarp material, but for what it is, it seems to be pretty well made.  I think it should work well for my planned use and it is big enough to not only go under my sleeping pad but basically become a kind of floor across a good chunk of my tent.  Definitely room for both my sleeping bag and gear to sit on it - protecting the tent floor.  Although the fabric is folded over at the corners to give double thickness at the grommets, I would probably not use this to make a shelter with unless it was a true emergency - it really is more of a blanket than a tarp.I can't comment on colder weather performance yet (it is June when I am writing this).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJIDF512R9MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00069PDYI#wasThisHelpful","RTJIDF512R9MO","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works as expected.  It powers my camera just fine.  However, when you try to shoot video with it - it introduces unacceptable levels of hum into the audio.  For still work it would be fine.  However, it is not great for video, which is the primary thing I bought it for.I will keep it because I also use this camera for astrophotography and it should be fine for that as well.But the only way you can use this for video is if you are capturing audio externally or adding it in post, etc.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30OHXWUM9Q75E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K5HGBA#wasThisHelpful","R30OHXWUM9Q75E","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can go buy a $20 compass or you can spend a bit more and get this.  You should spend more.This thing is very cool.  It is very accurate, dampens quickly and lets you shoot accurate bearings very quickly once you get the hang of how to use it.  Yes, it isn't the lightest compass out there, but that is because it is built like a tank.  The whole thing is just extremely high quality.  Given that I am just a hiker and backpacker - I expect it will last me the rest of my life, easily.  Given what a vital piece of kit a compass is - I am perfectly ok with the weight/size/quality trade-off.I agree with the other reviewers that there is really no need to spend more for tritium.  If you are thinking this will work like the luminescent hands of your wristwatch - glow very dimly for a few minutes and then go out, you are in for a nice surprise.I hit it with nothing more powerful than a hiking headlamp at close range for a few seconds.  It glowed so brightly you could read the entire dial.  It stayed that way for several minutes.  Eventually the glow lowered down so you can only see the glowing bits - but that includes everything you need to use the compass, including being able to read bearing numbers off the dial and even shoot new bearings.  It stays like that for 20-30 minutes at least.  And that is after just a few seconds of light.I also checked it using the red LEDs on the headlamp.  They will not make the compass light up like a Christmas tree the way a strong white light will, but you can even charge the glowing bits with a red LED to avoid ruining your dark adaption.I can understand why the military would need a tritium one - it means you can use the compass without showing any light at all.  But I am struggling to imagine any realistic civilian situation where this one wouldn't work at least as well.  So I think you can get this safely and save the extra cost of the tritium one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YFND98HW6FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016SRA4Y#wasThisHelpful","R21YFND98HW6FH","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good set of silicone pot holders.  They are a bright, cheerful orange in person.They are not hard to wash off or clean.  The design has a lot of texture to help improve grip, but it does not result in a bunch of nooks and crannies that are hard to keep clean.  They are a nice upgrade from cloth pot holders that need to go into the clothes washer if you spill anything on them.They do a good job at not transmitting heat, even though they aren't super thick.  They flex easily so they go around pot handles easily.  They have a good grip, so you can use them as small trivets and the pot won't slide around on top of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O64OXQBC6C6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OC3WKRM#wasThisHelpful","R1O64OXQBC6C6D","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice camp knife.  It is light enough to take backpacking, comes already very sharp and has a good, comfortable handle.  The blade is big enough to be useful for a lot of tasks, without adding a lot of weight.The fire starter in the handle works just fine.  There is a nice edge on the back of the knife designed to work with the fire steel and so it throws a considerable shower of sparks.  I've used it to light fires, light my cookstove, etc.  It twist-locks into the handle securely.  You aren't going to lose the fire starter because it fell out of the handle.Mora knives are high quality and this is no exception.  It is stainless steel so maintenance is a bit easier than with a carbon steel knife.The sheath locks the knife in securely, and I like that it is bright orange so it is unlikely to get lost in the woods or down inside your pack.I don't like that the sheath isn't reversible - I'm a lefty and so if I wanted to wear this knife, it would either be backwards or on the wrong side.  A minor inconvenience for a utility knife like this.I see this as an inexpensive, high quality companion knife to a larger blade, saw or axe if I have to do more serious work like batoning wood, chopping, etc. while out in the woods.  Although I suppose it could be pressed into that role in an emergency, the blade isn't that long and it really isn't designed for that kind of work.  It is more the knife you use for cutting paracord, light wood working, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NBSPRIUU6YQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EUXHS6#wasThisHelpful","R1NBSPRIUU6YQC","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"See my reviews of the other two Arkansas stones in this system (Soft Arkansas and Hard Arkansas) for a more detailed review of the entire thing.This is the last of the three stones.  The stone feels almost mirror smooth when you run your finger over it.  That is how fine the grit is.  You bring knives that are already pretty close to done to this stone as the last step.Here is where the scary sharp edge that will cut paper like butter gets laid down.This is the most expensive stone, but also the most important one.  If you are going to go to the effort of free-hand sharpening a knife with stones and honing oil, spend 15-20 minutes or more working on just one knife, the thing ought to come out as sharp as a razor.  Almost any sharpening system can get a blade reasonably sharp.  You are making the extra effort to get to something even better.This is the stone that gets you there.What it does for your knives is just amazing.  The first time I used these stones, I wanted to practice my technique with a junky old kitchen knife that was dull as anything and basically worthless.  I managed to get it decently sharp with the other two stones - sharp enough that no one would have considered it dull.  I could have left it that way and used it and it would have worked just fine.But instead I gave it a few minutes on this stone.  It is now the sharpest knife in my house, by a wide margin.  The boost this gives to the final edge is really quite amazing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLARCQ87MKQ8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J3TK6U#wasThisHelpful","RLARCQ87MKQ8D","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I discuss the entire system of these three stones in the first review (see ""Soft Arkansas"" by the same company).The bottom line is that I am very impressed with how well these three stones work.Some people say you can get the Soft Arkansas, skip the Hard Arkansas and go straight to the Black Arkansas.I guess that depends on how much you value your time versus your money.  I do think that the Hard Arkansas has value, because it means you'll spend less time on the Black Arkansas stone because you've used this intermediate grit.  It is also where I would start with a knife that was already in ok shape.If this stone cost as much as the Black Arkansas, I'd probably agree with the folks who only use two stones and just recognize I'll need more time for each knife.  But given that this isn't nearly as expensive, it is a nice time saver.  It is the one you can omit if you have to, but I wouldn't.After all, these are things you buy once, take good care of, and pass on to your kids.  They should last effectively forever if properly handled and oiled.Could you just use the Soft and Hard Arkansas stones and skip the final, extra fine step?  Yes, in theory you could.  But your knife is only going to be acceptably sharp after you use this. It isn't going to be dull enough that it is hard to work with or unsafe, but you aren't going to get that amazing, razor sharp edge that comes from careful, free-handed sharpening if you stop at this grit.The Black Arkansas is where the really amazing edge gets laid down.  That is why this is the least important of the three stones in the system.  It is still worth having, but the one place to cut if you just can't swing all three stones right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPA32LU11DMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J3NN6S#wasThisHelpful","RPA32LU11DMV","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had heard about how good Arkansas stones are - but had never tried them before.  I finally took the plunge and bought the full set of these.  The whole set is expensive, but I think these are totally worth it for anybody who wants a really high-quality edge.  I am very pleased with my purchase.This ""Soft Arkansas"" is the first or most coarse stone in the series.The order in terms of grit goes:SoftHardBlack SurgicalI don't know the precise grit equivalent for each stone, but here is where I'd rank the Soft Arkansas: it is where you start when your knife is pretty dull but still has an intact edge.  If the edge has rolled or is otherwise damaged, even this first stone is fine enough that it will take you a while to set it right.  You could do it, but it would take a while.  I'd use a coarser, diamond stone to clean up serious damage, then start with this once the worst of the damage was put right.  This stone is more for fixing an intact edge, not really for setting a new one.It takes a small bit of skill - but honestly, it isn't all that complicated a system to use if you have reasonable mechanical skills.  Just go on YouTube if you want to learn the technique and have never sharpened free-hand before.  All you really do is set the appropriate angle with your hand and then draw the blade across the stone, alternating strokes on each side of the blade.  You don't really have to worry about whether your angle is 23.5 degrees or 24 degrees, you just have to get close to your desired angle and be able to repeatedly hold the knife that same way with each stroke.  That is really all there is to it.Eventually, you will feel that the resistance of the blade lessens ever so slightly on each side - that is when you check the edge and maybe move up to the finer grain stone.  Repeat that process with the hard Arkansas and Black Arkansas and you will have yourself a razor sharp edge that can slice paper easily.Having never used the system before, I dug into the back of my kitchen drawer and found the most bedraggled, beat-up, ugly old kitchen knife.  Something that I wouldn't really care about ruining.  That old piece of junk is now easily the sharpest knife in my house, by a wide margin.While the results are outstanding, you do have to embrace the craft aspect of this.  I actually find sharpening knives with these stones to be very relaxing and zen like.  It takes a while, but that just makes the result seem all that more worthwhile.  If you expect to go from butter knife to scary sharp in 2 minutes, this is not for you.  If you are patient, these do an AMAZING job on your knives, but they require some time.You do need honing oil to use these stones.  You wet the stone with honing oil, then use honing oil again to clean the stone after you finish with it.The stone is large enough that it can be used with larger blades.  I even sharpened a machete with this stone, just to see if it could be done.The little wooden case is simple, but perfect to hold the stone in while you are working and keep it protected in storage.  It was also very well packaged when it arrived - these things are expensive and they are very careful to do everything they can to make sure it isn't broken in shipping.The only limitation in using Arkansas stones that I'm aware of is super high-end Japanese knives.  Some of those super-high end Japanese knives are so incredibly hard that they can't be sharpened on these stones.  I guess those need either diamond sharpening or Japanese wet stones, but that is a whole other level in cost and complexity.  These stones will serve you for basically every other kind of smooth edge you'll encounter - carbon steel, stainless steel, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBFBF7QFKYRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J3POSS#wasThisHelpful","REBFBF7QFKYRB","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In person, this is a pleasant, earthy brown color.  It works fine as either a large pot-holder or a small trivet.The material is very flexible, not hard or rigid at all.  So it can wrap around the handle of a pot with no problem.  As a trivet, it will work better than a regular pot holder both because it is large, and because the design sits very solidly on the table - it isn't slippery or going to move on you once you put it down.  Nor does the hot pot want to slide around on top of it.  The material has just enough grip to work well.We just started using these newer, silicone pot holders.  Honestly, once you have tried these, you will want to retire all your existing, fabric pot holders.  Why do you want a pot holder that needs to go into the clothes washer if you spill food on it?  With these newer materials, you can just wipe any spills off with a sponge, and the thing is good as new.  They protect against heat at least as well as the cloth ones and they are just easier to use.This is a handy little thing, I don't regret buying it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14X0GZ6XUWY9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXHVPRM#wasThisHelpful","R14X0GZ6XUWY9E","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice, long 30 pin apple cable.  The cable itself is solid and well-made and it is long enough that you can actually use your iPad while it is being charged up.  I find that it will come out of the charging port on the iPad occasionally when you are holding the tablet horizontally and watching movies on it.  I don't think this is a flaw with the cable, more just that the 30 pin connector is designed to release easily when pulled, and it is very easy to do this when moving around with the tablet in your hands, plugged in.

For a recent model iPhone, it charges them fast, too.But if you are only traveling with your phone, I would take the regular little iPhone charger and leave this at home.

"This is a cool little thing.  It seems to work reasonably well as long as you understand the inherent limits in this technology.All of these things measure the temperature of your forehead, and then extrapolate a likely internal body temp. from that reading using a simple algorithm.  That is never going to be as accurate as directly measuring the temperature using a traditional thermometer.This unit tries to compensate for the limitations in the process by taking a whole lot of individual measurements in a fraction of a second and then averaging them out.  What it then displays is the average of these multiple readings.  In theory, that should make the readings more repeatable by minimizing the impact of a single bad reading.In practice, this will normally tell you what you really need to know at home.  Does the patient have a temperature or not?  If the patient does have a temperature, is it getting worse or better?  That basic monitoring is what this is good for.  If you expect it to be dead on, within less than a tenth of a degree of the patient's actual temperature - you are going to be disappointed.Nobody should be under any illusion that this will completely replace your need for a traditional thermometer.  It seems to read within maybe .3  a degree of my traditional thermometer most of the time.  It largely is repeatable - it doesn't come up with the exact number every time, but it is fairly close.  But every now and again it seems a bit off - maybe you aren't aiming it correctly, the forehead is really sweaty and wet, etc.  So, if you point this at your child and it says they have a 106 fever, you need to go get a regular thermometer and confirm that rather extraordinary reading before running off to the hospital.  Similarly, if the patient is obviously feverish and you get a weird reading saying it is below normal, dry their forehead and try again.  You should never just blindly trust this - it is a useful, convenient data point that works well when you are monitoring temperature constantly, particularly with a sleeping, sick child.  If you use common sense and understand the limitations of the technology, this is a nice thing to own.  But it is not magic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Z00H31IWHGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O3H615E#wasThisHelpful","R38Z00H31IWHGL","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't used this a lot,  but it has been working fine for me so far.It is a reasonable trade-off in terms of the size/capacity issue.  You can get a huge power pack with a huge battery that will give more charges than this, but then you have to carry that around.  Or you can have something much smaller that can't really fully charge your phone from zero but might give you a few more hours.  This is sort of in the middle between those two choices.  It has enough battery capacity that it should about fully charge a iPhone 6plus from zero, so it will give you a considerable amount of additional run time without being too huge.I gave it to my wife who is constantly forgetting to charge her phone.  Now she has a full charge in her purse without carrying a brick around.  It is good for that kind of application - stick it in purse, a briefcase or something like that.  It is a little bulky to go in your pocket regularly, more like something you can add to a bag without weighing it down much.  It could be a backpacker reserve power supply just because it has a nice amount of power without being too enormous.There is no real indication of how much zip it has left - just a light that turns red when it is charging, green when it is fully charged.  So basically, you use it - you should charge it.

"This works fine and has reasonably good range between the sender/receiver.  The sender has a screen showing the temp & humidity too, so if you put it on a porch or something, you get an extra outdoor thermometer/hygrometer.  The display is big enough that you can read the large numbers for current temp and humidity across the room.I am, ultimately, not a huge fan of the display design.  Basically, you get a lot of data for each station - current temp, daily low and high (or - if you want- an all time low and high), and the same current, low and high information for humidity.There is no way to make the humidity display into a second temp. temp display for the outdoor station.  So that means you have one of two choices to see the info.  A manual mode where you actually have to press a button to move from station to station, or a cycle mode where it constantly cycles the display between all active stations and the home station every few seconds.It turns out that the constant, automatic cycling of the numbers between inside and outside makes the display a bit distracting.  I would not put this on my desk in my direct line of sight while in that mode, for example.  If you just want a static display of indoor and outdoor temp, this is not for you.  If you can put it somewhere where the cycling of the numbers isn't annoying, you'll get a lot more information out of this unit despite its relatively small size.  So that is the trade-off with this unit.For me, it is fine, I put it where I wouldn't have to look at it constantly and could just consult it whenever I wanted to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSXAARDT43JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW369VK#wasThisHelpful","R1DSXAARDT43JI","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATED:  The review below is of the original item I purchased.  Sling, in its infinite wisdom, has decided to materially change the terms of our prior deal.  They are now installing mandatory adware on the viewing software.  So you pay once for the hardware, and now, all of a sudden, if you want to actually use it - you have to put up with display advertising.  This was never disclosed to buyers at the time of purchase, and they installed this adware onto my computer as a supposed routine ""software update"" to the player software. I already paid the full retail price for a version that didn't require ad-support.So basically, this is like when you get a free game for your phone then pay extra to get the ads removed, only in reverse.  I already bought the ad-free version at full price, but now I get bombarded with display ads every time I want to use the product they sold me.  Guess how excited I am about that?  Excited enough to bother to come here and warn anybody thinking about buying this device to just steer clear of it.Basically, this is a disreputable, corner-cutting company with no respect for its customers or the most rudimentary sense of business ethics.  It is too bad, this was a good product, the company is just managed by rapacious scum-bags.UPDATED AGAIN:  I have learned to open the player and then minimize it while the pre-roll ad plays to no one.  Then flip it to full screen.  Just forget about the mode it used to offer, to play in a corner while you worked or surfed the web.  But the player is so badly coded that at least half the time, the pre-roll ad crashes it or keeps my Slingbox from connecting properly.  So I cannot NOT RECOMMEND this product strongly enough.  The sooner the people who run it go out of business, the better.  Maybe some competent people will buy the assets out of bankruptcy, but that is about the only scenario where you should put down your hard earned money for this product.  I paid well over $100 for this, and wouldn't pay $25 for it now.-----I had the original Slingbox, the gray one shaped like an over-sized Kit-Kat bar.  I loved it - it turned every computer in the house into another TV and also beamed my cable out to my little cabin in the mountains that otherwise would have had no TV at all.  The power supply died on my original Slingbox eventually, then the replacement power supply died again a few years later, so I finally decided to upgrade to this thing.There are plenty of resources out there about how a Slingbox works and what it does already.  This is a review for people already basically familiar with the idea and just trying to figure out whether this new model would work for them.Upsides:  Within my home network, using current generation devices and a high quality, modern wi-fi router (apple), I get an excellent, full HD picture on both my Apple and Windows 7 or newer devices.  The remote responds quite quickly and it is really does turn your computer into an entirely viable, second HDTV.It also works well over wifi on my phone, using the extra-cost software.  Again, inside the network in my house, the picture is perfect.It uses the component cables, avoiding the nonsense that sometimes occurs with an HDMI signal coming out of a cable box. The picture it makes using component cables is fine and so this is definitely the superior way to go.Outside my network - the quality varies.  And I have FiOS internet, which gives me 50mps upload speed, about the best upload speed you can get outside of Google fiber.  On my phone with AT&T LTE, it has a pretty good picture.  On my DSL line running about 1.5 Mps out in my rural cabin, it is only marginally better than the SD signal pumped out by my old, Kit-Kat Slingbox.  I would go so far as to say that if you aren't expecting 3-5Mps both from your transmitting location and your receiving location, you are probably no better off with this vs. the original, gray slingbox you can still buy on Ebay.  If you want to watch in HD, you need the bandwidth at both the transmitting and receiving location to handle that.  This does seem to be a little bit more efficient in encoding video than the older box, but it is not going to work miracles. Also, understand that it will chew up your limited data plan mighty fast if you hope to use it over your phone.  It is really a wi-fi only thing except in limited circumstances.Downsides:(1) Compatibility with older stuff is non-existent.  It will not work at all with my Slingcatcher, or my old Apple laptop that ran just fine with the Kit-Kat Original Slingbox.  It uses new and different software that must authenticate the Slingbox over the web.  Carefully check the operating system requirements etc. because if everything isn't fairly new, it may very well not work with this new Slingbox.  That is kind of disappointing - one of the advantages of my older Slingbox is that it worked universally everywhere - old computer, new computer, all of them could be made to function as a spare TV.  This new one, not so much.(2) The Roku compatibility is kind of a joke.  It isn't a true client.  Instead, you use your cell phone or tablet to suck down the signal and then forward it on to the Roku.  You use the cell phone/tablet to control the remote source because the Roku remote is too simple to really control a cable box.  The whole thing is kind of klutzy and inadequate.  Do not buy this expecting that it will deliver a great, seamless experience to your bedroom HDTV through the Roku.  It does work, but it is far from awesome.(3) The company that sells these things is pretty shameless about ripping you off.  First, they charge you for the box, then they charge you extra for the cell phone software, and even more if you want to put it on your tablet vs. your phone.  The only free software is for computers - everything else is a stiff, additional charge.  I think it is like $20 for the iPhone software and another $20 for the iPad or something along those lines - same for Android.  So add $40 or whatever the price is for your mobile device(s) software and then decide if you still want to buy this thing.  They know a lot of people aren't going to factor in the cost of mobile device software when buying this - they will assume that all the software you need to use the device is included with it.  Most people won't read the fine print.  It is borderline deceptive how they sell some of the enabling software as an extra-cost add on.  So buy this with your eyes open as to the total cost.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FZXU49RBPYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIP10KK#wasThisHelpful","R30FZXU49RBPYC","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This performs basically the same way every other oil-filled electric radiator does.  A resistance element heats the oil in the radiator, which then heats the room.  Just like a traditional radiator - there is no fan, so it makes almost no noise in operation.  It also has the advantage that the heat level stays quite even over time.  Because everything is contained within the metal of the radiator and the radiator itself never gets dangerously hot, it is a very safe form of heat - it is pretty much the only kind of electric heater you can safely run while asleep, while not in the room, etc.  The downside is the same as every other oil-filled heater - it takes a while for a radiator like this to heat up a room.  No fan means it relies on natural convection currents to heat the air.The advantage this particular unit has is that there is an electronic timer built into it.  So you can set two different times for it come on and off per day.  We use this in the bathroom, so it comes on in the AM long before we get up, and clicks off before we go off to work.  Then again at night it runs a little bit so it is pleasant in there when you are brushing your teeth before bed.  It isn't on when it isn't needed, you don't come into a cold bathroom in the morning, you won't forget to turn it off, etc.If it loses power or you want to wheel it between rooms, the program settings stay in memory for ten minutes.  It comes with a quality cord and plug - always something you want to be mindful of with an electric heater.  I felt it after the unit had been running flat out for well over an hour and the cord was still absolutely cool to the touch.There are little colored, LED lights to let you know what is going on with it - a light showing it is powered, that the heat is on, and that the timer is on.Below the lights is a very small, basic LCD screen that you use to set the timer and clock.  The screen is not back-lit and the symbols etc. on it are quite small.  So setting this thing isn't particularly fun - think setting an old-school VCR with a tiny display at an angle that isn't terribly convenient.  You basically have to squat or kneel down in front of it, or do it while sitting in a chair - you can't see the screen from any other angle.  You need to set the time of day, then the start time and stop time for when you want it to go on and off.We did have to program it once or twice, tuning it to come on early enough to make the bathroom warm at the desired time, then we haven't had to touch it in weeks.  It just works quietly in the background and you can forget about it.You can get a cheaper model without the timer, or you can get one with a mechanical timer that is likely easier to set, but is probably not going to last as long as this one.  In my experience, whenever you buy mechanical timer for lights or appliances, the mechanism almost always wears out in a few years.  The cheap little motor that drives the gears dies or the cheap plastic gears break, etc.  On the other hand, this one is digital, and so it shouldn't suffer from the same kind of wear that seems to inevitably kill a mechanical timer.This is good for somebody with a regular schedule who wants the heat on every day at the same time.  It is probably too much hassle for somebody who would have to constantly reprogram the start and stop times to fit changes in their schedule.  You can turn the timer on and off easily - there are big buttons for that - so you could have it run automatically during the week and then turn it off so it doesn't run during the weekends, or while you are away, etc.  We do that all the time with no problem.  But if you want to change the start and stop times - that is like programming a VCR and so you are just not going to want to do that very often.Overall - I like it.  It does exactly what I wanted it to do and has performed flawlessly since we got it.  The only thing I don't like is setting the start-stop times and the clock.  The cheap little basic LCD screen with no back light seems like a throw-back technology that wouldn't be out of place 20 years ago.  I can see that as a way to keep the price down, but this isn't exactly a cheap heater.  For what it cost, it probably should have a nicer, easier to use programming screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AISMZFW3PBU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BZFQB8#wasThisHelpful","R1AISMZFW3PBU7","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is huge, but it seems to work well.  I am using it to maintain the settings etc. on two hydroponic vegetable gardens in the face of our frequent power outages.  It will run a 160 watt load for well over a half hour according to the display.  That gives me plenty of time to get the lights unhooked, and with those off it should maintain the settings and run the little circulator pump for hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR80IN28W3QHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083TXNMM#wasThisHelpful","RR80IN28W3QHB","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a case for outdoor stuff - hiking in the backwoods, skiing, and occasionally out on the dive boat for scuba.  Something you could use safely even in questionable weather.  There were no reviews on this thing, but I gambled and ordered it.I am obviously not going to test whether the thing is waterproof by throwing my brand new phone in a bucket of water, but it looks promising.  They even include a special adapter that you can screw into the headphone jack that has an o-ring on it.  So you can use headphones while keeping the moisture seal in place.  Or you just have a gasket that keeps everything closed up.  If you are looking for protection from rain, snow, etc. it should be just fine assuming you put the phone in it correctly (discussed below).The fingerprint ID thing does work through the seal, and you can access the touchscreen just fine through the clear film on the face of the case.  It even has a little flip up stand so you can watch movies or whatever on it.  The sound is also fine, you can hear it through the case.  I even took some flash pictures with it just to test it out and they look fine.There is a somewhat hard rubber ring that goes all the way around the outside. That provides both the seal and the cushion on the edges  It isn't real thick and probably provides ok protection against drops, but I am sure a bigger, more bulky case would provide additional drop protection.  But then you'd have a huge case - a major disadvantage given how big the iPhone 6 plus already is.It does have a nice amount of material above the screen all the way around, so if you lay the phone screen down on even rough surfaces, the screen is well-protected.Downsides:  Nothing major.  It is a little hard to get the phone in and out of it.  There is a little indent on one corner that you can stick a coin or key in to pry the two halves of the case apart (or just pry with your fingers.)  Then you have to very carefully go around and pry apart the entire top half of the case.  Putting it back together is the same way - you drop the phone in after making sure the silent switch on the case and phone are in the same position and then very carefully go all the way around and make sure every little clip between the two halves of the case has snapped into place.  It won't be watertight if you don't snap every snap into place all the way around, so this is something you have to pay attention to.It isn't complicated to do - but you probably wouldn't want to do it 100 times a year.  I think it is fine for the occasional ski trip or hike.  The screen is protected by the clear plastic film which should be fine for most purposes.  But I probably would want something heavier covering the screen if I was going to just throw the phone into a backpack with other stuff that could scratch or rip that film.  Again, it is all about bulk vs. protection.  This is the case to get if you want a case you can take out in the rain, snow, boat etc. with decent drop protection too.  If you want the super-bulletproof case that makes the phone as thick as a brick but keeps the phone safe from extreme abuse, go elsewhere.There is a little thing to slip a lanyard through on one corner.  I kind of wish that there was just rubber on that corner to provide more drop protection - it would be better if the lanyard hole was somewhere else on the case, but that is a small thing.For what it cost, it seems a good value and quite well-made.  I can recommend it without hesitation.  I ordered the safety orange one just to make it easy to see if I ever drop the phone in the woods or snow.  My phone now resembles a small, square road cone.  So you might want one of the more conservative colors if you are using this as your only case and work in an office, but it is a good color choice for the outdoors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R13L2G8U5FM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV850YO#wasThisHelpful","R2R13L2G8U5FM2","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, thin leather case for the 6 plus.The front is leather with nice stitching all around the edge.  It is just thick enough to provide some protection and stays in place with a small magnetic catch.  The best thing about it is that you can put the 6 plus in your front pocket and it is still very slim - while still being protected from whatever else in your pocket (keys, change, etc.).  It provides enough protection for typical office workdays etc. and it looks nice and professional.The color in the picture is pretty accurate, it is a very dark brown.  The workmanship seems good for something in this price range.  I am sure it will not last forever, but looks likely to hold up for a reasonable period of time.  The phone clicks into it securely in a way that makes it unlikely to come out.There is a little pocket in the front cover that theoretically you could stick your driver's license or a credit card into.  But don't buy this expecting it to replace your wallet.  First of all, the cover uses a magnetic catch, meaning there is a good chance that the magnet in the cover will wipe the information on the mag-stripe of your credit card.  It might be ok, but seems like a bad idea to store your credit cards a half-inch from a magnet.  Even if it doesn't wipe your credit cards, the pocket is small and is not going to hold multiple things anyway.It does have a stand feature, you sort of unhook the bottom of the case and then the back folds so it presents the phone at an angle.  You can fiddle with the angle a bit to get it right.  The 6 plus is actually big enough that you could watch video on it, so this is a nice feature to have.  I've already tried it out and it works fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32Y4SR4XZ5O0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P226T4C#wasThisHelpful","R32Y4SR4XZ5O0V","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It keeps you dry and is so much better than those cheap, semi-disposable ponchos.I bought two of 'em and keep one in the truck now.

"Color me not impressed.  You take the unit out of the box and then you have to assemble the glass pitcher yourself.  The whole thing is enormous - it looks from the pictures like it is about as big as coffee maker - wrong.  You are going to need a lot of counter-space to house this beastie.  For scale, the glass carafe is easily 3x the size of a typical coffee maker carafe.Next weird thing: there is no actual on/off switch anywhere on the unit, just a breaker reset on the front of it.Basically, it boils the water, the steam rises into a condenser where it is cooled back into water by a little fan using the ambient air to cool the coils. The condensed water drips down into the glass pitcher.  Rather than run on a timer or somehow sense that there is no water left in the unit, it is supposed to boil dry then the breaker trips off as the base gets too hot.  That is how it shuts itself off.  This does not seem like a particularly sensible design to me.  It is basically designed to deliberately get very hot, when the temp rises too high in the base, it SHOULD stop before it catches itself on fire.  Not a design I am particularly comfortable leaving run when I'm not home for example, and this is supposed to run for hours on end.  It will take several hours to distill a full pot of water.Unfortunately, the little breaker on mine was defective, shutting off the unit after it ran for 10-15 minutes, instead of the 4 hours plus it was supposed to run.  I checked everything over repeatedly, went through all the trouble-shooting steps in the manual - nothing helped.  It was tripping off like it was overheated when there was still 95% of the water unprocessed.So now I have to go return it.  Next unpleasant surprise.  Even for defective units, you get to pay the shipping back to the manufacturer and this thing is big and heavy.  My guess is that even slow shipping this monster back is going to cost me $40 or more.  Doesn't really seem right that I have to pay anything out of my own pocket for shipping when I got a defective unit.  If there was nothing wrong with it and I just didn't want it - ok, but I didn't get a working unit and now I am out of pocket a fair bit of money due to a manufacturing defect.  Yes, I could have looked at the fine print on the shipping policies from a third party purchase, but I didn't and now I got burned. I have had occasional, defective products from Amazon, and they seem to always treat you right, sending somebody to come pick up the thing to make the return process painless and easy so you'll come back to them again in the future.  Not so much for some of these third party sellers, apparently.  If that makes you hesitant to buy this particular item - good.It isn't particularly loud in operation and there is nothing otherwise objectionable about it.  The steel cylinder inside looks relatively easy to clean, although it cannot be immersed in water and would probably be a lot easier to clean if it didn't boil dry each time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4B1KA0I3RST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ANW7HQ#wasThisHelpful","RM4B1KA0I3RST","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, these are not half-bad.  The bass response is excellent, maybe the best bass I've ever heard in little ear buds.  So whatever they did to squeeze decent bass out of tiny headphones, it worked.There are two penalties to be paid, however:(1) the mid-range and high-end are not as well reproduced as the bass.  It gives a somewhat odd bass bias to the music - like you are listening to a very good set of headphones for the bass parts and a decent but cheaper pair of headphones for the rest of the music.  Or the equivalent of the bass bias being tuned up just a little too high on the stereo.  So if you are looking for highly-accurate, neutrally-balanced headphones, these are not for you.(2) These don't really sound great at low volume.  It seems like you have to feed enough power to them to ""wake them up"".  You don't have to crank it to painful levels, but anybody who wants to listen to stuff at very low volumes a lot is probably not in the target audience for these.They are pretty sound isolating and I found one of the interchangeable tips fits my ears reasonably comfortably.  Cannot comment on durability yet.You really don't need to spend a fortune on headphones to get excellent sound quality.  For example, my old-school Koss Porta-Pros absolutely blow these things out of the water across the board.  But those goober-looking things live at home.  For getting a little groove on while riding the subway or working out, these are fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLDJLXT5YJDC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BY3OU6#wasThisHelpful","RLDJLXT5YJDC6","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Understand what you are getting here.  Although marketed as a ""survival knife"", this is definitely not a knife I would choose to take into the wilderness as my primary survival knife.  It is too small and the quality of the steel is unknown and almost certainly suspect at this price.  When it arrives, it is about as sharp as a butter knife.  The case is cheap and likely would not hold up long in sustained, heavy use.None of that matters.  It sharpens up reasonably well, it is a full tang knife that is unlikely to break in normal use, and it is dirt cheap.So it is perfect for those situations where you'd like to have a little utility knife available but don't really expect to need/use it much.  For example, this one got sharpened and oiled and is going into the trunk of my car along with the flashlight, jumper cables and so on.  It is ideal for those kinds of limited applications.In other words, if you don't expect too much going in, you will be very happy with this knife.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D0HFD0G3HTM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00178CS4K#wasThisHelpful","R3D0HFD0G3HTM6","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems to be a well-made product.  I like the thick elastic at the wrists that will keep out the wet/cold and make sure that even if you are working with your arms raised, no water will come running down your arms.  The snap buttons aren't quite as easy to get fastened/unfastened as a zipper, but the design with the overlapping flaps makes sense when you look at it in person.  It is designed to hold up and last a lot better than a zipper, while keeping water out much better than a coat with regular buttons or snaps.  It just takes a little more time to do up or undo the alternating snaps.  I imagine I'll be getting a fair number of years out of this.  Have no illusions about when/where you will wear this - it is for those days when it is absolutely pouring and you need maximum protection.  It is definitely not a casual coat that would also be good when it rains.Here is help for people trying to pick the right size.  I'm a 6'4"" guy with broad shoulders - normal build - neither thin nor fat.  When I wear a dress shirt, the dimensions are 17 x 37 and so I normally have to wear XXL T Shirts and/or XXL-Tall for most stuff like this.  I bought an XL Tall based on the reviews here and it fits just fine.  So even for large guys like me, the advice in the other reviews to knock it down a size is a good one.  It seems like the idea in the sizing is if you plan to wear a heavy coat and then put this on top as a protective shell, buy the same size as you normally would.  If you are not planning to do that - follow the advice of the other reviewers and knock it down a size from what you'd usually buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OBKG7FR1ES5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00862DU60#wasThisHelpful","R3OBKG7FR1ES5Q","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little wary of buying this - an unknown brand, no reviews of it.  But when my big gas pressure washer conked out and I needed to get a project done immediately, I gambled on this.  It cost about as much as renting a big gas one, so if it worked once and survived, I figured that I was ahead.I'm an experienced user of pressure washers.  I have had 2 electric ones and finally moved up to a gas one, so I am well aware of the gas/electric trade-offs as well as what to look for in a pressure washer.First impressions - it seems reasonably well put together.  As expected, it is mostly plastic, but it doesn't seem too cheap anywhere.  The power switch is solid, the gun is nothing amazing, but it doesn't feel like it will immediately fall apart, the pressure hose looks ok, etc.  There is a nice long cord with a big GFI on it.  It comes with a little velcro thing to keep the pressure hose neat, a hook for the electrical cable etc.  You can store the detergent bottle and so on right on it and the unit is quite compact for storage.  Unlike a lot of these things that resemble a giant wad of spaghetti in your garage - this one can neatly store away.  That is a big plus for something that is going to spend most of its life in storage rather than in operation.The connection for the pressure hose on the front of the unit is all metal, another good sign.  The garden hose connection in the back is plastic and you put a rigid, filter quick connect onto it.  That is not so great.  Now there is big piece of rigid plastic sticking 6 inches out the back in a way that it could easily snap off if you aren't careful handling it.  If something is going to protrude that far out it really should be reinforced with metal.  That's going to require some attention when moving the unit around - definitely not a great design.  You'll want to unhook all that immediately after every use.So I put it all together following the directions.  It took maybe 10 minutes or less to get it ready to go.  First test was the aforementioned time-sensitive project - a big deck that had been neglected and the solid stain was peeling off all over the place.  It needed to get pressure washed in preparation for re-staining. That meant blowing off the stain that had bubbled up or peeled, while just cleaning rest of the surface where it still adhered properly.  So it is the kind of job that requires a fair bit of power as well as precise control.So off we went.  First nice surprise - the motor is very quiet in operation.  This is undoubtedly the quietest pressure washer I've ever used.  Unlike my gas one, no need for hearing protection running this thing.  It is not silent, but it won't annoy the neighbors 4 houses away like my gas one.  It doesn't sound like a cheap, crappy pump when it is running, either.Power is, as expected, ok.  It has enough zip when you turn the adjustable nozzle all the way up to easily strip off peeling paint and, if you are not careful, dig a nice gouge into the wood.  But the power is tightly focused on a very small area when it is on full power, meaning it takes a long time to clean a big area.  This is where a gas powered pressure washer shines - it can just push a lot harder meaning a much bigger swath of water with same pressure  - greatly speeding up the process of cleaning big areas.The head adjusts the power rather than having a series of tips for various pressures.  The tip system with a gas pressure washer is definitely better - it gives you more precise control.  Although this has adjustable power, in practical effect, this thing has two settings - all the way up (what you need when blowing off mildew, loose paint, etc.) and a sort of mid range that is sort of ""garden hose +"" setting that would be good for washing your car or lighter cleaning jobs.  When you are using it high pressure mode, you must pay very close attention to what you are doing.  Unlike the gas system where you basically have to be an idiot to do damage to the work surface if you are using a low pressure tip, here all you have to do is get a little too close.  Every electric pressure washer works this way - they just don't have enough zip to give good cleaning performance unless they are all the way up and the water is concentrated into a pencil-thin stream.  Anybody can get the hang of it, it doesn't require any particular skill - but you have to stay on the ball.It cycled on and off smoothly and provided consistent power in operation.Eventually, it got the job done just fine.  It probably took me 2-3x as long as it would take with a big gas pressure washer, but it ultimately did a good job.  I also felt all around it after extended use and the outside wasn't hot anywhere.  This is the first electric pressure washer I've owned that didn't get very hot after extended use. I take that as a promising sign for its future longevity.It also needs essentially no maintenance as long as you can put it inside somewhere where it won't freeze.  The manual specifically warns you that the pump will retain water and will be destroyed if it isn't purged before putting it somewhere below freezing.  Apparently, you can buy some kind of antifreeze and pump it into the pump if you have to store it someplace cold, but since it is so compact, it should be easy to store inside somewhere.  The whole thing is about the size of a canister vacuum cleaner when it is ready for storage.There is no question that if you are using a pressure washer regularly or you are doing huge jobs, you need to step up to a gas one and steer clear of all these little electric ones.  The electric ones just take a very long time to do big serious, heavy-duty cleaning because they don't have the power.  The gas ones are expensive, they require a lot of maintenance, and they will occasionally break down and need servicing, like mine.  But if you are washing an entire house before painting it, or have to regularly clean a 300 yard driveway, gas is really the only way to go.On the other hand, if you plan to use your pressure washer a few times a year, at most, and none of the projects are huge (annual deck cleaning, patio furniture washing in the spring, washing your car) this would be a fine choice.  This is a weekend warrior grade thing, and for that intended use, it is definitely not half bad.I have no idea how long it will hold up, but it doesn't seem to be obviously badly made - I can see it lasting a few years.  Eventually, these things all die - if you expect one to last a decade you are going to be disappointed.  But it doesn't give me any reason to think it won't last a few seasons and be handy for the smaller jobs where my big gas one is a bit of overkill.For what it cost, I think it was a good value.  It gets a thumbs up from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN890N8V8RSUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGC7S1U#wasThisHelpful","RN890N8V8RSUF","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK.  This thing is cheaply made and the mechanism is probably not going to last forever.Nevertheless, I like it more than I expected to.  In a dark room, it has plenty of power and really fills the room with a soft, diffused light.  It is basically a bunch of colored LEDs with different colors and you push the single button to cycle through the various modes.  You can get red by itself, green by itself, blue by itself, and a variety of different mixes of those colors.  There is like a disco mix version that just changes the modes continuously.  That is definitely not relaxing.  I find the green one is the most soothing, while the blue is nice but blue light is really not great for trying to go to sleep.It automatically turns itself off after an hour.  There is no way to adjust how long it stays on, it always turns off after an hour.It has a speaker for your phone, so I guess you could use it to play white noise for an hour, but the quality/cost of this thing is so low I have never even bothered to try the little speaker.  Buy it for the light alone.It has a short power cable that terminates with a USB port.  It comes with a little AC adapter but you could run this off a computer or something, it is nothing but a few LED lights and a very small motor, so I imagine it consumes almost no power.Things I wish it had:(1) The ability to set and remember a particular mode.  You have to cycle through all of them to get the one you want each time. It is a one button interface.(2) A brightness/dimmer.  It is pretty bright in operation - not perfectly ideal as a night light just because it throws so much light.  it would be better if you could dim it a bit.EDITED:To say it won't last forever is an understatement.  After about a month or so of regular use, it started to jerk instead of running smoothly.  The jerkiness completely ruins the effect and makes it annoying instead of soothing.  I assumed it needed lubrication so I unplugged it and set it aside until I had time to fiddle with it.  Finally got a chance to diagnose it tonight.  Not a lubrication problem.  The little post connected to the motor that rotates to move the lens has either bent or worn an uneven hole in the part it connects to.  Everything is just cheap plastic at that central connection point so as it operates it will naturally wear and fail.  The design is inherently flawed - the post that drives the whole assembly and is constantly under stress should be made of metal, and so should the thing it works against.  It probably would have cost all of 1 cent more to manufacture a version of this that would have run reliably for years, but instead they went super cheap and so it is headed to a landfill after a very short life.I spent half an hour trying to figure out how to fix it because I liked it so much.  But learn from my experience, just don't buy this.  You will come to really like it, and then it will fail.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13V8H58B4BRHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2E6WWO#wasThisHelpful","R13V8H58B4BRHQ","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are ok - they work fine.  Basically, it is 9 little plastic bags filled with water, and they are designed to flex so they don't break as they are frozen and then melt.  They are thin and each compartment is relatively small, so the sheet is somewhat flexible even when frozen, meaning you can wrap it around whatever you are trying to keep cold.  They are good for small lunch coolers or wherever you really don't have room for a bigger, heavier ice pack.The downside is that there really isn't a lot of water in the bags, so it is not a huge amount of ice.  So don't expect one of these sheets to last very long.  In a basic, soft-sided cooler, after about 3 hours, they are normally completely melted.  So they are fine for like keeping a lunch cool for a few hours, but they are not going to be useful for anything more than the most light duty use.  Don't expect these to replace those big blue ice packs - they just don't last that long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN62FL3KK336C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TWI81G#wasThisHelpful","RN62FL3KK336C","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These arrive as flat sheets, you soak them in water and they swell up.  They don't leak or make a mess, the gel inside locks the water into the little compartments once they are soaked in water.  I particularly like that they are quasi-flexible so you can sort of wrap them around stuff in a cooler.  The cubes themselves are rock solid ice, they don't flex, but the fabric they are connected to makes them somewhat flexible when frozen.I also have some of those blue flexible thermos sheets.  They basically just encapsulate water in flexible plastic, while these mix water and some kind of gel inside the compartments.  Those blue sheets are thinner than these, but that means they don't stay cold as long.  I prefer these, overall, to the blue ones.  They seem to stay colder quite a bit longer and the fabric on the outside of them seems to make them sweat less on whatever it is they are keeping cool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C8NBDYS0AQWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MV7Z4O#wasThisHelpful","R3C8NBDYS0AQWQ","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new computer purchase made me finally upgrade my wireless network.  I have FIOS and the Verizon router that comes with the FiOS service is poky.  I was not looking to get an Apple router at all, at first.  I read a bunch of the reviews in the tech press that dinged this router for only having 3 wired ports, and lacking some of the features of other high-end routers.  The tech gurus complained that it was too highly priced for its limited functionality.  I am no Apple fan boy, so I was planning to steer clear.Then I started reading the consumer reviews of the Asus, D-Link, Netgear routers recommended in the tech press.  Repeated reports of unstable, beta level firmware, abysmal support and problems with disconnects seemed extremely common with all the competitive routers out there.  That sounded really bad.  I soon realized that I really don't care very much about the features this thing doesn't have.  All I really want from a router is (1) rock-solid reliability and (2) high transfer speeds even when I am relatively far away from the thing.  I'm not interested in my router, I don't care about my router, I just want it to work so I can forget all about it and go on with my life.So far, this router delivers in spades.  I have configured a number of wifi networks over the years, so I knew the drill.  I set aside a whole evening just to set all this up, turn off the old wifi from the FIOS router, etc. I actually needed about 5 minutes.  Plug an Ethernet cable from the FIOS router's LAN ports into the WAN port on the Airport Extreme.  Plug in the router. Airport utility automatically pops up on any late-model Mac.  Name your new wifi network and password.  Done.  It took me longer to find the setting in the FIOS router's configuration page to turn off the old WiFi network than to set up this router.  If you have Verizon FiOs, you can't get rid of the FiOS router entirely because it feeds your cable boxes.  So you need to let the FiOS router handle addressing.  I thought that would be a pain, but it was very easily handled.  The whole setup process is about as simple and straightforward as possible.Once in operation, the range is outstanding.  I have a big house and I put it in the basement and it reaches everywhere, giving me every bit of the FiOS speed even when I am far away from it.  It never drops the signal, I've never had to reboot it.  It just works.Do yourself a favor, just buy this unless you really really need some of the features this doesn't have.  Install it, then forget about it.  If you never have to think about it again, it is doing its job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMWZTA5XZ20H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB9WCR6#wasThisHelpful","RFMWZTA5XZ20H","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is small enough to be very easy to carry, but big enough to hold a fair bit of stuff.  It seems very sturdy, it is comfortable to wear, the straps are good with good adjustments and so on.I bought this for carrying spare clothes when riding my bike.  It was critical that I could keep everything clean and dry even if it pours rain or it is 100 degrees outside and I'm sweating like crazy.  This does the job.  It will easily swallow a pair of big sneakers and a full set of gym or street clothes with a good bit of room left over.The only penalty is that there is no zipper.  Instead, you roll up the top, then strap it down with two clips and a velcro strap. Means it takes a tiny bit longer to get in and out of the bag vs. a regular backpack.  If you really don't need the water resistance and are going in and out of your bag constantly, this might get annoying.  Also it is very much designed for serious day-pack hiking, with a lot of extra straps and clips beyond the two shoulder straps to help keep it secure and comfortable on your back.  I use mine for 30 minute bike rides and so all those extra hiking straps are a bit of overkill for me.  I was basically needing a college backpack that was waterproof, not a hiking day pack, but I can't really ding it for having more features than I need.  I would certainly not hesitate to take this on a long day hike - it is very comfortable to wear, with nice padding in the back and thickly padded shoulder straps.So far it has been perfectly waterproof, but I haven't given it a torture test yet.  But I expect it will do fine.  It seems to be very well made and very well thought out.  You can just tell in the little touches that whoever designed this knew what they were doing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYPUOBW8K81K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3NZL1Q#wasThisHelpful","RMYPUOBW8K81K","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought some cheap solar post lights.  They looked nice at first, but fell apart within 2 years.  So I was looking to upgrade to some better made ones.  Pulling these out of the box, I was largely very pleased.  The glass is a little less colorful than in the picture, but the solid wood base is nicely done, the glass and the leading all looks very good.  There was some excess caulk or sealant of some kind on the glass of one of them, but nothing serious.Unfortunately, just like the cheap lights I bought a few years ago, these include cheap, virtually worthless Ni-Cad batteries.  Ni-Cad batteries do not tolerate long storage and complete discharge well.  These show a manufacture date well over year before I received the product.  Predictably, they died almost immediately.  They actually didn't even live long enough to get installed on the fence post.  I'd unpacked these and sat them in the sun and then didn't get to the installation for a couple of days.  They failed before I could even install them.  So off to the hardware store to buy some fresh, NiMH batteries.  The new batteries are about 4x as powerful as the ones that were provided, do not contain Cadmium and are likely to last several seasons before they die.The way you change the batteries is that the flat black piece on top of the light pulls off, and that top contains the solar panel, the batteries and the two little LED bulbs that light up the glass at night.  There is no rubber seal or grommet where this top piece meets the top of the glass part of the post.  It looks virtually inevitable that in a vigorous storm with wind driven rain, some water will get under the cap.  Once water gets in behind the glass, there is no place for it to drain out.  I am going to have to keep an eye on this.  I expect I will somehow have to drill a weep hole in the back side underneath to let water out from inside the glass area.  It should weather normal rain just fine, but I am extremely skeptical it will stay water tight in really severe weather without a gasket.In operation, it glows very softly, mostly a sort of creamy white color with little bits of the yellow color to it.  It doesn't look at all bad, but it would look better if it were more the color of the picture instead quite so white.  It also could be a fair bit brighter.  Do not expect this to provide anything more than a decorative touch.  It is just not bright enough to light up a path or walkway.So this is a better made and much more solid light than the one it replaced.  But expect to change the batteries before you even install it, the actual color in operation isn't as warm as the picture suggests, the design may not be entirely weatherproof, and it doesn't throw off a whole lot of light.  This may sound like I am panning it - but I am not.  You need to understand that most of these solar post caps are just unmitigated garbage - badly made and likely to fail almost immediately.  This one is far from perfect, but it is much more solidly made than all the ones I looked at in the home center or the ones I previously bought on-line.  I think I can make this one work, and it doesn't seem likely to fall apart in a year or two.One final note - DO NOT glue this to the top of your fence post.  Even though it seems to be better made than a lot of these things - it will inevitably fail at some point and then you'll have to replace it.  Drill two small holes into the wood base, then attach to the post with weatherproof screws.  I used small brass ones that are totally unobjectionable.  That way you can replace it easily when the time comes.So if I were redesigning this:(1) replace the crummy Ni-Cad batteries with fresh, NiMH batteries.(2) more LEDs - it definitely needs to be brighter.(3) rubber seal or grommet of some kind where the top attaches to protect the inside from even severe weather(4) make the glass more colorful.  It doesn't look like the picture in operation - too white.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIAAOAD82I2I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F19CLPM#wasThisHelpful","RIAAOAD82I2I6","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a nice looking little thing, looks just like a retro fridge that has been shrunk down.  It would look better if there wasn't a stupid, big company logo on the front of the door, but it isn't bad.  There is a reason why the only picture is with the door open.In operation the fan is not quiet and not horrible either - sort of in the middle.  If fan noise bothers you this isn't the one to buy, but I don't find it too annoying.  It is just white noise.It is a thermoelectric cooler, which means it is far less powerful in operation than a regular fridge.  I gave it a torture test the first evening - put 4 pony bottles of tonic water into it. They all fit standing straight up and they were at room temp.  A few hours later they were definitely colder, but not yet cold enough.  Left it overnight and in the morning they were frosty cold and perfect, but that was probably 12 hours later.  They probably got cold enough to drink well before I checked on them. But the basic point is this - the thing takes a long time to chill stuff that isn't cold, but it has enough zip to cool stuff down eventually.  There is no fan that blows cold air around inside it, it is just a metal plate in the back that is constantly made cold, absorbing ambient heat and exhausting it out the back.  It works, it just takes a while.What I like about it is that it is tall inside, you can easily get a big water bottle into it.  It will also fit a typical frozen lunch entree into it, but not flat, standing up.Here is what I think this is good for:  mini-fridge in your office to keep a bottle of water cool, your frozen lunch frozen until it is time to microwave it, or a couple of sodas cold.  Because it is a thermoelectric unit, it can only lower the temp. a maximum of 20 c or 36F.  So at 70F, it drops the temp inside to 34F - perfect for a climate-controlled office.Here is what it would not be great for: a cooler that gets knocked around in the car or for camping and so on.  There is a little recessed handle to carry it, but I just don't see it being made sturdy enough to take much abuse.  In particular the door latch mechanism appears fairly fragile and will probably be the first thing to break.  If that happens, the fridge is done, because the handle is what you use to pull the thing tight shut.  You close the door, then have to pull the handle out to get the door to seal tight.  It does come with a car adapter and an AC adapter, but I expect I will never use the car adapter for it.This is something you stick under your desk or put somewhere else and just leave it be.  If you are gentle with the handle, it will probably last a while.  Everything else seems reasonably well put together.  The AC adapter is large, and it gets a little bit warm in operation, but nothing scary.  The AC adapter draws a maximum of 1.5 Amps at 120v - that is 180 watts.  So it isn't going to bankrupt you or blow the circuits in your office to run this thing, but it certainly isn't going to be as energy efficient as a small, regular fridge.  The cables on the AC adapter are correctly sized for the current they pull, neither the AC wire going in nor the wire running to the fridge were even warm after 18 hours of continuous operation.There are two sets of vents on the back, inlet vents in the recessed handle and a fan exhaust vent a few inches below.  With the inlet vent and the exhaust vent so close to one another, this thing needs some open space behind it to get rid of the waste heat.  So make sure you aren't planning to stick it flush against the wall or tucked into a cabinet without any venting behind. I think if you give it 6-8 inches behind and at least that much above (heat rises), it would be ok.  You need to give it enough free air behind it so it doesn't end up sucking in the very same hot air it just expelled.For what it cost, it seems a good value.  If it lasts it is a great value.  Eventually all of these thermoelectric coolers will fail, it is inherent with the technology that they don't run for 15 years like a regular fridge.  But if this survives a couple years it was worth what I paid for it.  If you want yours to last longer, turn it off when it is empty and run it only when you are trying to keep stuff cold.  There is a switch on the back to turn it on and off.  You can also flip the switch the other way and it can keep stuff warm, but I've not tried that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPG6KGXERKYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COYGU6I#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPG6KGXERKYW","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bracket that holds the thermometer is made of metal.  The thermometer itself is made of plastic.  The housing and the top and the bottom too.  However, the top and bottom of the thermometer look to be made of metal - it is very convincing.  To the point I had to tap on it to make sure it wasn't metal.You can pivot the arms to adjust the angle and then also spin the thermometer itself to get it positioned perfectly.  You need to be looking straight at it to read it - reading it from the side is not going to work.  But if you are facing it correctly the column of mercury is thick enough that it is easy to read.  I have mine mounted on a screened in porch about 2.5 feet from the glass door onto the porch and I can easily read it from inside.  It seems to be pretty accurate.The downsides?  It comes with very cheap screws which are probably not even galvanized.  So I replaced the screws with two brass screws and used those to mount it.  I would expect the screws would rust in a year or two if you don't get better ones to mount it.I imagine it will last a good while in the protected location of my screened in porch.  But I'd be worried about the fake metal finish not holding up somewhere where it is more exposed to both weather and direct sunlight.  You should mount this thermometer (or any thermometer) in the shade and away from where it will get a lot of direct exposure to the weather.I am knocking off one star for not making clear that the whole thing isn't made of metal - and for the cheap screws.

"This thing is indeed made from real wood and the corner brackets and rod that holds down the napkins are all metal.  When it arrived, it was kind of filthy so I had to scrub the whole thing with Murphy's Oil Soap.  After I finished cleaning it, it looks fine.  It has little rubber feet so it won't scratch your table and the metal pole is heavy enough to do the job of holding down the napkins.I wouldn't rate it as an outstanding, quality product, there are some scratches on the wood on the base where nobody would see them once the napkins are in place and the finish isn't exactly perfect.  But it gets buy just fine for what it is - a basic, wooden napkin holder.  If I had spent $50 on it, I would be a bit disappointed, but for what it cost, it is just fine.  I am not sure about how ""rustic"" it is - it would go fine in a rustic cabin, but just as easily in any mainstream decor.  It is a plain, simple wooden napkin holder.  It does take up a fair bit of space because the napkins lay flat instead of sticking straight up.  I wouldn't want it on a really small table.  But outside of that it would be hard to imagine any place where something made out of wood would look ok but this would look bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7SQTTBQ7CS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AXXV9S#wasThisHelpful","R2O7SQTTBQ7CS2","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems reasonably well made - the ends click in securely and it transmits the digital signal just fine.  Only caution:  When they say ""6 feet"" they mean 6 feet between the very tip of the end of the connector on each end, not six feet worth of cable with connectors attached.  So the actual cable length is more like 5'6"" or so.  Because the connectors are kind of long and there are two of them - it felt short enough that I actually measured it to make sure they sent me this one and not the 4' one by accident.For a monitor in the middle of a large desk and a laptop sitting on a table right next to the desk - this worked, but only just.I would definitely buy this one and not the smaller one unless you are planning to have the computer literally right on top of the monitor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF0NON0JJSVKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H3Q59U#wasThisHelpful","RF0NON0JJSVKC","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never ran this through the dishwasher but the finish started to flake off after about 2 years of regular use (we cook all kinds of stuff on it, not just pizza - it fits the oven perfectly).  So I came onto Amazon looking to buy the replacement for exactly the same problem everybody else on here seems to be reporting.  So I decided to look elsewhere.  There are 13"" pizza pans without the nonstick coating available elsewhere on Amazon.  Just make sure you buy one without handles or edges that stick out because they will not fit the Breville oven otherwise.Do not use a pan that has started to flake off the non-stick finish at all.

"I actually bought one of these by accident, meaning to buy the much more expensive one with the replaceable battery and light.  When I realized my mistake - I thought it would be going back immediately because there was no way this little guy would be beefy enough.  Wrong.  This thing is awesome.  It can push even big screws with ease, and has plenty of power for the kind of routine little drilling/screwing projects a homeowner is normally going to encounter.  The battery lasts a LONG time between charges and doesn't run down in storage.  I am stunned by how good it is given how little it weighs.  It is so easy to handle - it weighs probably 20% what my old ni-cad drill weighs and the power is similar.  The fact that the battery isn't swappable has been no issue so far.Yes, this is not a drill for a professional contractor who needs to shoot 1,200 screws a day.  But this ought to give you a sense of where the line is:  I still own a corded, 1/2""  hammer drill and I still pull it out from time to time.  But basically unless I am using a hole saw to cut a 6"" hole through something, or need to bore a big hole through a 6x6 for a heavy carriage bolt or something like that - this is more than up to the task.  This little guy is the drill I reach for probably 95% of the time now.I like mine so much I just bought another one for up at our cabin in the mountains.  It is just so handy to have around, once you have one you really don't want to be without it.As far as I can tell, the only downside is that the battery doesn't seem to be replaceable.  When the Lithium Ion battery does eventually die, you will probably have to replace the whole drill.  But for what it costs, that isn't a deal breaker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMZ2I02OQ2RXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CYKNVW#wasThisHelpful","RMZ2I02OQ2RXK","A1GYYOE13EFKKW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GYYOE13EFKKW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I believe in the power of consciousness archaeology. The most significant application in this book is the practice of letting go.  This involves fully experiencing a painful situation and having the ability to let it go.  This is difficult for me to do.  The vices of rejection, denial and arrogance prevent me from letting go. I also believe that I can raise my consciousness by showing kindness and maintaining a sense of humility.  Freeman believes that each person possesses an inner genius.  I agree with this completely. Being a genius simply means having an insight in a particular area.  I have discovered that over the years that I am a genius in networking.  I meet new people constantly.  I have the ability to create new work opportunities for myself because of my ability to network with different kinds of people.  I think that everyone has the power to network.  I try to help people to create or expand their own networks.  I believe in the value of surrendering my own beliefs every and then.  This helps to keep my mind open to new avenues.  I will read this book periodically to remind me to surrender my beliefs and to let go of my negative emotions. These practices will help me to stay mentally and spiritually healthy throughout my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R306WPR1GPHW8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3HTF1C#wasThisHelpful","R306WPR1GPHW8W","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is a good balance between faster tempo songs and the slower tempo ones.  There are lyrically moving songs on this album as well.  I love ""Heartbreak Song"" It is a excellent dance tune.  Some songs are lyrically inspiring like ""Invincible"".  This is a song that will make young girls feel better about themselves.  The title song is a reminder that a person's faith in people can be restored after being damaged.  ""Piece By Piece"" is a song that I listen to for inner strength when I need it. ""In The Blue"" is the best song about how friendship that transcends time.  This song resonates with me.  I think it is because I have several true blue friends that I have grown up with. ""Second Wind"" is another gem of a song.  It touches me because I believe that anyone can get a second wind.  ""Second Wind"" is the kind of song that motivates me not to give up on anything. ""Run Run Run"" is a superb duet with John Legend.  I never thought I would hear these two very different voices singing together on a song.  I love the piano playing on ""Run Run Run"" by him.

""I'm So Sorry"" and ""Friction"" are two songs that keep me on the edge of seat.  These two songs will help me to release some anger and tension when it comes up.  ""I Bet My Life"" is a song that resonates with me. This song touches me because I am always putting my life and trust in other people.  ""Shots"" and ""Hopeless Opus"" are two songs that remind me to forgive myself for any personal mistakes I have made in life.  The lyrics of these two songs really touches me.

"Graphic design is a fascinating subject.  I would like a job in creative design because of this book.  It would be so much fun to do something creative.  Creative Anarchy is about breaking the rules of graphic design to create something unique.  I work for a theater company part time, so this information could be very useful in my work right now.  One important rule of graphic design is that type is everything.  I learned some new words that will help me to understand how to use type in graphic design.  I learned that kerning is the space between two letters in a single word.  I learned that tracking is the spacing of all the letters in a single word.  I will remember these words if I ever get the chance to design a poster for my new play in April. There is a picture of a poster advertising the Shakespearean play Othello.  The first O in Othello is at the top of the poster.  The other letters are in a descending diagonal pattern that covers the entire poster. The display of the letters signifies  the descent that Othello experiences in the play.  I hope to create a poster that is memorable for my future plays.  Another rule of graphic design is to use a grid.  I aspire to write a book of my poems. I  want to write an autobiography some day too. I could use a column grid.  This kind of grid works perfectly for books that combines words and pictures together.  I learned a few things the use of color in graphic design.  I learned that hue is the name of a color.  I learned that tint is the lightness of a color.  I learned that shade is the range within a particular color.  I hope to get the chance to create a mural some day.  I could use my knowledge of color to create a spectacular mural.  I learned so much from reading Creative Anarchy.  I can not wait to apply some of the things I have learned in my work and personal projects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SVV2SJ6SXMC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440333327#wasThisHelpful","R3SVV2SJ6SXMC1","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find any book about neurology to be fascinating.  The title of the book comes from Alice in Wonderland.  It is often difficult to get a patient out a rabbit hole when they are diagnosed.  Dr. Allan Ropper is a clinical neurologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.  His job is to listen to his patients and diagnose their problem and decide what to do.  Clinical neurologists save the lives of patients but they also helps patients to end their lives too.  Ropper devotes two chapters sharing about Lou Gehrig’s disease or ALS affects the lives of two different patients.  One male patient with ALS is able to type on the computer with his knee.  He can still engage with the community and meet people.  The other patient is a female.  Her quality of life is not that good.  She cannot communicate with other people and is bedridden.  The difference between the quality of life between these two people are striking.  Dr. Ropper decides to humanely end the life of the female patient by removing her breathing tube so her breathing stops.  He does so at the request of the patient and her family.Some of the stories in this book are scary.  There is a story about a woman who has an ovarian teratoma in her body.  A teratoma is a tumor that contains cells from different parts of the body.  This tumor causes her to have hallucinations. Her hallucinations stop after her ovary is removed.  I learned that 6,000 people suffer a stroke in the United States.  There is a story of a young woman who suffered a series of strokes because of a chiropractic treatment.  I did not even know that this could happen.  This patient received blood thinners to stop future strokes from occurring.  Ropper also treats a man with amnesia by giving him medication to raise his blood pressure and anticoagulant medication.  The diversity of Ropper’s patients and their  conditions makes this book interesting.One of Allan Ropper’s former patients is Michael J. Fox. He has lived with Parkinson’s disease for over twenty years, but he still continues to work and even plays golf.  He has created a foundation to find a cure for Parkinson’s disease.  Michael J. Fox is proof that a person can live a full life with a neurological disease.  Ropper briefly discusses another patient that suffers from tremors, but he concludes that this patient’s problem is Lyme disease.  I am not studying to be a doctor, but I learned that it is important to get the correct diagnosis in order to receive the appropriate treatment.There is no information in this book about how to prevent brain disease from happening.  I would have liked some information about this.  I can only do what I believe is healthy for my brain.  I have to continue to do things like learn new things.  I have to continue to eat healthy and exercise regularly.  My brain will be disease free if I keep doing these things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQHS0EDF3XMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250034981#wasThisHelpful","R2WQHS0EDF3XMM","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to watch football, but  I am unable to play because of a physical disability. Still, I never even thought about the values a person can learn from playing the game until I read this book. Mark Edmundson articulates these values in this book.  He played two years of high school football in Massachusetts.  The values that he learned in those two years have stayed with him for more than forty years. He is now a professor of English at the University of Virginia. He finds examples from poems, books and his own personal life to illustrate the values he picked up.  He uses the example from Homer's poem The Iliad to show examples of character.  Achilles is the brave impulsive warrior in the poem.  His personality is similar to the football players who risk their bodies playing football.  There is another character in the Iliad named Hector.  Hector is also a fearless warrior, but he possesses the ability to show tenderness off the battle field.  Achilles does not have this trait in him.  I never read the Iliad, but I am inspired to because of Edmundson's brief explanation of the characters. Character can also be developed through effort and hard work. Edmundson lifted weights and exercised daily to become a contributing member of his high school football team as a linemen.The sport of football is also about learning how to deal with loss. Edmundson shares his personal experience of dealing with the death of his sister at a very young age due to a stroke.  It is healthy to mourn after a family member dies.  But, It is also necessary to move on with life after the grieving is done.  This is what a football player should do after a loss.  They should move on after reflecting about the loss.I learned football that instills faith in a person.  I am not a very religious person, but I think the practice of praying before playing a football game is good.  A football player may pray to have a good game and not to get injured. It also makes sense that a football player says a prayer to play to the best of their ability to help the team to win. I never thought about the connection between football and faith before, but Edmundson makes it sound logical and important.There is another poem in this book that I really like.  The poem is entitled The Bee by James Dickey. This poem is about a how a father finds the strength to save his son, who is  desperately  trying to escape from a bee sting by running into traffic.James Dickey musters up courage from playing college football at Clemson University.  I never even knew that James Dickey wrote poetry.  I like the subject matter of this poem a lot. I never thought a person could learn so much from playing football. I never thought that  qualities of a football player could be found in literature either.  I enjoyed this book very much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VE9OXPEVWAY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205752#wasThisHelpful","R2VE9OXPEVWAY8","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Smart Cuts provides examples of people who have achieved success by doing things to accelerate the career.  I have never even heard of Sonny Young, but he is a musician now known as Skrillex . He started his career wanting to be a singer, but he discovered a talent for being a music disc jockey.  He used those skills to create his own version of music called electronic dance music.  This passion led to career as a record producer for pop star Lady Gaga.  I am also inspired by the achievements of D’Wayne Edwards. He possessed a gift for drawing.  This led to a career in designing shoes.  Edwards now runs his own shoe design academy named Pensole footwear in Oregon, where he now teaches students how to design sneakers.  I have heard of a shoe design academy before, so I found this story to be very interesting.  These two men remained active in pursuing their individual passions.  They were able to able to elevate their talents into successful careers.  Some ideas in the book resonates with me personally. I can relate to having a mentor and being a super connector in my job.I work for a theater company called Playbuilders in the state of Hawaii. Our play about the homeless problem in Hawaii received the highest award for best overall play of the year last week.  I am not the most talented actor, but I have a theater mentor that helped me to learn my character and memorize my lines.  My theater mentor is very important to my development.  She pushes me and encourages me to improve on each individual performance that I do.I am involved in a new play. This play is about the history and people of Waipahu, which is a town close to where I live.  My role in this play is community organizer.  I have to locate people who live a specific community.  I need to find out if they have a story they are willing to share, and then I have to connect them to the playwright of this play project.  I have connected five people to this play project so far.  Meeting different people is a fun way to learn how to get into character when I am on stage, because I believe that every person has a different perspective about a specific subject.  It is neat to read a book that contain so many concepts that resonate so strongly in my life and work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD85IS0F5KYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062302450#wasThisHelpful","R3CD85IS0F5KYA","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great album from Spoon.  I like the variety of songs on this album.  ""They Want My Soul"" and ""Do You"" are two lyrically meaningful songs for me.  These tunes forces me to reflect on my place in the world and how my life is going.  The lead vocals of Britt Daniel is superb here.  ""Outlier"" is the purest rock song on the album.  The tone of this song just oozes energy.  This song is about living life on the edge.  ""Inside Out"" is a slower paced song.  I think this song features a harp playing.  This is a kind of song that makes me forget about all my problems.  I also like the song ""Rainy Taxi"".  I don't know why this song is entitled Rainy Taxi, but I like it.  I think this song is about the conflict that happens between two people in a relationship.  This song has a groovy tone.  Jim Eno provides a surge of energy on the drums on this song.  I like it very much.  Rob Pope provides funky guitar riffs on the song ""Knock Knock Knock"".  This song does not touch me lyrically like the others, but I enjoy listening to it.  The band members are so talented individually.  Collectively though, these musicians form one of the best alternative rock bands around today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CAWPTPPFZSMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTZAL9G#wasThisHelpful","R3CAWPTPPFZSMX","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most enjoyable movies of the summer.  This soundtrack reflects the humor of the film so well  The songs are not in order as they appear in the film, but that is okay. ""I'm Not In Love"" is the first song featured in the movie.  I like this song, because it reminds me of all the girls I liked in my youth. ""Moonage Daydream"" is probably my favorite track on this soundtrack though.  This song fits the film's space adventure theme better than any other song on here.  I am a David Bowie fan so that is why it is one of my favorites.  ""Hooked On A Feeling"" is  another good song.  I prefer the BJ Thomas version, but this cover works just fine.  ""Fooled Around And Fell in Love"" by Elvin Bishop is featured in one of the funniest scenes of the movie.  I haven't heard ""The Pina Colada Song"" in years.  This song topped the charts way back in the last month of 1979, but I still enjoy listening to it.  I love the feisty spirit of the song ""Cherry Bomb"" by the Runaways.  This song features a very young Joan Jett singing her first hit song.  ""Ooh Child""and ""Aint No Mountain High Enough"" are two fun  R and B classics that add to the diversity and enjoyment of this soundtrack for me","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR121K1N43VII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLF5J64#wasThisHelpful","RR121K1N43VII","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this new album from Jenny Lewis.  “Head Underwater” reminds me never to give up in life because there is always something to look forward to.  This is a very upbeat song to start the album.  “The Voyager” is a song that encourages me to explore all the possibilities in life.  It reminds me that I need to detach from all material things to spur my creativity.  Just One of The Guys is another song I really like.  This is a song about resisting going with the crowd and doing my own thing in life.  These three songs really resonate with me lyrically. “Love U Forever” has great guitar riffs.  I love the musical arrangement of this song. Jenny Lewis shows such a sensual quality in her voice on the song “Late Bloomer”. I really like her vocal performance on this song.  “She’s Not Me” is a song about the pain that men cause women and vice versa in a relationship.  I love the sounds of the waves on the song “Aloha and The Three Johns”.  This is probably the most upbeat song about the end of a relationship I have ever heard.  I am from Hawaii.  It is ironic to hear that any Hawaiian song can drive someone crazy.  Despite of this reference, I enjoy this song very much.  “The New You” is a song about how people have to adjust to a new stressful situation every day.  The electric guitar sounds beautifully subtle on this song.  This entire album sounds terrific.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ZTKXZ7EEKV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM30PVY#wasThisHelpful","R11ZTKXZ7EEKV4","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Temple Is Not My Father is an insightful book. Rasana Atreya introduces me to a group of people called devadasi in the Indian culture. The devadasi are servants of God.  They are preteen girls who are sacrificed by their families to become prostitutes.  It sounds rather strange for servants of God to become prostitutes.  The main character in this book is a woman named Godavari. I learned that the Godavari is the longest river in India. Godavari has a sister named Krishna.  This is the name of the blue skinned Hindi god. I also learned that a kirana is a grocery store.  Godavari is a devadasi  She is also a loving mother to a young daughter named Sreeja. I learned that Sreeja means spiritually intense.  All of these words are from a classical Indian language called Telugu.  Part of the fun of this book is just learning the meaning of these names and words online.The transformation of the character of Godavari is special here.  In the first part of the book, she is a lonely and isolated mother.  She is motivated by her sister to attend a non-government school to make something of herself.  She receives an education and becomes a crusader for young girls in need.  This is a short book, but the characters and themes are strongly presented and developed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR6SJ73QT3CSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQE95FU#wasThisHelpful","RR6SJ73QT3CSO","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edge of Nowhere is set in Prince William Sound, which is located in southern Alaska.  The people of Prince William Sound speak an endangered native Alaskan language called Alutiq.  It is neat just to be exposed to a new language.  Each of the eighteen chapters in this book are prefaced with the  Alutiiq  number and the corresponding English number. I learned the Alutiiq word for salmon is Igalluk.  People earn a living on Prince William Sound by salmon fishing.  I like to go to salmon fishing, but I can't imagine doing for a living.  John Smelcer establishes that salmon fishing is how people who live on Prince William Sound survive. It pays for the mortgage and the food.  It also pays for the crew who work on the boat.  I can visualize all the animals that he describes in this book.  They are deer, sea otters, black bears and salmon of course.The plot centers around a teenage boy named Seth.  He gets hit by a wave, and he goes overboard while on his family fishing boat.  He lands on one of the islands in Prince William Sound.  I love the way he learns how to survive for months on his own.  He crafts a spear with a tree branch .  to catch salmon. He also survives by eating mussels and dandelions.  He uses the tide currents to literally swim in the direction of his home.  It is not often that I admire the traits of a fictional character, but I do admire Seth's courage and survival instincts.  The other character is Jack.  He is Seth's father.  He is determined to do anything to find his son.  Edge of Nowhere is very much a coming of age novel.  The character of Seth starts the novel as a boy, but he becomes a self reliant young man because of his experience.The  theme of a  death of a family member is explored in this book.  I don't want to give the plot away.  I will say that Seth learns to accept that death is an natural part of life. Seth learns that sometimes that no one can be blamed for the sudden passing of the loved one.  I like everything about the book Edge of Nowhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OOZGGDGY470W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193524857X#wasThisHelpful","R3OOZGGDGY470W","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The six innovations that Steven Johnson discusses in this book are not new.  Glass, sound, time light, the cold, the state of being clean and cold have been around forever.  What makes this book special is how Stephen Johnson traces the development of each subject.  He starts from the very beginning uses of each innovation, and then he discusses how each application is being currently used today.I don’t like to be cold, but I enjoy reading about the history of it.  There is a picture of Willis Carrier in 1939.  He invented air conditioning. This picture shows him in an air conditioned igloo.  I have never seen an air conditioned igloo before, so I think this picture is very neat.  I need to find an easier way to keep cool in the car that does not include turning on the air conditioner and drinking water.  I know that people freeze their eggs until they are ready to become pregnant.  I wonder how long human organs and blood can be preserved as effectively as eggs.I learned that glass can be made from cooling a chemical compound called silicone dioxide.  I love reading about the applications of glass in this chapter. There is a picture of a fourteenth century monk wearing a pair of glasses.  There is a picture of the Keck observatory on the Big Island of Hawaii.  It has thirty-six mirrors.  I live in Hawaii and have never seen this observatory.  There is also a picture of a flea as seen through the lenses of a microscope.  There is another picture of a glass pasted statue of a beetles surrounded by stones.  This is a beautiful photo to look at.  One of the first applications of glass happened in the art world.  There is a lovely seventeenth century painting by Diego Velazquez in the book.  It shows maids of honor getting ready for a wedding.  This chapter is the most interesting visually because of the pictures.The first sources of light came from candles from animal fat.  I also learned that candles can be made from the oil from whales. This led to the invention of the electric light by Thomas Edison.  Other inventors used different elements like platinum and iridium to create the electric light bulb, but Edison is credited for bringing it to the public. The development of light is currently being continued by researchers in Livermore California.  They are working on a laser source of energy with nuclear capabilities.  I have experienced laser surgery while undergoing dental work.  I am curious to learn about new innovations in light.The chapter on cleanliness talks about how the city of Chicago became the first to create a sewer system to eliminate waste.  Having chlorine added to water in the late 19th and early 20th century purified the water making safe to drink.  This is interesting history, but I have travelled to places and countries like Taiwan and Las Vegas, where I am still concerned about the quality of water today. One innovation discussed in this book is a new kind of toilet. This toilet does not need a sewer line or electricity.  It operates by using photovoltaic energy from the sun.  It has an electrochemical reactor powered by the sun, which treats the contaminated water from the human waste.  This can be turned into a fertilizer for crops.  The toilet is disinfected with table salt.The chapter on sound begins with the discovery that caves in France.  They produce sound vibrations.  The invention of vacuum tubes led to the development and radio, which led to the ability to record the spoken word.  My fondest wish in regards to sound has not happened yet.  I would like to live in a home where all of the appliances are activated by the sound of my voice.The most interesting aspect on the chapter about time is the idea of an atomic clock.  I know that atomic clocks are supposed to keep precise time.  They are used in navigation and synchronizing computers I have never seen one or used one  I want to know if I can use it.  I want to learn more about the different elements that atomic clocks are made of and the difference between them.Steven Johnson mentions the work of mathematician Ada Lovelace.  She is credited as being the first computer programmer.  She wrote an algorithm for number theory in the mid nineteenth century.  She also predicted that the computer would have more applications than just number crunching. This book is a great read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXZ27998ZAPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594632960#wasThisHelpful","RTXZ27998ZAPP","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book will help me approach the obstacles and present situation  with more clarity and confidence.  I recently applied for a job that I did not get.  I originally perceived this as a negative experience, which it is.  I will try to apply the three phases of overcoming obstacles that Ryan Holiday writes about this book.  The three steps are to change my perception of my situation, take the proper course of action and to strengthen my will and continue at my present job.The author provides a story to illustrate how these three steps work. Each story in this book contains a pearl of wisdom that makes me feel better. I am inspired by the example of Thomas Edison.  He continued to invent things even after his lab burned down.  I learned from Thomas Edison that I should embrace the setbacks in life and keep working.  I am inspired by the life of John McCain.  He served with honor with his fellow as a prisoner in Vietnam instead of refusing a chance for freedom.  John McCain helps me realize that my decisions affect other people.  I am inspired by the life of James Garfield. He worked as a janitor to pay his college tuition and later became the President of the United States. I learned from this example is that every job is worth doing well.The advice in this book is based on maintaining an even keel about obstacles in life. I will strive to see the positive aspects in every negative experience.  This book motivates me to work harder to provide employment services for my clients.  I will also try focus on the things I can change and not dwell on things I can not. What I can change is my  attitude about my job.  What I can not change is the amount of money that I earn. The Obstacle Is The Way will help make me a happier and more productive person.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JTR4TDN8ROB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846358#wasThisHelpful","R3JTR4TDN8ROB6","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Linda Ronstadt has left behind a great musical legacy. This duet album is part of that legacy.  For the first time, I get to hear all of Linda's greatest duets on one CD.  My favorite track is ""Prisoner In Disguise"".  This is a duet with JD Souther.  This song is musically arranged perfectly.  It has  the acoustic guitar in the beginning of the song and superb piano playing in the rest of the song.  JD and Linda harmonize so well on this song. ""Don't Walk Away Renee"" is another highlight.  This song is very pleasant and soothing to me.  ""I Can't Get Over You"" is another excellent duet with Ann Savoy.  This song expresses heart break beautifully.  Linda duets with James Taylor on the song ""I Think It's Going To Work Out Fine"".  This song has a faster tempo.  It contains a few seconds of saxophone playing.  The sax playing makes this song groovy to me.  I love the way Linda belts this song out with spirit.  ""Some where Out There"", ""Don't Know Much"" and ""All My Life"" three of my favorite pop songs from the eighties and nineties.  Linda's vocals on these three tunes have made them into contemporary pop music classics.""Sisters"" is a breezy sounding duet with Bette Midler.

"Sergeant Stubby is the true story about the relationship[ between a soldier and his bull terrier in France.  during World War One.  Stubby captured a German prisoner. For this courageous action, he earned the prestigious German Iron Cross.  Using his keen sense of smell, Stubby also warned soldiers of gas attacks.  This enabled soldiers to escape in time.  Stubby and his owner Robert Conroy also escaped numerous gas attacks during the war too. I admire Robert Conroy, because of the way he honored his dog after the war.  He donated his dog's uniform and a scrap book of his dog to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC.  Robert Conroy individual achievements are equally impressive.  He earned a law degree after the war and became a legislative aide.  He also worked for the FBI for a few years.  I learned that the goal of World War One would be trying to spread democracy all over the world. Women gained the right to vote with the passage of the Nineteenth amendment in 1920, so I can say with pride that Americans were successful in World War One. Not every country is a democracy.  This is why I have so much respect for military veterans. They fight so that American citizens can have the democratic freedoms to elect our own leaders.Ann Bausum provides 25 discussion questions at the end of the book. One of the things she points out is that American soldier did not enter the war until 1917. Bausum does not offer any answers to these questions.  She forces the reader to come up with their own answers.  I think that President Wilson did not send troops overseas until 1917 because he wanted to ensure that Americans could successfully defeat the Germans and secure democratic freedom for everyone.  I wish our current president possessed the ability to think like Woodrow Wilson.  His foreign policy goals are not that clear to me. These discussion questions really reinforce the important material in the book.  Sergeant Stubby combines the themes of war and friendship.  The combination of these themes makes Sergeant Stubby a special book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8JEILUHUM2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426213107#wasThisHelpful","RY8JEILUHUM2Q","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kill Switch is an exciting novel by James Rolllins.  The plot is centered  around how a former Army Ranger named Tucker Wayne, and his Belgium shepherd dog named Kane escort a Russian pharmacist out of Russia. They are being pursued by a Russian general and a female sniper across Russia and South Africa.  The pharmacist is in search of a plant organism called the Last Universal Common Ancestor or LUCA for short that can be found in Africa.LUCA is a real concept in science according to James Rollins.  It is kind of like a stem cell plant that can adapt to any environment and interact with any other living organism.  It is a mushroom shaped plant that emits sulfur.  The fascinating thing is that LUCA can used in conjunction with other plants to create medicine.  It can also used be used as a weapon that can contaminate the water supply and destroy vegetation.  The science references in this book makes want to learn more information about LUCA, I enjoy novels where a man and his dog work as a team.  This combat dog  understands 1,000 words.  This man and his dog work in symbiotic harmony in this book.  The dog supports the owner and vice versa all the time.  This shepherd dog has the courage to confront lions and the ability to find villains and attack on command.  I am always amazed by the things that dogs can be trained to do. I love dogs.  I own two of them, so I understand the bond that a man can have with a dog.I really enjoy the geographical aspects in the book.  The characters in this book travel across Russia and South Africa.  Rollins makes me feel me like I am travelling right along with them.  I learned that the Volga is the longest river in Europe . I would love to take a submarine ride on the Volga river just to take in such a beautiful sight.  I would love to visit a region of South Africa called Upington.  I learned that is an area of South Africa where wine is produced.  I would love to enjoy the caves and tunnels of Namibia to see what I could find.

"Struck by Genius is a fascinating book about how a man becomes a math genius after a brutal mugging eleven years ago.  Jason Padgett acquired synesthesia and savant syndrome after the accident. Jason is transformed from a carefree young man with a poor academic record into a person with a thirst for knowledge about math and science.  There are negative things about Jason's brain injury.  He is obsessed with germs and more open to bouts of depression because of his accident.  His mathematical abilities seem to outweigh the negative aspects of his brain injury though. Jason possesses an unique kind of synesthesia. It gives him the ability to assign a certain color with a certain number. He perceives something called fractal  geometry in everything he encounters.  Fractal geometry involves the repetition of a certain pattern.  Jason also discusses examples of geometry in every day life like ripples in a water puddle during a rain storm.  There is  fractal geometry in the swirl of coffee in a cup and even in blood flow of veins in the body.  I have never thought of real life examples of geometry before.  There are math and science references in book that make me want to learn more. The Doppler effect is something that involves how a sound is perceived differently at two separate locations.  The Pythagorean theorem involves something about the square root of sides being equal.  I believe this theorem can used to construct buildings. Even though I did not formally study these concepts, I feel I learned something just by reading about it.Jason is also a talented artist.  This book includes some of his drawings. There is a drawing of a nautilus shell with triangles in it.  There is a diamond shaped figure with circles in it.  Jason's drawings attracted his wife Elena to him.  Their easy going chemistry and loving relationship is something that I aspire to have some day with someone.  I love the chapter about how Jason travels to his wife's home country of Russia to woo and convince her to marry him.There is an invention called the creativity cap mentioned in this book. This cap sends electrical currents into the brains of people who do not have savant syndrome and it makes them smarter.  In the example provided in this book, people who wore the creativity cap suddenly had the ability  draw pictures more easily.  I would love to use a creativity cap to become smarter.  I am inspired by the life of Jason Padgett.  His thirst for knowledge and his passion to share it is inspiring to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LM1FJ2IUZ3MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544045602#wasThisHelpful","R3LM1FJ2IUZ3MQ","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mambo In Chinatown is about how the life of a twenty-two year old Chinese woman  is transformed when she becomes a professional ball room dancer and dance instructor.  I admire ball room dancer because of the athletic ability they possess.  I have never done ball room dancing, but I enjoy visualizing all the spins, lifts and turns that Jean Kwok describes.  I really like the title because I never thought Chinese people were known for being good ball room dancers.Charlie is a strong lead female character.  She starts the novel as a clumsy dish washer.  But through hard work and determination, she becomes a graceful ball room dancer. The professional chemistry and romance that develops between Charlie and her dance partner is a lovely relationship  that develops in the novel.  I learned that having a background in tai chi and boxing could help someone become a graceful dancer.  I also like the relationship between Charlie and her younger sister Lisa.  They are sisters, but because of an eleven year age difference their relationship is more like of a mother and daughter.  This relationship is beautiful.  Charlie feels enormous  pressure about having to be both a sister and a mother at the same time.  This is an aspect that makes Charlie's character so fascinating.  I like reading how she tries to juggle two different roles.  I am half Chinese.  So personally, I found the elements of Chinese culture included in this novel are fun to read. Kwok makes a reference to using the mugwort herb in acupuncture treatments.  I have never tried this before, but I wonder if it would help me with my back and joints.  She also makes a reference to eating caterpillar soup as a cure for the common cold.  She sounds like a strange remedy, but it is so far out there that I would not try it.  Kwok makes another reference to a dish called congee.  This is a delicious rice porridge that I enjoy eating.  There is also the theme of trying to please a Chinese person's parents while trying to live independently from them.  This is something I try to do more of in my own life  It is a theme that is handled very well in this novel.  I found Mambo In Chinatown to be an entertaining, moving and informative novel.  I really enjoyed it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBF6C7W2I7UPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594632006#wasThisHelpful","RBF6C7W2I7UPY","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Morning Phase""  is Beck's finest work.  All of these songs touches me either lyrically, thematically or musically.  ""Waking Light"" and ""Unforgiven"" are two songs that I enjoy lyrically.  These two songs are reminders to embrace the end of life and not to be afraid of it.  ""Heart is a Drum"" is a song that features beautiful piano playing.  I can listen to this song while riding in the car.  It is a song with a great beat that would always make me feel good. ""Morning"" is a song that gives me a sense of optimism that I can make the most of each day if I just slow down and accept things as they come.  This song is very soothing and lyrically beautiful.  ""Country Down"" is a song that contains thirty seconds of simple harmonica playing.  Country Down is the kind of song that gives me the courage not be afraid and  to explore different avenues in life.  ""Blackbird Chain"" is a song with simple acoustic guitar playing.  I have never seen a chain of black birds, so this song has a visually poetic quality for me.  ""Blue Moon"" is a song that features a few seconds of good mandolin playing.  The musical arrangements of ""Country Down"" Blackbird Chain"" and ""Blue Moon"" are flawless. These songs are superbly crafted both musically and lyrically.  I absolutely love this new album from Beck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W85ND3U583P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHYEOY0#wasThisHelpful","R1W85ND3U583P7","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edison and The Rise of Innovation is an biography by Leonard DeGraff  He works as an archivist at the Thomas Edison National Park in New Jersey.  Most biographies have just words in them.  This biography is special, because it is includes photos of all the inventions.  This biography also contains photos of the house where he lived and the lab where he worked. This biography is informative and inspiring to me.  I want to invent things to make the lives of disabled people like myself easier.  But, I will digress and offer my review of the book first. I am fascinated by Edison's range of scientific curiosity.  Most people know that Edison invented the electric light, but I learned that he started a company to develop things like cement, motion pictures and even rubber.  I learned that rubber can be made from the latex extracted by the golden rod flower.  I learned that latex can be extracted from 38,000 different species of flowers. This is just an amazing fact to learn.  Edison produced a film entitled The Life Of Abraham Lincoln in 1915.  I am a big movie fan. I would love to see the quality of a film that is a century old.  Edison unsuccessfully tried to market battery powered vehicles like cars and motorcycles.  This is due in large part to the preference to  Henry Ford's gas powered cars. in the early twentieth century.  There are really neat pictures of Edison's  early model vehicles in the book.  Even though, his batteries did not work in vehicles, they powered things like radios, boats and telephone switch boards. I am amazed at the versatility of Edison's inventions.Edison also invented the electric doll and the phonograph.  He put a phonograph into the doll that gave it the ability to speak.  He pioneered the first record club, in which people were sent  twenty records to listen to every month. Leonard  DeGraaf makes references to people I have never of like singer Enrico Caruso and actress Sarah Bernhardt.  I would love to listen to Caruso's music and watch Bernhardt's films just to see if I would like them.  This  Edison biography sparks the inventive spirit in me.  I would like to invent an inexpensive wheelchair that can move up steps and curbs.  I would also invent a sturdier portable walker that I could use at work and in airplanes when I travel.  I hope I can find the money, material and connections to make these inventions become reality someday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRE0NLF422O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402767366#wasThisHelpful","R1BRE0NLF422O4","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who's the Slow Learner is about a young man with Down Syndrome who received an inclusive education in the California public school system. I have always thought of myself as a slow learner because of my struggles with math.  The title of the book appealed to me because of it. This book chronicles Sean McElwee's experiences from  kindergarten to his senior year of high school. This book is unique because the author is Sean's mother.  She fights to get Sean the best educational experience both academically and socially.  She fights to get his lessons modified to his skill level.  This is a problem created when her son's teacher does not give his lessons to the inclusion specialist to modify for him.  Sean has cognitive delays in speaking, writing and reading, that is the reason for the modifications.  His mother also fights to get Sean a job as an assistant on the high school football team. A mother's love for her child truly has no limits.  Sandra Assimotos McElwee is a perfect example of that. Sean has the ability to advocate for himself.  I work with adults who have learning disabilities. I am always trying to get them to stand up for themselves and communicate what they want and need.  It is not easy to accomplish this. I love to read about Sean's passion for music.  He has played the trumpet and violin.  He also enjoys performing in theater and holds a black belt in karate. Sean is now nineteen years old and will soon live independently in his own apartment.  I am convinced hat  person with a disability can live a full and satisfying life with assistance. I am inspired by all of Sean McElwee's achievements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4VN3FYNQIDDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478725907#wasThisHelpful","R4VN3FYNQIDDL","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toni Braxton and Babyface sound so good on all these songs. I never thought I would enjoy listening to songs about love, marriage and divorce, but I love this album.  My favorite songs are the smooth jams ""Sweat"" and ""Roller Coaster"".  ""Heart Attack"" is a great dance song that gets me moving.  I also love the acoustic guitar playing on the song ""Where Did We Go Wrong"".  ""I Wish"" is a song with rather angry lyrics from the point of view of a woman scorned.  I hope any woman who breaks up with me doesn't feel this way about me.  ""I Wish"" features the most beautiful piano playing I have ever heard.  Another gem is the song ""I'd Rather Be Broke"".  The lyrics of this song are so powerful.  This song is a reminder that a woman can be strong and reclaim her dignity after a divorce.  ""The D Word"" is the prettiest song about divorce I have ever heard.  This song is about how difficult it can be to move on after a divorce.  ""Reunited"" is such a pretty love tune.  It makes me want to find a special woman and snuggle with her.  I love the voices of Toni Braxton and Babyface.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BQOBXFX2D0CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FUABIGU#wasThisHelpful","R2BQOBXFX2D0CR","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of the book attracted me to read it. I never thought about a philosophy of walking before.  Frederic Gros is a professor of philosophy at the University of Paris. Gros introduces the ideas of several famous philosophers  Gros also shares his thoughts about  walking.  He discusses three kinds of walking. They are the march, the pilgrimage and the stroll. I learned what each form of walking has achieved in history. I am inspired by the achievements of Gandhi.  He slowly marched for 44 days to protest a salt tax in 1930. His actions led to India's independence in 1947. His philosophy of non violence is something I strive for every day. Gros believes that strolling promotes pleasure, joy and serenity.  These are things that I definitely want more of in my life.  This little bit of knowledge motivates to reach these states of well being.  I can walk indoors with a walker.  This helps me to relax some what and achieve some clarity of mind. I am unable to stroll outdoors because of my physical disability, but I try to enjoy the outdoors as much as I can.  I am inspired by the words of Nietzsche.  He believed never to sit for too long.  He believed that the best ideas came to fruition because of physical movement. I am inspired by work of Thoreau who lived for two years by himself in a long cabin.  He believed that walking gives a person an appreciation for nature.  He also believed that walking helps a person detach from material possessions.  Gros devotes a chapter to a philosopher  named Rousseau.  He wrote two books entitled Reveries and The Inequality of Man.  He did this  by just  walking and observing around the country of France.  I am motivated to learn more about Rousseau just to learn about what he discovered and compare it to my own experiences with dealing with inequality. I would have appreciated a longer discussion about the books Rousseau wrote in his career. I learned about an edible cactus called peyote. People in Mexico make a pilgrimage of 400 kilometers annually to the Potosi desert to retrieve and consume this plant.  The peyote cactus improves headaches and depression.  Gros also makes a reference to the Kailash mountain in Tibet.  This beautiful mountain is topped with ice. I would love to visit Mexico and Tibet to see these two things for my myself.  A Philosophy of Walking inspires me to walk more for my health. Learning more about philosophy is always enjoyable for me too.This book makes me feel more enlightened.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I0CNSXC4GJXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781682704#wasThisHelpful","R3I0CNSXC4GJXG","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Silver People is a novel about the construction of the Panama Canal. The title is a reference to the payment of silver coins that dark skinned workers received for their labor.  White skinned workers received payments in gold.  White skinned workers received payments in gold.  They were compensated for their work when injured whereas dark skinned workers were not.  It is interesting to read about the discrimination that occurred in the early years of the twentieth century.  I learned that the Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, and that it took ten years and people from one hundred countries to build.I love the fictional characters in this novel.  There is a young Cuban teenager named Matteo.  He has a passion for drawing and painting animals. He is tasked to lift and move train tracks.  There is a Jamaican character. He is a man named Henry.  His job is to dig dirt.  I really like the relationship between these two characters.  Henry teaches Matteo how to speak Spanish.  Matteo teaches Henry how to speak Spanish.  Margarita Engle really communicates how physically punishing these men worked in the construction of the Panama Canal.  Although these characters are fictional, the hard work workers endured is not.  There is also a geological engineer named Augusto.  He is a character that uses maps to prevent landslides in the construction of the Panama Canal.  Last by not least, there is a woman named Anita.  She uses herbs to heal people who are sick.  I learned that basil can used to treat headaches.  The bark of a willow tree can be used to treat general pain.  The characters in this book are fascinating.  Margarita Engle could easily write an individual book about each one. This is a novel presented in the poetic verse format.  The poems are easy to understand and delightfully crafted. I have never read a poem about the plight of a tree from a point of view of a tree. The loss of a roots, leaves and even the trunks of a tree can be devastating.  They are helpless against things like an axe or a stick of dynamite.  Many trees were destroyed in the construction of the Panama Canal.  I love reading about a tree feels in these poems.  This book also contains poems about bullet ants who sting and glass frogs who sing.  They are poems about holler monkeys.  The hands of monkeys are valued souvenirs by tourists.  There is a strong visual quality.  This visual  quality makes these subjects poetic.  The human characters are also presented in a poetic form.  Each poem is from the point of view of a different character,  I love the format of this novel.  There is no confusion about which character is speaking.  I love every aspect about this novel entitled Silver People.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33HQW1JBFN7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544109414#wasThisHelpful","R33HQW1JBFN7L","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorite track is ""Same Love"" by Mackelmore and Ryan Lewis.  This is the first rap song that touches me.  This song is about having acceptance of every person regardless of their sexual orientation.  This is the strongest lyrical resonant  song on the disc. ""Brave"" by Sara Bareilles is another song that speaks to me lyrically.  This song makes me feel strong and to be afraid to say what I feel.  I am a big fan of Pink.  ""Just Give Me A Reason"" is a great pop duet.  I never thought I would like a song by Justin Timberlake.  I must confess that ""Mirrors"" is a song that has grown on me in the last year.  I like this song very much. I am not a big country fan, but I must confess that I like every country song on here. ""Merry Go Round"" features superb banjo playing.  This is the happiest song about dysfunctional lives I have ever heard.  Jason Aldean proves that country tunes can be simple subjects like taking a pretty girl out for a ride in a truck.  ""Take A Little Ride"" is a country song that really rocks. Taylor Swift proves that she is a talent as a solo artist with the pretty  song ""Begin Again"".  She also teams up on a touching duet entitled ""Highway Don't Care"". Blake Shelton has the kind of voice that touches me on the song ""Mine Would Be You"". I like this romantically sensitive country song.  This disc also contains great dance jams like ""Locked Out Of Heaven"", ""Blurred Lines"" and ""Get Lucky"". I'm sure I would hear  these three tunes the next time I am in a club or at a party.  I could not get into the song ""Radioactive"" lyrically, but I think it has a good beat to it.  I couldn't get into the song ""Swimming Pools"".  This song just turned me off lyrically with the use of the N word.  ""Lego House"" is another song that did not appeal to me.  I think Ed Sheeran's voice does not have a tone in his voice that makes want to pay attention to him.  I just wanted to share my opinion about this disc.  I really enjoyed most of the songs on this Grammy compilation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V1X6DNRR6EVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKI40HU#wasThisHelpful","R1V1X6DNRR6EVH","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beautiful voice of Rosanne Cash takes me to Biloxi. I have never been to Biloxi, but she communicates the beauty of this place so well in the song entitled Biloxi.  I can see the ocean. I can see the stars.  I love the acoustic guitar playing.  Biloxi is my favorite song from this album entitled  ""The River and The Thread"" ""World Of Strange Design"" is about a person drifting into new surroundings.  This song has a bluesy country tone that I really like.  I have never been a musician, but Rosanne Cash kind of communicates how lonely can be on the road for her on the song ""Etta's Tune"" and ""Modern Blue"".  I get the sense that living on the road is fun for her, but it is always great to come home to a loved one.  Many of these songs cause me reflect on my purpose in life for some reason.  ""Money Road"" is a song that makes me reflect on just how important money is not  at the end of my life.  ""Tell Heaven"" is a song that reminds me that I can still have hope and not believe in God. ""When The Master Makes The Roll"" is a song that makes me believe that my life is in the hands of God.  I really like the lyrics to both songs.  ""A Feather Is Not A Bird"" is a song that reminds me that I am connected to everything in nature. These songs make me ponder my very existence on earth. ""50,000 Watts"" is a song about the radio can be a source of hope in tough times.  I listen to the radio a lot when I feel sad, so this song really hits home. ""Night School"" is a song with a very soothing tone.  I don't know why it is called ""Night School"", but it is very relaxing to me. ""The River and The Thread"" is a very entertaining album by one of the biggest stars in music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7IPYXTJXU5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZRMIYY#wasThisHelpful","R1C7IPYXTJXU5A","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ice Dogs is an exciting novel.  It is about how two teenagers named Victoria and Chris spend a week in the  Alaskan forest.  They guide six husky dogs tied to a sled through the Alaska bush.  A bond of friendship forms as Victoria and Chris struggle to survive a week in the dangerous thinning ice and freezing snow.  They survive by eating twigs, hare and moose.  I can't imagine eating these things for my own survival.  Keeping the dogs alive and healthy is another factor that motivates them to survive and get home safely.  I love visualizing what Alaska looks like in this book. I think Alaska is a beautiful state, even though I have never been there.  It is so refreshing to see characters who possess unique qualities in a book.Victoria has a talent for hunting and trapping food. She also has a passion for racing sled dogs.  Chris has the ability to sew.  He uses his talent of sewing to make booties to keep the dogs warm.  He also has the ability to comfort Victoria when she feels lonely.  Victoria possess masculine qualities. Chris  possesses feminine qualities.  This book sends a great message to young readers.  One important  message is that it is acceptable to have masculine qualities and be a girl and vice versa.Another theme of Ice Dogs is the influence that a father can have a daughter.  It is very important for young girls to value the things that their father can teach them. Ice Dogs is a reminder that a parent's legacy can live on in their child after they have passed on.Ice Dogs is targeted to young readers from fourth grade up. The main character is a brave young girl, which will naturally appeal to young readers. It is also a book that contains the element of friendship and survival.  I found these themes appealing enough for me to recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25TYR80UPO79V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547899262#wasThisHelpful","R25TYR80UPO79V","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dangerous Neighbors highlights the positive and negative aspects of volcanic activity.  A volcano is a tourist attraction in many countries.  In Italy, people trek to Mount Vesuvius to enjoy a warm mud bath or enjoy a swim in a hot swimming pool.  This is possible because of the volcanic activity. I live in Hawaii.  I have seen the beauty of a lava flow.  I don't mean to sound ignorant, but I did not know how mud flows ash flows and steam can also cause damage to a landscape.  This book reinforces my belief that a while a volcano can cause great destruction, it can also produce great beauty. In the Philippines, people enjoy fresh tilapia fish in the crates of Taal volcano.  There is a neat picture in the book of a stamp that commemorates the eruption of the Taal volcano in 1965.  Tourists climb Mount Fuji in Japan ever year despite the volcanic activity around the area.  Ecuador  grows the most beautiful roses because of the volcanic activity. Coffee beans grown in Washington State can create delicious expresso coffee that I love to drink. This book also highlights the destructive effects that a volcano can have on a country.  Volcano ash destroyed an elementary school in Japan.  I learned that volcanic ash contains glassy particles that can melt anything it touches.  The steam from a volcano has enough force to create physical damage as well. Volcano can emit large amounts of carbon dioxide that makes it hard to breathe.  I learned that mud flows from a volcano can have a powerful effect on land.  Mud flows killed mammoth elephants in Mexico City.  I wish this book explained more how scientists study the ground for volcanic activity, and how they can detect harmful gases from volcanoes.  I think that would have been fascinating to learn.  The information that Grant Heiken does provide is interesting enough for me to recommend this book.  Dangerous Neighbors motivates me to do more research of volcanoes on my own to learn more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O0X9JQWU2YVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107039231#wasThisHelpful","R1O0X9JQWU2YVC","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of extreme medicine is that medical practices being used today can be traced to something in the past.  There is a story of Robert Scott who died hypothermia exploring Antarctica in 1912. His death has lead to innovations in the treatment of hypothermia.  It is now possible to warm up a person's cold blood and reinsert it back into their body to save their life.  It is also possible to cool a person's body so that a blood vessel in the heart can be repaired.  The development of what how to directly treat victims of trauma started in the late seventies because of the airplane crash.  I did not know that trauma procedures were relatively new/ Not every chapter in this book follows this linear fashion, but I did enjoy reading this book nonetheless.  There is a story about a young man who suffered disfigurement because of an electrical burn. He received a face transplant. I have never heard of a person getting a face transplant before.  I learned that a person's immune system can reject the transplanted face. This is similar to how a body can reject an organ like a lung or kidney.  This is all fascinating information to learn.  Kevin Fong is a doctor, but he also has a degree in astrophysics.  He briefly worked for NASA. and includes his thoughts about being in orbit.  I learned that it is possible to give chest compressions using my feet for a person who is in cardiac arrest in outer space.  Fong does not include a photo of this, but I believe that it can be done.The photos in this book are fun to look at. There is a photo of an ice cave in Antarctica.  There is also a photo of Fong floating inside a space capsule called the vomit comet.  There is another photo of him scuba diving in the Red Sea.  His bravery and his sense of adventure is shown in these pictures.Fong includes a chapter about his thoughts about the planet Mars.  He believes that will be possible to travel to Mars once we have better anti gravity and technology to handle the radiation on Mars.  The distance between Earth and Mars is always changing, so it is important to time our planetary exploration just right to accomplish what needs to be done there.Kevin Fong includes the stories of some remarkable people. I learned that Soyeon Yi became the first female astronaut from South Korea.  She guided a capsule into space and guided it back to earth.  I am inspired by the story of James Hudson.  He had very little formal education, but he became a dental apprentice and dental surgeon.  He remained mentally sharp throughout his life and lived until the age of 103.

"Innocent Blood is an exciting book of religious fiction.  The plot centers around three main characters who are part of a religious prophecy to stop Armageddon.  One person is an archeologist.  She is known for her intelligence.  Another person is a warrior of man.  He is a soldier known for his bravery.  The third person in the trio is a priest.  He is known for his religious strength and knowledge.  I haven't read the previous books in the series.  I did not know how these characters were connected at first.  The relationship between the characters is believable.  They compliment each other well with their unique qualities. They are trying to prevent the unleashing of Armageddon at the hands of Judas Iscariot in this novel.  Judas Iscariot is a disciple of Jesus Christ.  He is known for his betrayal of Jesus.  It is interesting to see how a Biblical character is woven into a novel of religious fiction. They are also hunted by immortal beings called Strigoi.  These are people who love to draw human blood with their fangs. The character of Elizabeta is another interesting character.  She is a five hundred year old strigoi trying to adjust to life in the 21st century after centuries of imprisonment.Innocent Blood is set in beautiful locales that I would love to visit.  I would love to see the beautiful St. Peter's basilica in Rome.  I would love to see the winter paradise of Stockholm.  I would even like to see the oasis in the desert of Egypt.  Innocent Blood is also a thought provoking book.  It makes me think of all things I would do if I became immortal.  It would be neat to be immortal because I would get to see all the new innovations being developed.  A character in this book has the chance to undo his greatest sin.

"Social physics is a social science that attempts to explain how the spread of ideas leads to new behaviors.  The author is a man named Alex Pentland.  He is a data scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He talks about two main elements that spread the flow of new ideas that lead to new behaviors.  The two practices at the core of social physics are exploration and engagement.  Exploration involves trying out new ideas by getting a diversity of input from different people.  Engagement means getting people actively in the decision making process. These two pieces of information will help me become a better job coach and theater actor.  In both jobs, I am working with people from many different backgrounds.  Every person that I come into contact is valuable.  They can either assist me in helping another person find a job. A person with a performing arts background can assist me in developing new plays for the theater. It is imperative that I continue to make strong social ties with people in both careers to be successful.I also learned the value of slow and fast thinking in this book.  Slow thinking is helpful when I have to use reasoning to make a decision.  Fast learning is ideal for a task I do regularly like exercising or leaning a new bus route.  I believe that as a theater actor and a job coach, I have to be good at slow and fast learning.  I have to be good at slow learning when I am learning new lines or making my initial assessment of a new client.  I have to be good at fast learning when I need to perform on the stage.  I also need to be good at fast learning when I find a job that matches a client's abilities.  These two concepts are interesting and very applicable to my life.Alex Pentland also discusses future innovations that will help monitor or store information. I am fascinated with the idea of socio metric badges.  This badge contains location sensors and a microphone.  This badge will have the ability to quantify my body language and my tone of voice. It can also monitor the frequency that I talk to one individual.  Google maps are developing maps that will show data like the poverty level and crime level of a certain location. A  personal data store is another innovation that I will probably use.  This is a tool or application that I can use to store and share data about a particular subject.I learned a lot from this book.  I really enjoyed it.  I can use social physics to continue to excel in my career.  I can use social physics to find a new place to live.  I can also use social physics to make new friends. Maybe I can use social physics to  find a wife when I am ready.  I hope social physics will change my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WI69K2OFMBYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205655#wasThisHelpful","R2WI69K2OFMBYC","AE31M52VLKOG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE31M52VLKOG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent soundtrack. ""Frozen"" contains songs that I can sing to and enjoy.  Idina Menzel sings the Let It Go"".  This song is a gem.  It celebrates a character in the movie and her power to make beautiful things out of ice.  It is the kind of song that just makes me more confident in myself. ""For The Time In Forever"" is a song that symbolizes hope for a better life.  I really like the lyrics to this song.  Kristen Bell shows that she has a talent for singing too.  I never knew that she could sing.  ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"" is very pretty  song that celebrates the joy of being a child. ""Love Is an Open Door"" is a song about the optimism of love.  These are well written songs from the people who provides the music for the hit musical ""Book Of Mormon"". Jonathan Groff  sings a short funny song entitled ""Reindeer are Better Than People"". Josh Gad provides an equally funny tune about a snow man in summer. The instrumental music score of Christoph Beck is a perfect compliment to all of the songs.

"The compression sleeve helps alleviate the pain from my Baker's Cyst.  I like that it's lighter weight than a traditional neoprene knee brace and fits smoothly under pants.  But the top band doesn't stay up...it slides down to the knee joint and the top part of the sleeve becomes bunched up around the knee.  I'll wear it at home where I can pull it up throughout the day.

"I've been wearing these insoles daily for months, and my plantar fasciitis has improved significantly.  The shorter front ends just past the ball of my foot so your toes aren't cramped. The arch support is fantastic!  It felt too high at first, but that was only because the bottoms of my feet were painfully swollen. Once the pain starts to subside I found the arch height to be a perfect support. The heel has a squishy gel circle that is super comforting to painful heels.  I now have a pair of these insoles in all my favorite shoes and household slippers so I can wear them inside. The pain has subsided to the point where I can walk barefoot getting out of bed to use the bathroom during the night, and standing in the shower is no longer painful.  Together with exercises and a night brace, I don't even know that I have a plantar fasciitis problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQZHY4LKYLSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKGD1R0#wasThisHelpful","R1EQZHY4LKYLSM","A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We setup a photo ""booth"" at the company picnic and took instant photos to give the guests. It was a huge success!  The light meter helped determine the best setting for a well-lit outdoor photo. Guests enjoyed watching their photo develop too!  We took over 60 photos in a matter of hours and everyone was delighted with the results. Using the Instax Mini 8 camera instead of a digital camera ended up being a fantastic idea.The flash is bright. Really bright!  To help diffuse the flash I covered it with a piece of clear contact paper.  It helps when taking close-up portraits. I also dialed down the aperture setting when the subjects wore white and light colors to keep them from being overexposed.  The photo booth portraits came out great!The camera works great.  Film packs are easy to load and the picture counter is large and easy to read.  The lens takes a wider angle picture than you see through the view finder, so take that into consideration when you're framing your subjects.  I wear eyeglasses and found the viewfinder to be a bit small.  A larger viewfinder would improve the photographer's experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29KB2B4HLNKCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWKJPOK#wasThisHelpful","R29KB2B4HLNKCH","A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used this flip pan about 6 months and really like it! I use it to make pancakes and eggs on weekends and think it does a great job. Pancakes come out nice and round, all the same size, about 6"" in diameter. Super easy to flip without breaking the pancake. Liquid cooking spray or butter may drip out when you flip, so wipe the stove top when you're done. No big deal. Close the pan lid while the pancake is cooking, and the lid will be the perfect temperature when it's time to flip. Once you've buttered both surfaces, the pancake slides out each time. I don't flip eggs...it just seems unnecessary. Use a little butter and your eggs will slide out effortlessly.This isn't high-end cookware, so don't expect fine workmanship. The riveted pan hinge joints aren't tight so the lid opens freely. Any tighter and the metal would grind. The tiny bit of sloppy fit hasn't been a problem. The green cooking surface has not chipped or flaked off anywhere. The riveted handle assembly fits well against the pan and is not loose or sloppy. The edges of the pan meet with no gaps.Overall I recommend this pan because it makes perfectly round pancakes and flipping them is really easy. It does what it's supposed to do! I don't understand the bad reviews for this product as there's nothing wrong with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKOBLT4VK9UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWCC3C4#wasThisHelpful","REKOBLT4VK9UT","A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First time user! I followed the instructions and they fit over the claws easily. One fell off because I didn't use enough glue. My cat chewed off a few tips, but the cap stayed on and worked fine. He got used to the caps after a few days and stopped picking at them. The caps fell off one by one, and only 2 were left after 6 weeks. Those 2 claws had grown out enough to use the clippers to remove the remaining cap. It was an easy job.Second application! Used the Halloween Combo...really cute! My cat is used to wearing nail caps now and hasn't picked at them. I made sure to use enough glue and squeezed the tip of each cap after applying it, to make sure it stays on.Capped nails cause no damage to sofas, carpeting or kitchen cabinets.

Gone is the finesse that Laura Harris brought to the character, which is what made Daisy so endearing and lovely. It's hard to say whether the problem with the character is more due to the writing or how the actor, Sarah Wynter, portrayed her.

"Hello everyone, I'd like to comment on this fabulous mower! I purchased the mower in spring 2004 and have had ZERO problems, ZERO maintenance and ZERO hassles for the last 5 (yes, five!) mowing seasons. The original blade is dull and needs to be sharpened, so I've decided to purchase a replacement and have two blades on hand. I'm glad I chose the corded version of the mower. The rechargeable battery model would likely need a replacement battery by now too. I highly recommend this mower for small yards with minimal obstacles.Pros: Lightweight, easy for a woman to maneuver, easy to clean with a broom, easy to raise and lower mowing deck. The handle switch works flawlessly, every time. One hour of mowing every week doesn't even make a blip on my electric bill.Cons: After 2 years of weekly mowing, the paint on the handle was worn off completely. Having to step over the cord with every left turn is only somewhat annoying considering the money I've saved on gas and maintenance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LXSLQBCLLK4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005AKZG#wasThisHelpful","R3LXSLQBCLLK4W","A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I give this automatic box a one-star rating because it's simply ineffective and waste of money.There are a few good things about the box: Largest litterpan for a scooping box, waste collection tray uses easy-to-change bags, and the motor is fairly quiet.But it's absolutely horrible at picking up the waste. Solid waste fits between the rake tines and gets left behind. Since clumped waste sticks to the litterpan sides and bottom, the leading edge of the rake breaks up the clumps and leaves them behind, leaves them stuck on the rake or (worst) flung over the edge of the box.I allowed a one-week testing period for each of my two cats.  The first cat peed over the edge of the box because he has bad aim, and the sides of the box aren't high.  The second cat has better aim, but was afraid of the green power light. So I powered the unit off while I was at work, came home and let the box auto scoop. After repeated auto-scoops the waste collection bin remained EMPTY. The waste was either stuck to the rake or scattered around the box. I've never seen a box do such a bad job at scooping. The rake doesn't get close enough to the bottom of the pan, which is one of the reasons the clumps don't stay intact.After two trials I've given up on the box and gone back to scooping by hand.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T63TCAS41NAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V1YE00#wasThisHelpful","R2T63TCAS41NAU","A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Control buttons are simple and intuitive: start/stop recording, zoom in/out, forward & back to select recorded videos, play video/stop play, trash can to delete, volume up & down. Connectors include tripod mount, RCA output cable for TV hookup, USB connector plugs directly into your PC. SOFTWARE IS INSTALLED on the videocamera! Unexpected surprises: red ""recording"" light comes on beside lens & mic. Two AA batteries (included) eliminate the need to recharge batteries between uses. 2GB memory holds 60 min of recorded video - plenty for a weekend outing or maybe even vacation.SOFTWAREThe video editing & uploading software is installed on the camera. This cool feature allowed my friend to download videos onto her Mac before I left the party! It was super simple. At home I edited the video and published it on MySpace! Editing options are quite basic but very functional: cut, add styles such as black & white, sepia, kaliedoscope, add flip background music with/without original audio, combine video clips into a movie. The software automatically fades the video & audio between clips (nice feature). There's a software update avaiable online, now MySpace compatible. If Amazon doesn't delete my video link below you can see my first attempt. The guys in the dark room were barely visible (absolutely no light except for the video game). Not the camera's fault. Oh, and you can also capture still snapshots from video.See my first movie:  [...]CONSThe movie-making software takes video clips in the order they're saved and won't let you change the order (hence a 4-star rating instead of 5). You'd think that would be a drag & drop feature, but no. So in order to get my video clips in the correct order I had to rename and resave them in the desired order. Argh! I don't think you can voice over the video, and the music-over-audio option offers one track (I didn't choose that option for my video).

I normally have to accelerate my mouse speed, but had to slow this mouse down to 4.5-5 for use in Windows applications and online.The size of this mouse is a bit larger than average, and measures 4.5 inches in length and 1.5 inches high at its highest point. It would probably be extremely comfortable in a large man's hand, but is too large for a woman to use comfortably because it keeps easing forward out of my hand. The sleek satiny texture is almost sinful but makes it difficult for a smaller hand to grip. If it was available in a smaller size I'd exchange it.The included software is easy to use and offers complete customization of mouse functions. What makes this mouse appealing for Guild Wars fans is the illuminated scroll wheel and glowing logo. The logo glow fades on and off, the scroll wheel glows steady.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H960GOHFZ9ZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V9X2TG#wasThisHelpful","R1H960GOHFZ9ZU","A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this iron a few months ago because I liked the temperature dial location and ease of adjustment. Many irons have the dial beneath the handle which is awkward. When it comes to certain household appliances, I'm a fan of keeping it simple. Ironing should be simple! This iron has good, simple features but fails when metal hits fabric.Pros:This iron has a sufficiently large water tank, enough for several days' worth of clothing. Tank fill hole is accessible. Cord is 10 foot long and rotates freely in its base. The instructions say it heats in 90 seconds, and it's steaming just as quick.Cons:The soleplate is horrible. The front tip is squared off and it catches as I'm ironing twill pants, have to continuously readjust fabric. The edges of the soleplate aren't rounded enough, so again the iron doesn't flow smoothly across the fabric. And I think my iron runs too hot for the fabric selection guide. I melted a poly/cotton sweater just enough that the front of the soleplate got sticky. And even though I cleaned it off, the sticky keeps coming back. Note to self: must use lower temperature than the guide suggests. The soleplate coating is already wearing off.Overall, if you want an inexpensive iron in case company stops by, this iron would suffice. But if you iron daily (every morning before I get dressed), look for something with a smooth soleplate that will glide better. I'll probably be donating this iron to the secondhand store as soon as I find something better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EN2I15MWCOC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZN3EXW#wasThisHelpful","R2EN2I15MWCOC5","A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GCKBZ5B7XHPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an interesting, often funny, “airport read” about psychopathy. It begins with a suitably oddball incident, after which Ronson explores psychopaths, their behavior, diagnosis, and the mental health industry’s attempts to treat them. He remains appropriately ironic, and the reader will wonder whether the psychologists who treat psychopaths - or the journalist who writes about them, or the reader who reads about them - has psychopathic characteristics.Unfortunately, the subtitle highlights the book’s weakness, which is a superficial view of the “madness industry.”  Ronson would have been better to stick with the disorder itself.  Embedded in here is a critique of how the profession diagnoses people with any condition.  Basically, a psychologist will use a checklist to score a patient from zero to 40 points, with an arbitrary threshold of 30 points for a diagnosis. Ronson implies that everyone gets a single-digit score, and that many healthy people have some larger numbers - but he doesn’t really explore the question or dig up any evidence on it.  However, that question would provide a stronger foundation for the critique of the “madness industry” that he wants to make.Even so, it’s a very well-written book into a fascinating subject, and well worth a read. He also manages to treat his subjects with empathy throughout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R220796JP8T1TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594485755#wasThisHelpful","R220796JP8T1TM","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"African-Americans, and some other minority groups, participate in outdoor “adventure” recreation at much lower rates than other Americans. Mills documents those differences, but mostly tells a hopeful tale of blacks who have climbed mountains, explored the polar regions, or become NOLS instructors. He builds the story around an all-black expedition up Denali, financed by NOLS and some equipment manufacturers and retailers.The book is a quick and engaging read.  Mills doesn’t try to be a prose stylist but writes more like a well-paced sportswriter. His subjects on Denali are an interesting bunch that come from diverse backgrounds, and he also introduces us to the first African-Americans to climb Denali and Everest. Mills also retells the story of Matthew Henson, who was the first person to reach the North Pole (with his partner Robert Peary). Many will find those stories inspiring.The book belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who likes to read about climbing, exploration, or outdoor recreation more generally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P0KX2TE1II70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594858683#wasThisHelpful","R3P0KX2TE1II70","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection focuses on some quirky characters in Wyoming, several set in the fictional town of Elk Tooth - a kind of Wyoming Lake Wobegon. They are mostly fun, sometimes a bit silly. The characters’ names are often over-the-top, with back stories to match.A few have some punch, like the view of trailer life in “The Wamsutter Wolf.” Unfortunately, and like some others, it ends too abruptly, without trusting the characters to work through a turn of events. Too often she seems to go for the punchline and not the larger human story - stories about beard contests and a mania for hot tubs are all jokes, leaving no substance behind.That larger story is evident in “What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?”, a kind of lament for every failing ranch whose kids make a new life in the city. The challenges of being a newcomer in a community also motivate “Man Crawling Out of Trees,” though I found it hard to care for key characters.Inevitably, and unfairly, we’ll compare it to “Close Range” and its masterpiece, “Brokeback Mountain.” This collection is simply not as good, not as deep. But the characters are often fun, and the stories funny.

"The band has a weakness for juvenile marketing - witness the album art, lyrics intended to “shock” (but not too much), and a bit of fakery that will remind you of “When Harry Met Sally.” If you ignore all that and listen, you’ll find a serious hard rock band in the tradition of Pat Benatar and Joan Jett.

"Bowen, William G. with Kelly A. Lack. 2013. Higher Education in the Digital Age. New York: ITHAKA and Princeton: Princeton University Press.This book is built on Bowen’s Tanner Lectures at Stanford. In those lectures, Bowen discussed the “cost disease” in higher education and offered online education as one way to address costs while maintaining or improving learning outcomes.  In addition to worrying about both learning outcomes and costs, Bowen is sensitive to administrative issues and the implications of digital learning for faculty governance – not surprisingly, as a past president of Princeton University.His colleague Kelly Lack has reworked these lectures into a more “academic,” but still very accessible format, adding data, footnotes, and the like.  The book also includes responses from eminent faculty, administrators, and online enthusiasts. Not surprisingly, their comments vary in quality but even the weaker ones raise some provocations worth considering.Since it's based on Bowen's lectures, the book is necessarily more of an overview than a closely-argued tome. However, the format also makes it an accessible, easy read. If you’re interested in the implications of online education for the modern university, with some secondary attention to nuts-and-bolts issues such as pedagogy and course design, you will find this book very useful.  The notes and references also point you toward other good sources for future reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R369MFSRVN8BS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691165599#wasThisHelpful","R369MFSRVN8BS0","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection of essays explores Terry Tempest Williams’ relations with natural landscapes, mostly in the West. It’s advertised as Williams’ “stories from the field,” essays written away from her home in Salt Lake City. That’s not quite right, though - while there are stories from the Serengeti and elsewhere, the essays are mostly grounded in the American desert Southwest, in places like Moab. Because place is important to her, it’s actually best that most stay close to home.The book includes a healthy focus on antinuclear and peace activism, which follow from her concerns in “Refuge.” However, her more successful essays provide a woman’s voice in the male-dominated area of environmental writing. Her essays include reflections on some of these men, such as an eulogy of Edward Abbey. The collection is not nearly as good as her breakout “Refuge,” but the essays are well worth reading if you like environmental writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0CIMO1W1DOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679752560#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0CIMO1W1DOW","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At its surface, this book chronicles the climbing history of Cerro Torre, in Patagonia. This is an elite-level mountain, known both for its big wall rock and its ferocious and unpredictable weather. Cordes has the climbing skills to tell this story, having climbed Cerro Torre and many other world-class peaks.In addition to a serviceable collection of maps and a glossary of climbing terms, the book has an abundance of photographs. The color plates are glorious, while black-and-white photos in the text provide documentary support to the text.Much of the book concerns two controversies, both connected with Cesare Maestri.  Maestri has the first claimed ascent of Cerro Torre, in 1959, in a climb that claimed the life of his partner, Toni Egger. Some doubted Maestri’s claims at the time, and subsequent evidence has made them increasingly dubious. Maestri returned to Cerro Torre in 1970, when he used a gas-powered air compressor to drill 400 bolts in the Southeast Ridge. This Compressor Route is out of step with modern climbing aesthetics; Hayden Kennedy and Jason Kruk removed 120 of Maestri’s bolts after making the first fair means ascent of the Southeast Ridge.In addition to climbing narratives, the book tells of Cordes’ research into the history of Cerro Torre.  Some chapters tell stories of his interviews in Italy and Argentina, mostly interesting, but one simply documents that Cordes has met Reinhold Messner.The book gets off to a somewhat disorganized start, but then settles mostly into a straightforward chronology in its 36 short chapters. It could have used a stronger editorial hand, perhaps combining the scattered accounts of his research into a single Part, for example. In addition, many of the chapters feel as if they were reprinted from climbing magazines, which explains some repetition in the book.All in all, this is worth reading if you like climbing books. It won’t reach the level of the classics, but it could have been a better book with strong editing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSR2W5UIQ17S7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938340337#wasThisHelpful","RSR2W5UIQ17S7","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This latest entry in C. J. Box’s Joe Pickett series continues his tradition of great suspense. However, my favorites in the series have been the books that engage larger social or political issues.I won’t rehash the plot, but I’ll mention one frustration that weakens the overall story.  I’ve tried to avoid a spoiler but if you don’t even want a hint of a spoiler, stop reading here.Early on in the book, two characters end up in comas as a result of separate incidents. As it turns out, comas are a weak plot device because they give the author arbitrary power over how the story turns out.  Whether each of these people lives or dies does not depend on their character, their choices, or any other conventional element of fiction. While we may care about what happens to them, it’s essentially a flip of the coin.Despite what the title implies, this book fails to achieve the standards of some of his previous books. It remains a successful exercise in suspense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33611E9TOQRPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399160779#wasThisHelpful","R33611E9TOQRPR","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoy McPherson’s histories, and I enjoyed this one too. Still, it was a bit of a disappointment. The concept is great - seeing the Civil War through the eyes of Jefferson Davis, as a way of evaluating his performance as commander-in-chief. In execution, unfortunately, it was too often just another retelling of the Civil War. McPherson does that well, seeing the big picture and narrating it well. But we’ve seen such a narrative many times before.He might have done two things to help us see Davis better. First, McPherson could have explored the political environment in greater depth. McPherson shows us the internal politics of the Confederate Army in detail but gives much less attention to the Confederate legislatures and especially the state governors. Second, I would have liked to see more discussion in the abstract of the grand strategy choices that Davis faced. McPherson explains why Davis chose an “offensive-defensive” strategy, but other options appear only in a few pages at the end.McPherson’s overall evaluation of Davis is fair-minded. He rightly criticizes how Davis handled personnel matters in the army, but tends to think that he did pretty well otherwise. The book is certainly worth a read for people interested in the Civil War. I'd probably give it four stars from an unknown author, but from McPherson I expected more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5XRA0NV4PULS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204977#wasThisHelpful","R5XRA0NV4PULS","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now a professor of English, Mark Edmundson spent two years as a high school football player in his youth – years that coincided both with certain kinds of character development and certain kinds of juvenile delinquency. In this book, he explores how football encourages both kinds of development, and how the good kind may come at the cost of the bad kind.The essays here draw from several sources – his personal experiences in football; his life, family, and his musings on the same; books and articles on the game of football; and poetry and philosophy. Using poetry to talk about football is, in my experience, unique. It was certainly interesting to read him compare the characters of the Iliad to those who play football.Edmundson writes well, and the book moves along smartly. Though I greatly enjoyed the first half, toward the end the content started to thin out and it felt as if he was padding pages at times. That’s unfortunate because there are topics he could have explored. Edmundson mentions that he had access to the University of Virginia football team, and to a coach for the Oregon Ducks. Despite that access, the book doesn’t discuss the college game except as something to which high school athletes aspire.Though he recognizes the issue in passing, Edmundson also neglects the connections between football violence and domestic violence – a salient issue as yet another such incident appeared in the news as I was writing this review. This issue is not unique to football among sports, nor unique to sports among human activity, but still football seems particularly prone to this problem.One might also explore why coaching seems dominated by screamers and masochists; there are some famous coaches who seem to succeed by making more use of positive reinforcement than negative reinforcement. It seems to me that the game could improve positive character development by focusing on coaches, an issue that Edmundson does not discuss at all.  Still, it’s a measure of Edmundson’s skill as a writer that he left me wishing he had done more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DC7OD26O8HLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205752#wasThisHelpful","R2DC7OD26O8HLT","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These essays come from Rick Lamplugh’s experience volunteering at Yellowstone’s Bison Ranch one winter. He and other volunteers kept the ranch clean, cooked, and assisted with the Yellowstone Association’s tours and classes in the Lamar Valley - the “Serengeti of North America.”Lamplugh writes well, and the essays are a pleasure to read. He has some novel perspectives, such as a growing frustration with photographers who endanger both people and wildlife with their obsession over getting “the money shot.” Other themes are familiar – Yellowstone is cold in winter, it can be dangerous, the wildlife is great. An essay on watching a bull elk try to fend off a wolf pack over two days explores the question whether we are really comfortable watching death in nature. That’s a common theme, examined by many writers, but Lamplugh’s perspective – watching wildlife watchers – is new.If you have a shelf of Yellowstone books, this one belongs there. It will also appeal to many people who enjoy essays about wildlife and nature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35U282RY76JRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1490372059#wasThisHelpful","R35U282RY76JRY","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy the Anna Pigeon series but dislike the endings that depend on Anna engaging in superhuman feats to stop the bad guys (or, rarely, gals). I think that physical fights, like car chases in films, are lazy plot devices.It came as a surprise, then, that I very much liked this book. Here, derring-do is not a plot device - - it’s the entire plot. Anna has to take out the bad guys, one after another, when her friends are kidnapped in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. It’s “Die Hard” in the Minnesota backcountry. The potential victims include some people we met in an earlier book, and the characters are drawn well enough for us to care about them. But mostly the book is action from Anna's perspective, a growing sense of doom among the bad guys, and a roller-coaster of emotions from Anna's friends.Fun for the whole family, if the family likes violent films.There’s a cute little coda at the end, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4IJQ43O5YRG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312614586#wasThisHelpful","R4IJQ43O5YRG5","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this collection, we get to see C. J. Box work in a short story format, a departure from his usual novels. Like any collection, there are good ones and bad ones. My overall reaction, unfortunately, is that Box’s strengths don’t play well in the shorter format. One of those strengths is a strong sense of place (Wyoming), but the shorter format doesn’t usually give him the time to do that.  It’s telling that the strongest sense of time and place is “The End of Jim and Ezra,” set inside a winter-bound cabin in 1835. The short format gives Box plenty of time to explore the inside of a cabin and its two inmates.Three of the ten stories feature game warden Joe Pickett, the subject of most of Box’s novels, and a fourth tells of Joe’s friend Nate Romanowski. Because these characters will be familiar to most readers of this collection, Box gets to cheat a bit - he doesn’t have to develop the characters for the story to work. The character development in several other stories relies too much on shortcuts and stereotypes such as the impossible boss, the wronged husband, the Saudi prince and his minions. There are exceptions, of course; I liked the mixture of playfulness and cynicism in the way Box developed the lead character in a story of American Indians working for the Wild West Show in Disney Paris.These short stories often set up a twist ending, though you can see some of those endings coming. They often end abruptly - bang, it’s over. The longest denouement as a share of the story comes in “Blood Knot,” a 1000-word story of three generations in which the ending unfolds over a few hundred words.Many of these stories originally appeared in obscure analogies and, well, sometimes there’s a reason for that. A few were commissioned for oddball projects, which often doesn’t bode well. (“Pirates of Yellowstone” was for a volume inspired by the Bruce Springsteen song, “Meeting across the River.”) Some work, some don’t. While Box’s many fans will want to have the book on their shelf, it’s not strong enough to win new fans over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVV81B6RECAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158588#wasThisHelpful","R2PVV81B6RECAO","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s pretty common to write an environmental book by starting with the bad news and then ending with a hopeful story. Greenberg turns that structure on its head, starting with New York oyster restoration and ending with a massive threat to Alaskan salmon. I liked the way this worked, which made the book’s optimism more realistic than the conventional structure. Fixing things is *hard*, and it’s much better to prevent the harm in the first place. That’s the lesson of these three stories.Oysters, shrimp, and salmon all face large-scale threats from pollution, and the fishing industry must also adapt to changing global markets. In addition, Greenberg emphasizes the social connection between people and their own seafood resources. If New Yorkers eat local oysters, they will care about the health of their waters; so too Gulf shrimpers. International trade destroys those social and political connections. For Greenberg, eating locally becomes a political strategy.These trends make visible the dangers to the Bristol Bay salmon fishery. Most of the salmon are exported to Asia; Greenberg would rather the salmon was exported to the Lower 48. It’s not clear how that supports his locavore strategy. Most worrisome is the pollution from the Pebble Mine (and others) in the Bristol Bay watershed. It’s striking that these huge mines are worth *less* money that the fishery. Unfortunately, a few large corporations can organize more easily than thousands of fishing boats.Greenberg emphasizes locavorism as a solution. He expects that giving local consumers a bigger stake in their fisheries will mobilize them against habitat destruction and pollution. I’m not sure that solution can explain the New York oyster case he describes, where the city just gave up on its oysters and imported what it wanted. I would also be curious what Greenberg would say to those of us who don’t live on the coast, especially those who love seafood.

We meet various characters; many will matter for the central drama of the book, but a few matter only for their own stories. We hear a distant storm coming, and we know what, in that time and place, will presumably be coming.The tragedy comes, and we see the people of the town and countryside react - some as you might predict, some not. As events unfold, we see a remarkable characterization of a place, a time, and the individuals who live there, and then.Through it all, we also see our narrator, Scout, start to grow up. We see her older brother grow up a little more. Their father, Atticus Finch, is a model of heroism in a prejudiced small-town – but that understates who he is. The women in town, some of whom we like and some of whom we don’t, help Scout come to understand Atticus as a man of many virtues and keen insight into the human condition.Lee tells the story in Scout’s voice, who is recalling events of her childhood. Jumping back and forth between a child’s discovery and an adult’s wisdom, Lee achieves a rich narrative that touches on many different themes both personal and political. A stunning achievement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NUITC3E3DQI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446310786#wasThisHelpful","R2NUITC3E3DQI0","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is, of course, an American classic. Mitchell uses the story of Scarlett O’Hara and her romance with Rhett Butler to tell the story of the American South before and after the Civil War. She takes the standpoint of upper-class white Southerners to defend ante bellum Southern culture and decry the Yankee victory in the war. She also examines how some people survive a catastrophe while others fall apart. It is epic, and a major accomplishment.Mitchell is a great storyteller, at her most effective when using dialogue to move the story forward. She is less good in long passages of narration, where she tells us things about her characters that she has already made clear through dialogue and actions. Those narrative sections also provide her with the opportunity to state her political views, most of which have not aged well since 1936 (or 1865).Scarlett is the protagonist here, but Mitchell emphasizes her stupidity, amorality, and naivete instead of her courage or “gumption.” I would rather have Mitchell avoid passing judgment in her own voice, and let the reader evaluate Scarlett. Though Scarlett is the main character, Rhett steals the show - a remarkable character, complex, and one who undergoes some interesting changes through the story.If you are approaching this story for the first time, you should know that the book is full of offensive, racist language. This reflects the time and place where the book is set, and the language helps develop characters. Slaves use the N-word in complex ways, using it to referring to lower-status slaves and sometimes to themselves. Whites may also use the word, though a “better” class of slaveowners will use substitute terms that are also offensive today. Even more so than “Huck Finn,” to open this book is to make a decision to read offensive words used in a historically realistic way.The book is also suffused with politics out of step with modern America. The upper-class whites who dominate the story, and with whom Mitchell sympathizes, believe that blacks were better off as slaves than they were after emancipation; at the same time, Mitchell and her characters believe (inconsistently) that freed blacks were lazy freeloaders who were better off than their former masters.  It may be possible to argue that Mitchell does not share these views, but the most obvious reading is that Mitchell believes that slaves were better off before the Civil War than they were afterwards, a position that most modern readers will find offensive and historically inaccurate.At the same time, those very features of the story make it an excellent window into the minds of white Atlanta in the 1930s and, indirectly, Atlanta of the 1860s. We don’t have to agree with its perspective to appreciate its insights into the people of that time and place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38N55PBAHJ1T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451635621#wasThisHelpful","R38N55PBAHJ1T0","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lawyer Vicky Holden comes to the fore in this story, as both sleuth and suspect. Her supposed motives aren’t believable to the reader, and you’d think that her friends among the police would know her well enough not to suspect her.  But there are enough other things going on to engage the story.As is true elsewhere in the series, some of the mysteries are transparently inspired by new stories. It’s an understandable source of inspiration, but unfortunately it makes it too easy for the reader to anticipate the story line.  In this case, you’ll recognize events around real-world religious cults that shape the plot here.Though I liked the way the plot moved along, two minor annoyances frustrated me. One is that Vicky’s daughter, Susan, played an important rule in an earlier book. We learned many things about her there, but none of those events seem to affect the story her, Susan’s character, or Susan’s relationshiop with Vicky.  That seems like an odd lapse of continuity in a series.The other minor annoyance is the recurring theme that “the mission is in danger!”  OK, I understand the finances of a Catholic mission on a reservation pose many challenges. I understand that most priests assigned to the mission don’t want to stay long. Do we have to have these themes appear in every book?That said, this is a good addition to the series. The setting on the Wind River Indian Reservation continues to drive the success of these books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GE7RITTGNS08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M0BUOC#wasThisHelpful","R3GE7RITTGNS08","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this installment of the Wind River Mysteries, a priest learns the details of a murder behind the seal of confession, evil multinational corporations want to steal resources from Indians, white cops refuse to take American Indian religious beliefs seriously, and someone is killed immediately after setting up a meeting to tell one of our heroes about what’s going on.Haven’t we seen these things before? Some appeared in other books in this series, and the confession-in-confession idea is an old saw in mysteries.  While Coel is good with the details of the setting and her main characters, her plots remain a weak point.As always, it’s a faced-paced story and a quick read for the airport or beach. However, it’s one of the least satisfactory in the series.  In addition, the explanation for the murder doesn’t entirely make sense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZRZYDBJ1R24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425185788#wasThisHelpful","R31ZRZYDBJ1R24","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not a real biography of Theodore Roosevelt but a biography of his conservationist personality. For example, his positions on the Civil Service Commission and as New York City Policy Commissioner play major roles in other TR biographies, establishing his progressivism and showing how he pursued his reform agenda. That political history also illustrates his restlessness.  These characteristics are not to be found in Brinkley’s biography, where conservationism motivates TR – consistently, not restlessly, with reform an afterthought.The advantage of Brinkley’s approach is that we see the coherence of TR’s conservationist thinking on its own terms, separate from Progressivism more generally. The disadvantage, of course, is that Brinkley downplays evidence contrary to this conservationist emphasis. Notably, he explains away the disagreements between Muir and Pinchot over TR’s environmental conscience, instead of seeing the political calculations here that were inconsistent with conservationism. Brinkley also has to deal awkwardly with the Newlands Act that authorized the environmental disaster of the Bureau of Reclamation; here at least he admits that TR made a mistake.The reclamation issue is an exception to the rule that Brinkley suffers from the characteristic vice of the biographer – he views his subject too uncritically and exaggerates his role in events.  On Brinkley’s read, Roosevelt is the founder of the Boone and Crockett club, advocate of the Yellowstone Protection Act (Lacey Act), the founder of the Bronx Zoo, the main advocate of the 1906 Antiquities Act.  This bias is understandable in the case of a man like TR, whose life was full of remarkable accomplishments in several fields.  Still, exaggerating TR’s role has the effect of downplaying the contributions of, say, George Bird Grinnell, John F. Lacey, John Muir, and Gifford Pinchot - as these men’s own biographies will happily illustrate for you.Fortunately - well, mostly fortunately - Brinkley does tell us quite a bit about these people. Whenever a new person joins Roosevelt’s life – such as George Bird Grinnell or Gifford Pinchot –  we get a mini-biography of that person. That’s often helpful, but there are a lot of these people. It can be distracting, and Brinkley’s practice also contributes significantly to the length of the book.Another distraction is Brinkley’s errors of fact, pointed out by other reviewers. However, I was more distracted by his not-quite-errors, offbeat ways of telling familiar stories that probably could not survive close scrutiny. It’s hard to tell whether this reflects a lack of expertise on Brinkley’s part or too much reliance on research assistants - which must be part of his writing strategy, given the sheer number of pages he prints every year.  Either way, better fact-checking would help.Despite all that, I found this a lively (if over-long) read. It’s not the first Roosevelt biography I’d recommend, but if you’ve read others, the new perspective here will get you thinking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TE6LU9E7MSC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060565314#wasThisHelpful","R2TE6LU9E7MSC0","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this is *not* one of Hillerman’s Leaphorn mysteries, though New Mexico makes a brief appearance in the middle of the book.  Instead, it’s a conventional story of newsman who discovers secrets that powerful people want to hush up. The cliches are redeemed in the final chapters in a confrontation whose resolution depends on the choice of an off-stage character.The protagonist is the kind of truth-seeking newsman that would become famous a few years later in the Watergate scandal. For all his supposed savvy, he’s remarkably obvious to what’s going on around him - and he makes a bunch of bonehead choices that weaken the story.After a slow start, the novel picks up and moves quickly along. Hillerman has two big heroic scenes in the middle of the book, with a more psychologically tense conclusion than is typical in the genre. A good read overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8ELX8EYZ258/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006206844X#wasThisHelpful","RT8ELX8EYZ258","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve landed on this page, you probably already know that Tony Hillerman was a mystery writer best known for his stories in and around the Navajo Indian Reservation. The central figure, Joe Leaphorn, works for the Navajo Tribal Police.The story here relies on the interplay of three cultures, Navajo, Zuñi and Anglo. Hillerman needs the Zuñi culture to move his plot forward, but the secret nature of the religious practices he describes poses some challenges for the author. Presenting the Zuñi through Navajo eyes is a reasonable work-around, especially for an Anglo, but it makes the climax scene much thinner than it should be.Still, Hillerman makes very interesting use of the supernatural to move the story forward here while keeping the book realistic (and secular). People are motivated by their religious beliefs, whether Navajo, Zuñi or Roman Catholic, in believable ways. People are also trapped in their culture in various ways; one major character chooses not to be with the woman he loves because his career interests are inconsistent with their relationship. Leaphorn puzzles over this, and never figures it out.The mystery is serviceable, but the villain’s motivations only somewhat believable. As is true in other Hillerman stories, the plot wraps up all too quickly, without enough attention to the aftermath of events. A longer resolution after the climax would be more satisfying.That said, it’s a good read. The physical and cultural landscapes play key roles that keep the book  interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IZ6HWGRHED7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061808385#wasThisHelpful","R1IZ6HWGRHED7Q","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve landed on this page, you probably already know that Tony Hillerman was a mystery writer best known for his stories in and around the Navajo Indian Reservation. The central figure, Joe Leaphorn, works for the Navajo Tribal Police – though he has decided to retire at the start of this book. Leaphorn’s investigation intersects with that of Jim Chee, who has his own concerns and a different, more traditional approach to the Navajo culture than does Leaphorn.Like Hillerman’s other books, this one has a strong sense of place. Beat-up dirt roads, back-of-nowhere places lying down forgotten tracks, a desert landscape and possibility of rain all mark the book.Hillerman’s series also relies on clashes of culture – most obviously that between whites and Navajos, but also differences in worldview between Leaphorn and Chee. Status differences in the white world also play an important role in how characters behave. Some characters understand one another and respect cultural differences; others don’t. Sadly, many of the people who don’t respect others are anthropologists and archaeologists.  As in many of Hillerman’s mysteries, you can see some reasons here why Native Americans tend to dislike these professions.The story moves well, but the mystery was unsatisfying – I didn’t find the culprit well-drawn or the crime well-motivated. However, the real point of the book is the journey across a landscape, not a clever mystery puzzle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE3TGPUEWW261/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061808407#wasThisHelpful","RE3TGPUEWW261","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you don’t know it, Isle Royale is an interesting place - the least-visited national park in the Lower 48, but the most revisited, and the longest average stay of any national park unit. It’s mostly designated wilderness, a mixture of hiking and canoe trails for the self-reliant visitor.It hasn’t always been wilderness.  A hundred years ago there were many resorts scattered through the archipelago, many fishing operations, a little lumbering, and other miscellaneous activities. Creating the national park meant stripping all that human activity out of the landscape.Baldwin’s book tells this story, emphasizing the key decades of the 1920s and 1930s. I haven’t seen this part of the story told anywhere else, other than little vignettes by the residents.  This book is valuable simply for her work in the archives to get this story.She also does a good job telling of the wider political environment, such as the growing wilderness movement and the competition between the Forest Service and the National Park Service for both land and visitation. Some of her inferences here are more speculative than most historians would feel comfortable making, but she points us to look more closely at the relationship between Isle Royale and Superior National Forest (Boundary Waters).Baldwin also tells a story of how the definition of “wilderness” changed in the 1920s and 1930s, as conditions on Isle Royale were also changing. Briefly put, “roadless” and not “virgin forest” became the key characteristic of the island, which made possible a major logging operation just as the park was being established.  Some wider comparisons would strengthen her analysis - the Great Smoky Mountains come to mind - and I would have liked more discussion of wilderness theory.  Consulting Gary Wockner’s book on Isle Royale (National Park Conundrums) would also strengthen the conceptual work here.All in all, however, this is a very interesting and readable book - a master’s thesis written for the general public that also raises some good questions for the wilderness scholar or national park fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32DN16E7630R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0935289186#wasThisHelpful","R32DN16E7630R2","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book intends to offer a history of the Church of Latter-Day Saints by two Mormon historians that nonetheless serves the needs of non-Mormon readers.  Unusual for many histories of all types, it is organized thematically, and willing to sacrifice chronology in order to develop its themes. For example, one chapter thinks sociologically about Joseph Smith’s religion and what it offered Americans in the 1830s and 1840s.Though more honest than other Church histories written by Mormons, the book falls short of its goals.  It is willing to admit failings of its members (some Mormons see psychologists!), acknowledge that outsiders believe the Church is very wealthy, admit some mistakes by Mormon leaders (but not the prophets), and discuss actions by the Saints that helped provoke Gentile persecution.  However, it never goes far enough to be truly balanced - it remains a Mormon history, and one that would be acceptable to the hierarchy of the Church. I was particularly surprised by their very sympathetic discussion of plural marriage (polygamy) not just in the past but as a doctrine that could be dusted off in the future again.When they discuss controversies, the authors do not go far enough to be truly balanced. For example, the authors insist in several locations that the LDS Church defines itself as Christian.  It does.  However, many other Christian denominations do not define the LDS Church as Christian, and do not recognize LDS baptisms. A balanced history would discuss why mainstream Christians do not classify the LDS as Christian. For example, the authors could have emphasized the nontrinitarian nature of Mormon doctrine, or the materialism that supports doctrines that humans can become God(s), more or less through works.A more balanced history would probably also discuss controversies around baptizing the dead, which Jews have found particularly offensive. The book was written as the LDS Church decided to allow African-Americans to become priests, and the authors rightly discuss that decision. They do not really explain why LDS doctrine had previously discriminated in this way. Other controversies receive similar treatment – they are acknowledge as part of an LDS apologia.Even so, the authors do admit of various criticisms of their church, its history, and some of its doctrines. They acknowledge church complicity in the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and they admit mistakes at Winter Quarters and among some of the handcart companies that ended in disaster. For this reason, this book is the best history of the LDS Church written by Mormons for a non-Mormon audience. However, I wish they had done better still.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVY0EYXYDNWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0252062361#wasThisHelpful","R3OVY0EYXYDNWN","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fourteenth book in Box’s Joe Pickett series, about a crime-fighting game warden in Wyoming. As in the other books, Pickett goes well beyond the job description of a game warden; like real game wardens, he lives in a violent world where people with serious weapons confront one another in the middle of nowhere. As is increasingly true of the series, this book does not stand alone well.  You need to know what happened in the previous few books, and this one ends with a very obvious point toward its own sequel.In this installment, Wyoming Governor Rulon once again uses Joe as his personal roving investigator. He sends Joe to northeast Wyoming, to a corner of the Black Hills, to investigate some suspicious goings-on.  (It’s a fictional “Medicine Bow County” but you may recognize some of the landscape around US-212 in Crook County – too obvious a name for the novel, it seems, unless it’s a joke for insiders.)  Joe goes, disguised as himself, a game warden on a couple of make-work tasks.Of course, Joe soon pokes a hornet’s nest. Thanks to his Dudley-Do-Right nature, he can’t leave things well alone, and he ends up provoking an overreaction from the bad guys instead of just leaving town. Not only Joe but also his dog and his pickup are placed in danger; series regulars will know what’s coming.There’s a side story involving Joe’s daughter Sheridan, a residence assistant at the University of Wyoming. Box could have done without this distraction, which plays out (and ends) in an unnecessary way. That’s a rare misstep for Box in this tightly-crafted, well-written series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16KIVYUW5LVVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399160760#wasThisHelpful","R16KIVYUW5LVVC","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1967, Art Davidson and seven others decided to try the first winter ascent of Mount McKinley (Denali), North America’s highest peak.  Because Denali lies so far north, its elevation of 20,322 feet (6194 meters) gives it nasty conditions comparable to higher Himalayan peaks. In addition, there is less air at higher altitudes because of the effects of the Earth’s rotation, making high-altitude mountaineering more challenging. The peak is also famous for its storms, especially its wind.  Remember, they’re trying this in winter.The team gets off to a bad start, in part because it’s not a team. Skill levels, fitness, acclimation to altitude, and climbing styles vary. Leadership is a problem. People, including the author, make some bad decisions. Then things get bad when three members of the team spend six days in a horrible storm, with temperatures below -40F/C, winds of 100-150 mph (150-200 kph).  Did I mention that they have very little food? And no tent? And the storm blows some of their supplies off the mountain?Mountaineering stories often emphasize the heroism of the protagonists.  There’s a little of that here, but more of the story focuses on the psychology of the climbers. Davidson is honest about himself, and honest about others. He blames himself for some decisions. He usually doesn’t blame others for their decisions, but the facts often make you wonder.The book is a compelling, fast read. If you like mountaineering or adventure stories, you should definitely read it - but it reaches beyond the genre and should be enjoyed by a wider audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G18B74YBFFLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594857555#wasThisHelpful","R3G18B74YBFFLG","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Grizzly Years, Vietnam veteran Doug Peacock tells how his road to recovery led through the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains. He fell into a job as a freelance photographer and videographer who would disappear into Yellowstone and Glacier national parks for long periods to photograph grizzly bears. The book tells of notable encounters, including a series of accounts that lead up to his own Moby Dick.His grizzly stories are interspersed with stories of his tour of duty in Vietnam, in the hill country of the Montagnards. For him, nature is real and human society is not – especially the part of human society that goes about killing one another. He recognizes that grizzles too can kill other creatures, and even humans. However, he sees grizzly violence as natural in a way that human violence can never be.While Peacock’s own story is unique, and movingly told, it falls into the wider class of stories about how wild places can heal damaged people. Perhaps we need a self-help section in our bookstores for those damaged by civilization—or “syphilization,” as many of these writers call it. This well-written and moving story would deserve a featured place in that section.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D6AHFDO46SJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805045430#wasThisHelpful","R3D6AHFDO46SJS","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The contributors to this book tackle a common question, applied to their own area of expertise: how much do global problems cost us? In other words, how much does air pollution cost the economy? Climate change? Hunger? Gender inequality?It’s a good question, and it’s useful to know the answers as we debate policy choices.  In addition, the contributors clearly talked enough so that they’re all thinking about this in similar ways. For example, they all examine percentage change in GDP by region so that a minor $100 loss to Americans doesn’t weigh more than a $50 loss to Chadians, for whom it would be a large share of annual income. (One might prefer other measures, but that’s a different conversation.)Alas, reading pages of econometrics, tables, and charts doesn’t make for particularly interesting prose. Lomborg had his authors address this by writing two chapters each - the full research paper version, suitable for a refereed academic journal, and a 4-5 page summary with a few key graphics. He collects all the summaries in the start of the book.The summaries inevitably read like a PowerPoint with too much text - lots of bottom lines but little explanation. The explanations and arguments are in the long articles later in the book, but dry dry dry.Prose style aside, I couldn’t help but wonder about the big picture.  If you’re an economist, why are there *differences* in the cost of major problems? For example, if gender inequality costs us more than air pollution, why have governments invested in the wrong problem? Shouldn’t we be in an equilibrium where the marginal benefit of a new million-dollar investment in problem X is equal to the marginal benefit of the same investment in problem Y?If I’m right about the answer to that rhetorical question, then these problems aren’t about economic cost-benefit at all.  They depend on society, culture, history, and politics, other disciplines that are ignored here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LI5OSU1AT589/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107679338#wasThisHelpful","R1LI5OSU1AT589","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book tells two intertwined histories, the history of the field of public history and the history of interpretation in the National Park Service.  Meringolo tells the NPS history well, though others have done likewise.  More than others, she discusses rivalries with other agencies such as the Smithsonian Institution, and the way that public purposes helped drive NPS historians and historical archaeologists away from their parent disciplines of history and archaeology.Meringolo’s more distinctive contribution lies in her history of the field of public history. It is conventionally dated to the 1970s, thanks to program development at the University of California at Santa Barbara and other sites. By ending her narrative in the 1930s, Meringolo gives much greater attention to the growth of public history (under other names) in the half-century ending in the New Deal.Clearly written and argued, this will become the standard history on these topics.

She can deliver in a range of styles and moves.The band also rocks the album - three powerful guitars, whose interplay works particularly well on “Medicine.” Check out the live performances of that track on the internet if you’re curious about this band and their sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OF7DSG2J9Z5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038QK5UI#wasThisHelpful","R2OF7DSG2J9Z5P","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This masterpiece of African fiction provides the outsider with an entry into life in a traditional village. Our protagonist, Okonkwe, thrives there but also comes into conflict with traditional values and customs. In the last third of the story, the village and wider community are destabilized by the arrival of Anglican missionaries and British colonial government. This sets up a clash between traditions and modernity, in which divisions within tribal society, and within the family, play important roles.Achebe tells his story beautifully, in a simple but powerful style. The story is richly evocative of pre-colonial society but its core themes are timeless.  Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0SH3S6C3SB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385474547#wasThisHelpful","R2E0SH3S6C3SB9","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book documents the many relationships between Native American tribes and the Yellowstone National park region.  It draws heavily from a report that the authors wrote for the National Park Service in the mid-1990s. It takes an eclectic, multidisciplinary approach, using evidence from archaeology, folklore, written history, oral history, and anything else the authors could find.One might wonder why such documentation is necessary - - certainly Indians lived in Yellowstone, as they lived everywhere else, right? Unfortunately Yellowstone National Park has long denied this fact, or ignored it. It has not funded research into the park’s indigenous history, and has not told this history to its visitors. In these respects, the park stands out against some other parks.The authors succeed in documenting this history well. The style is scholarly but readable. The final chapter discusses some of the changes Yellowstone has made in response to this evidence. The book is essential for people interested in learning more about these issues in depth.It's probably too much for the general reader or for someone just traveling to the park.  For a shorter, even more accessible introduction that focuses just on the Sheepeaters (Tukudeka Shoshone), see Loendorf's book with Nancy Medaris Stone, Mountain People.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4A3V52LCV0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806135891#wasThisHelpful","RA4A3V52LCV0J","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are interested in the history of American Indians in Yellowstone National Park, this book provides a great introduction to the most important group, the Sheep Eaters (Tukudeka). Joel Janetski’s book on Indians in Yellowstone discusses more tribes, but I found it less satisfactory. If you want a detailed academic tome, get Nabokov and Loendorf’s “Restoring a Presence.”  Loendorf wrote this book with one of his collaborators as an accessible, non-academic companion to “Restoring a Presence,” and it succeeds admirably.The book’s chapters each discuss some part of Tukudeka Shoshone life, such as hunting, lodging, clothing, and food.  I find some such archaeological works to be tedious descriptions, but this one is lively and interesting. The authors not only care about the Tukudeka but are interesting in what makes them distinctive, such as a much higher ratio of dogs to people. They also bring the story forward to three elders on the Wind River Reservation who still identified as Sheep Eaters in 1996. (The rest of the reservation is Eastern Shoshone or Northern Arapahoe.)You can still find signs in Yellowstone that imply that no one lived there before it became a national park.  This book is a very welcome corrective, and perfect if you have an interest in the topic.  It doesn't connect to wider issues that would attract a general audience, so I don't award it five stars.  It's great for its niche, however.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MA0Z5M9YHPPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0874808677#wasThisHelpful","R3MA0Z5M9YHPPR","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Friedman starts this book with some very useful conceptual work on the idea of “anti-Americanism,” which is often confused with opposition to particular US policies. Many Americans use it to dismiss foreign criticism, and during the Cold War it was often lumped with  domestic “un-Americanism” to dismiss reformers as Communists. It is mostly appropriated by people on the political Right in the United States, though Friedman rightly points out ways in which American racists are more un-American than the reformists they criticize.All those points are convincing, and well-taken. Indeed, Friedman’s deconstruction of the concept is so thorough that much of the book is overkill.  He shows that the French like America but oppose some US policies. So do the British. So do the Germans, and the Argentines, Mexicans, Japanese, Egyptians, Kenyans, and everyone else. This was true in the 1950s and in the 1960s, and in the 1980s and in the second Iraq War. In short, the book is far more thoroughly documented than its central analytical points require.Friedman uses his evidence to lead up to a central historical point: the Vietnam War was caused by the faulty discourse around anti-Americanism. Political elites were unable to consider foreign advice or criticism because they labeled it all “anti-Americanism.” Friedman describes them as prisoners of a discursive system that reduced complexities and choices to the misleading rubrics of pro- and anti-Americanism, they failed to see that there were paths available that would not lead into deadly quagmire.” (page 157)I’m not ready to explain the Vietnam War as the product of a discursive system, though clearly misperceptions of various forms contributed to that tragedy. Those failures also reappeared in G. W. Bush’s Iraq War, as Friedman also notes. By focusing on a single foreign policy concept, this book tends to overemphasize the role of the concept, flawed as it is. I would recommend most highly the initial conceptual chapter and then skimming the case studies depending on your own historical interests.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25T5TXI7GDNO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521683424#wasThisHelpful","R25T5TXI7GDNO7","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Turner has some remarkable essays here - a meditation on how pelicans play, musings on his spirit animal, a riff on Thoreau, a rant against the destruction of wilderness. Lying behind it all are his concerns about how we have lost our ability to understand wilderness, wild places, wild creatures, wild things. Turner does not join all of us who see developers and resource extractors as they enemy; instead, the enemy is us, our lack of connection to the truly wild, our inability to experience nature for more than a long weekend.Anyone who cares about human relationships with nature will not just read this but keep it on the bookshelf next to Abbey, Leopold, and Thoreau.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1MDBBSMUCU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0816516995#wasThisHelpful","R1W1MDBBSMUCU8","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A member of the Lakota nation, Joseph Marshall has reached the life stage of the tribal elder. What makes his books remarkable is that he learned the Lakota oral tradition from his grandparents, who were old enough in the mid-twentieth century to be in touch with the pre-reservation tribal history.  We’re lucky to have a talented storyteller such as Marshall to share these traditions with us.In this book, Marshall shares eight traditional stories (and one modern story), each built around a single virtue such as wisdom, faith, or tolerance.  After telling each story, he shares his own reflections about this virtue in the modern world.I loved the stories, but found Marshall’s reflections to be somewhat uneven in quality. I appreciate his overall call to stay in touch with traditional virtues in a world that changes too quickly and forgets too much. While his points are well-taken, they are not particularly distinctive. In contrast, the stories shine with an authentic voice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AEC699M1OUT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401931758#wasThisHelpful","R3AEC699M1OUT5","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book looks both at the physical qualities of paper and at the various uses of paper.  These are not so easily separated – the physical qualities of paper matter a lot for toilet paper, for example. The uses of paper are widespread, from identity documents and money to newsprint, facial tissues, and blueprints. The content that appears on paper also matters, associated with political scandals, military intelligence and cryptography. Huge volumes of paper fell over Manhattan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.My overall reaction to this variety is: too much.  It’s amazing how important paper has been, in so many different areas. But do these things really belong together? To what extent is the “paperness” of currency similar to the paper production at the National Security Agency, or the careful craftsmanship of artistic paper in rural Japan?I was happy to go along for the ride, for Basbanes is a fluid writer who introduces the reader to all sorts of intriguing topics.  But there’s no overarching story, just a collection of essays.  Paper is everywhere, but that means the core of this book is nowhere.Still, it’s an engaging read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29977FJ06HN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307266427#wasThisHelpful","R29977FJ06HN2","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Louis Agassiz was one of the most visible scientists of nineteenth-century America, for reasons that seem a bit mysterious today. This biography emphasizes Agassiz’s non-scientific talents as a lecturer, fundraiser, and popularizer, an emphasize that explains his successes in some ways without really explaining how these nonscientific attributes contributed to his scientific prestige. The narrative reflects the fact that the author is a professor of English, not a scientist or a historian of science. This gives the book a fresh perspective but leaves unanswered any questions about the merits of Agassiz’s natural history. Simply put, we do not learn enough about Agassiz’s studies of mollusks or other species to judge whether the man’s field research produced any lasting contributions.As this implies, Irmscher consistently deemphasizes Agassiz’s actual science. Even in the case of glaciers, where Agassiz’s contributions would seem to be most lasting (and least controversial), we don’t learn much about Agassiz’s scientific claims. Instead, the narrative focuses on Agassiz’s relationships, both personal and professional. Irmscher also downplays Agassiz’s contribution by emphasizing contemporaries who had similar insights but were slower to publicize them.Irmscher’s claims here imply some deeper criticisms of science, which he explores in an extended discussion of intellectual property. I would have liked to see sharper distinctions between scientific property (“this is *my* theory of glaciers, which entitles me to recognition”) and commercial property (“this is *my* patent, which entitles me to profit”), but Irmscher’s interests in this discussion lie in an English professor’s critique of the modern research university.The narrative prefers to focus on the non-scientific aspects of Agassiz’s biography. Agassiz collects specimens like a modern-day hoarder, but has trouble writing up his findings. When he does publish his results, Irmscher emphasizes how Agassiz’s claims about (say) jellyfish also serve Agassiz’s psychological needs of the moment. Agassiz lectures widely and is known for his showmanship, not his specific claims. He spends many summers in the field, but his second wife’s science writing and travelogues are the major products. Agassiz  takes on Darwin from a modified Creationist perspective, and he advocates a “scientific” racism that is popular in mid-century America but without scientific foundation.  Perhaps the most “scientific” chapter her emphasizes Agassiz’s work with the draftsmen who illustrated his publications - and illustrated them brilliantly, judging by the reproductions here.Throughout it all, I kept wondering: why was Agassiz famous? I leave the book believing that he was not the “Creator of American Science” of Irmscher’s subtitle - but instead, a “Scientific Huckster” whose talents were akin to P. T. Barnum’s. Since Agassiz was a very eminent professor at Harvard, a successful fundraiser for his museum and his field expeditions, and a man of great credibility in American science of the day, I had to wonder how many great hucksters there may be in science today. The book implies a deeper critique of the scientific enterprise but Irmscher remains focused on the flaws of the man instead of developing a critique of science - or society - more generally. Completing the argument would require that Irmscher engage Agassiz’s science more fully, to show that it was not worthy of the praise it received in its day. Without that final step, this book remains an engaging and thought-provoking biography but not entirely satisfying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CI77EXK742ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547577672#wasThisHelpful","R2CI77EXK742ZP","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s not surprising that “the Old Dominion” would be interested in preserving its traditions. In this book, James Lindgren explains how elite Virginians’ traditionalism after the Civil War led to the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA) doing more than just safeguarding tradition. The APVA focused on material culture such as historic buildings, historic sites, and antiquities.The APVA was the nation's first society to focus on preservation at the state level. It used preservation to bolster traditional political and social values in Virginia after Reconstruction, reasserting the distinctiveness of state traditions in the new Union. This made it naturally exclusionary, based on the older elites of tidewater Virginia, and excluding other groups and regions.Lindgren does a good job positioning his study among wider issues, and in thinking through the implications of his narrative. Indeed, his introduction and conclusion would each stand alone for a reader looking for an overview without the narrative detail in the middle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WDTU3R9L27PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813914507#wasThisHelpful","R2WDTU3R9L27PY","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Rebecca Conard provides very interesting framing chapters exploring the conditions in the early twentieth century that produced such a historian, one interested in the public applications of history.  Her final chapter explores the legacy of Shambaugh’s applied history, which fragmented into archivists, national park historians, state historical societies, and many others.  The middle chapters provide a biography of the man, drawing heavily (with many long excerpts) from an unpublished manuscript by one of his students and long-time associates.All in all, this book provides a surprisingly-engaging account of a key figure in the days when historians were seeking to professionalize the discipline.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35UWQRQA7MK54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0877457891#wasThisHelpful","R35UWQRQA7MK54","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thaddeus Kosciuszko is a very interesting historical figure. He played a part in the American Revolution, lived in France for part of its revolution, and fought unsuccessfully for Poland’s independence against Russia. He was a friend of Thomas Jefferson who left his fortune to the cause of buying Jefferson’s slaves their freedom – with Jefferson as executor.  That worked about as well as his resistance to Russia.Storozynski’s biography tells this story in the tradition of detailed historical narrative. This makes the book a great reference but too slow a read.  A stronger editorial hand, and more attention to the big picture at the start and end of each chapter would have been more engaging. Maps would also have been helpful, especially for Kosciuszko’s military campaigns in Poland.I see that the book has a large proportion of five-star reviews, praising the man (for good reason), and recommending the book for Polish-Americans (also for good reason). I object to the style and to Storozynski’s emphasis on too great a level of detail.

"This book reviews the political history behind “house museums” in the United States, historic sites memorializing places where famous Americans lived. West shows us the origin of the house museum movement among politically-active but disenfranchised women, examines how professional men took over from volunteer women in the early decades of the nineteenth century, and explores the increasing diversity of subjects from George Washington and Thomas Jefferson to Louisa May Alcott, Booker T. Washington, and George Washington Carver.West’s narrative keeps gender issues central while placing them in the context of wider histories. It goes much further than being “a welcome corrective” to the literature. West makes it clear that the real story is deeply rooted in gender, domesticity, and class, and that studies overlooking these issues get the story wrong.West eschews strict chronology in each chapter. She begins with a narrative of general themes, followed by studies of one or two key founders, with overlapping chronology across sections. This sometimes makes the story difficult to follow, and she does not necessarily point to the key figures as she introduces each one. Stronger overviews at the head of each chapter would help orient the reader to each story more effectively.That aside, this is an impressive piece on the politics of public history, and sure to be the standard work on the American house museum for some time to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12VD6RSKKIXE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1560988363#wasThisHelpful","R12VD6RSKKIXE4","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jan Zalasiewicz is a geologist specializing it stratiagraphy, studying the layers of rock placed down over the years.  He got to wondering whether human impact on the Earth would be significant enough to be visible in the geologic record of the future - say, 100 million years from now.Though this is a short book, it takes him a fairly long time to get to that question.  He imagines sentient beings of the future who must learn enough Earth geology to be able to find human traces. How would interstellar explorers figure out the Earth? Our planet is quite different from Venus, Mars or the Moon in being dominated by rock strata. These stem from our plate tectonics, volcanism, uplift, and erosion by water - found to a small degree on Mars but otherwise not common on the planets we know.As Zalasiewicz ponders how our explorers would figure out Earth geology, he tells the story of his discipline. How did Earth geologists figure out how our planet works?  This history of science was the strongest part of the book, and could easily stand alone.What legacy would we leave?  Not much.  The human presence on Earth has been short.  Geologists of the future may be able to find evidence of a species that arrived suddenly in geologic terms, spread across the world, left some flooded coastal concrete structures, and then flamed out as part of the sixth major extinction on the planet.Readers with a higher regard for the species than I have may find that conclusion depressing.  I don't think that's the interesting part of the book in any case - it's an accessible and fascinating account of the Earth's geology and the geologists who study it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PU8MSXD7L17P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199214972#wasThisHelpful","R2PU8MSXD7L17P","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book tells the story of fourteen leading women in the history of Yellowstone National Park.  Watry is interested in the pioneers, so the stories lean toward the first half of the twentieth century. However, her final chapter tells of Mary Meager, a career biologist in the park who is still active in her retirement (and whom I have had the pleasure to meet). Many of these women have training in biology but tended to work as naturalists and nature guides; many others were concessioners, owning stores in their own name or with other members of their family.Watry tells these stories well, and it's good to have a women's history of the park at last.  However, the book is written to appeal to people who love to read about Yellowstone. Watry does not try to ground the Yellowstone stories more widely in American culture, despite several opportunities to do so.For example, Watry prefers to tell these stories as individual biographies, with the exception of two pairs of sisters.  That tends to emphasize family histories instead of wider social change.  The first three women rangers were all hired in 1920-21; each was exceptional in her own way, but the timing suggests wider forces (and a sympathetic Superintendent Horace Albright).The pioneers, both in the ranger service and in the concessions, all tended to benefit from family connections - fathers who worked for the park, or parents who established a business.  Highlighting the importance of those networks for getting these leading women their start would make the book speaker to a wider audience than just Yellowstone aficionados.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QWJ650XFN71F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606390295#wasThisHelpful","R2QWJ650XFN71F","A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arnold Ytreeide in his new book, “Ishtar’s Odyssey” published by Kregel Publications gives us A Storybook for Advent.From the back cover:  “Ishtar, it seems you have discovered a star that even yesterday did not exist.”Ishtar, the ten-year-old son of a Persian wise man, will soon join a caravan following that star across the desert. The slightly spoiled prince would just as soon as stay in the predictable comfort and safety of the palace, but slowly he learns that there’s much to see, do, and learn in this world that can’t be experienced with tutors. Disasters and dangers challenge his courage and confidence, but Ishtar finds strength he never knew he had. He eventually meets Jotham, Bartholomew, and Tabitha as he follows his father and uncles in their search for a newborn king.Ishtar’s Odyssey is divided into short chapters meant to be read aloud for each day of Advent. Families will treasure this devotional read and benefit from the advice about creating seasonal traditions, suggestions for sampling Persian foods, and notes on the history behind the story.Mr. Ytreeide tells us that Advent is a three-fold celebration of the birth of Jesus, His eventual second coming to earth, and His continued presence in our lives here and now. Advent is the period beginning four Sundays before Christmas and observed by some Christians as a season of prayer and fasting. The journey of the Magi or The Wise Men has not been written about much, as far as I am aware, so this is a unique book. There is one continued story every day for the full four weeks of Advent. At the end of each story Mr. Ytreeide gives us some thoughts that should focus our minds on the praise and worship that this trip brought about. By telling the story from the point of view of ten-year-old Ishtar we really get the full flavor of the birth of Jesus. I think this is an excellent resource and great fun to read.

"Simon Toyne in his new book, “The Searcher” Book One in the Solomon Creed series published by William Morrow introduces us to Solomon Creed.From the back cover:  Perfect for fans of Lee Child and Stephen King, the author of the acclaimed Sanctus trilogy conjures a haunting epic of good and evil, retribution and redemption—the first novel in the mesmerizing Solomon Creed seriesOn a windy hilltop in the town of Redemption, Arizona, people have gathered at an old cemetery to bury a local man who died in a tragic accident. But the occasion is suddenly disrupted by a thunderous explosion several miles away. A plane has crashed, pouring a pillar of black smoke into the air.As Sheriff Garth Morgan speeds toward the accident, he nearly hits a man running down the road, with no shoes on his feet and no memory of who he is or how he got there. The only clues to his identity are a label in his jacket and a book that’s been inscribed to him, both giving the name Solomon Creed. Solomon knows only that he’s here for a reason—to save a man he has never met . . . a man who was buried that very morning.Miles away, three men scan the skies for a plane carrying an important package. Spotting the black cloud in the distance, they suspect something has gone wrong, and that the man who has sent them will demand a heavy price if the package has been lost.To uncover his real identity, Solomon must expose Redemption’s secrets and the truth behind the death of the man he is there to save. But there are those who will do anything to stop him, men prepared to call on the darkest forces to prevent Solomon from succeeding. The Searcher delves into history, murder, criminal revenge, and personal betrayal while also exploring bravery, love, sacrifice, and renewal—all underpinned by a truly frightening and deadly mystery.I think the moment you have a town named Redemption in Arizona you are heading for a place that has secrets and is willing to go to extremes to keep them. Next add in an Albino who has amnesia who feels that he is there to save a dead man. Now add in a crashed plane, a missing package and  those that will stop at nothing to stop Solomon from what he has to do.

"Gracie Malone in her new book, “Unafraid” published by Faithwords gives us 365 Days Without Fear.From the back cover: You can prevent fear from controlling your life!God does not want us to live in the grip of fear. But overwhelming concerns about our children, difficulties in the workplace or home, health issues, or financial difficulties sometimes result in our being enslaved by this commonly felt emotion.Fear can indeed control our life, but that doesn’t have to happen. There are over 400 instances in the Bible of God telling us we don’t need to be afraid. It is to these imperatives that UNAFRAID brings light, a touch of humor, descriptive stories, quotes, questions, and practical help in enabling you to cast out your fears, anxieties, and apprehensions so that you can rest in the Father’s loving presence.You were made for more than a life of fear. Learn to place your trust in God and begin to live UNAFRAID.What is one of the common problems that all mankind face? Fear. All of us face fear. For some of us fear can be a real problem. Left undealt with it can hold you back from moving into areas that could enrich your life and the lives of others. The good news there is a solution to fear! Psalm 56:3 NKJV tells us, “Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you.” God knew we would have our moments with fear and He provided the perfect response to it, Himself. God knows no fear so He can deal with our fear. Ms. Malone has given us 365 verses, one for every day of the year, that provides a healthy response to when we are afraid of whatever. Ms. Malone has given us a devotional. She not only gives us the verse for the day but a wonderful thought that focuses our minds on God so that we have peace and the fear will actually leave us. This is a great book. You will want to hold it in a special place on your shelf as you will be referring to it daily to refresh yourself with these truths. This is also a great book to give as gifts to family and friends. They will think of you every time they put it to use.

"Matt Mikalatos in his new book, “Sky Lantern” published by Howard Books gives us The Story of a Father’s Love for His Children and the Healing Power of the Smallest Act of Kindness.From the Inside Jacket Cover:  Love you, Daddy. Miss you so much. Steph.Steph scribbled those words on a sky lantern before sending it off to her father in heaven who had passed away from cancer. Halfway across the country, Steph’s lantern landed in Matt Mikalatos’s yard.As a father of three daughters, Matt could not let Steph’s note go unanswered, so he posted an open letter to her on his blog. Matt never could have expected the viral response to his letter that led him on a journey to find Steph—and to bring healing to thousands of others in desperate need of the loving words of a father.Filled with paternal wisdom and reflections on the relationship between a father and their child, Sky Lantern shows how the miraculous events that followed Matt finding the sky lantern in his yard—and the widespread and lasting impact his letter had—prove that the bond between a parent and their child is everlasting.Matt Mikalatos defines a sky lantern in this manner, “sky lanterns are like hot-air balloons, only much smaller. This one was made of paper and metal. The candles are long gone.” This is how God has an adventure for us. It seems so innocent. You wake up in the morning after a storm and there is trash on your lawn. You go out to throw it away and that is when you find out about the girl whose father died. So Matt went on the internet to try to find this girl and in the process of doing that so many others were also touched. I think this is epic. In an effort to reach out to one person God was able to have Matt reach out to many. “Sky Lantern” is the story of what he did and What God allowed him to accomplish. It is a marvelous story.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Howard Books for this review.  I was not required to write a positive review.

Grouped around the classic theme of murder, KILLER NASHVILLE NOIR: COLD-BLOODED is a first-class collection and a must-have for fans of the genre.Noir is a category all to its self and, I believe, it is very hard to do.

Every single author, whether they are big names or newcomers, is a major contributor and provide really interesting stories that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I am a big fan of Steven James and he contributes a first class story. If you are new to Noir then this is the collection for you. If you are a fan of Noir then you certainly are not going to be disappointed.

"Anthony Horowitz in his new book, “Trigger Mortis” a new book in the James Bond series published by HarperCollins gives us another adventure with British Secret Service Agent James Bond.From the back cover: Incorporating original, never-before-published material from 007 creator Ian Fleming, New York Times bestselling author Anthony Horowitz returns literary legend James Bond to his 1950s heyday in this exhilarating and dashing thriller.The world’s most famous spy, James Bond, has just returned victorious from his showdown with Auric Goldfinger in Fort Knox. By his side is the glamorous and streetwise Pussy Galore, who played no small part in his success. As they settle down in London, the odds of Galore taming the debonair bachelor seem slim—but she herself is a creature not so easily caught.Meanwhile, the struggle for superiority between the Soviet Union and the West is escalating. In an attempt to demonstrate Soviet strength, SMERSH plans to sabotage an international Grand Prix in the hot zone of West Germany. At the Nürburgring Racing Circuit, Bond must play a high-speed game of cat and mouse to stop them, but when he observes a secretive meeting between SMERSH’s driver and a notorious Korean millionaire, it becomes clear that this is just the infamous organization’s opening move.An orphan of the Korean War, he has a personal reason for wanting to bring America to its knees. He’s helping SMERSH decisively end the white-hot space race—but how? With the help of an American female agent, Bond uncovers a plan that leads first to Florida and then to New York City, where a heart-stopping face-off will determine the fate of the West.This thriller has all the hallmarks of an original Ian Fleming adventure and features welcome familiar faces, including M and Miss Moneypenny. Horowitz delivers a smooth and seductive narrative of fast cars and beautiful women, ruthless villains and breathtaking plot that will leave readers hanging until the very end.I have to be honest I did not like the first seventy-one pages. Based on that I thought I would not like the rest of the book. I was so wrong! From page seventy-two to the end is practically non-stop excitement. Jason Sin is a high quality villain and Jeopardy Lane is a beautiful, bright, tough partner. Mr. Horowitz has us globe-trotting as he takes us from England to Germany to the United States. We all know that Bond plays Baccarat and golf what we didn’t know is that he races cars as well. Mr. Horowitz has given us quite an engrossing thriller that will have you muttering “oh, no” as you are reading as fast as you can to get to the next page. Jason Sin is a terrorist on the grand scale and really puts Bond’s and Jeopardy’s lives at great peril.

During a late-night photo session, Craig, the photographer, is shot to death. In the confusion Toni hits her head and is knocked unconscious, and when she awakes, she can’t recall what happened. If she could regain her memory, could she identify the killer? Apparently the killer thinks so, because soon after the incident, Toni hears someone breaking in to her apartment and barely escapes. Too bad the police believe she is somehow responsible for Craig’s murder. It doesn’t help that her character on the show is so convincingly nasty and conniving.Was the target really Craig, or did the killer aim for Toni and miss? Craig was an unscrupulous womanizer. Any number of people might have wanted him dead, including a career criminal he helped convict, his business partner, his wife, and his mistress. Despite her winning personality, Toni has her share of enemies, among them an older actress jealous of her success and the show’s director, whose animosity baffles her.With the help of Michael Benedict, a handsome young criminal lawyer, Toni sets out to awaken her dormant memory and unmask the killer. Meanwhile the character she plays, Alexandra, is in a coma, fighting for her life. The writers will decide Alexandra’s fate, but Toni must save herself.This is one very clever murder mystery. There was a murder. Toni may have seen it however she has temporary amnesia. However the killer does not know that and feels that she can identify him so he is gunning for her. Was the cameraman really the killer’s target or was he really after Toni all along? How do you investigate when no one believes you? And is it possible that it ties in with the Soap Opera?

"Randy Petersen in his new book “The Printer and the Preacher” published by Thomas Nelson gives us Ben Franklin, George Whitefield, and the Surprising Friendship that Invented America.From the back cover:  Social mobility. Religious freedom. Hard work over class. We take these values for granted, but colonial America had to learn them. How? Under the care and nurture of two remarkable men:  a printer and a preacher.Preaching in public spaces across the colonies, George Whitfield inspired the first Great Awakening. Simultaneously, Benjamin Franklin was printing his own brand of common sense in Poor Richard’s Almanac. But the two were not just working in parallel; their stories were intertwined in a thirty-year friendship that spread their influence around the globe.This is the story of that friendship. Of how Franklin first printed Whitfield’s sermons, how Whitfield defended his friend’s diplomacy, and how their mutual regard allowed each to flourish and shape an ever-growing population.The Printer and the Preacher provides a model for our time:  a friendship across differing outlooks with room for disagreement and mutual respect. And in the course of that friendship, a nation that was yet to be born was given its defining traits.I know a little about Colonial America. I know a little about George Whitefield. I know a little about Ben Franklin. When I found out that I could learn more about all three and how they worked together I jumped at the opportunity. Mr. Petersen has given us a well written, informative biography that brings the two men and America, at that time, to life. I started out knowing a little, I finished knowing quite a lot more. I felt that I had been transported back in time and I was walking the streets of the Colonies with these men.  If you are looking for an excellent merging of Christian biography and Colonial American history then you have to read this book. I recommend this book highly.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson.  I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

A terrible sacrifice. In the face of powerful darkness, who will prevail?The island of Seare is at war. The Red Druid is gathering strength and power to stand against Conor, Eoghan, and the brotherhood. But there is strife within the brotherhood as well. Eoghan still refuses to claim his rightful rule, and the resulting conflict creates an uncomfortable distance between him and Conor. When Conor leaves to find the key to defeating the Red Druid, Eoghan and Aine worry he will succumb to the danger. They set out on their own mission to defeat the Red Druid through Aine’s magical gifts.But nothing―and no one―is as it seems.This is it! This is the book we have been waiting for. This is the epic conclusion, third act, of the Song of Seare Trilogy. Act One, “Oath of the Brotherhood” introduced Conor and Aine and got the action going. Act Two, “Beneath the Forsaken City”,  is where the action really took off and it seemed The Red Druid had the upper hand. “The Sword and the Song” is Book Three in the series and this is the final battle with The Red Druid. In an effort to defeat the reign of terror Conor and Eoghan separate knowing that one or both of them may not survive. Ms. Laureano has given us a very exciting story filled with high drama.  She has also given us plenty to think about as she shows us the need to press close to God for His support and His guidance. Great stuff! I am sorry that this is the final book of the series.

"Mike Bechtle in his new book, “You Can’t Text a Tough Conversation”  published by Revell gives us the ability to have a good conversation.From the back cover:  When it comes to the tough stuff, we need real, face-to-face conversations. But have we lost the art?There’s no denying that as our use of technology has increased, our communication skills have decreased. Technology creates the illusion of being in touch, but we lose the deeper meaning conveyed by body language, facial expression, and tone of voice. We text when we should talk. We tweet firings and breakups. We vent our frustrations with other people online. Whether it’s with a spouse, a friend, a boss, a co-worker, or children, those tough conversations create high anxiety. In the end, what we have are broken relationships and hurt feelings.In this timely book, communication expert Mike Bechtle shows you how to build strong relationships, offering tried-and-true methods to navigate the muddy waters of having tough conversations–in person. With his help, you’ll learn to be a better listener, give and receive genuine feedback, saturate your relationships with kindness, and much more–so that you’ll feel confident when it comes time to actually talk.Relationships get challenging and conversations get tough. Sometimes the tools we have do not work well and we give up in frustration. Mike Bechtle has given us new tools we need to deal with these situations in his new book, “You Can’t Text a Tough Conversation”. He has divided the book into four parts:  Part One:  The Process Of Conversation, Part Two:  Tools For A Healthy Conversation, Part Three:  Skills For Healthy  Conversation and Part Four:  Growing Into Connection. If we really think about it we learned our communication skills from watching our parents and they from theirs, so these skills have been in play for generations. Let’s face it they don’t work so well in our current time and we need to embrace a new skill set. Mr. Bechtle has written this book to do exactly that. This is a great book.  You might want to hold it in a special place on your shelf you might be referring to it again and again.  This is also a great book to give as gifts to family and friends.  They will think of you every time they put it to use.  I recommend it highly.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Revell.  I was not required to write a positive review.

"Callie Smith Grant in her new book, “The Horse of My Heart” published by Revell gives us Stories of the Horses We Love.From the back cover:  Shining coat flashing in the sun. Silky mane rippling in the wind. A toss of the head and the stamp of a hoof.Few of God’s creatures are as noble and soul-stirring as the horse. Even those of us who aren’t lucky enough to have horses of our own seem to have an innate desire to connect with these beautiful, regal beasts. As children we read stories about them, collected models of them, and tacked posters of them up on our walls. Throughout history they have carried us and calmed us, pulled our loads and pulled at our heartstrings. They give us a taste of wildness and yet make us feel at home.In this inspiring collection, you’ll meet horses who show up at the right time, who help their humans learn important truths, and who rescue the very people who rescued them. These true stories of horses and the people who love them are sometimes touching, sometimes humorous, and sometimes miraculous. Always they are inspiring, like the horses themselves. They will touch your heart, renew your spirit, and show you that surely God had us in mind when he created these magnificent creatures.The Lone Ranger had Silver, Zorro had Tornado, Roy Rogers had Trigger and when we were growing up we had the Westerns with all those horses. Let’s face it if we already had a dog as a pet our next choice would be a horse. There is something about a horse that draws us. Me, personally, I think there is a nobleness about them. They allow themselves to eat from our hand, ride on their backs and pull their loads. Ms. Grant has pulled together these wonderful stories from all these various authors to give us the complexity that is a horse. There is an intimate relationship between man and horse as well as woman and horse. In these true stories horses help in the healing process, help some in adjusting to life’s changes and then together human and horse where the horse is rescued and then the horse does the rescuing. All in all a wonderful look at some of the most magnificent animals in creation.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Revell Publishers.

"Richard L. Mabry, M.D. in his new book “Miracle Drug” published by Abingdon Press takes us into the life of Dr. Josh Pearson.From the back cover:  Overcoming these odds will take more than a miracle drug–it will take a miracle.The infection wasn’t supposed to happen, but it did. The treatment was supposed to take care of it, but it didn’t. Dr. Josh Pearson believes an experimental drug Not yet approved by the FDA may be the antidote. But there’s only one dose available for two patients:  the former President of the United States…and Josh’s girlfriend.With the nation’s eyes on him, Josh must pull off a miracle to save a man who holds a good deal of power and the woman who holds his heart.The moment that you involve the Center For Disease Control I think you have started a great thriller. When you target a former President of The United States with a disease that shouldn’t exist you have caused the thriller to escalate. When the manufacturer may have already discarded the only supply of the drug that can cure this disease and there is only one dose and Josh’s love has the disease as well and you have blasted this thriller into orbit. Dr. Mabry really knows how to write a thriller that will grab your attention and then keep it until he decides to let go. I think “Miracle Drug” is Dr. Mabry’s best medical thriller to date. Action, mystery and suspense these are the ingredients of “Miracle Drug”. Turn off the TV, unplug the computer, put aside the housework you are not going to want to do anything but read this book until the end and enjoy yourself in the process.

"Brent Crowe in his new book “Sacred Intent” published by Worthy Publishing Group helps us Maximize the Moments of Your Life.From the back cover:  If life were a week……you would make every moment count. You’d be more motivated, more focused, more passionate about all you said and did. You’d lead with greater influence. You’d develop deeper relationships. You’d take control of your time. You’d follow your calling. You’d turn the world upside down for Christ.“Every person with a sacred intent approach to life wants to accomplish more, not less, with the amount of time and energy granted,” writes author and speaker Brent Crowe.Your life matters! Crowe shows you how to bring your life vibrantly alive with purpose and make this world better because you live in it.Dr. Graham Lacey made a statement before a dignified group of people, He said, “Life is a week. How will you make all seven days count?” This question affected Dr. Crowe and he set out to write his book trying to come out with an answer. If life were just a week then our energy would be vastly limited and we would need to be good stewards. Seven is the number of completeness and a life rich with sacred intent will be complete according to Dr. Crowe. So each day of the week is broken down with a different emphasis:  Monday:  Influence, Tuesday:  Time, Wednesday:  Calling, Thursday:  Engagement, Friday:  Relationships, Saturday:  Motivation and Sunday:  Dream. With “Sacred Intent” we need to begin because the clock is ticking and the calendar pages are turning and our moment is now!. I think that everyone should have a copy of this book and it would make a terrific gift for friends and family so that they could be motivated as well.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Worthy Publishing Group.

"Jody Hedlund in her new book “Luther and Katharina” published by Waterbrook Press gives us A Novel of Love and Rebellion.From the back cover:  She was a nun of noble birth. He, a heretic, a reformer…an outlaw of the Holy Roman Empire.In the 16th century, nun Katharina von Bora’s fate fell no further than the Abbey. Until she read the writings of Martin Luther.His sweeping Catholic church reformation—condemning a cloistered life and promoting the goodness of marriage—awakened her desire for everything she’d been forbidden. Including Martin Luther himself.Despite the fact that the attraction and tension between them is undeniable, Luther holds fast to his convictions and remains isolated, refusing to risk anyone’s life but his own. And Katharina longs for love, but is strong-willed. She clings proudly to her class distinction, pining for nobility over the heart of a reformer. They couldn’t be more different.But as the world comes tumbling down around them, and with Luther’s threatened life a constant strain, these unlikely allies forge an unexpected bond of understanding, support and love.Together, they will alter the religious landscape forever.I consider this to be historical fiction at its finest! I also consider this to be Ms. Hedlund’s best work so far! She took the real life characters of Luther and Katharina and brought them to life on the pages of this book. I knew a lot about Martin Luther but not nearly what I read about here. And I certainly knew nothing about Katharina. This is riveting stuff. A really a deep story that is full of tender drama. Martin Luther and Katharina are great characters that we can really identify with and care for and root for their romance to succeed. Don’t start this book late at night because you are going to want to finish it before you go to bed. I think everyone should read this book, not only for the fun of it, but for the historical value it brings. We owe a great deal to these two and Ms. Hedlund brought their total worth to these pages.If you missed the interview for “Captured By Love”, a different series, and would like to listen to it and/or interviews with other authors and professionals please go to Kingdom Highlights where they are available On Demand.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Waterbrook Press.

This was great fun for me so I can only imagine how much more fun it will be for children. Not only are the stories told but there is the added benefit of items that do not belong in the art. Surfboards, Frankfurter Cart, Boy Scouts eating Smore’s around a campfire and in each story. Then in every picture there is Teddy, the teddy bear, that you have to find and sometimes he is in there more than once. The stories are Noah and His Great Ark, Moses Crossing the Red Sea, Joshua and the Fall of Jericho, David and Goliath, Daniel and the Lions, Jonah and the Big Fish, Feeding the 5,000, and Man Through the Roof. This book will provide hours of entertainment and a great way to teach the Bible stories to your children.

"Shelley Shepard Gray in her new book, “A Wedding at the Orange Blossom Inn” Book Three in the Amish Brides of Pinecraft series published by Avon Inspire takes us into the life of Emma Keim.From the back cover: Beloved bestselling author Shelley Shepard Gray returns with the third book in her Amish Brides of Pinecraft series—a story of second chances for two young single parents…and the wedding that brings them together.Emma Keim was heartbroken when her husband Sanford passed away, leaving her to raise three young daughters alone. In the years since, her relatives have made it no secret that they expect Emma to remain a widow, mourning Sanford indefinitely. But when she meets Jay Hilty—a widower with three young sons of his own—Emma is delighted to have a new friend who understands her struggles. And it doesn’t hurt that he’s also handsome and kind. Still, Emma is dismayed that her family is so opposed to their friendship—and the idea of it ever becoming anything more. She honors her husband’s memory every day, but is she destined to be alone forever?Jay knows that few people his age understand what it’s like to lose a spouse, and Emma’s gentleness with his boys stirs something in his heart that’s been quiet for far too long. But when Jay’s oldest son becomes engaged to a local woman, suddenly Jay, Emma, and their children are swept up in wedding preparations. Witnessing his son’s joy, Jay wonders if it’s time for him to move forward, too, and find happiness again.Jay wants to court Emma in earnest, but Emma’s relatives remain troubled by the prospect of her moving on. Once again, love has come to Pinecraft. But can these two parties of four become a happy, healthy family of eight?Welcome back to Pinecraft, Florida. In my experience whenever there is a romance it is always between two young individuals who, possibly, have had a broken heart or two before meeting this new person but they have never been married before. In this book this changes. Both Emma and Jay have been married before and their spouses have died leaving them with three children each. Images of the Brady Bunch spring to mind however this is so much better. Emma and Jay’s romance is so much fun to read and participate in. Ms. Gray has given us real people in Emma and Jay and watching them grow individually and then together is a real treat. Then there is Frankie the beagle who loves pizza and cake. “A Wedding at the Orange Blossom Inn” is an exceptional story with exceptional characters that you care for and so want them to get together.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Litfuse Publicity Group.

"Therese Down in her new book “Only With Blood” published by Lion Hudson gives us A Novel of Ireland.From the back cover: Jack Flynn, strong and aggressive but slowly dying of tuberculosis on his farm in Tipperary in the Republic of Ireland, decides to acquire–purchase–a young wife who can bear him sons to inherit his family’s land. His choice, Caitlin Spillane, is less than half his age, attractive and intelligent, and resents bitterly the obedience that is forced upon her.When a young firebrand, a supporter of the IRA, arrives in the village, he and Caitlin are drawn together in their detestation of Flynn. Flynn, traumatized by his own insurgent IRA experiences twenty years earlier, is secretly convinced that Eamonn de Valera’s more diplomatic, peaceful approach to Ireland’s problems is the only sane one.Could Caitlin be won for the cause, and leave her unloved husband?A novel set against the struggle for the heart of Ireland in the Second World War, when the IRA notoriously sought assistance from the Nazis, Only with Blood explores flawed characters placed in extraordinary situations.I never read a book set in Ireland during the Second World War so that alone made this book interesting to me. Then there is the family, Jack Flynn looking for an heir. Caitlin, his young bride, expected to give him one. Donal, the IRA activist. Then there is the fighting of the War and between the IRA and Britton. This is fascinating stuff. Power, betrayal and political intrigues are just some of what has to be dealt with. Ms. Down is a highly gifted author who knows how to give us wonderful characters that are human and have strong emotions.

It’s impossible to stop, but one man doesn’t know enough to think the world can’t be saved. He’s no hero; not clever or capable, talented or tested. The Hollow Man is just trying to survive in an uncertain climate where terrorism is changing the rules of how we live.According to the author “The Hollow Man” is based on true events during the early 1970s. Chaban is the mastermind assassin that kills the unpopular Prime Minister of Spain. Now the analyst assigned to protect that Prime Minister begins a cat-and-mouse chase across Europe with Chaban. As the hunt progresses our hero narrowly escapes death again and again in this fast-paced thriller. “The Hollow Man” is loaded with twists and turns and red herrings that will leave you guessing all the while you are flipping pages to find out what happens next. Take the phone off the hook and make yourself a big bowl of popcorn because once you get started you will not want to put this book down until you actually finish.

With Italian artifacts disappearing at an alarming rate, Alabaster and Dante search for answers and create a trap for the thieves. Through a mysterious online contact Alabaster learns she is being followed, and with her safety at risk she is forced to rethink her chosen alliances and discover hidden truths about herself.I did not know that there was a Roma Underground. I thought all of the history of Rome was above ground. So for that alone this book was an eye opener. Then Mr. Valjan takes us into the culture and food of Rome. That is an experience also. I had no idea that there was such a profession as forensic accountant. Wow, learning all the time. And on top of that if your boss does not like your report you can get killed for it.

"Mary Ellis in her new book, “Midnight on the Mississippi” Book One in the Secrets of the South Mysteries published by Harvest House Publishers takes us into the lives of Hunter Galen and Nicki Price.From the back cover:  What lies beneath the black waters of the Bayou?New Orleans–Hunter Galen, a stock and securities broker, suspects his business partner, James Nowak, may be involved in embezzling their clients’ money, but he’s reluctant to jeopardize their friendship based on suspicion alone. After James turns up dead, Hunter realizes his unwillingness to confront a problem may have cost James his life.Nicki Price, a newly minted PI, intends to solve the stockbroker’s murder as she establishes herself in the career she adores. As she ferrets out fraud and deception at Galen-Nowak Investments, Hunter’s fiancée, Ashley Menard, rubs Nicki the wrong way. Nicki doesn’t trust the ostentatious woman who seems to be hiding something, but is the PI’s growing attraction to Hunter–the police’s only suspect–her true reason for disliking Ashley?As Hunter and Nicki encounter sophisticated shell games, blackmail, and death threats both subtle and overt, danger swirls around them like the mysterious dark waters of the Bayou. Only their reliance on faith and fearless determination gives them hope they will live to see another day.I like New Orleans. It is a city I have not visited (yet) though by reading this book Not only do I desire to visit it more I learned more things about the city and feel as if I have been there, at least in spirit. I have never read of a Just Beginning Private Investigator. Shows there is a first time for everything. Nicki is a wonderful character, who represents the poorer side of town while Hunter represents Upper Society. Obviously these two clash at the beginning as Nicki actually thinks Hunter killed his partner. So do the police which presents a problem. Eventually Nicki comes around to see that Hunter is innocent and then the fun really begins. This is an exciting story as Nicki tries to solve her first case with everything working against her. Nicki and Hunter are terrific characters that Ms. Ellis has breathed life into and that we root for them to succeed. And did I mention that there is a romance also? “Midnight on the Mississippi” is a lot of fun and it entertains you as you keep flipping pages as you try to find out what is going to happen next.  Ms. Ellis has a great way of telling the story and moving it along at a nice pace. A really enjoyable read.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Harvest House Publishers.

"Wm. Paul Young in his new book, “Eve”published by Howard Books brings us into the life of Eve.From the back cover:  From the author of the twenty-two-million-copy bestseller The Shack comes a captivating new novel destined to be one of the most talked-about books of the decade.When a shipping container washes ashore on an island between our world and the next, John the Collector finds a young woman inside—broken, frozen, and barely alive. With the aid of Healers and Scholars, John oversees her recovery and soon discovers that her genetic code connects her to every known race. No one would guess what her survival will mean…No one but Eve, Mother of the Living, who calls her “daughter” and invites her to witness the truth about her own story—indeed, the truth about us all.Eve is a bold, unprecedented exploration of the Creation narrative, true to the original texts and centuries of scholarship—yet with breathtaking discoveries that challenge traditional beliefs about who we are and how we’re made. Eve opens a refreshing conversation about the equality of men and women within the context of our beginnings, helping us see each other as our Creator does—complete, unique, and not constrained by cultural rules or limitations.As The Shack awakened readers to a personal, non-religious understanding of God, Eve will free us from faulty interpretations that have corrupted human relationships since the Garden of Eden.Thoroughly researched and exquisitely written, Eve is a masterpiece that will inspire readers for generations to come.Mr. Young has taken on the story of creation. Adam, Eve, The Garden Of Eden all the familiar elements that we have grown up with. He has added new thoughts from other parts of The Bible so that we get the story between Genesis One, Verse One and Genesis One Verse Two. Didn’t know there was a whole story between these two verses? Well have no fear it are presented here. Mr. Young has done a marvelous job of bringing his characters to life on the page.  I am not so sure I agree with the theology that is presented. I guess this is something the reader will have to determine for themselves.

Over time, his tiny church grew into the worldwide Hillsong ministry, leading people all over the globe to follow the greatest Guide who ever walked the path of life–Jesus.In this straightforward book, Brian Houston shows his own life-tested experiences and the powerful Biblical truths he’s learned that will enable you to live fully, love completely, and lead boldly–the hallmarks of Jesus’ time on earth. When it comes to life with Jesus, there is no doubt —your best is yet to come.Brian Houston tells us, “we are all born with God-given potential to change the world around us. To show us how Pastor Houston has divided the book into four parts:  Part One:  A Big Life, Part Two:  A Difficult Path, Part Three:  A Narrow Gate and Part Four:  A Glorious Future. Is it going to be easy? Sometimes not. However it is going to be an amazing adventure. All we have to do is follow Jesus. Sounds simple enough. Sometimes we run out of energy but we have to keep going. After all Jesus gives us the direction, the insight and He has already given us the potential to fulfill His plans for us. I believe that “Live Love Lead” is a book that each one of us should read and then keep close by so that we can refer back to it.

"My husband is a car fanatic, so he was really happy to get his hand on this little set. He has enjoyed washing and drying his car and loves the quality of clean the mitt provides. The microfiber cloth does an excellent job of drying - as all microfiber towels do. It absorbs a tremendous amount of water and you only need the one cloth to dry your entire car (that's how absorbent it is). The little finger mitt is so cute and great for small jobs/objects.Both mitts also come in handy for dusting! I absolutely hate dusting and it makes me sneeze, but this mitt makes it kind of fun and it's more convenient. Just wipe the area that needs dusting as if you're wiping it off with your actual hand and you're done. It's extremely effective and doesn't leave even a speck behind! :)To get the items clean, I simply throw them in the washing machine with my regular load and they come out fine. Whether you need to wet wash or dry clean something, these are amazing at doing so.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

"I am not a fan of skincare products with a laundry list of ingredients. This serum has only 5 ingredients and those 5 are the best of the best when it comes to skincare. Best of all, they all work well on MY skin. I have weird skin that doesn't always like the things that everyone else likes.... Things often irritate my skin or break me out, so I'm always hesitant with new products because I know that the worst scenario is a face full of embarrassing breakouts.Luckily, this serum has not embarrassed me yet! I haven't had any extra breakouts since using it. As a matter of fact, the ones I did have cleared up pretty quickly just a week and a half after using this. I love that this serum is so light and gentle. A little goes a long way for sure. I generally use two pumps for my face and neck and I apply it while my skin is damp as it seems to absorb better and more quickly that way. It also dries very quickly and leaves my skin feeling really soft (not tight either).I now have less noticeable pores, lighter acne scars (in conjunction with my moisturizer, this is giving a 1-2 punch to those acne marks), and an overall smoother complexion (no more rough patches). The pump is very convenient and I haven't had issues with it at all. I don't use this much around my eyes, though, since I have a dedicated gel for that. I'm in my mid-30's, so my skin is definitely not what it used to be. However, so far this has really been helping to bring back that youthful complexion.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

"I had some issues with this at first. It seems that my skin is sensitive to retinol, so I have to be careful with it. I can't mix it with some other products I use either (like benzoyl peroxide creams), which kind of sucks (it causes irritation and tiny red bumps on my skin). Once I figured out how to make this work for my skin, though, it was smooth sailing.I only use this at night once I've cleansed, toned, and allow my serum to dry. I apply as thin of a layer as I can and in the morning, my skin feels really soft, looks brighter, and my huge hormonal breakouts don't look as angry. Hormonal breakouts are the main reason I like to use retinol right now (they're more annoying than aging skin to me). This product is great at reducing the size and redness of those huge under-the-skin bumps that take forever to go away!! They even seem to go away faster than usual (maybe around 1 1/2 - 2 weeks).I like that the moisturizer is very gentle, soothing and hydrating! It has a very pleasant, clean and natural smell as well. My acne scars have also been fading away very nicely. I love that the first ingredient is aloe vera, which is very healing and gentle - it works very well on my skin.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

"I don't wear much makeup so I don't need a ton of brushes, and I certainly don't need the highest quality of brushes. Even though these are cheap, the quality is there for occasional usage; they don't disappoint. These brushes are really soft, easy to clean, and perform as expected with my BB cream, eye shadows, and mineral powders.If you have purchased brushes from Amazon before, then you'll know that most do have a weird smell upon arrival. So yes, these do have a smell that is a bit strong at first (I think it's mostly due to the case), however, it quickly goes away once you wash the brushes and let everything air out. It certainly won't do any harm to the brushes or your skin. I like to use a face cleanser to wash the brushes since I break out easy (I use an acne cleanser).I love the pleather case that the brushes come in as well. It's excellent quality and folds up nicely, which is great for storage and portability. I think the case alone is almost worth the price.You can get water on it and not worry about it being ruined - it wipes right off. I leave the brushes in it (with it open, of course) to air out.The bristles are very nice and so gentle. I did notice a few were hanging out when I first opened them, but after washing none others fell out. The brushes are put together and have been holding up very nicely to my 1-2 times a week usage.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

"I wasn't sure how this brush would work on my extremely thick, tightly curled hair, but it works amazingly!! It not only helps to detangle, but it is also great for defining my curls even more. I have a 4a hair mixed with a little 4b texture here and there, so I use a lot of curl defining gels and creams. This brush works great in combination with those to help define even more.The mirror on the back of the brush makes this the perfect purse brush! I like that I can bring this along with me if needed in my purse and there's a convenient mirror on the back to make sure everything looks good. I don't carry a compact, so this is the next best thing - it's extremely convenient.The colorful plastic bristles are really cute and the ends/tips are round and don't pull or snag your hair. They're also extremely flexible, making this great for tender-headed children and adults! I also like how the bristled are spaced out.

"This is a great size bottle compared to most. I've been using this about a month now and I'm really surprised at how little is needed. Using it day and night, the bottle is definitely going to last me a good 6+ months. I also can't believe how moisturizing it is! I thought it would be drying due to the Benzol Peroxide, but it's just the opposite.I can comfortably wear this all day without worry about it drying out my skin and in turn creating even more oil. It helps to keep my oil production at bay and I have been breaking out a LOT less than I was before using it. Actually, my breakouts in all areas except my chin and jawline have stopped (yay) - and that's only because those are hormonal and nothing external helps those much.I like to use this along with an acne cleanser and I use a spot treatment on whiteheads when needed.

"These blue sunglasses are pretty cool and fashionable (although they may not suit everyone’s preference). I only have one issue with them: I feel like I’m wearing 3D glasses! I guess this weird feeling I get is due to the polarized lenses; they cut glare and brightness giving comfortable vision to the user. However, I find that they make me a little dizzy from time-to-time. I like how lightweight they are but looking through them…. well, I have to get more used to them.To some, these sunglasses might seem a little cheap. Yes, they are made of plastic, but they’re great quality in my opinion. All pieces are put together securely and there aren’t any loose ends or anything. However, they might be better geared toward children (don’t they look like something your young daughter might wear?).The lens has a mirror finish, which is great if you want to hide your eyes. I do like the way the block the glare of the sun, which is great for driving. There is a bit of reddish tint to objects when looking through them, which I think is what gives the 3D feeling. Although I do like them, I’m sure this style is not for everyone. It’s definitely unique, though.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

"This cell phone clip holder is easy to use and has a really long, flexible arm with a clip that holds your phone securely. It has a strong bracket type clip that can easily be attached to a tablet, chair, or anything else with an edge. You just take it out of the box, attach the clip holder to the body (just push down and it clicks right in), clip it (attach the bracket) onto a desk, table, or anywhere else you want to use it, and then put your phone in the clip holder.The long arm is very flexible and can be stretched and bent into different different shapes and angles. It has a long reach, so you don’t need to have it right next to you. It can be pulled over to you when needed and then pushed back when not in used. A clip holder like this is so versatile. It can be used just about anywhere, as long as you have somewhere to clip it. It also puts your phone in easy reach. It would also be useful in the car, in the kitchen, in the bedroom (ie. attached to your night stand), in the bathroom, you name it.The clip that holds your phone is also flexible. It can be turned and rotated 360 degrees (all around). It’s very cool and just really convenient and handy to have around. It’s definitely more flexible and useful than any other cell phone holder I’ve tried.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

"I'm still on the fence with these. When I take just one, I don't stay asleep the entire night. I literally toss and turn so much that I wake up feeling worse (tired and cranky) and end up needing a nap later that day. Plus, I keep waking up every 1-2 hours, which is very frustrating. It's not worth me taking it to have such irregular sleep like that.On the other hand, when I take two of these, I sleep TOO much! It seemed like I just couldn't get enough sleep - no matter how long I slept. A few days I slept 9-10 hours (longer than I usually do), woke up not feeling totally rested and then ended up going back to sleep a few hours later and slept another 3-4 hours. Even on some days, I still didn't feel rested after that nap!I have a pretty bad case of insomnia. I stay up all night/early morning long and sleep during half of the day. I was hoping these would help me to get on a more regular schedule, but instead they disrupt my sleep even more. I either don't get enough sleep or get too much and still feel like I haven't had enough.For the record, these do help me to relax and I get to sleep a LOT faster than not taking them at all. I guess I'll have to look at other options. As someone else mentioned, I've had the same type or results with other Melatonin supplements as well, so I guess it's not for me. I also like the taste of these and LOVE that they're gummies. I have a hard time swallowing pills, so they're super easy and convenient for me to take. So while I like them, I don't like the effect that Malatonin has on my body. However, I can't fault this supplement for that since it's ME (my fault).I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

"This coffee grinder works just as well as another I have that is the same style. This one was actually easier to take apart, though (the other was super tight - almost glued together). If you know how to use a coffee grinder, then using this is a piece of cake. Just add your coffee beans (I use 1 TBSP per cup), grind, brew and you're done.I find this grinder very easy to clean. Even the the plastic cup inside the bottom holder comes out if needed. I had a few pieces stuck in the bottom and I tapped it on the counter and the plastic piece just slid right out after a few hard taps. I didn't know this would happen, but it's convenient because it made it really easy to get those stuck pieces out.I love that you can adjust the grinder to get a super fine or more chunky powder. I prefer somewhere in the middle. It does give you a little arm workout to use, but it only takes maybe 2-3 minutes to get the beans ground and ready for brewing.

"My husband has always been a large laptop bag kind of guy, but ever since I introduced him to this smaller messenger bag he hasn't been using large laptop bag nearly as often. He is a graphic designer and he does a lot of drawing and sketching, so this size bag is perfect to carry his sketch books, pencils and other supplies. He can also fit his digital camera and phone.This bag is great when he doesn't want or need to take a lot of items on-the-go. He can just grab it, throw it over his shoulder, and go. It's really lightweight so it doesn't take any effort or strength. It's stylish too and looks great whether dressed up or dressed down.

"This little gadget is easy to set up, easy to use, and very convenient. All you need is a smartphone or tablet with working Bluetooth and you're good to go. It syncs quickly and effortlessly, allowing you the convenience of having the camera shutter right in the palm of your hand. Then, you can simply place your phone or tablet at a distance. This is great for taking group photos or pictures of a large area.The one thing to note about this is that you will need to make sure your device's camera is all set up to USE THE VOLUME KEYS AS THE SHUTTER. If not, this shutter will not work. Not all device cameras have this option. On my both my smartphone and tablet, I have to download an alternative camera just to use this or a selfie stick since I can't set the volume keys as the shutter. So be mindful of that.If you press the button on this and your camera does not take a picture (it will probably zoom in/out instead like mine), then you need to use a different camera app. There are plenty in the app store that allow you to change this setting, so it's really no big deal. Besides that, this Bluetooth shutter works perfectly and comes in handy for many situations.

"I'm a huge tea lover and I drink 2-3 cups a day! I can honestly say that this is definitely one of the best tasting and most convenient teas I've ever tried. The best thing about it is the way you make the tea.I've never even had a tea product like this before; it's like a tea bag and spoon all-in-one. It's so easy: just place the tea stick in hot water, wait for it to brew, and then stir the tea stick. You can add sweetener if you like and mix it in using the tea stick as a stirrer! Clever, right? The tea stick has little holes in it so it acts as a infuser.I love the flavor of this tea. It's my first time having pineapple flavored tea. I love it enough to buy it in the near feature (which I plan to do). I definitely want to try more flavors as well. I love that the tea sticks are individually sealed can can be taken with me wherever I go. Best of all, no spoon needed!

"This is a great little starter workout and muscle building kit for men. Shoutout to all the husbands who keep saying they're going to workout everyday, but then don't (the procrastination is real)! LOL. My husband is probably the leader of that group, hahaha, but this shirt did give him some extra motivation and encouragement to actually start working out. So, I'm very  happy about that!It was a little big on him, but not too much. He has gained some weight in the past 5 years and he wants to lose it and tone up. This shirt is great quality and has nice cutouts so that he can see his muscles and clearly see the areas he needs to work on. The measuring tape is great too because he doesn't have to guess if he's gained muscle, he can actually measure and keep track! The tape works well and can be easily thrown into a pocket or gym bag.Has my husband started working out everyday because of this, no, but he has at least started doing something extra - push-ups and sit-ups. He also loves to just wear this around the house since it's very comfortable. Hey, I have no complaints about that! :)I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

"I know this Konjac sponge is described as ""for me,"" but I'm a woman and I've been using and enjoying it as well. The charcoal Konjac sponges are best for my oily, acne-prone skin type because they help to draw out all the gunk and toxins from my pores. I have definitely noticed a difference since using this in the mornings (I only use it once a day). My skin always appears smoother and my complexion always looks a little brighter after using it.I like to use the rougher side (the other side is smooth) to help give myself a nice, gentle exfoliation with my cleanser of choice. Then I finish up by removing it with the smooth side and rinsing with warm water. The sponge is very easy to clean although it does take a few minutes to squeeze all of the soap out. Since the sponge is fragile and I don't want to get holes in it, I gently squeeze it between both of my hands until no more soap comes out.This Konjac is large (much bigger than any other I've tried), which can be a little bit of a pain for small hands like mine. It does get a little slippery once you wet it and start lathering with your cleanser. However, it has never fallen out of my hands. The sponge is hard as a rock when dry and gets very soft once you soak it in water. It's very easy to use and it comes with a string so that you can hang it up to dry overnight.Overall, it's definitely worth using if you have problem skin and want to help keep it more clear / acne free.

"I use this for recording the majority of my videos (especially unboxings and demos) with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition), which fits great by the way! I even take it with me sometimes when I need to record videos away from home. I love that I can literally mount this practically anywhere and on anything I'd like. As long as the object is strong, sturdy and thin enough for this to latch on to, it will work well.The mount does have some weight to it (it's not lightweight) and it can take some work to adjust it; you'll need a little bit of muscle! The actual holder (where you put your tablet) holds well. I've never had an issue with my tablet falling out; it's very secure. The gooseneck itself can be a little wobbly depending on the item it's mounted on or the way you actually have the gooseneck positioned.You don't want it to be in a place where you'll often bump it because you'll end up with an unsteady video that will need much stabilization! The mount part is easy to attach/detach to a table, chair, or anything else with a ledge. You just twist the little piece right above it it to tighten or loosen up.It often does take me 5-10 minutes to get the gooseneck positioned just right but it's worth it because it allows me to be hands free. It's really convenient if you like to watch videos on your tablet as well. You can take it in the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, wherever you want.

"Growing up in the 80's, I learned to crochet with Red Heart yarn. We didn't have access to all the luxury yarns available today. As an adult, once I picked up knitting and crocheting again, I dismissed acrylic yarns as somehow inferior to all those expensive luxury yarns. (I wasn't quite a yarn snob, but I didn't like the feel of acrylic while working with it.) But I've since used Red Heart to make several afghans and throws, and I have to say I've totally changed my mind. I now recognize it for the value it really is: it's inexpensive, widely available, and virtually indestructible. (I still have and use an afghan my mom made me with RHSS about thirty years ago.) I also think the yarn has a lot of body and a decent twist. And by far, its best characteristic has to be its easy washability. I love that I can toss this in a washer and dryer and not fret about it. In a house with pets and/or children, that's an absolute must for me. I've thrown exclusivity out the window in favor of function and practicality. I like knowing that when I gift a handmade blanket to a loved one that it's going to hold up and not accidentally be felted or destroyed in some way!Currently I'm using hunter green and aran for the double-knit throw I'm making my husband for Christmas. I'm only a few rows in, but the afghan is looking beautiful so far! The hunter green is rich and deeply saturated, and the colors look beautiful together. Some of the SS colors can be somewhat drab, but some of them really pop. The pic above doesn't do the color justice; I find that the photos on the RH website more accurately reflect the true colors of the yarn.As for working with it: okay, so it's not cuddly soft like 100% merino, but I've noticed in the last few years that RHSS has become softer. Some colors feel softer than others. After a washing (or a few), the yarn does soften and even ""fluffs"" up a little bit. The only drawback I've noticed is on particularly humid days in the summer or before a thunderstorm, the yarn gets really squeaky on my needles or hook, and I have a hard time working with it. But other than that, it really doesn't deserve the bad reputation that it has among the knitters of today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSV0KNEJPHTFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KSOHBM#wasThisHelpful","RSV0KNEJPHTFF","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first went CG, I started with some drugstore brands of conditioner, because they are cheaper and I was experimenting. Unfortunately, none of them did much for me. They usually resulted in very limp, greasy strings and completely destroyed my curl pattern. Apparently, I needed protein. So I started using this stuff, and, voila, my curls returned. OneCondition is great, because it is not overly moisturizing, and it contains a bit of protein which adds volume to my hair. The slip isn't as slick as that of the ultra-moisturizing conditioners, but it suits me well. It really just seems to be a well-balanced conditioner. If you have super dry or super thick hair, this may not be the best choice, but for my fine 3a/3b Botticelli curls it is perfect.It's terrific as a co-wash too.

"I've been following the CG method for about three months now. At first, my hair hated this product. But as my hair got healthier, I started being able to use this. If my hair is too dry, this just makes it sticky. If my hair is too moisturized, this makes it sticky. But when I've achieved a good protein/moisture balance (which happens more and more lately), this stuff is like magic. My hair is very fine, and my curls are very damaged from many years of abuse and straightening. So, when I wake up in the morning (after sleeping with a satin bonnet on), my curls are smooshed and practically gone. I spritz a little water on them, follow up with a little gel, and wait for that to dry. Once dry, I hold the Mister Right about 8-10"" from my head and mist very lightly and scrunch again. All of a sudden, I've got plump, shiny, happy little curl bundles! It is like magic. So, if it doesn't work for you, make sure your hair is balanced and that you are not using too much of this. Make sure you are holding the bottle several inches from your head and that it falls as a mist over the hair. It is very easy to overuse this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HU8WBZ6N63XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HJ0ICY#wasThisHelpful","R2HU8WBZ6N63XH","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've got 3a/3b, high porosity, very fine Botticelli curls with a few corkscrews. For the past two months, I have been transitioning to curly after hating and straightening my hair most of my life. It hasn't been easy, but I have learned a lot about my hair's needs. Following what many of the others have written here, I apply this liberally after my leave-in conditioner. My hair is about two inches past my shoulders, and I use 4-5 pumps. I used to rake it through my hair, but that messed with my clumping, so I stopped doing that.

In a million years, I never would have thought I could have beautiful, well-defined, frizz-free, soft, bouncy curls...but I now do. If you are transitioning and having a hard time figuring out the right combo for your hair, don't give up! It is a harder process for some of us, but it is one well-worth undertaking. Experimentation with products and reading a lot of forums on naturallycurly.com have been integral to my transition.

"When I initially converted to CG, I used only gel. I had curl, but my hair was so damaged that I wasn't getting the curls I remembered having when I was younger. I bought this product after reading the reviews, and I LOVE it. After scrunching out the excess water with a tee shirt, I apply a moderate amount of this then follow up with a generous amount of gel. Using too much of this will result in a slightly greasy look, so be careful. This product bundles my curls nicely and makes 'em shine, while the gel adds protein and sets my curls in place. (For gel, I either use the Angel or Aussie Instant Freeze, if I need a harder hold.) I highly recommend this product in conjunction with gel, especially if you are transitioning to natural.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PFO2YD2R29PT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K26D9E#wasThisHelpful","R3PFO2YD2R29PT","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For over a decade I've been straightening my 3a/3b hair. Recently, I've been toying with the idea of wearing it curly. Since I love all of the other KMS products I use, I was sure this would be just as effective. I've been using it on my second-day curls and have to say it does work...at least, initially. My curls get frizzy and straighten out a little overnight. I spritz some of this on my head in the morning and follow with just a little bit of water. Then, I flip my head over and scrunch my curls. When I stand back upright, my curls are bouncy and shiny again.But there is a downfall. I noticed after a few hours that my curls would get a little tangled and slightly tacky or sticky. So I looked at the list of ingredients. Alcohol is the first ingredient. Thus, it is very drying. On my hair, at least, the shine deteriorates after awhile, leaving behind a dry, goopy mess.I'm outside in the wind and other weather conditions a lot, so that may have something to do with it. If I were in a climate-controlled environment all day, possibly I would get a different result. I wanted to love this product, and I really thought I would. But I don't.I just discovered the Curly Girl method and am going to give that a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJKZKUEREPMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JDPK2Q#wasThisHelpful","RTJKZKUEREPMF","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously been unfamiliar with Temple's work, as both designer and author. For that matter, I'm not too familiar with any crochet designers. I found her writing style to be delightful and witty. Many times throughout the book, I also found myself laughing out loud and nodding my head in agreement. With such chapters as ""The Day I Ran Out of Yarn: A Horror Story,"" ""Crochet Needs a Good PR Agency,"" and ""The Center-Pull Skein--Modern Convenience or Urban Legend?"" it is impossible to not adoringly identify with her plight. She makes no bones about it - she is neither apologetic, nor ashamed of her love of the rather uncool craft of crochet. She speaks of crocheters as `the silent majority,' yet also questions if it is necessary that we crafters identify ourselves as members of one group. After all, many of us do more than one. Knitting and crocheting need not be mutually exclusive, and one is certainly no better than the other.If you enjoy crocheting and/or have a yarn addiction (see the chapter entitled ""Crocheter vs. Stash""), I definitely recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZXD010I9CKJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0740778129#wasThisHelpful","R1ZXD010I9CKJN","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used both Lion Brand Sock Ease and Knit Picks sock yarn to make socks. Both are 75% wool and 25% nylon. Comparatively, the Knit Picks yarn is much softer and stretchier than the Sock Ease yarn. Knit Picks' sock yarn is easier on my hands during the knitting process, but those socks also lack the terrific structure that my Sock Ease socks have. For me the structure and drape of this yarn is more important than how soft it is. (That being said, they're still plush and wonderful on my feet.) The yarn is finished in aloe vera which does help ease the scratchiness a bit. Also, the yarn seems extremely durable and is tangle-free.I love that this yarn is machine washable and even machine driable. With each washing, the yarn continues to soften slightly. To wash them, I turn them inside out then put them on the gentle cycle in warm water and lay them flat to air dry. Although they are softening, they still have that great structure and drape that I like. Although they're not super soft, they're still my favorite socks; and I wear them all the time. They don't ever feel rough or scratchy on my feet.I bought this yarn in Taffy and Green Apple and made the Contrast Toe & Heel socks from the free pattern on Lion Brand's website. They turned out beautifully, and the colors are gorgeous. I'm very pleased with my socks and intend to make more pairs using Sock Ease.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3UOHXYGKRDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D7WO92#wasThisHelpful","RJ3UOHXYGKRDL","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been searching for a natural alternative to the face moisturizer I had been using for years. Although I loved it, I didn't love the synthetics in it. Prior to this purchase, I had never heard of jojoba oil. But the price was right, the reviews were glowing, so I figured, why not?I didn't notice anything spectacular after the first application. But I continued to apply it nightly after my shower. I'm so glad I did. Wow, is this stuff awesome! My skin is so much softer than it has ever been, yet it's not oily or greasy in any way. I've never worn much make-up, but now I get away with the lightest smattering of foundation or none at all. My skin looks more radiant/dewy and less dry, flaky, and tight.Upon some of the recommendations here, a few nights ago I applied a dab to the ends of my hair - which are slightly more damaged than the rest of my hair - and they really do appear to be much smoother now. The best part is this isn't some fancy, overly-priced beauty gunk; it's natural, soothing, and super cheap. In addition, a bottle lasts a very long time, because you need so little per application. What can I say? I'm hooked. Thanks to all the reviewers out there, without which I would have never tried this stuff.Get this.

"I'm recovering from adrenal fatigue/CFS caused by severe leaky gut and gut dysbiosis. As such, my immune system is busy nearly 24/7. I take several antioxidant supplements, including liposomal vitamin C. Previously, after researching Dr. Levy's work, I began taking large quantities of ascorbic acid powder. He claims this is useful in reducing free radicals and destruction of the mitochondria (oxidative stress). I was having results with that, but I never seemed to reach GI tolerance. So I knew I still wasn't getting enough vitamin C, despite taking the stuff all day long.I then found this company's glutathione, started taking it, and was blown away. So I ordered this too. I take 1-2 packets a day. Dr. Levy believes that the liposomal form of vitamin C is equivalent to 8-10 times the same amount of ascorbic acid powder. I like that I get so much bang for my buck and that I don't have to drink tons and tons of vitamin C powder. Also, this product passively diffuses into cell membranes and delivers the vitamin C directly into cells, where it is needed. No ATP required. What a terrific idea!I've since started making my own homemade liposomal vitamin C. It's about 70% as effective as this product, but it's much cheaper to produce. I do still keep a box around for when I need an extra boost. I squeeze the contents of the sachet into a glass of water with a sachet of Lypo SphericTM GSH and drink it that way. The taste isn't bad at all. This is really a terrific product, and the delivery system can't be beat.

"I bought these grains for my boyfriend who needs probiotics but hates the taste of my milk kefir. These grains arrived quickly. As others have noted, the seller is thoughtful. They sent along over a sheet of information on rehydrating and culturing your water kefir. We followed the instructions to the letter, and it took about two weeks for these guys to plump back up. We had placed them in a jar with distilled water, a few drops of Liqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle, and some sugar and placed a lid loosely on the jar. Then we set the jar next to our crock-pot, because these microbes like the warmth. A few days ago, we strained the first batch of water kefir, and I'm happy to report it was a success! My fella said it tasted like apple cider. He's happy with the taste, and I'm happy he's getting the probiotics.

"Holy cow, I LOVE these shoes-that-aren't-really-shoes.A year ago, my boyfriend purchased a pair of Sanuk Men's Grifter Sidewalk Surfer Slip-On and fell in love with them. I thought they were cute and comfy too, so I'd often wear them myself. Other than that, I'd always wear the same old pair of Vans slip-ons that I've had for years. When my Vans Classic Slip-On started literally falling apart, I despaired that I'd have to finally buy a new pair of shoes. I decided I'd try a pair of Sanuks.Well, I fell in love immediately. I ordered the June Bug in gray in a size 8, my normal shoe size. They fit PERFECTLY. They were somewhat tight around the top of my foot for the first few days. Now they're broken-in and fit like a glove. It's like my feet are encased in clouds. Seriously. I'm really, really impressed with these shoes. They're cute, but even more importantly, they're the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. And comfort is hugely important to me. I keep my old Vans around for working in the garden, but my Sanuks are now my go-to shoes for everything. I will definitely continue to buy Sanuks for a very long time.These are the next best thing to being barefoot. I now like wearing shoes a whole lot more.

"I've got unruly, curly hair. I've been straightening it daily or every other day for over a decade. As such, I've tried many products to protect my hair from heat damage, while getting it straight. This is, hands down, my favorite product to use. First, I spray KMS silksheen leave-in conditioner hair detangler 5.1 fl oz / 150 ml lightly to the ends of my damp hair then apply a dollop of this creme, running it through with my fingers. For my hair, this is the best combo I've found, and I've not changed it in three years (although I would love to try KMS' new 'Freeshape' line). I also shampoo and condition with the 'Flat Out' and 'Color Vitality' lines. These products dramatically reduce my blow-dry time to less than ten minutes. I'm not really into spending a lot of time primping, so I LOVE this. Also, I need only run my flat-iron over my hair once, and I'm good to go. Before using these products, there's no way one time would have cut it. And the best part? This stuff makes my hair impermeable to humidity. My hairstyle is maintained, even on rainy days. I'm sure there are other terrific brands out there, but I've tried many (both cheaper and more expensive); and this is the only brand that manages my unruly hair without ending up greasy and shellacked to my head. Definitely recommend.Oh, and did I mention they all smell terrific? I've got chemical sensitivities to cheaper supermarket brands' products and can't use them.

"I'm fairly miserly, meaning I don't like to spend much money on stuff when there is a cheaper alternative. However, in the case of hair conditioner, I'm willing to shell out the extra dough. I used this for two years and fell in love with it. It really does maintain my hair dye and smells wonderful.Recently, I decided I wanted to try some cheaper supermarket brands, in order to save some money. I tried 4 different brands (which I won't list here) to no avail. I have naturally curly hair that I straighten. They left my hair greasy and easily tangled, even after straightening. In addition, I was very sensitive to the chemicals in those products. Finally, I sucked it up and went back to my old standby, KMS.

"I had been frequenting a fairly pricey salon for the last few years, because it was the only place I'd found that would leave me feeling satisfied after each appointment. The problem? It got way too expensive, and I just couldn't continue to afford going every few months. A year ago, I stopped going and told myself I'd find a cheaper place. Well, that never happened. I don't consider myself a vain woman by any means, but I've wasted a lot of money and time over the years on botched haircuts and dye jobs. I didn't have the heart to go through that again. This resulted in my going a year - yes, an entire year - without a haircut. Although my layers were still evident, they were quite shaggy and shapeless.I discovered the Creaclip on youtube, watched a bunch of videos, and read what other people had to say. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I ordered one. It arrived very quickly (today, in fact), and I immediately put it to use. I started by taking off half an inch or so. I have to say, this thing is really, really easy to use. I've never cut hair in my life, but, within a few minutes, I was creating layers all over the place! This product easily gave me results similar to those I've gotten in the pricey salons. I'm not discounting hair-dressers or their work, but I'm a very low-maintenance, do-it-yourself kind of gal, and this product is exactly what I've been looking for. Not only do I save loads of money, I also save my time. Plus, it's kind of fun to use.This product does a great job, but the material itself seems cheap. I'm not sure why these clips are priced so high. I ordered it off of the Creaclip site, which sells for a few dollars cheaper than Amazon. Still, I caught on quickly; the clips are extremely user-friendly and foolproof; and I'm very pleased with the results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIGJ998GALD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NMR6TY#wasThisHelpful","R3RIGJ998GALD1","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW. This book is outstanding. Others have reviewed the book's content, and they do it far better than I could. So, instead, I'll attest to the healing power of this diet.Over a year and a half ago, I became sick. Super sick. So sick I was unable to get out of bed. I eventually realized my adrenal glands were shot. So I quit my job and school and took time off, expecting to recuperate within a few months. Ha.I researched and researched, pouring over everything I could read online. I had a Candida infection (resulting from allopathic drugs) that never went away. I'd literally feel poisoned, especially after eating. My immune system was a mess. I had zero energy. I suffered severe chemical and mold sensitivities and began to develop hives. I started developing arthritis in my knees and fingers. Some days it was so bad it prevented me from knitting/crocheting, two of my favorite pasttimes. I experienced constant congestion and back-to-back sinus infections. My body was in terrible shape. I'm not a dramatic person by nature, but I assure you, some days I wasn't sure how much sicker one could get before the body just gave up altogether. I kept getting weaker and more exhausted by the day. For months, I didn't leave the house. For the record, I'm 32 years old. (Mind-blowing, isn't it?) After several months of research and trial and error, I discovered the adrenal issues were a symptom of a much larger problem - severe leaky gut and gut dysbiosis.If the preceding paragraph sounds like hyperbole to you, I can't say I blame you. Before my experience, I'd have been skeptical too. I had been preparing to study biochemistry in grad school. Before I became ill, I thought chronic illnesses and autoimmune diseases could merely be 'managed.' In blind faith, I had accepted what the medical establishment tells us. That was fine, until the medical establishment failed me...repeatedly. I gave up on allopathic medicine and knew it would be my responsibility to heal myself. As much as this illness has consumed me, it really was a true wake-up call. A blessing in disguise.So I researched. Boy, did I research. I took vitamin/mineral supplements. I got my detox pathways up and running again, as per Dr. Myhill's methylation protocol. I followed her advice for supporting mitochondrial health. I started eating meat. I had been a vegetarian for 16 years, but I was so sick I had no difficulty adjusting to eating meat again. In fact, I craved it. Things improved slightly, but my quality of life was still abysmal.Finally, a few months ago I happened upon some website extolling the GAPS diet. I looked into it but figured I was already eating a clean (mostly) paleo diet, so I didn't need to buy this book. I didn't think it was that different from what I was already doing. When I had to stay home on Christmas day because I felt so toxic and crummy, I decided to purchase the book.So, sure I had already eliminated processed foods and gluten. But I still ate cheese everyday. I still ate sweet potatoes and oats. I still ate a lot of fiber. This book showed me the error of my ways. These things are fine for a healthy gut. But my gut was a complete wreck and needed special help. More importantly, this book showed me what I WASN'T eating that I needed to be eating: lots of bone broth and marrow, organ meats, and lots of ferments, amongst other things.I started following the GAPS diet intro on January 1st of this year. The first two weeks were brutal. I had been toxic for so long that I was used to feeling lousy, but the die-off this diet produced was intense. In the book, she stresses the importance of managing die-off; but, because I was so toxic, there was really little I could do. The diet alone, even without the introduction of probiotics, sauerkraut, and kefir was enough to produce rapid die-off.Then early last week, it was like the fog broke. Gradually, I started having more energy. I announced to my shocked boyfriend that I wanted to go for a walk in the park like we used to do. We did. I suffered no repercussions from it, whereas before GAPS it would have taken me days to recover. I now go for a 30-45 minute walk nearly every day. I can't stress how utterly amazing this is. I prayed that GAPS would help me. It was my last resort. However, I never expected it to work this quickly. Truth be told, I'm still stunned.I'm nowhere near fully recovered. I've still got toxins circulating. I still feel die-off, but it is nowhere near what it once was. True, I take other supplements. However, since starting GAPS I have stopped taking the majority of my supplements, simply because I no longer need them. At long last, my diet is providing the nutrients my body has been needing all along for repair (particularly cholesterol and saturated fats, which are sadly demonized in our culture). I probably sound like a crazy person because I'm so, so excited about this book and this diet; but if you're sick like I was, you know all too well what it's like to live in a chronically ill body. I don't know what percentage of CFS is caused by gut dysbiosis, but I know that mine was. If yours is, this is, without a doubt, the diet to follow.Because I'm having such rapid success on the intro phase, I intend to stick with it for a few months. Some people fly through it in a matter of days before starting full GAPS. That's the nice thing about this diet; you move at your own pace and let your body be the guide.I'm also curious to see how this diet helps me with the mental health issues I've contended with since childhood (namely fits of debilitating anxiety, ocd, and depression that have become increasingly severe in the last few years). I had tried several SSRI's over the last ten years until a new doctor put me on Adderall (which is nothing more than a mixture of amphetamine salts and is very, very hard on the adrenals) after diagnosing me with ADHD. The SSRI's never worked. I'd be happy if GAPS prevents my anxiety from getting worse, but truly I'd love to see the anxiety eliminated permanently. At this point I have no expectations. After all, I've lived with the anxiety for 30 years. But if anything can help, I firmly believe it'll be this diet.This book saved me. Reading success stories of people recovering from CFS is what got me through the worst moments. I hope my story does the same, and I will update again in a few months as I progress along my GAPS journey. I wish you all the best of health.UPDATE 4/10/12: Spring has sprung here. I no longer seem to be affected by pollen, which in previous years gave me terrible allergies and sinus infections. In fact, I have not had a sinus infection in months. The arthritis symptoms are completely gone. I've lost 15 pounds and walk an hour or more just about daily in addition to my chores around the house. Also, for the last 3 months my monthly cycle has been just that (cyclical). In the 20 years I've been menstruating, I've NEVER once had a regular cycle. Now it's literally every 28-29 days. There has been no improvement on the mental stuff yet; in fact, the die-off seems to be temporarily making it much worse.UPDATE 3/1/13: I've been on GAPS for over a year now, with no deviation. No cheating whatsoever. I can honestly say I don't miss any of the ""normal"" food that I used to eat. This stuff is just so nutrient-dense that I don't ever think of eating anything else. And I used to literally be addicted to sugar. So, that's pretty cool. As to my progress - physically, I'm not much stronger than I was six months ago. But I'm still light-years ahead of where I was two years ago. Still taking walks, doing chores, knitting, able to function like a human being. I'm experiencing new die-off symptoms (caused by breaking up biofilm in my gut with probiotics and systemic enzymes, I believe) like visual disturbances, rosacea and other rashes, adrenaline rushes, numbness/tingling/burning in my extremities. Apparently, these things are all typical for Candida overgrowth. I'm not surprised that I haven't experienced more physical improvement. My Candida infection was/is quite severe, and I've always anticipated that it would take several years to recover. Happily, though I am able to report a significant improvement in my mental well-being. My depressive episodes started to lift just a few months into GAPS, and now they are all but gone. My favorite improvement by far, however, has been with my anxiety and panic attacks. It took about a year, but they are about 85% gone, at this point. I can't tell you how wonderful it feels to have some relief from this torment for the first time in over ten years (most of my adult life).It should be obvious, but in case it's not, this protocol is not (nor does it claim to be) a quick-fix. I've had gut dysbiosis (and many, many rounds of antibiotics) since birth. It takes a long time to undo decades' worth of damage. The diet is only the base, although Dr. Natasha says that for many GAPS folks, the diet alone is enough. In my case, after the infection is gone, I will still need to detox, fix my adrenals completely, get my metabolic hormones back in order, and perhaps chelate. I have no delusions about how long this is going to take.Thanks to all of you who have commented or contacted me over the past year; it's been wonderful swapping stories and information. I'm very grateful to you all. Here's to continued healing! :)UPDATE 11/13/13: A lot of healing occurred this year. A lot. I now walk 4-5 miles almost everyday. I am doing so much more than I have in the last few years. I am still quite toxic but can now tolerate an infrared sauna, which is great for detox, every other day. (My adrenals were too weak, and I was so toxic my body could not handle it before.) The little things that used to require so much effort are back to being a routine part of my life, i.e. doing my hair, wearing make-up, etc. I feel more like my old self than I have in a long, long time. Occasionally, I feel even better than I remembered. There are still periods every few weeks of fatigue and die-off, where my IBS symptoms act up, anxiety and brain fog skyrocket, and I feel rough. But I haven't had one panic attack! What I (and my fella) are most excited about is I actually get to celebrate the holidays this year! I missed out on them the past two years, so I'm making up for that. Lots of GAPS baking and so forth. I have read most of the other reviews here, and I am so happy about and moved by how much this diet is helping people with chronic, so-called ""untreatable"" conditions. My thoughts are with all of you, and I want to wish everyone happy holidays!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZKA33BLG3SOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0954852028#wasThisHelpful","RZKA33BLG3SOG","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ugh. I've been detoxing from Candida overgrowth for the last few months; yeah, it's not at all pretty. After a month or so of continuously feeling downright awful (this was way beyond ""flu-like symptoms""), I figured I'd try this clay. I had read about using bentonite clay and psyllium husk fiber for eliminating the Herx reaction associated with Candida die-off, but never thought I needed it. Boy, was I wrong.I started making 1 ""shake"" a day and relatively quickly worked my way up to 3 per day, experiencing no ill effects like constipation. Provided you drink enough water, you'll have no issues with that. After a few days of taking the clay, I definitely started feeling less toxic. I've read other great reviews of the product, and I adamantly agree with them. This stuff is terrific and is really sparing me (and my liver) a lot of pain and suffering. It's my understanding that once the liver processes toxins for removal, they are sent out into the small intestine in bile. However, 95% of the bile is reabsorbed at the terminal end of the small intestine, allowing many of the toxins to also be reabsorbed. This clay binds those toxins, preventing reabsorption. So, this product is, in my opinion, an absolute must for anyone undergoing a detox program.Recently I started using Healthforce Intestinal Drawing Formula, Vegancaps, 260-Count once a day as an adjunct to the P&B shakes. In addition to bentonite clay and activated charcoal, it contains ingredients like slippery elm and marshmallow root that soothe and lubricate the digestive tract. I really like the combination, and the two products complement one another very well.I'm very happy with this brand of bentonite clay and intend to stick with it. I recommended it to my father-in-law who is concerned about heavy metal toxicity. The bottom line: this product is good stuff. I'd rate it more than 5 stars if I could.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20K94894NOE8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016J6XAA#wasThisHelpful","R20K94894NOE8D","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using coconut oil for a few years now and am pleased to see that its benefits are finally being touted...now that saturated fat is no longer villainified, thank goodness. Coconut oil's praises are long overdue! We used to buy more expensive coconut oil; but these are tough economic times, so we've been using cheap coconut oil. I read all the great reviews on this site and can't believe that for the cheap price, it's organic AND cold-pressed/hexane-free. We've got another brand of what I'd loosely dub coconut oil sitting in the cabinet next to this brand, and although they are similar in price, that's where the similarities end. That stuff is going in the garbage where it belongs. I could barely even taste coconut when using it. I won't go back.I eat about 3 tbsp of this stuff per day and, naturally, it's satisfying. As soon as you open the jar, you can smell the coconut. And the taste...delicious! If you're already a fan of coconut oil and are aware of its healthy properties, try this brand. You won't be sad that you did. And if you're just learning about its merits, this coconut oil is perfect to start using. If you don't like it, you haven't really lost much money.

"I've been using this supplement for about two weeks now, and I'm certain I'm already feeling the effects. Phosphatidylcholine is excellent for aiding bile flow and general housekeeping within the liver. As I am on a detox program for my chronic fatigue, I read a lot about this supplement and thought it was worth a shot. In Europe, PC is widely used to treat disorders and diseases of the liver. I'm really starting to veer into holistic health, trying to avoid allopathic medicine as much as possible (chronic illness really opens one's eyes!). Anything that helps the liver function better is a must-have in my therapy. PC is also used by cells in the formation of their plasma membranes, so for people with chronic illness, it really is a great supplement to have around.I'm not a big fan of soy, which is the source of this product. I'm not reacting badly to it, but I may investigate to find out if there are some other readily available sources of PC.

"My interest in this product arose after researching far infrared sauna therapy for detox. I've got allergies and multiple chemical sensitivities, general malaise and severe fatigue. When my body started breaking out in hives, I knew something had to change. I had already been detoxing for some weeks, but I wasn't getting the results I wanted and was concerned about the heavy burden I was placing upon my liver and kidneys. (I've got a chronic illness and am just now realizing that by and large, many chronic illnesses can be traced to toxin overload. In my case, it's so true.) When I read all the info about how FIR sauna therapy is used to detox people somewhat efficiently and quickly, it was something I had to try. The idea of decreasing the workload of my internal organs appealed to me.I've been using this sauna daily for about a week and am already feeling results. The hives are completely gone and have not returned. I started with 15 minutes because of my health issues and have since worked up to 30 minutes at 130F. I sweat a lot. This sauna is particularly good for my health, because it gives my cardiovascular system a workout. Due to my illness, I have not been able to exercise for quite some time. So I'm really happy that my lungs and heart are still being conditioned in some manner.As many other reviewers noted, the instructions for this thing are a garbled mess. Mostly I used my common sense and a few glimpses at the illustration in the manual in order to put it together and it only took me about 10 minutes. Very easy. As per the suggestion of some others, I immediately decided to not even bother trying the chair that is included (yes, it's teeny), instead opting to use a small stool we have. The control is extremely easy to use. The inside space is pretty confined, which isn't really a problem until I get too relaxed and find myself relaxing my posture a bit; then my back invariably touches one of the heaters which instantly wakes me up!All in all, it's a great little sauna, and, for the price, I couldn't be more pleased with the results I'm feeling. Detox takes a long time, and this is an effortless way to speed up the process. I noticed after about 5 days of using it that my skin is soooo smooth and soft. It feels like I've been using a creamy moisturizer, and I haven't been using anything. My boyfriend, who is in reasonably good shape, also uses it as a preventive measure - to purge the toxins before they eventually cause illness. We call it our ""spaceship."" The cats also get a kick out of watching us sit in this thing; it is pretty amusing, for sure, but the benefits are anything but!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DD7UB7KXPE72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002POAYDW#wasThisHelpful","R2DD7UB7KXPE72","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mega-Zyme was recommended to me by someone who is familiar with treating leaky gut syndrome, which I've got extensively, as I suffered from systemic Candida for 2 years. I had never tried digestive enzymes before. I take 2 with each meal and 1 with snacks. I have noticed I have more energy after I eat now, which is great. But the main thing I'm noticing is less allergies. As my gut has been healing, I've still been dealing with food allergies cropping up. This enzyme supplement essentially helps ""chop up"" my food so that large particles of food are no longer passing via my gut into my bloodstream, where it causes horrible allergies.Update (9/27/11): I think this is a terrific enzyme supplement, provided you are one of the few who has sufficient levels of stomach acid (HCl). I started taking another digestive enzyme that includes HCl and ox bile and am finding that this one works better for me. But I still keep Mega-Zyme around and use it when I eat small snacks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PQZPVGQ1YLFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OUHDC#wasThisHelpful","R2PQZPVGQ1YLFE","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the last 13 months, I've been suffering/recovering from adrenal fatigue. I've been house-bound and many days, bed-ridden. On the rare occasions where I've been able to go outside, I'd go for a brief walk, only to have to nap upon returning home. For anyone experiencing this debilitating condition, you know just how severe the fatigue is. I'm an ex-runner, so you can imagine how mind-numbing, frustrating, and downright depressing this condition has been for me.Over the course of these last 13 months, I've done little else besides research adrenal fatigue and experiment with supplements, reading both scientific journal articles as well as anecdotal evidence from others with the affliction. Adrenal fatigue differs from CFS and fibromyalgia in significant ways, but the endless fatigue is one symptom that is common amongst all three conditions. Well, I've treated the adrenals; I've treated the underlying Candida infection; I've corrected the mineral/electrolyte deficiences; I'm working on detoxing my lymph and liver. Basically, I attacked adrenal fatigue from every angle I could, yet my energy was still tanked.Once again, I came back to the internet and started reading more about CFS and fibromyalgia. Since these two conditions are at least recognized by the medical community (unlike adrenal fatigue), I thought maybe there would be more information out there, something I had overlooked. Once I happened upon Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum's website and read what he had to say about d-ribose, suddenly it all made sense. (I'm a biologist, so I've got a meager understanding of how the body works.) Immediately, I began researching ""mitochondrial dysfunction"" and its causes. Boy, did I fit the bill. I came back to amazon, poured over the reviews here from people with CFS or fibromyalgia, and immediately ordered this powder.I was so anxious to try it that I couldn't even wait for it to arrive. Yesterday I sent my boyfriend to the natural foods store a few blocks away, where he picked me up Now Foods Ribose 750mg, Veg-capsules Bioenergy, 120-Count. I took 6 capsules immediately (which I estimated to come out to about 5 grams or so). An hour later, I felt the effects. I'm not kidding. Trust me - if you knew adrenal fatigue, you'd know there's no way I'd be subject to placebo effect. Besides, after so many other failed treatments, I was scared to have hope and wasn't really expecting much. I took 2 more ""doses"" throughout the day and felt so much better than I had in months! Last night was the first night I slept a solid, uninterrupted 7 hours in a year! UNBELIEVABLE. Today I again took 5g 3x/day, as Dr. Teitelbaum recommends, and I feel improvement still. I've been able to eat less, which is a wonderful side effect; because in the last year, I've gained 35 pounds from having to eat constantly to prevent an adrenal crash. I knew that I had to be missing a key nutrient, and it seems that I've stumbled upon it.I'd give this stuff 10 stars if I could. If you're suffering from any kind of chronic illness/fatigue, please, please try this. I wonder how much suffering I could have spared myself if I had known about this months ago. In any event, I've got a looong way to go until I'm recovered, but with this, I now have hope that I will recover. I wasn't so sure before and was starting to become quite depressed. I will try to update again in a few weeks to see how well this product is still working. I also ordered Jarrow Formulas Acetyl L-Carnitine 500mg, 120 Capsules, Source Naturals Ubiquinol CoQh 100mg, 90 Softgels, and NOW Foods Nac-Acetyl Cysteine 600mg, 250 Vcaps in the hopes that these products will amplify the results of the d-ribose on my mitochondria. My d-ribose powder arrived today, so I'm eager to start using that in lieu of the capsules.Oh, it's incredible to have happy mitochondria again!UPDATE 10/19/11I'm still taking the ribose, 1/2 tsp. 2-3 times a day with meals. This product, in conjunction with detoxing, daily glutamine supplementation, probiotics and dietary changes, Lypo SphericTM GSH, and Dr. Myhill's methylation protocol, has made a tremendous difference in how I feel. Again, I've still got a long way to go until I'm completely recovered; but in the last month, I've felt a great deal of progress. I'm able to leave the house again and no longer worry about adrenal crashes. I continue to sleep more soundly at night and feel less zombie-like, in general. At long last, I'm on my way to feeling almost normal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQSWFXTUTUQRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MLAO4Y#wasThisHelpful","RQSWFXTUTUQRD","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should preface this review with a few things: 1) I've been suffering from systemic Candida for over 2 years. 2) I ordered this product a few months ago with a heavy dose of skepticism. When the product arrived, I started taking it per the dosage instructions listed on the bottle- 8 drops 3x/day. Well, it made me feel like crap, so I stopped taking it after just a few days. At that point, I knew I probably had toxins accumulated in my tissues/liver from the chronic infection, yet I had no idea how severe the problem really was.For the last month, I've been trying to detox and alkalinize my body. I've got the Candida under control but still feel pretty lethargic from the constant toxic burden. I started reading people's reviews of Cellfood on different websites. Also, I watched a presentation given by the president of NuScience. [He strikes me as a little shady, but the results of the studies are pretty impressive.] The anecdotal testimonies for Cellfood are overwhelmingly positive, so I decided to give it another go. The first day I used 20 drops with my dinner (yeah, I don't really ""do"" moderation). The next morning I woke up feeling the sickest I've ever felt in my life. (I've been drinking herbal tea and taking a greens powder everyday too.) I figure the combination of all 3 things sent my body into a detox rush that my liver just couldn't handle. I spent a miserable couple of days. Today finally I feel slighly better. I've reduced my intake of Cellfood to just 5 drops a day and intend to work my way up. I'm so impressed with this product that I'm seriously considering purchasing some of the company's other Cellfood products, despite the hefty price tag. Once I have my health back, I intend to continue using this, because I have no doubt it'll send my energy through the roof!To summarize: This stuff is intense! No joke. If you've got any chronic sort of illness/disease, tread lightly. Don't start at the recommended dosage, because it works really quickly and will make you feel terrible and put your organs under more stress. Take it slowly and let your body adjust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M40VBHIMBSUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F4F9JS#wasThisHelpful","R3M40VBHIMBSUR","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm nowhere near menopause but use this to aid with estrogen dominance and the PMS I experience monthly. I'd be lost without this stuff. I no longer suffer the crazy mood swings, irritability, difficulty sleeping, emotional highs and lows, and all the other fun PMS-related things that I used to contend with. This stuff is fantastic. I've been using it for years and have no plans to stop. I've tried many brands of progesterone cream over the years, and this is the last one I tried. I intend to stick with this brand, because I feel it is the most effective (at least for me). This stuff is a lifesaver for anyone suffering from estrogen dominance and/or PMS.It has a really light scent to it. Other brands I've tried never smelled bad, per se, but this is the most pleasant-smelling of all the ones I've used.

"I've got adrenal fatigue, and, as often accompanies this condition, a severe magnesium deficiency. Magnesium is crucial for healthy adrenal function. During times of stress, either emotional or physical, the adrenal glands are called on to respond to the stressor, namely via the production of cortisol and adrenaline, among other hormones. You can imagine that if the diet is producing an inadequate supply of magnesium, one would run out fairly quickly. When these tiny glands malfunction, chronic illness can occur. This is where I'm at. I was popping magnesium citrate supplements like crazy all day long and eating foods rich in Mg, to no avail. All I wound up with was diarrhea. I wasn't obtaining results at all and continued to feel crummy.I was digging around online when I saw the term ""transdermal magnesium."" Intrigued, I looked into it. Then I came to amazon.com, because I feel the reviews here are authentic and I can trust what people are saying. I decided I had nothing to lose and bought some.As soon as it arrived, I wasted no time and applied it all over my body. I won't lie; this ""oil"" stings and/or itches, especially on a cut or wound of any kind. But it also heals the cuts very quickly. I didn't feel anything happening the first time I used it, but during the second time, all of a sudden I felt a warmth underneath my skin (presumably in my bloodstream), and I felt like someone had ""plugged me in."" [Note - adrenal fatigue occurs when the adrenal glands' cells are devoid of the necessary mineral reserves to sustain them, so you just sorta fizzle out. It's no fun, believe me.] My energy didn't soar through the roof or anything, but for me, I knew that I was onto something.I've been using it 2x/day for several months now, and I refuse to be without it. It goes where I go. I sleep much more soundly, whereas before I had trouble falling and staying asleep. The anxiety that I suffered for a decade is also so much better. I feel more alert and more in control of my thoughts. It's also eliminated the heart palpitations that accompany adrenal fatigue. I could not be more pleased with this product.By supplementing orally, it can take a year or even longer to replenish the cells' Mg reserves. I've read that using transdermal Mg, replenishment can occur in as little as a few months. While my case is extreme, I have no doubt that healthy folks would benefit from this too. In my opinion, we are all likely Mg deficient to some degree. For optimal health and vitality, we could all use more powerful magnesium! And, as we all know, our food quality these days is subpar and just not supplying us with everything that we need.UPDATE 2/12/12:True to what I've read, I was able to stop using this oil after only a few months. So, even in my extremely depleted (read: stressed) state, this oil was able to build my Mg reserves back up in a very short time. Now I make sure to eat a lot of bone broth, organ meats, and I juice veggies everyday. A few weeks ago, I applied some Mg oil again to ensure I still have a sufficient supply, and I didn't feel any difference. So it seems that I'm able to obtain the magnesium I need from my diet once again. I'm grateful for this transdermal oil; I believe it would have taken me much longer to build up my reserves if I had only used the oral form of supplementation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FVB2VXULIRBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026RCMAG#wasThisHelpful","R1FVB2VXULIRBZ","A3HHGBT6MFH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HHGBT6MFH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have ever read a book by Trudy Stiles, you know she writes with her heart and soul.  The emotional impact of each story leaves the reader a mess, their brain is mush because of the new points of views she had introduced you to.  Nothing is cut and dry with any of Trudy’s characters or plots.  This is what I love about her and her books.  I always walk away feeling like I have grown emotionally.  Epic Sins is no different, you will find your heart racing and emotions all over the map.  I had times I wanted to cry and rock in a corner then within pages I wanted to smack some motherly common sense in Garrett and Sam.Both Garrett and Sam had a hard road because life dealt them a rough hand to deal with.  I won’t go into what they came from because this will be part of story that will capture your heart in the beginning.  Garrett went looking for that missing piece in his life and found a band of boys who wanted him to join them and make it big in music.  As time went on the fame became real but so did the nightmare of drugs, women, booze and soon fatherhood.Sam continued to feel the void in her life that her childhood created.  Becoming a nurse for babies who are in trouble was a way to fill her need to fix things, to save lives, to change events and take control, something she was never able to do as a child.  When something tragic happens she once again faces an unknown future.  With her aunt’s help she finds a place with Garrett, helping to take care of his son who needs the constant medical attention.Watching Sam come out of her shell and allow love into her life was a beautiful thing to witness.  Garrett grew up to be the man I think even shocked him all for the sake of his son and to not repeat the sins of his father in which he suffered for.  When love began to surface between the two, we think they might be ok, until the past come crashing in on them, connecting dots that no one wanted connected.  Sam’s response upset me at first, but this is where the brilliance of Trudy comes into play.  Once I stepped back and thought about it, I am not sure I wouldn’t have reacted the same way.  When wounds are not allowed to heal, loss not allowed to be grieved, how can we judge her for her reaction to the truth?I have recommended this book to many already because it is a classic example of an ugly cry read.  It will destroy your heart and then rebuild it into what could actually be a more generous and accepting one.  She brings the broken people to surface and loves them back to health, inviting the reader to not only care but grow right along with the characters.  She is a brilliant writer and for that alone you should read her series in which gave birth to Garrett, but it isn’t necessary for the Epic Fail series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P36CT4S3O7XJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WZMO1O#wasThisHelpful","R2P36CT4S3O7XJ","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I read this story I told the author this book had to be published.  Vanessa Marie took a tough topic that people tend to ignore and waved her magic talent over it to produce a story that will capture the reader’s heart and leave them thinking about what they can do to help kids in the foster care system.Her characters are rich, diverse, nothing that you would expect to not only be woven together into a plot but into a family that works.  Vanessa had my attention on the first page with Dante going to yet another foster home.  He knew not to get attached, comfortable and God forbid start feeling anything.  When the door opened he was welcomed by Violet, the spunky little red head that will steal your heart.  When Holly, the mom and my new hero came in, he knew he was entering into a circus he might not want to belong to but soon he not only found he wanted it, he was terrified he would lose it.I won’t go into how this story unfolded, but trust me there are times you will want to climb into the pages and fight the battle for Dante, and other times you will sit back and cry for the pain that unfolds.  One thing you will certainly find is laugh out loud moments, especially with the swear jar.  Vanessa Marie gives you an example of true acceptance, opening your heart to those in need of love and how the foster homes SHOULD work.She added a raw reality and emotion to her story, not sugar coating Dante’s life as he begins to share his past.  We also find that not every family is “normal” but they can still be functional, loyal and loving.  More than that, they can be accepting and forgiving, faithful and supportive.  Some of the scenes in this book had me fist pumping and messaging the author telling her she nailed it.  Other times I was shedding some tears and wanting to take those kids in myself.  One thing is for sure, I have embraced my inner Holly and enjoy allowing her to come out at the right times.  I know this story is about Dante and I adored him but Holly and Violet won my heart.After I was done reading, I did what the normal reader suffering from book hangover does; I begged, pleaded and yes demanded more books from this family.  I wasn’t ready to let go yet when I turned the final page.  This is a MUST read book.  Young adults, who are finding their way in life through the muck and evil with the support of love and adults who understand what life is all about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHNS8UDRMNW6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165SOIRQ#wasThisHelpful","RHNS8UDRMNW6D","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I met these men Tate, Leo and Brute in the first book when Shay entered their lives.  Now we are going to read about Tate and his wife Cassie and how even perfect love might not be enough to keep them together.Tate is a man who needs to protect those he loves, it is the number one need he has and when he feels he has let someone down, the guilt leads him to decisions that he might regret.  Cassie is the love of his life; he would do anything to show her how much she is cherished and valued.  The two have expanded their worlds and sex life because she trusted him to teach her and keep her safe.The book opens with him watching as she is served divorce papers.  It is crushing his heart to even do this but watching her crumble before his eyes could be the very thing that will destroy him forever.  Cassie isn’t going to accept this; she has vowed to win her man back.  She didn’t understand his standoffish behavior the last year.  She knew what had happened, but why was he acting like this?The club Tate owns with Leo and Brute has a sex club in the basement and it could be the weapon Cassie needs to make Tate let go of the past and fall in love with her again.  No one can say she isn’t determined and cleaver.  Letting her into his private world that he had tried to protect her from wasn’t easy so when things go wrong, the results can be devastating.I enjoyed the story but have to say once he makes his confession, I was a bit deflated.  I first thought that was pretty lame, but then after I stepped back and thought about Tate, it does fit his personality.  He is the sensitive Alpha who hates failure, especially when failure involves those he loves.  You don’t have to read the first book in this series, A Shot of Sin but it is well worth the time to do so.  It will give you more appreciation for Shay who is a riot and smart butt even in this book as well.  I love her and Leo together.Now I can start counting down the time till we get Brute’s story, he is an interesting character for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPE96SQH2QPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163Y1SIE#wasThisHelpful","R1WPE96SQH2QPG","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Lynnette Bernard for a while now but Alexa’s Warrior Mate has left me speechless.  Rarely do I feel homesick after I finish a book, but this one had me feeling it during the last ten percent.  I had found a place that I wanted to call home, a group of men that I wanted to call my warriors and a sisterhood that you could only dream to be a part of.  She gives us action with the battles between the good and evil, which will take your breath away and leave you on the edge of your seat, but what won my heart was her character development with each and every role in the story.Lexi and Sebastian were the main characters in this book, but you meet Lexi’s sisters and niece along with Sebastian’s warriors. Both came from strong families with loving parents, they know what true love looks like and that is what they want more than anything, but with the roles they have inherited, no one sees them as anything other than protectors, until that moment at the lagoon where a single touch will change their worlds.With visions and prophecies that have been passed down by both families, it was fate that Sebastian and Lexi would meet and join forces to protect the people of Altavesta. They knew this was their destiny but much more is about to happen to them when it becomes clear that they are mates for life.  Lexi tried to fight this, was willing to take the pain that came from not being near him because she couldn’t see her life being shared with another soul. Sebastian had seen their future and it was joyous, with love and children, finally he would have that one person who would see past his protection and feel his soul and love, but he refused to push her into any choice that she wasn’t comfortable with. He wanted her to decide to be with him out of love, not obligation or the pain they both were feeling.This book is definitely one of the most sensual books I have ever read. Sebastian and his warriors treated Lexi and her sisters with such respect and kindness that it became like foreplay for the romance that would soon occur.  I had so many moments when I could feel my heart melt and my body heat up, when I would see these strong men who willing to fight at any moment, instantly soften to the powers of sweet little Hanna.  These men had a perfect balance when it came to flirting and talking to the sisters. It was clear they saw them as beautiful women yet they also never gave a second thought to their strength and ability to fight beside the men in battle. Lynnette did a brilliant job at describing how Lexi touched Sebastian’s soul and heart by seeing the man and his desires, while he effectively captured her love and trust by encouraging her to not change a thing about who she was.  He appreciated the training her father had given her and he admired her courage and strength, while never losing sight of the soft woman inside that needed love and protection.  There are so many elements to this book that just made me want more. I can hardly wait to see what is coming next.  I will make sure no matter what I am doing, when I get more of this story the world will have to wait as I escape back to my new piece of Heaven that awaits me on Altavesta.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F5DORW3RWD0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016JY2VHK#wasThisHelpful","R3F5DORW3RWD0M","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say this installment to the series was not what I expected. Before I go on, you must read Entice before Embrace or nothing will make sense for you regarding Laurie and her story.  Laurie is devastated with yet another man betraying her and Liam has a lot of explaining to do concerning his connection to the latest betrayal.James, her ex-husband, is determined to not let go of their marriage.  He recognizes what he had done wrong in the marriage which goes beyond the affair but what drove him to do such a devastating act.Laurie is just an emotional mess.  Her job is falling apart, the lies are becoming too much to deal with.  Her own family has been less than supportive and her heart and body wants Liam.  Seems clear cut right?  She could go with Liam, fall even deeper with his accent and sex God body and turn a blind eye to his dealings in the company but her heart is also screaming that she can’t throw away what she and James have created.I have to say when I started the book I had my choice as to who I wanted her to go with and even with the temptations that S. Layne threw at us in this book, I am still firm on my choice but I could understand what drove her to her final decision.  One thing is for sure, I would never want to be in Laurie’s shoes.Once again I was blown away with the talent of S. Layne.  She has a way with words that weaves a story which takes the reader away and into a realm that will leave them questioning what they believe and what they would do.  She makes the sinful sound pleasant and the innocent appear guilty.  I am looking forward to reading the next book which will feature Talia, Laurie’s friend.  The character development is so fabulous in this series, even the side characters were strong and interesting and going into Enflame shouldn’t be a problem at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIQR71L3ACJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIDBLOK#wasThisHelpful","RXIQR71L3ACJA","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book very intriguing as it takes a taboo topic of affairs and gives it a realistic spin that leave you realizing no one is above doing it when the circumstances are right.Laurie loved her husband, or maybe she was comfortable and didn’t feel she needed to put forth more effort.  She had a career she loved, a beautiful home and a husband, what more could this woman want?  When she finds out her husband and best friend had been having an affair behind her back, her world comes crashing down.While out of town on business, and to get some space to put her marriage in perspective, she bumps into Liam, a man that melted Laurie’s resolve.  With the promise of one night to get her mind off her troubles at home, she accepted.  She reasoned that her marriage was over, it was ok for her to do this and it was for only one night, what could it hurt.Little did she know Liam was going to not only invade her dreams at night, her job was going to be at risk and the truth was going to come out and soon her husband would know what she did.  I am sure we all have thought there is no way we could do something like that to our spouse, but the S. Layne proved with this story that events that are beyond our control in life can change a person.  It makes their morals weak from the pain they are enduring.  It gives reason to the most unreasonable situations.  She also proved with Laurie, what happens one night doesn’t always stay in that night, the truth sneaks into our world and could destroy who we are and what we have built. Her writing style is smooth, quick to read as the story just flows off the pages and captures your attention.I look forward to the next book to see what Laurie finally decides.  She has two men who want her, a job that she is desperate to keep, how can she manage all of this and finally decide what is right for her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW7LPIO83F693/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VN6WB66#wasThisHelpful","RW7LPIO83F693","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was asked by the author to give an honest review in exchange for a copy of her book.  After reading the synopsis I was interested but feared this would be a routine “housewife is bored in marriage” kind of book.  I couldn’t have been farther from the truth.  I have tried to think if I have ever come across a book with this plot idea and I came up empty.Imagine your life, taking care of the kids and husband, cleaning the home and preparing meals.  Your life consists of dress up and tea parties and a job that you love but is demanding of your energy.  Then one night and a pink dress, you go on a date with your husband and the world you knew no longer exists.  This is what happens to Mirella and Gabe.  High school sweethearts who settled very early, run into a couple at dinner who is about to expose them to a whole new world.Weston and Bridget Hanson are not only intelligent but beautiful and handsome as well.  Bridget and Gabe hit it off instantly while Mirella and Weston took a little longer to get acquainted.  After a meeting in Weston’s office Mirella finds out what Weston had in mind.  This could be a once in a life time chance for her and Gabe, but what about the ground rules they have established in their marriage.  What about their children, how will this affect them?  How will it affect Mirella and Gabe in the big picture?  Sometimes the boredom of routine and the fascination of the unknown can be a blessing or a powder keg waiting to blow.I won’t go any farther as to not risk spoiling the story but be prepared to watch a marriage go through turmoil that it may not survive.  Mirella will be making some decisions that will affect not only her family but her own life as well.I really felt comfortable with the writing style, it fit the story perfectly.  I often felt like I was sitting and talking to my best friend about what she was encountering without the glitzy flair or deadpan emotions that come in many books of this nature.  The balance was perfect for me with the lack of dramatics and the intensity being perfectly balanced.I would certainly read more from this author as she gives a unique look into topics that are usually black and white.  She has created a gray area with this book that had me thinking what I would do in Mirella’s place, what my husband would do if he were Gabe.  When a book leaves me thinking then I know I have found a winner for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VU3U0LMBESHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGZNEQQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VU3U0LMBESHR","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever wondered what the face of revenge and anger looks like?  Well wonder no more, just take a look at Keenan.  During this series he has been the one that held it together, kept focus and peace to the best of his ability but when secrets come out and he realizes the lies and betrayals have shattered his soul, he is left with one mission in life, seek payback and make it hurt.Sheldon came out of her relationship with Keenan and has started to build a new life in the years that he has been missing.  Finding who she is without the influence of Kieran and Keenan, she is totally blindsided by his return.  Now she is looking into the eyes of the man she loved, left and tried to forget.  He isn’t the man she remembered but can she ever learn to love the new man he is?  Sheldon does a lot of forced growing up in this book, some of it made me happy for her and some made me want to shake some sense into her head.  Any time Keenan is around, danger lurks in the shadows.  I found it hard to remember sometimes that this was the same man that I felt sorry for and loved in the beginning but every once in a while we would get a glimpse of him, hiding behind the armor of pain and hate.As with all of this authors books action and evil flood every page of the story, keeping the reader white knuckling through the book, so obsessed we can’t turn our heads, but fighting for our next breath at times as we keep reading.  Our highly dysfunctional family is back and once again B.B Reid wrote it in a way that we should be ashamed to love them but we aren’t.  She has a distinct way of making the monsters in her stories human, to the point I find I make excuses for their behavior.  This is what I love about B.B. Reid and her books, I am always left twisted in the mind, heart racing a sprint and begging for more glorious torture from her books.  If you are fan of this series or the dark and twisted genre, then you need to get to one clicking her books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15JAZ1D4KU35M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XU5A8A#wasThisHelpful","R15JAZ1D4KU35M","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review for this book won’t be typical to the ones you see listed for it on the sites.  I am not a fan of YA or Dystopia genre books but I have wanted to give one a try to see what the hype was about.  After reading the synopsis for this book, it felt like this would be a great first experience book for me and I believe I was right.I can’t go into the details of this story as it is long and complicated and I still don’t feel I am up to speed with this genre to do it justice.  What I can talk about is the talent and writing style of Logan Keys.  The first half of the book did drag a bit for me and while that is normally a curse for a reviewer, in this case it was much appreciated.  It gave me a slower chance to learn about the characters and the situation they have found themselves in.  I was also able to absorb the new information regarding zombies and the end of the world as they knew it.  I found that with the slowness and description that Logan gave us, the purpose for the kids to escape the “prison” they were in and advance to a new land, along with where they had come from and the lives they had happily lived before this devastation, was much more intense when the story picked up half way through.The writing in this book was next to flawless with the smooth reading, the suspense and mystery.  Included was an abundance of action, abuse, torture both mentally and physically and the emotional angst was off the charts.  The way the scenes were described and the detail paid to every room, battle field and event made the story come to life, which was also another benefit for me as a new reader to this genre.I was very impressed with how Logan was able to keep my attention and interest growing, even though at many points I was very lost as to what was happening, but that was due to my inexperience not the writing and I found I was emotionally distraught in the end.  The character development used established a foundation for me to connect and care about Liza, Tommy, Jeremy and a host of other characters from beginning to end.  The final page will leave you gasping with the shock that no one expected to come.  While I can’t say I am now a fan of this genre, I can say I was invested enough in the characters to want to know what happens next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LIDJOKYG9GC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZUA2X3M#wasThisHelpful","R1LIDJOKYG9GC","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sara Night has lost everything in life.  Her family is gone due to an accident, her dreams and goals in life are lost.  Placed in a foster home she fights for a reason to live.  Repeating her senior year again, her grades are still very low, her ambition is even lower.  She has no reason to live.  After a failed suicide attempt she finds herself being “kidnapped” by the two guys she thought was her friends.  They need her to fulfill a mission for a secret agency that is going after a drug cartel.At first Sara refuses this job, she has no idea what to do, she has never been trained to be a secret agent spy.  It wasn’t until the director explained this was her chance to leave her world behind, have a place to call home and a new family that it became a reminder that her only goal in life was to do good, help others and make up for the guilt she felt about her family.Training was intense and the mission started and from there you will have to read to feel the action and suspense, the drama and intensity of the quest.  The author had me gripping the kindle and sitting on the edge of my seat.  She developed the characters so well it was difficult to cheer on Sara in every little victory and want to rescue her before the cartel finds her.  I am not usually fan of mystery but Sara Schoen gave a heart breaking story behind the reason for Sara to take on this job.  She has me invested in this story from chapter one.  I highly recommend this book and personally will search out more work from this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9SM07DPXERE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011B1JMBY#wasThisHelpful","RH9SM07DPXERE","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"M. Leighton presents a story that is packed with action, mystery and passion.  The prologue itself will suck the reader into the story and have them reaching for tissues and trying to find solace.  Jasper’s life is a maze into darkness from the first page and he continues to carry his secrets throughout the story.Muse is a puzzle of her own, being sent to a new town to start over because her father felt it was safer, she never really understood why her father did the things he did.  He was a military man who commanded trust and respect and when he asked something of a person they just complied without question.  She was content till she was forced to hire someone to find him.  In walks Jasper but is his agenda the same as hers?  Was he the man that she meant to hire?Their passion sparked instantly and the sex quickly began.  This is the only part of the story that caused me to lower my rating.  I felt it the story would have been easier to read and have a solid plot, if under the circumstances of why they were traveling together; the buildup had been longer and stronger.While out trying to locate the missing father, truths come out and discoveries are made, all of this became a threat to break up what they had instantly built.  Jasper is a dark soul who can’t be tied down with love or any other human.  Muse is a strong woman who loves freely and isn’t afraid to show her emotions to him.I loved the plot, and we get an idea of how the author’s mind must work. The plot was not predictable for me, I had some ideas but I was never fully on target before anything happened.  The secondary characters were intriguing and fun to get to know as well.  I can’t go more into the story as the twists, turns and surprises all need to be experienced by the reader, not spoiled by a review.I haven’t been a regular reader of this authors work but I will certainly be waiting for this next book and will go back and grab a few more of her prior reads because she held me captivated in this story.  It was gritty enough to keep me on edge and passionate enough to make me melt.  While her style seemed to hide a lot of information regarding Jasper and Muse from the reader, which at first frustrated me, I soon became a fan of this style.  It gave me the feeling of being in the story with them as we uncovered lies and danger.  I highly recommend this book and will be waiting to see what she comes up with next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L1HBKITEUYNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4FUI#wasThisHelpful","R3L1HBKITEUYNW","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were many things I liked about this book, a few things I loved about it and one very annoying thing that carried throughout the whole story.  I love Sara York’s writing style and how she can draw the reader into the situations at hand, leaving us feeling the emotions of the characters so much we begin craving a happy ending for them.  I loved the story of Sam and Hudson as they were refreshing and hot.  I did like the commitment and love shown between Greg, Chris and Liam and the beginning of the book was intense and had me hooked.  What drove me crazy were Liam’s weakness and his constant need for reassurance, yet he claimed he trusted Chris and Greg.From the first page you can see where Liam came from.  His parents were willing to do whatever it took to turn him from being gay and save their Christian reputation.  From Jackson Mississippi, his parents didn’t have a hard time getting the local police involved in “kidnapping” their son and sending him to a facility to fix him.  This isn’t the first time they have shown hatred for who he is and he carries the scars on his body and soul from their abuse.It is because of this kidnapping and the fact Greg and Chris refuse to just leave without him that we meet Sam, a FBI agent who will help set Liam free.  Sam also becomes part of the story when he watches the love those three men have for each other and seeks a love of his own.  Liam is forced to make a horrible choice between Chris and Greg that will lead us to more of his need for constant reassurance and coddling.  Now I know Liam is fragile, he has been through a lot but at some point I just wanted to scream and remind him he has two men who love him, leave the past behind and move forward.As you go on in the story you will see more of Sam and Hudson’s relationship develop and Liam’s parents not giving up their attempts to make Liam straight.  The suspense and emotional part of this plot was great.  Greg being the Dom in this relationship gave way to some pretty hot m/m/m scenes and the love those three had for each other was inspiring.Sara does a wonderful job at bringing those hidden taboos to light in a way that the message hits you before you even see it coming.  She shows the pain of having to keep secrets in order to save yourself from death or persecution by society.  The author also proved how far some communities has advanced in acceptance of different lifestyles while some backward communities are still stuck in the old way of thinking, that homosexuality is a disease that can be cured with violence, fear and hate.  If you are a fan of the m/m/m genre with some emotional angst that will leave you all over the place, then you will enjoy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28P8CB87O1XGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PDCZS6#wasThisHelpful","R28P8CB87O1XGD","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to love this book and as I began reading the story and met Alexis and Martin, I felt for sure this was going to suck me in and leave me with a hangover.  Unfortunately, I wasn’t as invested as I had hoped to be.  I still enjoyed it a great deal though.Martin has the mission of protecting Alexis as she recovers from being abused both mentally and sexually by Elliot.  She was handed out to many men and was left a broken woman.  Martin understood how she felt since the same thing had happened to him by his parents until the police stepped in and put him in foster care.  If was during that foster care he met some great friends and landed in the Army. Now out into the civilian world, he dedicates his time helping other victims of sexual abuse recover and find a place in the world for themselves.He has a strong attraction to Alexis just as she does for him, but two things are stopping him at first from making the move.  She is broken and recovering.  This is not the time for him to make a sexual advance towards her, not until she is mentally strong enough to decide if she wants that.  Second, he doesn’t see himself as a good man.  She deserves more than what he can give her.  Alexis is a strong woman, she doesn’t see him as defective, she sees him a strong man who will protect her, care for her and will leave as soon as they catch the man leaving threatening messages.As the story progresses you will soon find out whom that man is from her past and how far he is willing to go to make her his woman but you will also watch Martin slowly learn to accept the truth about his past and his future.  It is a wonderful message of survival and forgiving yourself, but also the power of love and endurance.I think I could have loved it had there been a few changes in the writing style.  At times it felt rushed, especially the sex scenes and the consistency between Alexis being strong and logical versus emotionally crippled because of the past was not solid for me.  I also am not a fan of repetitive words or phrases used so close together.  It breaks the reading flow for me.  I did love the plot and could see some areas that could have been more intense and ways that the reader could have connected more with the characters but with all of that said, I would still recommend this book to others and I do want to go back and read books one and two because I strongly believe in the message the author is trying to project in her stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BQDQYK7OR49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RZCT5S#wasThisHelpful","R29BQDQYK7OR49","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love the path Elle took when writing a BDSM story.  Instead of focusing on establishing a Dom/Sub relationship and the sex, she took us behind the scenes regarding trust, love and loyalty.  Along with this she writes about when life takes a different and unexpected turn, leaving us with choices that no one would want to have to make.  Life become crazy when you agree to do a favor for someone soon becomes a life changing decision?Kit felt her life purpose was to be a sub, to serve and obey her Mistress Kayla.  Their relationship saved each other from the past they needed to escape.  Kayla had an old friend who used to provide refuge for her as a child from the fighting and dysfunction between her parents.  Stumbling upon Charles secret, Kayla started investigating BDSM and found she was meant to be a Dom.Charles has asked Kayla and Kit to help him on a project, namely his grandson.  With the plan in place, Kit is supposed to find out if Jared is not only accepting of BDSM but is he the natural born Dom as his grandfather believes he is.  After a “false start” soon Kit and Jared start to become interested in each other and the testing begins to form.I won’t go any farther with this story other than say, things aren’t always as they appear.  What could start out with your convictions firm, you can soon find yourself a toxic turmoil where choices are going to need to be made and betrayals will shatter your heart.  Friendships and love can be broken instead of strengthened and everyone has skeletons and secrets they are willing to go to extremes to protect.My heart went out to Kit numerous times as she tries to navigate her way through this maze of confusion and fear.Jared was intriguing to watch as his European ego begins to melt and he sheds his royal attitude for a more natural and accepting view of life.Charles broke my heart as we watched him finally be honest about how he has felt over the last twenty years.Kayla was devastating to watch with her pain that she has hidden because there is no real solution to her problem.People shouldn’t be changed and it is going to take a selfless person to let go or accept the reality of their situation.I am so impressed with this author’s ability to make me so focused on the dynamics of the relationship and forcing me to question what I would do if I were confronted with such a dilema.  So many times I have read BDSM books yet never have I ever considered what happened in situations like this.  There is a level of human angst and confusion that you often see in books today, but Elle did a fantastic job at keeping this story realistic from the events to the emotions surrounding the events.  I am looking forward to reading more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEAAIVZ4AG3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013M8FPRO#wasThisHelpful","R2VEAAIVZ4AG3A","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OH HOLY HECK!!!!!!!!!!!! Pepper Winters owns me in every way possible.  I have read dark and twisted but she has reached a level of torment that I never dreamed this series would reach.  With each book, the intensity and tension rises, leaving me exhausted, mentally warped and gloriously begging for more.At the end of the Third Debt we thought Jethro and Nila were on the cusp of freedom, but as we have learned, that is near impossible with the Hawk family.  As we enter the Fourth Debt, our innocent Nila that we have grown to love, has now turned bitter and focusing on revenge.  With the loss of the man she loves, she is determined on bringing down the family that has tormented the females in her heritage and shattered her heart.The advanced development for ALL of the characters in this story also rose to a level that I couldn’t have predicted.  We finally start seeing the true colors people and get some answers to our lingering questions that have been building.  So many times I found myself reading and internally screaming “please don’t be doing this, tell me this is a trick.” While other times I was wondering what in the world goes on inside Pepper’s mind to create such a nightmare that has become Nila’s life now.I can’t go into what happens in this book, it would be too risky but trust me, this isn’t for the faint of heart and if you have read the other books in this series, this one is even more horrific in my opinion.  I say horrific but God it is a wonderful kind of horrific.  I hated to see Nila suffer both physically and emotionally but Pepper won me over when I noticed I was holding my breath, squirming in my chair, clutching my kindle with white knuckles.  She had my world captured in this story and nothing mattered till I finished this book.What can I say about the ending other than the only saving grace for me was I know there is another book coming which gives me hope.  The last paragraph had me screaming, wanting to climb in and save Nila myself.  I am so thankful she isn’t ending the series this way; it would crush a part of my heart for the rest of my life.  This is how much I love this series and the Fourth Debt was by far the best one yet.  I absolutely live for dark and twisted so it is rather hard to shock me or make me invest myself in a book so deeply that it would haunt me forever, but this series has done it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4ZMWZ0PS1Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6BY24Q#wasThisHelpful","R3U4ZMWZ0PS1Z5","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are not familiar with K.S Haigwood books, then this will be one of the most unique books you will ever read.  If you are a fan of hers, then you will not be surprised that she takes the theme of evil versus good, enemy versus enemy and brings them all together for a common good.  One difference for the fan or new reader is the addition of Anne Conley to this book.The duo wrote a novel that will draw you into the plot early and refuse to let you go.  Life will become nonexistent, chores left undone.  Children will be begging for your attention but all you will be able to do is continue to read and turn the pages as you watch Mena, Phoenix and Alex try to figure out the mess they find themselves in after one tragic night.Mena discovers her husband has cheated and she tries to leave.  When he finds her on that dark raining night, she isn’t alone, Phoenix, the alpha of the vampires is there.  Her husband has been harboring more than the secret of his affair, he is also the alpha of the wolf pack.  When Mena is changed, she becomes the new alpha but all of the information she needed wasn’t provided.  All she is sure of is she needs to figure out a way to lead this pack of wolves and combat against those that left in rebellion.With Alex being the investigator into the murder of her husband, Mena’s wolf has a strong attraction to the human Alex, while Mena has feelings for Phoenix.  K.S. and Anne created a plot that gives each character a set of pros and cons with each decision they have to make, intensifying the conflict and angst in the story.  The goal was clear; the path to reaching that goal is going to be next to impossible.  People are going to lose in this story, not many will gain but for the one who wins the prize, the risks may never outweigh the victory.Brilliance that is the first word that comes to mind when I talk about the talent of these two authors.  This book is for everyone, the lovers of vampires, wolves, shifters, love, loss and drama.  Add a few witches, humans, crime, anger and pain and you have the recipe for this emotional vortex that will take you away from reality and leave you demanding for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OXDEBWJC04IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012L5AWEK#wasThisHelpful","R2OXDEBWJC04IW","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is always a wonderful thing to see an author branch out into new areas of writing that is scary and intimidating for them.  What makes it even better is when they do an awesome job at it and provide a story that will shock the reader and leave them begging for more.  This author put her fears and insecurities on the shelf and went forward, giving us a gritty story that will shatter the weak at heart with drama, suspense and the evil deeds of others.K.A took on a tough topic in this book and added a bit of romance to the plot to remind us that love can conquer all, or can it?  Jules never grew up knowing what love or having a family felt like.  Living in foster homes, dealing with abuse, having her friendships and relationships used against her, has forced her to survive in a hotel room, working at a dead end job and avoiding the advances of sick men.It wasn’t until the Riley brothers stepped into the bar that she started to see a second chance at life begin to form. While stubbornly holding on to her independence and pride, Holden showed interest in things other than her body.  He wanted to know her heart, mind and ambitions.  He wanted to help and love her, be part of her dreams and future. Dante gave her a sense of protection, security, possibly an awkward form of friendship. While Dante wanted to find out what Jules was about, he respected the strength in her soul that has kept her alive but soon the truth about the three comes out and their worlds turn upside down.  Putting the pieces of this puzzle together was consuming, captivating and at times earth shattering.The amount of suspense and drama all begins to unfold halfway through the book and the author didn’t give you a chance to catch your breath till the last page, leaving you trying to process what you had just read with your mind swirling and heart racing.  You will find scenes that will rip your heart out and leave you emotionally raw, moments you will want to scream at K.A and ask her what she was thinking.  Then you forgive her with the moments that have you melting because of the tender romance that brews between Holden and Jules.  The biggest promise I can give you is the unpredictability of this story.  Never let your guard down, go through the first half and learn about Jules  and understand where she came from because where she ends up will blow you away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NGPB3UH6NIJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010YRNCSK#wasThisHelpful","R3NGPB3UH6NIJ8","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By far this is the best book in the series so far and that is saying a lot.  I fell in love with Pamela Sparkman’s style after I read her first book.  The way she brings the reader into the story, making us feel the emotions and live the plot was impressive to me.  We meet this crew of characters and they continue to show up in the books as the series progresses.  Skin Deep is about Hayden and Beth.Hayden has every reason to be a jerk in life but he turned his back on his childhood and family and forged ahead in life learning to love and be the kind hearted man that was his true self.  He has two girls in his life that he takes care of and loves, but Beth has captured his heart.  Unfortunately, Beth can’t give him anything in return because she is empty inside.When you read about her childhood and how she survives day to day it will break your heart.  She struggles against the vice she has depended on, her eating disorder and her longing to be normal and able to love.  Hayden can see past the walls she has built and makes it his mission to make her like him, be a friend to her and get her to love him.There are so many twists to this story, you will never be able to sit back and predict the next move.  I love how Beth isn’t a victim or someone who feels there is no hope for her future; she just needs someone to believe in her enough till she can have faith in herself.  Hayden, oh my Hayden is my favorite male character out of this series.  He is bright, funny, loving, and sexy and can sing a woman right off her feet.If you haven’t already experienced the beautiful storytelling of Pamela Sparkman you are missing out on a great treasure.  She brings her characters to life right before your eyes, allowing each of them to show their tender vulnerable souls to the reader and allowing us on their path of healing.  She gives us joy and sadness, hope and healing and humor along the way.  I know we have all heard the phrase Live Well, Love Much, Laugh Often…….that is the theme in Pamela’s books.  No matter what the situation is, no matter how great the heartache will be, nor how big the loss, she has created a group of friends and family that love, laugh and live through ups and downs in life as a team.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ04C95O1EW4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0110SNHAA#wasThisHelpful","RQ04C95O1EW4P","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have loved the Wonderland series from the beginning and I think the unique idea of different authors writing the characters story is brilliant.  It keeps the style and pattern refreshingly different and so far there hasn’t been a book that I have disliked or gives me the usual drag that often happens in a series.  But this one, Max Colton’s story, was so intense and real for me, I feel like I left part of my life in the pages with him.I am not sure how H.A. Robinson did it, but she created a bond for me with Max from the first chapter.  I have been known to become emotionally invested in a story, I have suffered my fair share of book hangovers but rarely do I feel like I have a “dog in the fight” as I did with this one.  Max became my own child or sorts, when he hurt I hurt, when he was happy my whole emotional balanced shifted.  She had me so incorporated with this story; my family noticed the emotional changes in me.  I will admit, this freaks me out that Ms. Robinson not only got in my head with Max she moved in and took over my world as well.The story starts out with Max being sent away to school.  The love of his mother was strong but in my opinion she wasn’t always worthy.  His father was a huge self-centered jerk who just thinking about him makes my blood boil.  Max had some issues with his speech and he never fought back or started a fight, yet he carried bruises and cuts from others on his face often.  Punishment at the school wasn’t detention that we have come to know, it was physical punishment and even through all of this, the light that kept him centered was going back home to be with his mom and keep enough distance from his father.I could go on for hours about this book and walk you through every day of his live as it was described but I won’t risk spoiling it for you.  Expect to see Max as he grows up to be a man, tricked by women who want to take advantage, lied to by others who have their own agenda.  He will find that his love for his mom makes him vulnerable to vultures that are preying on his gentle heart.  But there is more, you will also see his kind spirit find friendships that will nurture him into becoming a brave man who can stand up for himself.  He will find his place in life even if it is in the location he swore he would never go to, Max learns that sometimes the places labeled never become the only place to go.If this were a normal book, this is where I would say the ending leaves you in a slight cliff hanger, but this isn’t a normal book.  For me, the ending left me with the mixed emotions of being excited to see his next venture in life begin to unfold, the thrill and joy that he is about to embark on.  Then there is the other side of my heart, the more protective side that is fearful this next stage is going to shatter him and crush the fragile spirit we have seen since we met him.  Make no mistake when you open this book you are at risk of falling in love with Max, but this kind of love goes much deeper than a physical attraction.  If we could bottle this secret talent the H. A. Robinson has for making the story become part of our own soul, there wouldn’t be a single person on the planet without a book in their hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M6E52H58CRV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010M4R8JY#wasThisHelpful","R1M6E52H58CRV6","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an emotional second book in a series.  I could go over the facts in the book but you need to feel this story as you go.  I feel everyone should read this book in this day and age.  Of course it will upset some people because it is an f/f book and that won’t appeal to the average reader but you will be missing a great message of those beliefs that influenced us as children.Delilah is now facing the most crucial turning point in her life.  The last thing she has from her parents after their unexpected death is the guilt that they were upset with her because she admitted she was gay.  Being in a community where homosexuality was common, she struggles with coming out and questions why  straight people don’t have to “come out” about their sexual preference yet homosexuals do.  Doesn’t everyone have the same right to be happy and free without shame?When she decided to express her feelings toward Ashley she was relieved to know Ashely felt the same towards her, but  can she let go of those ties that bind her to her parents judgments and be open in public with her girlfriend?  Could what she felt was the last link to her parents really be broken if it meant saving this relationship.You will watch Delilah as she explores this new lifestyle, which I hope will be seen no differently than a young adult exploring their first real relationship no matter what sexual preference they are.  That is the message I carried from this book, every form of love, every coming of age event and every belief you grew up with, shapes a person’s future in the same way.I found this to be a powerful story of a young woman trying to find her way in life after losing her only foundation, her parents.  Striking out into the world with a shattered heart and desires that have been deemed as wrong.  Feeling love for the “wrong” person yet knowing the heart won’t let go of that feeling.  I think Delilah was a strong woman and I felt bad that a society I am part of made her struggle worse than it needed to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE8C4QJNL3Z8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX90BDI#wasThisHelpful","RE8C4QJNL3Z8M","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"ARC provided by author in exchange for an honest review for Stephanie's Book ReportsWow, this was an intense read; I already feel a book hangover starting.  The author is going to take you on a path of twist and turns and discoveries that will rip your heart out and leave you breathless.  It starts out as an average college story, one night stands, girl meets bad boy, friends try to talk her out of going after bad boy, but shortly after the first few chapters something changes and you are thrown into the depths of the hell that Cassie and Luca have lived during the last few years.  The story goes from entertaining to meaningful right before your eyes and you are so invested by the time you realize it, there is no turning back for the reader.In one night, the loving home and charmed life that Cassie had grown up in becomes dark and destroyed.  Her world will never be the same again and the only way she knew how to deal was to deny, ignore and have sex with any man she could to feel something for a few minutes before the numbness took over again.  She is in college and living with her two best friends London and Milo.  You will love those two, Milo brings light and laughter to the story, London deserves sainthood with her patience and compassion.  London knows the secret Cassie holds, she has felt the pain of the last four years and focused her attention on keeping Cassie safe and going forward.  Cassie sees Luca at a party and decides that night should be spent having hot sex with him, but he turns her down.  He instantly sees what Cassie is hiding behind the cold exterior of her heart and he wants no part of her plan.Luca might appear to be the bad boy with a terrible reputation, but in reality he is just as torn up with events in his life as Cassie.  Maybe that is why he could identify the mask she was wearing because he had one of his own.  Or could it be he was afraid that she might become more than a one night stand? When he moves in next door to her, they begin a cat and mouse game, trying to make the other jealous enough to give in and beg for sex.  It was a safe game they thought because both were too stubborn to wave the white flag and admit defeat.  It was endearing to watch him with her and as the events continued to unfold, I found I was falling in love with his character more than I even thought was possible.There are times in this story that will have you on your knees overcome with raw emotions as Cassie faces the reality of what was left behind after that dreadful night.  Moments that will melt your heart as both Luca and Cassie take a risk at trust again and events that will make you value the love you have in your own life even more.  There are so many ups and downs with this story that will keep the reader turning pages in order to see if they will find their happy. The writing style is smooth, the action is balanced and the author truly invited the readers to care about these characters.  I would recommend this book and say I will be looking for more work from this author in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JSJ7R14MPPLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y997HEA#wasThisHelpful","R2JSJ7R14MPPLX","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kindle Alexander has accomplished a major feat with this book.  The author took an outstanding and intriguing plot and made it blossom into an intense and emotional read that will make you stop and think about how your judgments on homosexuality and the liberty to live your life.  The message in this book that exude from every page is about acceptance, unconditional love and becoming comfortable with who you are and living the life you were given.  These messages were sent in the midst of a love story filled with patience, angst and hope that never crossed the line into ménage, cheating or betrayal.Dylan Reeves is a middle aged man who has the mind of a genius when it comes to technology.  He created a program that is sought after across the country, but his funds are too limited to expand his company any farther.  He freely admits during his college years he made some wild choices, not bad ones because those choices developed into marrying his best friend Teri and their three beautiful children.  His life was story book perfect to the world, but behind the closed doors he was living a lie.  Dylan was gay living in a straight man’s world.  His dedication to his children was so strong he was willing to live the lie till they were all off on their own in college and then he would make the difficult choices that he knew he faced.Teri Reeves was one of the most remarkable women that I have ever come across in a fictional story.  Dylan had been honest with her years ago and she dealt with his truth that had now become her story.  She committed with him to stay together for the children, but she also wanted to support him as he emerged into this new reality.  She found a man whom she carried on a relationship with for years, loved him and would go away for weekends with her lover, all with Dylan’s blessings.  She encouraged Dylan to seek his own love while they banded together as a family for their children.  She was strong, confident and a valuable support person for Dylan as he realized his day of freedom was coming sooner than he had planned.Tristian Wilder was the handsome CEO of Wilder-Nation, the company that wants to buy Dylan’s program and business.  Everyone knows Tristian is gay and a playboy but when his eyes land on Dylan for the first time he felt in his soul there was more to this man than his brilliant mind.  Tristian figures out Dylan’s secret and with small baby steps takes him on the journey of what it would be like living as a homosexual male.  I loved the balance that the author gave Tristian, as CEO and self-made millionaire, he is used to getting his way in everything, but with Dylan he had such patience and compassion, it made this story even more beautiful.Be prepared to discover emotions of your own that you might not be aware of.  I don’t know if I could be as strong and accepting as Teri.  Could I have the patience and acceptance in hiding my emotions and heart to the world because of the fear and shame carried by the one I loved if I were Tristian?  Could I break free from the moral foundation I had been brainwashed with growing up to stand up in an unaccepting society and declare my true being like Dylan is faced with? This is a powerful story and truly one of Kindle Alexander’s best books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31M81TVTVEN7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XXBQPM0#wasThisHelpful","R31M81TVTVEN7J","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once I started this series, I haven’t been able to put it down.  Lynnette Bernard continues once again to take real human issues and throw them at this group of characters who happen to also be shifters.  One thing that she does in this series that has me addicted is adding new characters with each book, giving you enough of a hint to know you will see them again soon while creating their role to the point you need to know more about their story.  We met Nikki in book one, she was Laurie’s best friend and hints were dropped that she had lived a rough life and been hurt beyond the point anyone should have expected.Now with her own book, we learn just what was behind the tears that Nikki shed, she was lonely and had been beaten down her whole life.  With a mother who continued to remind her that she meant nothing and would never amount to anything, to an ex-husband who used her for the one thing Nikki had.  Now as a nurse, she tries to hide behind the sarcasm and laughter and help everyone who is in need while hiding as she sheds the tears and longs to be held.  We saw her get hurt by Laurie’s ex-husband in book one and that places her at the ranch and in the sites of Alexander and Butler, triad partners looking for their mate.The guys are wolf shifters and in charge of protecting the pack and family.  Without having a mate to calm their inner wolf down, they were beginning to believe they might have to step away from security as they were losing their grip on the emotions that were flooding their soul.  When they met Nikki, they knew by the scent she was their mate, but convincing her was going to be a huge challenge.How do you convince a stubborn woman who is afraid to allow a man to control her that she was meant to be with them when they are so demanding and alpha in their need to protect and take care of her?  There is a lot of back and forth between these three as they demand she listen and she demands they accept her for who she is.  She wants babies so badly but fears that the lies she has been told about her ability will make it never happen.  Even with the visions they all see, she isn’t willing to risk her heart and believe in what they are telling her.  It will take a big event to prove to her that she needs to close her mouth and open her eyes to see the truth.I look forward to book 3 as we were given a peek into the story of Drew, Carter and Susannah and her story sounds intense.  As with book one, Lynnette leaves some loose ends in each book while drawing attention to the next journey the reader will embark on.  While the traditions are the same in the pack for each book, the personalities stand out and transport you into a new plot and intensity that makes you want to keep coming back for more.  Make sure you read them in order and enjoy life on the ranch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23U3E7E5BWBDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HA6FXU#wasThisHelpful","R23U3E7E5BWBDD","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 stars*ARC provided in exchange for an honest review for Crystal’s Many Reviewers*I have had the honor of reading the first three books in the Den of Sin series and the number one thing I tell readers is you will find a steamy story with a real message about life, acceptance and moving forward in each book.  L. V Lewis doesn’t write this series for the erotic element alone, she write a meaningful story with an erotic twist.  The Beaudelaire Hotel is the place where broken and dishearten people go to find a second chance at love and life.In this installment you meet Karen and Paul.  They had met years ago during physical therapy and rehab.  Karen was married though and not free to explore any feelings she had for another man.  Paul was instantly attracted to her but he respected her situation in life and at the time he was trying to find his place in society now that he came back from the Marines with his leg being replaced by prosthesis.Karen was one of the most sought after fashion models in the country.  Her beauty lit up a room and men would fall on the floor in front of her to gain a single second of her attention, but she was dealt the hand of facing a double mastectomy. Her husband couldn’t handle that his wife was no longer the woman who could fill out those sexy bathing suits so their marriage ended. Giving love another try was not something Karen was willing to risk; she couldn’t even have sex without her shirt on.  After agreeing to give the weekend of fantasy a try, she is confronted with the man who fell in love with her all of those years ago.  Could she let Paul love her and give her two days of joy and passion?L.V. Lewis proves to the reader that outside beauty isn’t what feeds the soul; it is your heart and spirit that makes you beautiful.  As Paul proves to Karen she is as much of a woman now as she was in front of the camera we watch her confidence grow and admire the courage and self-acceptance Paul as over his newly formed body.  This is a story of second chances, love and acceptance that can be read very quickly due to the shorten length and writing style.  The author is a pro at reeling you in on the first page and making the next couple of hours become a fantasy come true for the reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D56YEBEUGN7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HI5WHSI#wasThisHelpful","R1D56YEBEUGN7E","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ARC received from the author for an honest review for Bare Naked WordsI had not heard of this author before and was a little worried when I researched and found the term Dick Dynasty used.  The first chapter really was not what I had expected and to be honest, I was almost ready to DNF because I just wasn’t sure this was my kind of book.  I am so glad I didn’t quit though because the authors talent for suspense and making two opposites attract was well worth the read.Porter is the oldest brother to the “Dick Dynasty”.  His brothers Preston and Parker are seen as his responsibilities with his mother since their father is out of the picture and the burden becomes too much to deal with for Porter.  With all three being in the porn business, Porter sees first hand that gay porn can make more money than the average kind, he also sees the drugs that are available to them, but he isn’t willing to go that far for a buck.  When he meets Holly he realizes, he might even be willing to stop all together if he could have a future with her.Holly is a professional woman as a casting director. She deals with the dramatic and demanding people who have a list of demands that should never be expected to be met.  She has a clear picture in her head of how porn stars act, even down to release parties that she would bet money becomes an orgy.  When she meets Porter at his brother’s party, her body says YES, while her mind say NO. Good thing an accidental run in gave her the escape she needed, but Porter won’t be ignored for long.  Can he ever convince her that there is more to him that the porn?I loved the side characters in this story, to be honest; they carry the plot better than most.  Mitch and Becks gives this story a slice of humor and sarcasm that will make you fall in love with them and the boy’s mom is the queen of motherly guilt.  There is a pretty dramatic ending, some would call it a cliffhanger, but for me it was more like the prologue to what I hope is the next book.I want to make sure it is clear to those who give this book a try, the first part might offend you and make you want to quit, but the author quickly shows us what he is capable of and will provide you with steamy sex scenes, suspense that will leave your heart racing and a love story that will be remembered for a long time.  I can hardly wait to see what is coming next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGN7C1XBXPJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDVCK50#wasThisHelpful","RGN7C1XBXPJ7","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had recently be gifted a copy of Lynnette Bernard’s Cowboy Series and fell in love with those characters and her writing style.  I made a comment that I wanted to check out her paranormal series but was concerned because I didn’t know if her style would be enough for me to really invest in a paranormal book.  She kindly offered to give me the series in exchange for an honest review.  I mean let’s be serious, if you can get a reader who doesn’t understand or like shifter stories to like your book, and then you know you must be on to something right?When I received the series I thought I would give the first book a quick glance.  I had a to do list a mile long, but I was curious about Laurie’s Loves.  Unfortunately for my to do list, nothing really got done yesterday because once I started the book I couldn’t put it down.  Even woke up at two this morning to read some more and was up again at six with kindle in my hand.  What made this addicting for me?  The human element of the story.  Even the shifters presented themselves to me as human beings with the same emotions, fears and angst that I have; therefore I could connect and identify with them on so many levels.  Now I am not a pro at the shifter genre and there were a few loose ends in this story that I still wonder about, but overall I am hooked and a proud card carrying fan of Beckett’s Wolf Pack series.Laurie is the mother of two young adult twin children that she has raised by herself from day one.  Her husband was abusive and jealous of the time the kids took away from her.  He had no love for anyone.  After saving every penny she took a vacation to the ranch where she meets Jace and Jackson, along with their whole pack.  She had been torn down by her ex so much, she didn’t see herself as anything other than old, fat and stupid, along with very ugly.  What the guys saw was their beautiful mate and they were determined to claim her as soon as possible.Jace was jaded, vowing to never find the mate that would calm his wolf and be able to contain his emotions; he fought daily to remain a fair alpha for his pack.  Jackson was the beta, second in command and he was much more laid back and easy going than Jace, but he could feel the struggle flaring inside his triad partner.  Jace and Jackson have been able to talk to each other since they were kids, not verbally but through their thoughts so when Laurie came onto the ranch they both knew she was the one they had been searching for their whole lives.  Will they be able to protect her when someone wants her dead?  Will they be able to accept that Laurie is a package deal?  Along with her love they will have to accept her friend, children and yes even the threat of her ex-husband.You will be introduced to many members of this pack family and watch as Laurie just naturally fits in with each person.  She has a unique kind of love and compassion that draws people to her but she also has enemies that want to destroy her and insecurities that will keep her paralyzed in life.  This book wasn’t just a love story; it had action and drama that will keep you turning those pages.  It is also a story of letting go of the past, releasing the fears and burning the old tapes that play on repeat in your mind, keeping you from taking risks and finding your happily ever after.  I was so engrossed by this book, I quickly started book two before I even thought about how to write this review.  This pack of humans/wolves have fascinated me, drawn me in to their world and even made me a bit jealous that it is fiction and not someplace I can go to in real life.  I look forward to reading the whole series and getting to know each of the characters better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388WNQE3IRFE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007V2DHQ4#wasThisHelpful","R388WNQE3IRFE9","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I say this more out of pride than for full disclosure and honesty reasons, but I was Lorenz beta reader for this series and the person who has spent the last two years regularly begging for Cyrus to have his own book.  I fell for that man in Hunted and begged, pleaded and yes even demanded that he get a book of his own.  I am so thankful Lorenz saw the brilliance in my suggestion, or demand, and gave him the fourth installment to The Gates Legacy.  Actually it had nothing to do with me begging, as the Gates Legacy unfolds, it was just common sense that this new chapter in the plot would evolve from Cyrus.I could tell you what happens in this book, well no I really can’t because so much happens in every one of her books, it would be a novel just describing it, but I do feel I can give you some insights as to what you are going to discover while you read her series.  It is strongly suggested you read these books in order, if you don’t you will risk getting lost in the plot but more than that you will never capture the true poetry in her writing.  Lorenz is one of the only authors I have come across that can write a book in such a way, you actually forget you are reading and feel more like you are living the story in a big screen production.  Her talent and way with words brings the story to life, you can smell the air in the scene, picture the little items that were not even mentioned because the book becomes a magical land you have just entered.The theme, as always if good versus evil and how far are you willing to go to achieve your goal.  In this installment she also focuses on how far you will go to make your life better.  There are some characters that we have grown to love over the past three books that are stuck in a darkness that will consume them if they don’t reach out for the light. Cyrus was dealt a terrible deal when he was transformed from human to vampire.  Now he has to decide if adjusting to his new life and making the best of it is worth the risk, especially when he is going to have to partner up with the demon himself who put him in this position.  Anger, disappointment and revenge will threaten to derail the plans and the overwhelming sense of loss could cripple some of our beloved characters.  Is this family strong enough to bring the ones on the brink back to life while carrying on the mission at hand?I have the blessing in life to call Lorenz my dear friend and with this relationship I see so much of her own personality in her books.  With Reckoning her trait to put herself aside for the greater good is the common theme that plays out across the pages.  Each member at Tack Industries will be faced with the challenge of protecting themselves and those they love or risking it all for the greater good in the vampire community.  The bond that this created family has, is fused with a moral need to do well, even in the face of the most demonic evil forces ever to be created.  Wars and battles will be fought and some are won, some are lost, but what stands firm is their resolve to do what their fallen leader had set out to do in the beginning of the series.There are not enough words that could convey my feelings about how everyone must read this series.  I was not even a vampire fan when I started working with her on Hunted.  Lorenz writes for all readers.  She doesn’t direct this series to vampire genre lovers, she writes for readers who love fantastic stories.  I found as a “vampire virgin” that I was easily enamored by these characters and plot, finding my own place among the Gates Legacy lovers, yet another one of Lorenz’s personality traits, inclusion for all people, acceptance and the ability to leave no one behind when she it typing out her magic on the computer.  Get your copies today people, you won’t be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3624B3BGFI1NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLII41A#wasThisHelpful","R3624B3BGFI1NI","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jake’s Angel is by far my favorite in this series, which is hard to say because I have loved each one.  Once I finished the book I took some time to think about why I loved Jake’s Angel so much.  The conclusion I came up with is because of Lynnette’s writing style.  With each book she gives you crumbs of everyone’s story along with the plot of the two main characters in each book.  The build up to why Jake was so standoffish to Claire has always intrigued me, now I know the full story and it was more intense than I had predicted.Jake’s parents died when he was younger which caused his older brother Deuce to take over as head of the household.  Jake became more withdrawn from the family and society while the other brothers grieved and moved on from their parent’s untimely death.  When you read the reason for his coldness it will break your heart and make you want to love him even more.  His nature is to dominate in the bedroom and in life.  I think he is one of the most protective brothers in the McKade clan and just what Claire needs, but his fear in hurting her keeps replaying over and over in his head.She grew up with a mother and sister who never loved her.  They mentally, verbally and physically abused her over and over because she was different.  She was an Empath, she felt the emotions both good and bad of others to the point it would overwhelm her most of the time.  When she touched Jake, she gave him the sense of peace and calm that he has been missing since his parents died.  In Jake she found safety and emotional calmness from the invading feelings.  He could shut the outside world out and give her the room to just be at peace.  Since she can read his mind, she knows what he is most afraid of and why he keeps pulling away from her.  She can also see his dreams that he gave up on long ago, her job now is to prove to him she can make those dreams come true and that he is her mate.Everything isn’t smooth for them as outside forces try to derail their path and if they make it they will have to stand strong together and trust in what the Great Spirit has put together for them.  One thing I love most about Lynnette’s books is when she introduces new characters in the book.  I always know that means there is a chance this series will go on and on as she tells the story of each one.  She writes her series in ways that each book could be a standalone, but I wouldn’t recommend it, yet each one carries not only the main couple but additions that keep the interest and intensity alive.  I have yet to read one that drags or becomes boring midway through because she engages the readers mind along with their heart.  I highly recommend the Cowboy Mates, Psychic Connections Series.  Lynnette has many other books out on the market that have more of a paranormal theme.  I am not normally a fan of such books but with her style and flair in storytelling and her ability to make me so invested in her characters I pray their story never ends, I will certainly be getting more of her work so I can dive in and enjoy her talent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJOB0HEVVVJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG6TMGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1VJOB0HEVVVJH","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crystal from Crystal’s Many Reviewers is a dear friend of mine and bought this book for my 12 year old daughter.  My daughter doesn’t always have the patience to sit and read a book; she must be on the go or on her computer, so I was amazed when she came out of her room the day after getting this book with her kindle in her hand.  She informed me she had already read the first story the night before and she couldn’t put the second story down.I immediately went and purchased the first book from these young authors and send it to my daughter’s kindle and she started that book the moment she was done with The Perfect Summer.  I skimmed over the book and read bits and pieces and it didn’t take long for me to realize that we have three young ladies who are going to be fantastic authors as adults if they keep this up.  They are natural born story tellers who know how to relate to teenagers through stories of morals, values and compassion.  As a mother I highly recommend these books for your young readers.Faith’s review (age 12)I loved all three stories. My favorite story was the second one, A Lesson for Summer. I think I like it morebecause I could understand the characters more. I could relate to the stories more than otherstories I have read because it was like talking to my best friend instead of grown-ups. I love how they all put their own touch it every story. Myfavorite characters are Vanessa and Teresa. They are my favorite because theyare twins that stick together in every situation. I don’t always like to read but I didn’t want to stop reading this one and already like their first book. It is nice to know that kids can be authors too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSNIX7AOVM9T6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625178719#wasThisHelpful","RSNIX7AOVM9T6","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could not have written or asked for a better ending to this series.  The title speaks for itself, giving you the understanding of how things have work out for Ace and Max after the running, denying and anger destroyed their world.  Till now we have read how Ace runs from difficult situations.  She grew up depending on two men, her father and Max.  When death and fear took those two from her she did what came natural, she loaded her car with her belongings and headed out of the state.  With Max we came to understand him more in book two.  Being raised without his father, then reconnecting to only find out the man he really wasn’t, left Max needing Ace even more.  When she was gone he clung to the next available substitute and his life kept spiraling downward.In Finding me, it starts with Ace, now being called by her given name Harper, creating a new life for herself on the East coast.  She called in a few favors and found an assistant job in a lab and exposing her to people who pry as to why she is so closed off and away from home.  Fritz and Kitty will become vital to her discovering herself again and when she needs to go back home for her sister’s wedding, she will have to come face to face with Max again.As the story unfolds, there are a few things that the author did that gave me chills and made the story come to life for me.  In keeping with the title, Harper discovered her identity isn’t reliant on anyone but herself.  She is more than capable at being happy and we got to see that while she was on the East coast but even with happiness she wasn’t complete till she solved what she was running from.  I also loved that her father, even though he was gone, played a huge part in this book and in her recovery.  He truly showed the love of a father with the way the author wrote the story.  I loved how Max was finally able to be honest and real with Ace.  He had so many walls up regarding her because of her tendency to run but when he could finally be honest with her, you could see the confidence and courage evolve in his character.I am totally obsessed with these characters and story.  The way Mariah wrote each book was unique and insightful.  She allowed us to feel what the character was feeling and put us in each person’s point of view so we could develop our own opinions about the story.  She took some risks with this one, it isn’t the typical love story that readers have become accustom to, she added the raw elements of life, loss, anger, fear and defensiveness.  She showed we never know when a stranger will become a friend, when a first love will be the only love and how love and protectiveness can reach far beyond the grave.  I strongly suggest you read this three book series and read them in order so you can relish in the plot as I have.  This will be a story I won’t soon forget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R255MOZ2JFV9F1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLXRWCQ#wasThisHelpful","R255MOZ2JFV9F1","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so grateful to say I was wrong to assume that this book was going to be ordinary.  She took a plot that carried interest and intrigue on its own and utilized every aspect creating a spectacular story that will remain with me for a long time.Sara Hubbard is by far the best author I have found at switching POV’s.  They transitioned so smoothly that I was able to just continue reading without having to shift mind sets to grasp each character.  Evie and Declan each had their own take on an event and different outlooks on life so to make this a smooth read using dual POV, is impressive.  She took black and white and made the perfect shade of gray with these two people.There is something about this book and her style that I can’t put my finger on, but I loved it.  It captured my attention right away, drew me into the story and allowed me to feel every scene as if I were there.  The facts became very clear as to why Evie and Declan would never make it as a couple, yet while the line was drawn, it was also blurred just enough that I never entertained a thought that they shouldn’t be together.  I guess I was Mona in real life because the Mona in the book saw what I did; they needed to make this work.Evie was the type of woman who believed you could react to others in kindness, no matter how damaged you are in real life.  Why feed the dragon you are trying to eliminate in the world.  I can’t say she really forgave and forgot, but she certainly didn’t let her past keep her down.  She grew each day and asked questions and always found the positive in people and situations.  She was nave, but not because she wasn’t street smart, it was because she refused to let the world taint her view of life.  Evie is holding a secret, like no other secret that I have seen written into a plot and that single event framed who she is today.Declan, who suffered as greatly as Evie did growing up, adopted the killed or be killed mentality.  He has sold his soul to Jimmy and will do his underground fighting and become his hitman.  He had nothing to lose and everything to gain by working for Jimmy, he also gained Mona as a mother figure and because of the pub, and he will soon have Evie.  Declan is a monster, he is an evil killer who shows no emotions, but Evie can see through that and into his heart.  She doesn’t want him to change his past; she wants him to be the man he was supposed to be and love her while allowing her to love him.I absolutely love this story and the way the author created magic while finding a common ground for the angel and the killer is brilliant. It is a raw, intense and drama packed book that brings the read front and center into the story.  Absolutely one of my favorite books so far in 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183SWYQ3JKIXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEAO49U#wasThisHelpful","R183SWYQ3JKIXG","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a few elements to this story that really touched my heart. The Swedish aspect since my husband is Swedish and was familiar with the traditions and foods involved and I could see a lot of him in Erick. The other element is I am a mother to a college aged young man and two teenage daughters. This topic needed to be addressed and the author did it in a very graceful and respectable way without risking the emotional impact for the reader.Without spoiling the story for you, I will point out a few things that really touched my heart in this book. Erick and Daisy was the perfect couple. New to college, love and life on their own, they were the perfect balance to each other. Preforming of the arts are center stage in their lives and one day, what should have been a normal routine, turned into a life altering day that will shatter everyone involved. My favorite line of the whole book was “He wasn’t a hero. He was in love.” And that is how this story begins, Erick and Daisy finding their love before their innocence was taken and replaced with tragedy.Friendships will be tested and futures at risk. How do you overcome that exact moment when everything went into slow motion, the noise is deafening and will be repeated in your nightmares for years to come? When the smell of blood will infuse in your senses and you will smell that for the rest of your life. Images will forever be the background in your mind and this nightmare will continue across the country and played out on the news over and over for you to remember. Crutches will be used, lives destroyed all because of one man. Erick will prove that you can come out of a traumatic event still breathing, but that doesn’t mean you survived it.The author takes us along with him as he goes through years of his life struggling to overcome the memories. I had moments of feeling like this was being extended to long, but then I realized maybe I was just wanting him to “fix this” as soon as possible because the author’s style was so intense. I was an emotional mess while watching him waste his life away.There is so much more I would love to say about this book, but you really need feel it for yourself. You will read about struggles, forgiveness, acceptance and letting go. This is a powerful story that needed to be told and I think this author was brilliant in the approach she used to tell it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SEPHNSB0RS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2H6CSO#wasThisHelpful","R32SEPHNSB0RS6","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given an ARC by the author in exchange for an honest review.  I have been a fan of Mardi Maxwell for a while, but I always strayed away from the sci-fi genre because I couldn’t see myself enjoying it but because I have great faith and love for Mardi’s writing style I accepted the challenge and I am so thankful I did. For readers who are on the fence about sci-fi, this author gives you a complete run down in the beginning of the book regarding the terms and time frames used. You have a brief history of the situation and then as your progress into the story, you will be so captivated by the plot and characters, the fear of sci-fi rapidly disappears.Valan could be considered a real demon, but as you begin to understand you and the situation he was in, I think readers will embrace him as I did.  He lost a great deal due to a group of barbarians and he wants revenge.  When he learns that the only way he will be able to stay alive is to mate with a woman from that group, he was willing to die instead.  His father still remained determined to live after the heartbreak and pave the way for his son to mate and live as well.  If Valan refuses, he will not only die, he will lose his warrior status.  As demanded he and his other members invaded this enemy territory and kidnapped the women who were destined to be the new mates for the Zarronians.  His mate was a beautiful young woman named Lia.Being woken up in the middle of the night and realizing she have been ripped from her home and taken to the enemy camp should have terrified her, but instead Valan saved her life.  As Lia’s tribe’s tradition was, the sire can have as many women as he cares to have and the females are not treated with respect.  Lia’s sire had sold her to the worst man in the community, one who enjoys punishing his girls in public and not caring if they die or not.  Lia was going to be Gorm’s as soon as the cycle permitted so when she found herself mated to Valan, she was given a new chance at life.  Unfortunately Valan wasn’t very nice in the beginning, he saw her as a part of the reason he lost everything.The best part of the story is when Lia tells Valan about her life before he took her and shows us how Valan’s heart begins to struggle between need to protect her and the urge to get his revenge. There are some steamy scenes that will have you grabbing some ice water and fanning yourself off.  Along with that, we see Lia as she accepts her new life and role as his mate.  The question is, will Valan finally release his need for revenge and allow his life to become full of happiness and love before Lia’s past life will come back and take her back to what she was desperate to escape.  I really enjoyed this book and can hardly wait to read book 2.  I am so thankful I took a chance at sci-fi because Mardi Maxwell could make me a fan with stories like this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR539UWKSZL2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ82JOA#wasThisHelpful","RR539UWKSZL2X","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy of this book to review for Stephanie's Book Reports.You will find an intense introduction to this series in a matter of sixty some pages.  It took me no time at all to absorb this piece of the story and when I was done I desired to know more about what was going on with this man.Thane has created his own religion, a set of beliefs that leads him to save women and find the one that the Gods has approved of to give him a son.  He really believes that everything he does is for her sake, her benefit and will greatly improve her life and he ask the readers to believe in him and his methods.Already in his compound he has a few women who live to serve him and a young man called simply Boy. When he spots Betty, a prostitute who was running from her own family issues, he takes her as his special one and calls her Freya.Book one, as I said, goes very quickly and basically gives you an idea of the compound, his plans and her initiation into the new group she will be forced to call family.  I have a feeling this is going to be a very dark and twisted series and I am not even able to predict where the author is going with this one.  What I can predict is I am going to be sitting on pins and needles till I get the next one.The ONLY reason I gave this a 4 star rating is because of the length and the fact I feel we only got a chapter of the story.  Because of this, I read scenes that felt rushed and information that I would have loved to of had missing because of how fast this book unfolded. This would have been a perfect first book in a series had she given us more as an introduction and expanded more of the scenes to this plot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ86NNWPG7SID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1511839007#wasThisHelpful","RZ86NNWPG7SID","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have yet to open a book by T.K. Leigh and not feel like I just gave her my heart and soul to do as she pleases.  This author can bring a reader to tears and tug at the heart strings more than any other author I have read.  Chasing the Dragon is no different.Mackenzie, also known as Serafina Galloway, will steal your emotions as you read how she had to leave everything at a young age and go into hiding.  As she reemerged back into society things became complicated and dangerous.  She built those walls in order to protect herself when events left her totally alone in life.  Now with the chance to make her dreams come true, Tyler Burnham will walk into her world and rip things apart.Tyler has his own agenda and loving Mackenzie isn’t on the list.  He needs information that only she can give him, or at least that is what he believes.  Someone is after her to gain information as well, but if they succeed first, it could be deadly.  The plan?  Go in and get to her before the other enemy does. Make her trust him and possibly steal her heart but that won’t be easy because Mackenzie tailors her life by a calendar.  Every minute of her day is scheduled and spending time with a man or falling in love is NOT on that calendar.Of course love has a way of wiping out schedules and breaking down walls.  It also has a way of changing the agenda and forcing a person to make a choice between love and job.  This isn’t your typical romance story though.  The author will leave you breathless with suspense and danger.  The lies will be flowing between the pages forcing you to sort it out and come to your own conclusions as to why she had to leave her home as a child and who can she trust now.  At one point I couldn’t  figure out who I trusted anymore and that broke my heart because I had grown to love Tyler and Mackenzie along with some of the side characters, I didn’t want anyone to be an evil person.  You see the book ends leaving  you feeling as empty and broken as the characters and wanting to beg the author for more immediately.There is not a single book that this author has written that I wouldn’t highly recommend, but this one has a new intensity to it that I am in love with.  She can make you feel just as strongly as the characters do.  Her scene development is so strong, at times you feel you can reach out and touch Mackenzie and Tyler.  She doesn’t just entertain you; she takes you on an epic journey that will leave you wanting more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LN5G2AL7YFA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQLAI7Q#wasThisHelpful","R2LN5G2AL7YFA4","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was intrigued by this psychological thriller and can hardly wait to see what is coming next for Greg Dorn.  I think part of my attraction to this story was I can relate to the location that this story takes place.  Parsons Kansas, the small town feel gave what happen to him when he was a teenager more impact as I could feel his loss.  With the town circling him and his father during this loss, it was a natural prediction he would want to give something back to them.Greg’s mother and sister were killed in an accident when a mental patient stole a car and slammed into them.  The devastation and pain were overwhelming for him and he lost his way in life for a while.  It was one day when he saw an officer stop a car for violation he found his passion.  He wanted to be a cop.  He wanted to prevent another teenager from experiencing the same loss that crushed his world.Moving up the ranks, he found he wanted to take his wife and daughter to a bigger city so he could do more to bring order to the streets.  Moving to Denver was going to be a transition on its own, but to see the road rage and aggressive driving was more of a shock.  Slowly his perception began to change, he wasn’t sure what this voice was that continued to tell him how to handle situation.The author leaves us wondering if we are witnessing anger taking a personality of its own in this plot, because Greg has a lot to be angry about as more loss and dealing with people’s rage at cops happens in his life and career, or are we seeing depression come to life?  Could this be a different psychological issue being born right before our eyes?  Slowly he loses himself, what his goals were and dreams.  His wife decides that this isn’t the life she signed up for with him and his world starts crumbling beneath him.  Could he be the cause of what he was trying to prevent in the final pages of the book.The ending isn’t flashing red lights and warnings leaving you hanging on the edge of your seat but it should leave you wanting a lot more regarding what is going on with him.  I really loved this story, the unknown, the questions and watching the path of this man go from happy to torn apart was done with such subtle detail it was impossible for me to identify when he took the next step into insanity.  I did have one problem with the writing style, I felt like repeat phrases, words and meanings were happening to close together and too often but that didn’t take away from the plot that I was following.  It is a quick read that will absorb your attention.  I look forward to see what is coming next in this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YSE4W4HZL02X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAL0SI2#wasThisHelpful","R1YSE4W4HZL02X","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Secrets, love, suspense, heart break and much more is waiting for youbetween the pages of His Angel.  The author will take you on a ride thatwill leave your head spinning by the end of the book.  It is a cliffhangerand WOW what a cliffhanger it is.I found the first half to be a bit slow with getting Abby and Evantogether, but by midway through the book, the slow pace had been forgottenbecause once the author flipped the switch, the action began and thesecrets started to spill.Abby had a twin sister who died when they were in a car accident duringtheir teen years.

Protecting her heart and strugglingto find a reason to look forward to the next day, she agreed to go out withher best friend who just returned from college.  This is where she willmeet the sex God named Evan.Now I can’t go into much detail because I won’t spoil this book for you,but Evan has known Abby for a long time and he has wanted to be her mansince he saw her.  The secrets you will learn, are what kept him from her,but now the road is clear and he can move in to not only love her butprotect her from the danger she will soon face.The ending of the book was unpredictable for me.

We see the angel Abby become more intouch with the demon that has begun to grow in her fueled by the truth shejust learned, revenge, anger and years of pain due to the loss of hersister.Grab your copy now and buckle up for the second book My Demons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ADZ89KT9IP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PC4KSWO#wasThisHelpful","R28ADZ89KT9IP6","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The truth is about to surface for Frankie. When we last left them, Frankie had seen Hayden leave Derek’s home and she instantly jumped to the conclusion that Hayden had found her way in bed with yet another man Frankie was involved with.After going MIA for a while Derek finally found Frankie and was able to learn the truth. With his sexy ways it didn’t take long for him to correct this misunderstanding and leave Frankie very satisfied. While she can’t seem to get rid of Reed, at least now Derek knows more about what happened between them and isn’t too thrilled to know his sister was involved.Marni gave us plenty of steamy passion in this episode and Derek was allowed to go where no other man has gone on Frankie, but this part of the story was pretty much more focused on sex and Frankie figuring out how she felt about the change of plans. Could they really have a relationship along with a business contract?By the end of the book things were getting good. Derek and Hayden might just have what they need to take Randy down, which Derek wants even more now after a visit that caused him more angst than he needed. Hayden confides to Derek about what really happen that night Frankie’s world fell apart and strange text messages alarm Derek enough it might force him to do the unthinkable.This is a very quick read due to the writing style being so smooth and the interest the author creates for the reader. If you haven’t already started this series jump on board now. I think episode four will blow us away with the intensity that has started to build in book 3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS9CJL0W81R9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKJBRZU#wasThisHelpful","RS9CJL0W81R9J","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been waiting for this book since the second I finished Fear Me.  I am all about dark and twisted stories but when an author can add the element of dysfunction in her characters to the point I love them even though I want to hate them, this just makes my experience with the series even better.  I was so emotional after reading Fear You, I had to take a couple of days to gather my thoughts and figure out what I could say about this book that would carry my true feelings.There is no way I can give you a synopsis like review for this book, it would risk spoiling the story for you.  Fear You did pick right up from the end of book one, so make sure you read them in order.  Lake has finally found her courage after being bullied and intimidated for so many years.  Full of questions as to what Keiran has really done and being pushed one final time, she did what she felt was right at the time.  Unfortunately for her, her actions didn’t send him away, it made him more determined to take her over body and soul.  No matter how much she thought she knew him, she was in for a shock as to who this man really is.We found out a lot about Kieran’s past, who he really is behind the mask of evil he wears.  It broke my heart and made loving him much easier for me.  The secrets behind his family members and the reason he can kill so easily was very difficult for me to read.  With each layer that she peeled back, I felt my own emotions become rawer.  I went from not wanting to like him to wanting to save him from the past that tormented him in his sleep and drove him while he was awake.  We also got to see how he really felt about Lake as he was crushing her spirit.This was an intense series to read.  The author reached in and tore my heart out, angered me to the point I wanted to scream and then put me in a situation that I couldn’t talk myself out of caring for these two people.  The secondary characters played just as big of a part in the story as the main ones did.  The balance of events and the style of writing were so smooth and perfect; once you start this series it is difficult to put it down even for a minute.One thing I loved most about this story is that we watched Lake in her transformation and we weren’t even aware that what was happening to her was in a way what had happen to Keiran.  The evil deeds of others, the horrible agendas that were placed on these two created the monster Keiran acted like and the ballsy woman Lake turned into.  The only difference that kept her from going as far into the dark as he did was she had known love in her life.  She had a family structure at one time and an aunt who loved her and nurtured her dreams.  Lake always had hope, Keiran never experienced hope till he met Lake.I am not sure there are strong enough words to express how much I recommend this series to any reader who loves the dark side of life.  I don’t think there is a single emotion B.B. Reid left untouched by the time I turned the final page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM55R257R03G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLP4DC8#wasThisHelpful","R2BM55R257R03G","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh those McKade brothers are at it again and I really love it.  Claiming Lainey is one of my favorites in this series because it touches on the realistic concerns of a ménage relationship and how love can overcome fear.  The author starts the book with Spence, Lainey and Tim being teenagers and we see how Tim’s father was so abusive to Tim.  Lainey and Spence come and save him and it was then that Tim became a McKade by love, not blood or legally.After almost twenty years of being best friends the guys decide it is time to let Lainey know they want her as their mate, but she is terrified this will mean she will have to pick one of them and hurt the other, which she refuses to do.  We watch Lainey as she goes through the process of accepting that she can have it all with both men and with each step of acceptance the author brings another reality to light.Will Spence be fine if she is with Tim alone, will Tim accept if she compliments Spence and not him?  What if they have children, will the man who isn’t the father feel left out.  This wasn’t as easy as the men presented to her, sure they had two years to figure this out and be prepared for society to bash them, but she has had only a few hours.  There is also a new surprise about the signs the Great Spirit leaves mates which warmed my heart and made this story even more precious.In every book of this series the author brings powerful messages of broken people finding the love that has been in front of them since childhood and providing a level of suspense and love that makes the book impossible to put down.  Once again she has a high level of passion this this book that will leave you sitting in front of the fan as our beautiful threesome try to figure out how this will work for all of them.We also get to see more of Rafe and Becca and their struggle with the distance between them and Jake and Claire will have a part of the story.  The Great Spirit knows who should be mates, but the humans are being a bit stubborn and making this more difficult than it needs to be.I have said it before and I will keep repeating it, I love those McKade brothers and the whole family.  Lynnette really proves that family isn’t always created by blood and law, this family is made up with love and loyalty.  Grab this series and fall in love with this family just as I have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X2Z09961V6EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPXWV3G#wasThisHelpful","R2X2Z09961V6EI","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept of this plot was intense and the author sure knows how to display dysfunction at its best.  The author took a woman who was abused and battered as a child and grew into an educated counselor/lawyer who still found herself in abusive relationships. From her current relationship with Liam, which led her to Ronan and a host of other men who had no problem using her, she found some connection with Ronan that she couldn’t turn her back on.  He reminded her of a disturbing story from her past, a person she couldn’t save.Ronan knew from the first few minutes after she entered prison to talk to him as his lawyer, that he could manipulate her and use her for his own agenda. She was hiding secrets from him and that wasn’t good.  Once he realized he could get her to open up to him, she because the perfect tool in his agenda.  He didn’t believe the world “no” was even found in her vocabulary since he knew Liam and the kind of man he was.As the story goes you will encounter crooked law enforcement and city officials, drug deals and runs that will lead to suspense and drama, abuse, betrayal within the group and something that might be considered as a very dysfunctional sort of love.  There are some pretty great criminal scenes here that had me glued to the pages and mystery that left me trying to predict the ending.The author did a great job at displaying one of the most maladjusted relationships that I have read.  So many times I wanted to smack Brooke upside the head and beg her to wake up and get away from these evil men, but she wasn’t going to break her loyalty that I felt was more out of guilt than a moral issue.It is very difficult to give you more than what the synopsis offers because the whole story is full of action packed drama and sex.  It is hard to write a review on White Rabbit without giving spoilers away.  I will say that there are a few issues that I struggled with, such as important events being talked about yet we never had the full story as to what happened.  I also found some consistency issues as things jumped around with no clear path as to the journey of this story or whose POV we were reading.  I am not a huge fan of the Daddy talk, such as she liked being Daddy’s little girl with Ronan but that is my opinion and doesn’t reflect in my rating of the book.I do believe the book could use some work as far as making it read smoother and filling in the gaps, but I based my review on the plot and talent of the author to take crazy and make it into a work of art.  If you love dark, then you will want to give this one a try.  Just be prepared as rape, talk of incest and brutal treatment of people are clearly in this book and since she is a pro in making the words scream to your soul, it does get rather intense while reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PERXI0OZUQN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9PCKQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PERXI0OZUQN7","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finished Without Mercy and honestly, I had to sit for a while to sort out the many emotions that this story brought me.  Words literally have escaped me when I think about how to write this review.  I find it astonishing that this was coauthored because I could never, in a million years, be able to pinpoint who wrote what scene or chapter.  Victoria L. James and L.J. Stock have such similar writing styles yet they each bring something that could only be described as magical to this story.Not only is the writing style impressive, they have a talent of drawing out a huge range of emotions from their readers.  I rarely am brought to tears while reading, it happens but not very often.  In Without Mercy, the authors had me falling apart for different reasons on three occasions.  I was so wrecked during those times I had to put the kindle down and walk away so I could gather myself.  I won’t say what those scenes were, or give any hint as to what occurred because you must experience this book on your own but I found I had gained some valuable lessons from Drew, Ayda and yes even Tate’s journey.Ayda was still adjusting to her new life at the hut with the MC gang.  They had accepted her into the fold, well the whores who were hanging around didn’t like her but the men respected her not only as Drew’s woman but as Ayda herself.  Kenny had taken Tate under his wing and the feeling of being an inexperienced single mom to her younger brother was less of a burden than it had been before.  With not having to worry about paying the bills and keep a roof over their heads, she was now free to keep the hut going, laundry clean and food in the men’s belly’s while she found new ways to try and draw Drew out of his shell.  With all of that going the number one thing she had left to figure out was, is living her dream with Drew really fair to Tate?  Her younger brother was getting sucked farther and farther into the MC mentality and forgetting his dreams of college and high school football.  She had sacrificed so much of her life after her parents died to provide and raise Tate, she isn’t sure if she can sacrifice Drew and the gang in order to keep Tate on the right path.Drew was still leading the charge for revenge of those who were responsible for Pete’s death.  He knew he had done things that would make a normal person sick and haunted with nightmares forever, but to him this was life, his life.  With new threats emerging in town, a dysfunctional relationship with the head of police that could prohibit him from protecting what needs to be protected, he is also faced with the balance of how much does he let Ayda in on club business.  If he isn’t careful he is going to wake up alone one morning and realize his need to protect her is actually what pushed her out the door.It was a stunning turn of events that made all of the pieces fall in place for Drew and Ayda, leading them to find that lost link that had been there all the time, yet hidden due to their own stubbornness. I won’t give any hints, but trust me when I say, those few chapters left me in excruciating heartbreak as I watched them and had no clue how this would end.  You read romance books and they use the word love, but these two authors showed you what love is all about.  That realistic kind of love that comes from so deep in your heart you don’t even recognize yourself any more.  They also showed us about trust and the fine balance that it takes to maintain it.  Acceptance was another message that I gained from this book.  Love and loss is a promise in life, acceptance of that is something you must work to obtain.  They both had to have their own form of acceptance to the new world they have created and how they acquired that was beyond anything I could have imagined.  In conclusion, I think the most heartbreaking part for me was the last page, as their story had come to an end in this chapter of life.  Knowing they will move on and we possibly won’t be there to watch, yes this is a pathetic plea to the authors to not bring this series to an end, was like saying goodbye to a loved one and knowing you might not see them again.  I not only fell in love with Drew and Ayda and the rest of the gang, they became part of my heart that I will carry for a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFFELFFL7OLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1OEN7S#wasThisHelpful","R2YFFELFFL7OLW","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Unworthy Heart is any indication to what we can expect in The Donnellys Series, then we should be in for a lot of enjoyment.  Ryan and Maiya would never be two people anyone would expect to hook up because of the major differences.  With her red hair, tattoos and hang ups from her childhood, there would be no way she would be a good fit for the sexy, clean cut,professional business man Ryan who is a single parent .  But Maiya is a pure example of a phoenix rising from the ashes and making something out of her life.Coming from a childhood full of absent parents, an event that filled her heart with so much guilt that it almost disabled her from moving on.  She was told for many years that she was unworthy of anything good, especially love.  Even with all the odds, she made her way through college and landed a great job in the business world.  She has her own car, apartment and clothing.  The life her mother provided for her when she was a child had no place in the world she created for herself.Ryan was dealing with his brothers and trying to raise his child as he worked with Maiya at the office.  Past relationships have left him broken and let down, but he isn’t willing to give up on love yet.  Something about Maiya intrigued him, made his body ache for her and confused his mind.  How could he introduce this tattooed beauty to his son and family, but how could he resist his heart yearning for her either.  They came together with humorous banter; quick comebacks and sex scenes that will make you blush.  Still even with all the confidence and love Ryan gives her, Maiya can’t believe he would want to stay with her long time, invite her to be the mother to his little one.  Soon this is going to end and she is going to have to brace herself for that moment. It always ends when the guy gets what he wants from her.I read Dorothy’s first book and fell in love with her style and flair that is in every book so far.  She doesn’t embellish her plots to make them sell, she uses the raw, gritty and dark reality of what really happens in life and makes her readers believe in miracles and love once again.  I adore Ryan, his patience for Maiya and constant acceptance and reassurance that he offered her were wonderful, yet he was still human with the quick triggers and pet peeves that would drive him crazy.  Maiya while confident in her job was so insecure in that private world she hides behind her walls.  The moment she let Ryan in and exposes the cause of her guilt was done with such taste and grace from the author it made me feel I was sitting along with them as they talked.

You won’t want to miss out on this remarkable family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2630B70HTOATZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VNK4PLG#wasThisHelpful","R2630B70HTOATZ","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when the author asked me what I thought of this new idea she had.  What would I do if I had been bullied and humiliated in school, to the point I didn’t even want to go on.  If my home life wasn’t what you would call normal and I lived with the depression of loss at home, would I tell the bullies in hopes they would back off?  The biggest question, what if I met one of my bullies after I had become an adult and had a great career…….would I tell them what I thought, would I run away, would I be mature and explain the pain they caused me…….would I fall in love?That is what Sadie is going to have to decide when the years of losing weight, changing her appearance and working her butt off to succeed in her career all comes to a halting stop the moment Matt walks into the conference room for a meeting.  He thinks he recognizes her even after she denies it is her. She tries to convince herself she is nothing like that little girl either on the inside or out, but that little girl constantly reminds her that some things don’t change.Matt was involved in the bullying,  he wasn’t the leader of the abusez, but he knew how it was hurting Sadie.  Now he wants a chance to make it up to her.  Maybe he can help her heal the old hurts, but as he listens to her he realizes she has never had a boyfriend, been kiss, held hands.  All of the things a beautiful woman should have experienced by her age, she hadn’t, all because of the bullying and feelings that she can’t recover from.Will she let Matt be her first in all areas and will he end up saying to be her forever?  I love the message in this story of recovery and forgiveness.  As we know in life you can forgive a person but rebuilding trust is something that rarely happens.  Get your copy now and watch Sadie as she makes the difficult choices regarding self-image, confidence and where Matt will fit in her life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D664QE6EHT3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLLEA3S#wasThisHelpful","R1D664QE6EHT3C","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was honored to be able to beta read this book.  I had fallen in love with Nikki Grooms first two books and her style of writing but she has really grown into an even more brilliant author with the unique story of Finn and Megan.This story isn’t rushed, yet it flows consistently and packed with action and events that will keep you invested and turning those pages.  Megan and Finn both are coming from heart break and disaster, so when they  see each other across a crowded club they know that there is something there, love, passion, hope or escape, it didn’t matter it was better than what they had.  Of course hope doesn’t instantly surface, it is just that, a hope, maybe a dream of escape, either way, they find themselves in an alley giving into a few moments of lust that will open up a ton of wounds that will need to heal.Finn will face a level of loss that could crumble him, if not for the need to care for his mother who is dying, I am not sure Finn would have found a reason to go on.  He had some good friends who cared and helped him but how his sister died will never release his soul from the guilt and pain he feels. Someone is to blame and his anger needs to be released but Megan might not be able to handle his rage.Megan is trying to get away from a drug dealing abusive boyfriend.  She just wants to be free of his behavior and business but she has nowhere to go.  She left her family for him years back and now she isn’t so sure they will take her back. Sure she sees something in Finn that keeps drawing her to him but when he lashes out she is firm that this won’t be accepted in her life again.  How many chances can she take in life before it just becomes to difficult to stand back up?On the occasions Finn and Megan give into the lust and attractions, new bonds are created between them yet neither know if being together is even possible.  One gives the other a chance to love and in their lives, the other is terrified of life and losing another person.  Revenge fuels their soul.  It will take something big or an event to bond them together.  I am not giving hints; you will have to read to find out.I loved how the author wrote this.  It truly came across to the reader as two lost hearts, roaming the streets, passing each other once in a while…….trying to find their meaning in life.  It takes not a chance encounter but a huge shove from fate to make them finally stop and talk.  Watching the characters, slowly emerge from their sheltered cocoon to bloom into mature adults who take risks for love, was a beautiful journey that the author took us on.  Suspense, crime, loss and pain all surrounded by fate, love and value of the human spirit is what you will be exposed to in this beautiful book.  Grab yours now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IJNV51VMYGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0IJZI8#wasThisHelpful","R15IJNV51VMYGR","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a big fan of paranormal or shifter stories but this author asked me to beta read for her and I agreed.  I know how hard she worked on this book to make it unique; she didn’t want to put out a run of the mill story about shifters that is predictable. She wanted a new element to such stories, she wanted to expose the element of empathy and the power it has to build and destroy a person.  Since I was not a huge fan of the genre she challenged herself to write and rewrite this story till I was able to say, I am hooked, give me more.Acer Randall let his family in order to find a way to deal with the “curse” that was handed down through the generations of his family.  He has empathy to the point it cripples him at time, carrying the heavy loads of others emotions as his own has forced him to put the walls up and go forth in the job of enforcer against the powerful warlocks.  He is a fierce defender, one that most are afraid of but he had to keep a constant control of his anger and conduct himself in the role he was assigned.His heart has signaled that Haven is the woman to fulfill his desires but she isn’t as on board with his plan.  While beautiful she is also in a position in life that mixing with Acer could prove disastrous. She does rescue him from a dangerous situation but that was with the promise she would put him to death by her own hands………the question is when the time comes is she able to keep that promise.Make sure you grab your copy of this book now and be prepared for the next installment of Haven and Acer.  I would really recommend this series to others like myself that are just not sure if shifter books are something they could enjoy.  I know the author put a lot of effort into giving those of us a chance to find a shifter that is unique, investing and would give us exposure to a genre that is difficult to write and often ignored.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X3F6PL85HCXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAOTBKE#wasThisHelpful","R2X3F6PL85HCXC","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I fell in love with the McKade family in book one.  There we met all of the brothers and discovered that Deuce McKade was the oldest brother, intent on fathering all of his brothers and taking care of those who couldn’t protect themselves.  This was the situation with 8 year old Grace; she was trying to take care of her little sister Melanie while her abusive parents did their own thing.  Grace fell in love with Deuce way back then and was happy to just be a friend of his in adulthood.  It helped that her little sister married Luke McKade, Deuce’s brother.Now Melanie is about to deliver her second child and knows that there will be issues with the birth.  The girls have a special gift, Melanie can see into the future and Grace has the power to calm children and animals.  Grace’s gift comes with a curse though, most humans that she touches not only causes her pain but she also sends pain to those who she is not meant to touch.  As Deuce and Grace get his ranch house set up for Robby, their nephew and the new baby so Melanie and Luke can focus on her recovery, Deuce decides this is the time to prove to Grace that she is his mate.The McKade family history includes the Great Spirit placing a symbol on the back of the necks for the two who were supposed to be mated.  Deuce knows once he has proven to Grace they were meant to be the symbol will appear and they can focus on having babies and creating a family.  Grace wants Deuce, her doubts about a family comes from the pain she experienced with her gift.  Will she give birth to children who will be isolated and tormented like she was?  She can see her nephew has her sister’s gift, it has to be the same for her, that gift/curse will be passed on to her children.I love how the author has created this family for us to fall in love with.  In this book we get to experience some of the background stories about the other brothers as well.  It wasn’t enough to let us know the whole story but it sure increased my interest in getting on with the rest of this series.  The ladies in their life are not only friends but they fit with the McKade brothers like a glove to a hand.Grab your copy of Touching Deuce and watch this love story unfold into a magical relationship.  With her lust for him that is covered in fear and his alpha protectiveness that sometimes overpowers his love, this is a beautiful story to jump into.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13FJ1N8M212UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWAUNKU#wasThisHelpful","R13FJ1N8M212UZ","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn’t aware that this was part of a series called Independence Fall when I signed up to review this book.  Wild With You can clearly be read as a standalone, but since I fell in love with the characters and the fact that I love series that are set up such as this, where each character has their own book, I will be looking for the rest of this series soon.Brody could easily be the man of my dreams.  He is sexy, handsome and protective.  He has taken on the role of being caregiver for his siblings but his dedication to others goes much farther.  He is also part of a search and rescue team that saves people who have gotten lost or hurt in the wilderness.  With his brother Josh who is suffering from a brain injury and has lost his short term memory, Brody searches for treatment options that will help Josh regain a normal way to function.  Brody will be picking up the doctor who has accepted Josh as a patient for a trial therapy, little did Brody know this was going to be one pick up he would never forget.Dr. Kat Arnold had been raised in Independence Fall as a foster child.  She was ignored as if she had a disease, her possessions would fit in a bag and wasn’t worth the price of a fast food meal and she was lonely.  Her one bright spot of the day was seeing Brody.  He always showed her kindness and compassion, even when it came to fixing her “lucky” pair of shoes with glue.  Coming back to her past wasn’t something she had planned, but here she is with a handbag that cost more than her could have even dreamed existed as a child.  She is replacing the doctor that was supposed come as a favor and the first person she sees once she arrives is Brody, the longtime crush that made everything better. The author created some very hot and steamy scenes that will leave you panting and begging for more, but she also shows you what love really looks like.  Brody is going to have to make a choice of his brother’s future or his heart’s desire for Kat.  Having the woman you love treat your brother’s brain injury as his doctor could get messy.  Kat will be faced with the realization of all the confidence she has gained from her PhD and career as a doctor may not survive going back home to the people who felt you were nothing your whole life. The insecurities that stayed with her through childhood will make a raging comeback if she isn’t careful.  She will also be torn between her oath as a doctor and her passion for Brody.This was a very well written book that read smoothly and quickly.  I found when I had finished the time had just slipped away because I was so drawn into the story.  I will certainly be getting the rest of this series and putting Sara Jane Stone on my list of authors to watch for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FGTXU0R67K7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMG19U0#wasThisHelpful","R1FGTXU0R67K7E","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was reminded once again to never judge a book by the cover alone with this book.  As you see the cover is beautiful, gives the impression of a love story that will sweep you off your feet, but that really isn’t my style. I need angst, drama, really issues that will leave me on the edge of my seat.  What the cover is hiding is one of the most realistic stories that takes you from your comfy chair and places you in a southern town where Southern justice and evil thinking runs the town Monday throughSaturday and they all come together under one church roof on Sunday to worship the Baptist way.  Heads are turned, giggles are heard, sins are abundant and survival of this small town will be the hardest thing you have ever done in your life.No this isn’t a religious book, this is a story of two people who followed the traditions, suffered the blows life had dealt them and found a way to make it through the country muck.  Drew Dunne had a football career lined up when he entered college.  He had suffered loss, heartache and lived with guilt that nearly suffocated him.  Results of bad choices were going to haunt him for years to come, then that one injury, the injury that every athlete prays will never happen, occurs and Drew loses the last piece of sanity he had in life.  Now married to a woman who hates him, blames him for her unhappiness and a father in law that dictates what is going to happen in his baby girl’s life, Drew wonders if ending it all wouldn’t be a better solution than trying to survive it.Allison Bennett found herself married to an evil man who treated her horribly.  When she hears they are moving back to a small Georgia town, she loses everything, even down to the furniture and items that belonged to her Grandmother and family.  Dealing with daily put downs, physical abuse and the demands from her husband, she sees that she needs to be silent because her husband is the new star for the football team in town.  She learned quickly, no one listens to anything negative about the jocks in small town USA.When Drew and Allison see each other in church, they look past the sexy exterior and see the pain and emptiness in each other’s eyes.  With the town against them, spouses who would rather kill them than set them free, their hearts still beat for each other.  This story will take you on a twisted road as we watch them to see if they ever find their freedom and love.  The suspense was intense but what grabbed me more was the realistic dramatic feel to this journey.  I was all over the map with feelings.  I was angry at the injustice that was approved of and supported.  The self-righteous attitude from the town “Christians” was revolting and the lies and secrets that were defended made me want to throw my kindle across the room. Then you had the innocent moments that Drew and Allison could steal with a glass of lemonade, working at a church function or sitting in a pew for Sunday service.  They could communicate without words with only the gentle smile or touch while be scrutinized by everyone around. I haven’t cheered on two people in a book as hard as I did Drew and Allison.  I wanted their happily ever after more than they did at times, but they never gave up even when life was balancing on the edge and we were left wondering if finally evil had won.  I highly recommend this book and will certainly seek more from this author.  Grab your class of sweet tea, put your feet up and be prepared to “Bless your heart” a few times because you will be transported to the country roads and justice of small town Georgia.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDCUW64AUR7IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZO5QCI#wasThisHelpful","RDCUW64AUR7IA","A3BKJYAJCE9GK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKJYAJCE9GK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have sensitive, dry skin and in my opinion rough hangs. I love discovering new, effective hand creams that will make my hands soft. As a result, I did not hesitate to try Ahava’s Dead Sea Essentials Witch Hazel hand cream. And I’m glad I did. This hand cream is wonderful. I love it as much as I do the Ahava’s Tea Tree Oil foot cream. It’s affordable (around $11), which is comparable to other hand creams I have purchased (L’occitane, Eucerin or Neutrogena) and Ahava is a brand that I have grown to trust. It is a pleasant scented creamy blend of ingredients that include witch hazel, which soothes and heals dry skin. The cream is not too thick and doesn’t feel greasy (although initially you may think so, it dries to be almost sightless). Even after washing my hands, they still felt moist. The scent is pleasant and doesn’t linger. And finally for those who are sensitive to parabens or phthalates, this hand cream doesn’t contain any. I give this hand cream, 5 stars. I will definitely buy this product in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JTWPA5K9O9Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPO4T7U#wasThisHelpful","R3JTWPA5K9O9Y1","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually spend Sunday night giving myself a mani/pedi. It is rare that I go to a nail salon. Instead I purchased an Amope Pedi Perfect Electronic Pedicure Foot File, some files and clippers, and a dozen or so fingernail polishes. I usually use (old school) Vaseline to moisturize my heels and feet but am constantly looking for a good foot cream that will leave my feet feeling soft and smooth. So when Vine offered Ahava’s Dead Sea Essential Foot Cream, I jumped all over it. I wasn’t disappointed. DSE foot cream is non-greasy, contains tea tree oil and has a pleasant scent. The cream itself is not too thick, and goes on easily. I have found that it is most effective when your feet are damp. I apply my foot cream immediately following a foot soak or shower/bath. After using this product daily, for over a week, following my shower, I do see visible improvement on my heels. They do not seem to be as dry and are definitely softer. I would definitely recommend it. 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFE7GX4440EZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQBBTLW#wasThisHelpful","RFE7GX4440EZV","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IZZE, Organic Sparkling Water is not what I expected. I knew that it was carbonated water, but I was expecting something sweet like the old Clearly Canadians, especially since the ingredients lists sugar cane. But when they say it is a “hint” of sugar cane, they mean it literally. This water is not sweet, but offers a hint of flavor. I will be honest, this sparkling water reminds me of a more expensive La Croix. I absolutely love the packaging. It is attractive and bold. But the product itself is just ok. If you are a sparkling water person, you will probably love it. I personally preferred the Raspberry Watermelon combination over the others and it must be really cold. This assorted box of 12oz bottles comes in three different flavors: Raspberry Watermelon; Blackberry Pear and Mandarin Lime. Each bottle has 10 calories; 2 carbs, 10mg sodium and 2 grams sugar. The reason for the decrease in stars (i.e., rating) is the price. At twelve bottles for $24, it ends up costing about $2 each. This is expensive if you compare it to other brands on the market. For example, you can get 12, 12 oz cans of La Croix for $12 and not have the sugar, sodium, calories or carbs, for less than you are paying for the 12 bottles of IZZE. Don’t get me wrong, the IZZE bottle is cuter and may make more of a statement…it screams “I just spent some serious money on this water”…but in terms of taste and cost, it isn’t worth it to me. Don’t get me wrong, if I have a nice BBQ and have folks over, I probably would serve these because they are so attractive, but on a regular basis, probably not. 3 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOSQH8A42DHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSW3AQW#wasThisHelpful","R2NOSQH8A42DHJ","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How would I describe this bar?Well, I should begin this review by saying that I am not a huge fan of bars. I know, I know….bars are popular and all the craze. Some people absolutely live by them. And as a result, the market is flooded with bars. There are protein bars, energy bars, fruit bars, granola bars….bars used for meal replacements, healthy bars and even those that curb your appetite. So while not a fan, I decided to try the “Brookside Dark Chocolate Fruit and Nutty Bar” with Blueberry Acai flavor. This product is a chewy bar that has dark chocolate, nuts and fruit. If you traditionally like that combination, you will enjoy it. If you don’t well, you won’t.  Each bar is approximately 180 calories; 9g of fat; 0% cholesterol; 22g Carbs; 55mg Sodium; 4g Protein; 13g Sugar and reasonable amounts of Vitamins, Calcium and Iron. It is gluten free, has fiber, antioxidants and vitamins A, C & E.There are two things that I am not sure about: 1. The taste and 2. The cost.In terms of taste, either you are going to like it or you aren’t. If you love the taste of dark chocolate coupled with a strong blueberry/acai flavor, you will gobble it up. But to me it is a bit overwhelming and lingered on my tongue. The consistency was good. Not too chewy, but not too soft, just right. It isn’t anything that I would just grab with enthusiasm, but it could again be the flavor combination. Now, the cost. There are twelve bars in the box which are going to cost you about $26 (via Amazon), which means that each bar costs over $2. That is kind of expensive, unless you are one of those who are willing to pay top dollar for a fruit bar. But for those of us who are cost conscious, who have large families or simply have teens that snack a lot, this would be a pretty steep investment since you can get a giant box of chewy granola bars (40 +) from your local warehouse for under $12.  So with those two things in mind, I will give these 3 to 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9R5R8HN1Q3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BUDN5W#wasThisHelpful","RL9R5R8HN1Q3A","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is based on feedback from my teenage son. The first thing that I noticed when we opened the Amazon box was how thick these pants were. I knew that they were going to be lined with flannel, but I still didn’t have a concept of just how much. These carpenter pants are attractive (khaki) but definitely made for cool/cold weather. I would even go so far as to say if you are a hunter, camper or participate in a lot of winter sports or activities, these would be perfect. Although we live in Atlanta, and traditionally have mild winters, I am sure that these will be an option once the weather cools off. In terms of style, these pants are a very rugged looking pair of pants and look nice with a number of shirt colors…..either plaid or solid. The material is comfortable and wears well. My son suggests that you wear them with boots or a high-top shoe because of the width of the legs. In his opinion they would not look good with tennis shoes. He also likes that you can wear them with the cuff or without, it is up to you. These pants wash well and if they wrinkle (they are 100% cotton), you can just iron them. Overall, these pants are a steal for under $30. And if you enjoy outside or cold water activities, they are a must have. For price and functionality, 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDE5HHV85L7E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKY2RS6#wasThisHelpful","RDE5HHV85L7E7","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is based on feedback from my teenage son. Simply stated, he loves them. He said that the Wrangler stretch pant is not only attractive, but comfortable. Made from a light weight material (cotton and spandex blend), these pants allow you to move freely. He said that they aren’t too tight or restrictive. He is able to sit behind his desk at school, or run around the school easily. These pants are styled like jeans but can be used as slacks, especially for those events that you want to look dressed up, but not look overly dressed. Meaning they can be casual or dressy, so you have an option. He also likes the fact that these pants fit just right in the crotch…not too long or short. He complains that some of the newer styled jeans either fit like hip huggers or hang low in the crotch. These pants wash well. He didn’t notice any shrinkage or tightness after they were washed. I simply threw them in the washer on the normal cycle and dried them as usual. So there aren’t any special care instructions. And if you take them out of the dryer immediately, they aren’t wrinkled and rarely has he had to iron them. And finally, these pants are not expensive. For under $30, you get a pretty decent pair of versatile pants. He gives them 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK727CQ82BPVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKYEHWU#wasThisHelpful","RK727CQ82BPVD","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For around $14, you get two fantastic mitts (which amounts to about $7 per mitt). They are attractive nautical blue and black. The fingers and thumb of the mitts are covered in a silicone/neoprene material, while the portion from the wrist up is covered with a thick blue quilted material. They appear to be durable and well made. (Of course I will update this review if something changes). They are unisex, so anyone can use them. However, I believe they fit better on a person with smaller to medium hands. My husband could put them on, but said they could be could be bigger. They are machine washable. And in terms of drying, you can simply throw them in the dryer on a light setting (so it won’t get misshapen) or air dry them. When I use these mitts to remove things from the oven, I am not able to feel the heat. My hands feel protected, which is the whole point. Finally, these mitts would definitely be a welcomed addition to most kitchens. You can even give them (with a gift card) as a bridal shower gift or as a stocking stuffer.

"Thrive is a brand/company that cares about the health of your skin and so much more. This company is environmentally and socially conscious. They are dedicated to restoring the land and giving back to the community by supporting local farmers and workers. Thrive is natural, hypo-allergenic and cruelty free. For those consumers who have sensitive skin, this is a product that I think you should try. I have not noticed any irritation, dryness or blemishs while using it. This face wash is free of everything….free of paraben, formaldehyde, ammonium, and PABA (para-aminobenzoc acid). The two ingredients that form the basis of the scent and yield the restorative properties of Thrive are Fierrilo and Juanilama. Both can be found in Costa Rica. Fierrillo is a vine that has anti-inflammatory properties and Juanilama (in the mint family) is a potent antioxidant with healing/restorative properties. The scent is pleasant enough and would remind you of cloves (i.e., those black things that my grandmother use to put in the Christmas ham). This may be a slightly confusing description, of the scent, but I think it is accurate. Note, while it may seem a little overwhelming/loud at first, it dies down once you rinse and the scent doesn’t linger. In terms of the container, this 3.38 ounce container…is attractive (I really like the logo, a bold red feather) and fits anywhere…on the counter or in the shower.  The translucent gel is easy to use/manage….you simply squeeze a little more than a pea size amount, add water and lather. I use my fingers versus a cloth and simply rub the mixture on your face. It goes on smoothly, doesn’t leave the skin feeling oily and leaves no residue.  And if you would like to exfoliate, you may want to use a face brush or a washcloth by rubbing it in a circular motion before rinsing well.  I would definitely purchase other products on this line, and am considering purchasing the beard oil for my husband. With that being said, I would definitely recommend this product. Overall, I give it 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259MJFIRECVZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJB95X8#wasThisHelpful","R259MJFIRECVZ1","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Musician Julia Ansdell stumbles across a beautiful piece of handwritten sheet music while traveling in Rome. On the spot, she decides that she must own the captivating music, seeing it as a challenge to master its complicated rhythm. However, once she returns to America, she realizes that the notes that haunt her compel her young daughter to act bizarrely, even violently. Julia’s only hope is to determine the origin of the music and hence the culmination of the rest of the story.Tess Gerritsen, the writer of the Rizzoli & Isles series, offers something a little different in this haunting tale. “Playing with Fire” flips back and forth between present day (Julia) and the past (to a talented musician named Lorenzo). Departing from her normal style, Gerritsen allows the reader to see the events leading to WWII, and the atrocities against the Jews through the eyes of Lorenzo.While haunting, this story moved a little slow to me. After the powerful …or intriguing might be a better word, beginning, I found myself struggling to get through it and I am not sure why.

"I have used Goody powder for years. I personally tend to buy the flavored ones because they do not leave the bitter flavor that the non-flavored ones do. In the past, I have tried the cool orange flavor, but after trying these, they are a definite “go to” if the orange ones aren’t available. One packet with a coke knocks any pain out.Taste/Flavor. The taste isn’t bad. The fruit flavor does cover some of the bitter taste that can accompany powdered acetaminophen.Convenience. There are 24 individual packets that are extremely convenient. They slip in your pocket, wallet, bag or purse. There are no large pills or pill bottles.  You could leave some at work in your desk, and strategically place them around the home.Effectiveness. To me, these powders work faster than pills. I have found that the powder formula hits the system faster, especially if you compound it by drinking a soda that has caffeine in it too (i.e., Coke or Pepsi).  I also think that it is the combination of caffeine, aspirin and acetaminophen that form this product that make it effective.Price. Amazon offers these powders at the same price as most drug stores (under $7).I know what you are wondering, since it seems that I like this product, why didn’t I give it 5 stars? Well, I took off half a star for two reasons: 1: Just like the other Goody’s, these packets can be difficult to open. Perhaps they are trying to prevent kids from getting into them, but for us “adults” who have a headache, attempting to rip these open quickly is not always easy. 2. There is still a slight “bite” or bitter after-taste once you take it, which is probably why I don’t take them with water. It isn’t horrible, but I think the orange flavored ones cover the taste more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOX3OVYEZ409/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEMPFWC#wasThisHelpful","R1NOX3OVYEZ409","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Shelby is still reeling from her husband Richard’s sudden death when she finds out that he wasn’t what she believed him to be. Not only did he have secrets, but he was he a liar, a swindler, and left her in crippling debt.  Faced with no real options and a young child (Callie) to raise, she decides to return hometown, to her roots in the mountains of Tennessee. Determined to stand on her own two feet, Shelby returns to small town living and faces those from her past.  Griff is a local contractor who recently moved to Rendezvous Ridge. The minute he sees “the sad eyed” Shelby, and her beguiling red-headed daughter (Callie), he falls in love. While Griff likes projects, he knows that any pressure he gives will make Shelby run, so his plan is to be patient and wait for her to catch up. Meanwhile, while Shelby is learning to trust again and rebuild her life, Richard’s past seems to have followed her to Rendezvous Ridge. There have been a string of break-ins, thefts and a few deaths. While the two find love, they must also solve the mystery of who and what Richard was.I enjoyed “The Liar”, and while some may say that there is nothing new or original about this story, I would suggest that there was that familiar and pleasant a NR formula that holds true. Guess what “The Liar” had it. You had romance, some mystery and a pretty satisfying conclusion. Overall, I would give this story 4 stars and recommend it to Roberts’ fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXU88VGH2A2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170863#wasThisHelpful","R1BXU88VGH2A2S","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The benefits of purchasing the Mead Five Star 2015-2016 (August to July) planner are:1. The size is perfect. It fits well in a large purse or backpack.2. The thick plastic cover is attractive and seems to be durable.3. This is the perfect tool for a student (or non-student) to get organized.4. It covers a school year….August 2015 thru July 2016. It is divided by the month, which is on two facing pages. Following each month is a daily option with bullets for you to write events or tasks.5. Scattered throughout the planner are other items that are beneficial for students: proofreading symbols; conversions; the states and their capitals; spelling tips; maps; dates to remember and holidays.The cons of purchasing this planner:1. It is kind of expensive ($18) for what you get.  I think someone in the market for a planner can find one that has more features (i.e., times, scratch paper, etc.) or that is just as good, if not better for less.2. This planner would have been superior if there had been times that corresponded with the daily section. That is a feature that I normally look for in a planner, and is a feature that I think would appeal to some consumers…although you can write in the times of the events by the bullets.In conclusion, while this planner is aesthetically pleasing to the eye, it is nothing special and in my humble opinion does not warrant the $18 asking price. Therefore, I can only give it 3 to 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTG9KWYF9REMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCF9FV8#wasThisHelpful","RTG9KWYF9REMP","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this laptop. It is versatile and has tons of features that make this a great purchase.1. It has a large easy to read screen (about 17”). Wonderful for watching movies or surfing.2. It has the regular features of a laptop but the added feature of being touch sensitive. Therefore, you can navigate between screens and tasks by using your fingers.3. The keyboard is located in the center of the laptop but is surrounded by a rubbery filling casing that allows the palms of your hand to comfortably rest while typing.4. You can use either the mouse or the touch feature.5. This computer has several USB ports, an Ethernet, hdmi, SD card, and DVD/CD drive.6. A nice long cord for charging.7. This laptop is large enough for a dorm room or home office.8. It has a built in camera.9. The keyboard lights up when you are typing which helps if you are working in dim light. (Ok, now I am telling my age.)10. It comes preloaded with Windows 8.1 and a free upgrade to Windows 10 when it is available.11. The battery life is decent.12. You can decide how you’d like to sign-in on the laptop, either a password or face recognition.13. This laptop is comparably priced to others on the market and has the touch screen feature.The only warning that I will give anyone considering purchasing this laptop is the size. It is large (which is great to use at home or in a dorm room), but a little too large and heavy (5 to 7 lbs) to be portable or carry around…..unless you have great arm strength or a large backpack.Overall, this product warrants 5 stars and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a great laptop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19GXF1M1DS5MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQXZV1Q#wasThisHelpful","R19GXF1M1DS5MN","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For under $50, a groom could purchase this portable iHome speaker for his groomsmen. Of course there are other occasions that you could purchase this item, but that is what came to mind when I first saw the masculine design. It's cute and the sound quality isn't bad. There are some other benefits to buying this item. This speaker is portable, about the size of an actual flask. It fits in my hand easily. It is Bluetooth enabled or you can attach a cord and play your music. I was able to connect both my phone (android) and ipod easily.

"The 5 Star 5 Subject Mead Spiral Notebook is perfect for those anal retentive people who thrive on organization. You have a quality product by a trusted brand. The notebook is durable and attractive.Description of the product: a traditional 5 subject spiral notebook with a few exceptions. (1) The cover is colorful and made of a durable plastic (versus the traditional paper), which means you can wipe it off and hopefully it will last longer than its paper counterpart. The notebooks come in an array of colors, which should suit most. And I would even say that if you wanted to, you could decorate the cover making it uniquely yours.  (2) The subjects are divided into 5 sections by colorful tab pocket folders, that are…..expandable and moveable. You can use a sharpie or other marker to label the tabs. (3) The paper is quality and college ruled paper, which I prefer because I think it forces me to write concisely and neatly. (4) There is a pen holder on the front of the outside of the notebook and a small fabric cover over the spirals.I could only find one potential issue with purchasing this product. This Advance Mead Product costs a little under $20, which is expensive for a school supply for the average consumer. However, I think this might be worth it if you have a special project for school (i.e., preparing for graduation for high school or college, preparation for the SAT, the ACT, the LSAT, MCAT, writing a thesis, project, etc.) or if you are a really dedicated student. I can also see a person in the working world using this as a tool to stay organized. Overall, I can already see the benefits of owning at least one of these notebooks. I plan to organize my son’s senior year in it….it will include, everything from upcoming dates and deadlines, as well as lists of things to do, party planning, entertainment, trips and menus, etc. I think it will be invaluable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S30CEZ0SN5W0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7X2QQI#wasThisHelpful","R3S30CEZ0SN5W0","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chelsea Cain is a talented writer. Her writing style is effortless and captivating. She has the ability to pull you into a world that is both disturbing and tantalizing. I for one really enjoyed the nuances of the Archie/Gretchen chronicles….the story of a serial killer and her hunter. That series invoked so many different emotions that I found myself conflicted, upset and yet spellbound. In my opinion, an author who can bring out so many emotions in the reader, has to be talented. So when “One Kick” was released, I didn’t hesitate to download it to my kindle. I knew that reading another Cain novel would mean exploring the mind of the disturbed and a world filled with violence and depravity. I wasn’t wrong. First, I will explain why I found this story to be more disturbing than other Cain novels. In my mind, there is a clear difference between adult victims and children. Yes, I know it is a fine line, but in the Archie/Gretchen chronicles, you understand that at the heart of it they were consenting adults. One was supposedly in a position of power and the other was beautiful but pure evil. You knew that they made the choices that they made willingly. BUT that is where “One Kick” differs. In this story, Cain gives us a glimpse into the mind of child abductors, their victims and those that hunt those that prey. This time the story revolved around the helpless….kids versus adults. Kids who clearly did not have a voice in what happened to them, or who didn’t have the ability to make certain decisions.Kick Lannigan is a survivor. Having been abducted as a child, forced into child pornography and “accidentally rescued”, she is determined not to be victimized again. Kick had been abducted while looking for her puppy, and was being held by Mel and his consenting wife. Five years after the abduction, she was discovered by accident during a collateral investigation spearheaded by a dedicated FBI Agent, Frank. The FBI didn’t even know “little” Kick was there until they saw her and destroying evidence of a pretty horrific crime. Discovering her changed a lot of things for all parties involved. Mel was jailed and his wife committed suicide. Eventually testifying against her capture, she is responsible for imprisoning a man who was part of a larger child pornography ring. Fast forward several years and we see the survivor Kick, who has become obsessed with self-defense and rescuing/locating missing kids. She is now a weapons expert, proficient in hand-to-hand combat, and emancipated from her mother (who was willing to cash in on her new found celebrity) and living a very life solitary life with the exception of her “play” brother (James, a fellow abductee) and her sweet old dog, Monster. So when she is approached by a mysterious man (Bishop) and asked to help in a child abduction case, she believes that she can make a difference and finds herself on the trail of a child abductor, possibly one who was involved in her own abduction. All she needs to do is contact her jailed abductor (Mel) and ask for help to find children that are missing. He could hold the key to their survival. Faced with bombs, dead children, and a mysterious foe, the Bishop and Kick work together to locate those that deserve to be saved and bring down an evil network.What I found to be the most compelling was Cain’s voice as the survivor “Kick”. While she may vacillate between being a survivor and a warrior, I had to remember underneath it all, Kick is a victim, and her response to certain things made sense. (SPOILER) I could understand why Kick hid scrabble tiles in her hiding spots and I could also see why she ran to destroy evidence after being prompted by Mel, I could even understand how a young child, who on some level realizes that she is being abused, could form some kind of bond with her capture, but I struggled with her decision to save his life. On the other hand, I did understand Bishop’s mysterious actions and reactions. However, in the end, it was the subject matter that I found to be so disturbing and found myself struggling just to get through the story. It was not necessarily what I read, but the sheer ramifications of what it all meant. In my mind, Kick while partially healed would always be flawed and broken. No matter what she does or who she tries to save, there would always be a certain sadness, a vulnerability, a loss of innocence that she will always have. But she is the perfect protagonist in that every day that she works to be normal, is a testament to her triumph over evil. As the two explore the dynamics of their relationship (both working and personal), they fight to locate those believed lost and abused. So in the end, we have a truth revealed, a dead bad guy, hurt good guys and injured “not too sure which side they are on” guys and a somewhat uplifting story. But we also have a lot of questions about Bishop (although he gave us a little glimpse into his past) and who he works for. Why do they (Trident) have an interest in keeping Mel alive or Kick involved? Overall, I would give “One Kick” 3.5 to 4 stars. Although disturbing, I thought it was a thought provoking read.  And I probably would read the upcoming sequel, if for no other reason than to discover the truth behind Bishop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ7W9O60AT4EM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476749876#wasThisHelpful","RJ7W9O60AT4EM","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In true James Patterson & Michael  Ledwidge fashion “Burn” is unrealistic but extremely entertaining. Lovers of the Michael Bennett series will appreciate this installation in the series. It’s the usual: various crimes that seem unrelated, a sprinkling of personal issues for Bennett, an introduction of new characters and new investigations, and some pretty gruesome deaths. While this isn’t the most realistic story, or the most accurate …in terms of police protocol or investigative practices…it was fast paced and entertaining.As far as the main storyline, here it is in a nutshell. On the personal front, Bennett is still juggling a ton of kids, especially after his beloved nanny (Mary Catherine) has to return home to care for her ill mother. His can’t really find time for a love life since it always seems to be affected by either his job or some personal crisis. He’s worried about his feisty grandfather who suddenly becomes ill, and the return of the biological father of one of his adopted kids (Chrissy) who has suddenly decided that he wants to be a father. On the professional front: Bennett is being punished (by a rival) and tasked with supervising a rag-tag group of misfit cops (The Outreach Squad in Harlem), each of who has their own set of issues, and failure to do so could mean the end of his career.  To complicate matters, he receives information about a disturbing crime (a possible cannibal club in the NY area), which sadly leads to the death of one of his detectives. And finally, in order to return to Major Crimes, he must arrest some pretty savvy jewel thieves who have been hitting the diamond district.Overall, I give this story a 2.5. I have the usual complaints (that I have about the Patterson collaborations), but again I decided to read this one (like the others) because it offers a few hours of escape. The normal Patterson formula is ever present…..you know those short, easy to digest chapters….each ending with a small cliffhanger or a pregnant pause. But for me, there were too many dangling storylines at the end. Ok, I can live with the eventual (all be it forced) connection between the jewel thieves and the cannibals, but what about the other stuff? There was some attempt to really develop some strong characters (in the Outreach Team), but then nothing. It is kind of hard to explain, but you wonder why after molding this team, making these friendships, and really making a difference (which his character always strives to do), would he just return to Major Crimes? It seems like this would be his opportunity to really make a difference and develop these officers into great detectives….hence destroying his arch nemesis, Starkie. In terms of plot, once the connection was made between the jewel thieves and the cannibals, I groaned because it seemed a little forced. And then the conclusion or should I say cliffhanger (one of the cannibals escapes in an SUV with several bodyguards), I found myself puzzled.  And instead of something to wrap it all up, which again is a Patterson/Ledwidge tradition, we see Bennett finally visiting Mary Catherine. The Bennett I know would have never rested until he identified his man and brought him to justice. I mean I’m all about a little romance, but can we stay focused on finding the escaped bad guy? Of course, maybe the next story will fill in the blanks, but I would have liked a little more closure. Regardless, if you want a mindless read…this is perfect. But don’t be disappointed by the lack of depth in the plot or in the characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XO6F5ODFW2O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455515876#wasThisHelpful","R1XO6F5ODFW2O4","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ginger Dysart is suffering from a broken heart. Over the last year, her marriage to a wanna-be rock star failed and her infant son died from SIDS. Looking for a fresh start and wanting to heal, Ginger moves to Thunder Point and starts working in a flower shop. Matt Lacoumette, a part-time professor/farmer, has turned to the bottle, still reeling from a stunning betrayal from someone who’d sworn to love him. When the two meet at a wedding, fate pushes them together and they soon find themselves falling in love. However, Ginger is reluctant to continue a relationship with someone so filled with hurt and rage. Instead she wants Matt to forgive the person that has wronged him, learn to trust again, as not to bring those feelings into a new relationship, which would kill their budding future.Overall, this was an easy to read novel. However, I was at a disadvantage because I hadn’t read any other novels in the Thunder Point series. I am sure that Robyn Carr intended this to be a stand along novel, but clearly there were storylines developed in previous books. As a result, some of the intuitive things about the story confused me, which made some of the storylines seem forced or underdeveloped. There were also times that some of the characters seemed overwhelming, irritating or over the top. For example, there were times that Matt seemed too broodish, too stubborn, even though I agree he had been wronged but still …pull… it…together. Meanwhile, Ginger seemed a little too forgiving….I mean forgive, but don’t forget…in other words, why bend to meet with an ex-husband who clearly didn’t give a darn about you or his deceased son, only to say that you were the better person? And then there were certain other characters whose storylines, I am assuming, were explained in previous novels or will be explained in future ones. These just seemed to be thrown in there. Perhaps if I was familiar with this series, I would have really enjoyed this story a lot more than I did. Regardless, I would give this book a 2.5 to 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T9VYFWK0NGJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317870#wasThisHelpful","R2T9VYFWK0NGJQ","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What better than to enjoy the floral scent of Pre de Provence Shea Enriched Soap (Rose de Mai) while lathering in the shower. This soap lathers well and exfoliates the skin, leaving your body feeling fresh and clean. The bar is attractive. It is a pink/ lavender rectangular bar of soap with what appears to be small crushed pressed flowers. While some may find the scent to be (initially) overwhelming, once rinsed and dried, the smell dies down and leaves a pleasant aroma. It doesn’t dry the skin, or leave your body feeling greasy or irritated (which is important since most of my family has sensitive skin). The size is convenient, especially for those who like to travel. It is versatile. You can use it in the bathroom or the kitchen, although the bathroom was my preference. And finally, the bar, while some would consider a luxury, is not over-priced or overly expensive (under $7), especially if you compare it with soaps that you can buy in other specialty stores like Victoria Secret, Body Store or L’Occitane. So for the cost, for the benefits, you get a pretty decent bar of soap. 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A425OLMFB817/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVNYIFW#wasThisHelpful","R3A425OLMFB817","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Whenever I think of anything ""Celtic"", especially when it comes to jewelry...I think of intricate weavings that are inspired by romance (preferably a Highlander), symbolize strength and are reminiscent of either Ireland or Scotland. These earrings are no exception.  Simply wearing these earrings will make you feel romantic and whimsical.There are several reasons to purchase the ""Sterling Silver Celtic Tree of Life Round Dangle Earrings"": (1) The size and weight. These earrings are about the size of a penny and extremely light. They don't pull on your ears or stretch the holes. (2) They are aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Simply put, they look great, even better in person than the picture. They don't look cheap and the average person would think that you paid more than you did. While the stone is very small (which I think is best so that it doesn't take away from them), they are the perfect size and don't overwhelm the design. (3) The cost. For under $20, you will get a pretty decent pair of earrings (I have sensitive skin and it has not irritated my ears or my neck where it might touch), and for under $20 you can get the matching pendant [thru Amazon].Why then (if these earrings are so great), do I only give them a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Well, the posts/hooks are a little large. While they allow the earrings to dangle, they sit far away from the head. [The end of the hook may touch your neck slightly. You might have to bend them in a little.] I personally would not have designed them to be as wide. But overall, I think these are a great bargain, look great and would be a nice addition to your own jewelry collection or to give as a gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283FHLJQV5RP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEZ87TI#wasThisHelpful","R283FHLJQV5RP","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lieutenant Eve Dallas has an admirer, or shall we say a devoted friend who is willing to do whatever it takes to get her attention. For starters, they are willing do those things that Eve isn’t allowed to legally do, like kill those who have escaped or perverted justice.  And all Eve needs to do in return is acknowledge the killer. So the first killed is Eve’s nemesis, a  savvy defense attorney who Eve has faced in court and the next is a junkie that Eve once tangled with. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning of a crime spree.  As the killer changes focus and targets those people that Eve loves, she becomes more determined than ever to unmask the killer before the ball drops (New Year’s Eve is fast approaching).  From the cryptic messages left at the crime scenes to close encounters with a killer, Eve must follow the clues to a startling conclusion…the killer is closer than they even realize.I love the “In Death” series and this was no exception. After over 40 books and or short stories, we have seen the evolution of Eve Dallas from the loner/career driven Homicide Lieutenant to a softer/kinder/gentler Homicide Lieutenant. While Eve is still not “overly lovey dovey”, seeing those times that her shell cracks (with Bella and Peabody), makes you smile. Not to mention her relationship with Roarke is better than ever, and her relationship with her friends and co-workers is constantly evolving. JD Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) doesn’t ever disappoint. And I for one, as a devoted fan, can’t wait to read the next one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VPE7O7A8JVGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170871#wasThisHelpful","R3VPE7O7A8JVGY","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Personally, I have always loved the look of Zoysia. My aunt who lived in Florida swears by it.  There is nothing like a lush yard of green grass.Traditionally Zoysia is plush, yet it is a tough, durable grass that requires very little maintenance. I live in Georgia and have a rather large yard, almost an acre. I thought that the perfect solution for some of the bald/bare spots in my yard would be to try Scotts Turf Builder Zoysia Grass Seed & Mulch. I scratched the bare ground lightly with a rake, and spread liberally with a spreader and by hand (depending on the size of the area). I also placed this mixture in small planter cups in the hope of growing plugs. Even with tons of rain (for some reason Georgia is experiencing a large number of April showers), I have yet to see a sprout (in either the trays or on the ground). I even took into account that I have two dogs that may be trampling the tender new growth, but still nothing. It has been approximately 3 weeks since I planted the seeds and still nothing.The pros:1. The price offered thru Amazon ($32) is cheaper than some places that I have seen it. I have seen it in stores for over $45.2. It spreads well.The cons:1. I have yet to see a sprout either in the trays or on the ground.In conclusion, I think if I could get it to grow, I would love it. But that is also the reason that this product only gets 1 star.

While these are recommended for dogs between 5 and 10lbs, my Australian Cattle dog has nabbed a few. While we mere mortals may not find these ....shall we say tasty, the doggies love them. In conclusion, even though these greenies are a bit pricey ($35 dollars + shipping if you don't have Prime), they are well worth it. And if you compare these (via Amazon), to those sold in your local pet store (Petsmart or Petco) or retail store (Target or Walmart), they are comparable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WTP9ZZNXWDXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7R7FDW#wasThisHelpful","R2WTP9ZZNXWDXS","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am sure that I am not the only parent who has found themselves stressing out about college entrance exams (i.e., SAT or ACT). I have paid for classes and purchased a ton of books to help my son prepare. The ""SAT Premier 2015-1016"" prep book is the perfect tool. It includes several tests; a CD with proven strategies to score higher;  test taking strategies; and offers online (and mobile) training tools and aids. There are hundreds of practice questions in every subject ......math, critical reading, and even writing examples for the essay portion of the exam. So for a small investment, you have a decent prep tool. However, like other tools granted most students, they are only as good as a motivated student. Only time will tell if his score improves (he is scheduled to take the test before summer), but if his score does not improve it won't be because he wasn't provided an additional tool to prepare. ","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWEACPPCHY8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625231598#wasThisHelpful","R2GWEACPPCHY8N","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know very little about Nick Cannon. There are three exceptions... I know that he was married to the pop star, Mariah Carey; was a host of a TV talent show (America's Got Talent); and is an entertainer. What I didn't know was that he was a decent writer/poet. Overall, I definitely think that Cannon's book ""Neon Aliens Ate My Homework"" will appeal to some teens. Those who look to pop culture to express themselves, or really appreciate urban culture will gobble this short book up. There are tons of musings on subjects that every young person can relate to. Over 137 pages, Cannon covers everything from bullying to a young boy's desire to fill his father's shoes. They speak of loving yourself, to knowing your self worth and being kind to others. There are sentimental poems (Remembering Shel & Daddy's Shoes); humorous poems (Funky Feet, Halitosis or Farts & Burps); and ironic ones (Pink Lunch Lady & Haters). They are introspective  and engaging. Accompanying each poem are black and white illustrations. Some are extremely detailed and others whimsical. Yes, Cannon does illustrate a few himself and they remind me of Mindcraft....but the others are talented street artists, from different backgrounds, who express themselves through art.While not always rhyming, there is something almost musical about Cannon's poems. I definitely can see the hip-hop influence, and honestly believe that a few will touch certain reader's hearts and souls. ","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QYANUL14QKM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545722810#wasThisHelpful","R3QYANUL14QKM9","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something amiss in the town of Stratus...supernatural occurrences are abound. The dark Prince is determined to get two of its residents, Brielle and her boyfriend, Jake, at any cost. He is even willing to restore the sight of a fallen angel, Damien, to get them. You see, Brielle, not only wears a halo around her wrist, but she can see through the celestial veil, which is an invaluable gift to have. And Jake, well he can heal people with his bare hands. Controlling their powers would be a game changer (literally change the tide of the war between good and evil), so he is pulling out all the stops. And to complicate matters, Brielle is having nightmares, worried about her father (who appears to be drinking again and dating a woman who literally makes her stomach crawl), still struggling with her mother's death, and she's worried about Jake because he appears to be keeping a secret. She simply needs to have faith and believe in something and someone bigger than herself.This was my first Shannon Dittemore novel and I enjoyed it. I am intrigued enough to get the first and next books in the series. This story had everything that you need to have an entertaining read. The story definitely has some religious overtones (sometimes it was heavier than others), but there are epic battles between good and evil, and some teenage angst thrown in for good measure.

"Personally, I like the Head & Shoulders, Instant Relief Scalp Soother for the following reasons:1. Head & Shoulders is a shampoo that my family uses for dry scalp or following wrestling meets as a cleanser, so this is a product that I trust and use.2. The gel is perfect for instant relief of itching and dry scalp.3. The gel is clear and non-greasy. While the packaging says that it was non-greasy, I thought that even using small amounts over time would leave my hair looking greasy or heavy, which would in turn mean that I had to wash it more often. It didn't, and I was pleasantly surprised.4. It doesn't smell bad or loud. There is a vague scent, of tea tree or mint. Once placed on the affected area, the smell doesn't didn't last. I could not smell the product hours later or once it dried, so you don't have to worry about people inquiring about it.5. I like the pump bottle. It allows you to either squirt the gel onto your finger or directly onto the scalp. This also allows you to control the amount of the product you use.6. It did help with flaking on the scalp, leaving the area looking clean.7. And finally, price wise it isn't bad. If you have a problem with dry, itchy scalp, a product for under $7 that offers some relief might just be a product that you wouldn't mind investing in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29LVSBM3LR32F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP2005Y#wasThisHelpful","R29LVSBM3LR32F","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been three years since mixed martial artist fighter, Cannon ""The Saint"" Colter, has seen Yvette Sweeny. While he fought hard to resist her in the past (because of her age), now that they have been thrown together (to settle her grandfather's estate), he doesn't see the need to fight the attraction now. She's all grown up. The only problem, she is still traumatized from an incident that happened years prior, one that Cannon had to rescue her from. And it is understandable, who wouldn't be traumatized after being doused in gasoline and forced to watch a woman be assaulted by a group of bad guys. With that in mind, he is willing to be patient, and seduce her slowly. If anything, his training has taught him patience, and anything worth having is worth fighting for. As the relationship develops between the two, they find themselves in one dangerous situation after another and soon we come to realize that there are forces trying to tear them apart.  Will their love conquer all? Will Yvette find her happy ever after with the sexy fighter Cannon?There were several things that I liked about the story. (1) It was familiar. I have read the story that included the tragic events involving Yvette and Cannon, and I was glad to know the outcome of their story. (2) I enjoyed the other characters in the story and look forward to seeing how they evolve in the series. I definitely can't wait to read Merissa (Rissy, Cannon's sister) and Armie (Cannon's best friend) story because they are destined to be a great couple. And (3) the story is easy to follow. Foster has a formula for her novels that is sure to please most romance/mystery fans. There is a decent story + romance or a forbidden relationship + intrigue and danger and wonderful characters, all of which results in a pretty decent story, which are ideal to read while on short vacations or trips.Now the things that I wasn't wild about but willing to struggle thru in order to see the outcome. (1) Cannon was a little corny. While he was dashing and considerate most of the time, there was some dialogue that was super dumb. I can't put my finger on it, but there were some statements that just didn't ring true. (2) There were some things about Yvette, that didn't ring true as well. Again I couldn't put my finger on it, but some of their discussion or her reactions seemed a little off. Regardless, in the end I was somewhat satisfied but thought that these concerns warranted a star deduction.Therefore overall, while a little predictable in parts, ""No Limits"" was an entertaining read. You have romance, danger and excitement. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OYWIHPHL7WKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373779046#wasThisHelpful","R2OYWIHPHL7WKM","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Michael Connelly is a very talented writer. He has two series that I am familiar with......Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller (the Lincoln Lawyer). You can always count on two things with a Connelly story: (1) a nicely developed mystery and (2) a decent backstory for some engaging characters. So, when I saw that Bosch was going to be an Amazon series, I was thrilled. At the very least, I knew that it would provide a few hours of entertainment. Guess what, I wasn't disappointed. While you may find that episode 1 moves a little slowly, there is a gradual building of tension and suspense that will compel you to watch the entire series in one sitting. This weekend I was able to binge watched all 10 episodes, and while not as raw/gritty as True Detective (which I loved), and not as edgy as Banshee (which I love), it still ranks pretty high in my mind as great television.Titus Welliver is perfect as Harry Bosch.  He embodies the essence of the no-non-sense homicide detective who has a keen eye to detail (doesn't accept the quick and easy), is deeply flawed, but clearly dedicated to the truth and justice. The opening episode finds him not exactly following police procedure and chasing (without calling for backup) a murder suspect. Soon we find him fighting for his career as he is being sued civilly (the department has cleared him) for using deadly force against a suspect. While awaiting the verdict, he responds to the scene of some skeletal remains that were discovered by a dog. Needing something to take his mind off of his troubles, he tasks himself with discovering who is responsible for the death of a young child killed several years prior (cold case). Meanwhile, a serial killer has been arrested, and seems to have become fixated on Bosch, and inserts himself into the bones investigation.As Bosch awaits his fate, the investigations come together in only a way that Connelly can orchestrate. And to complicate matters, Bosch's personal and professional lives are clashing. So while trying to solve a very old case (that involves incest, jealousy and abuse); stay one step ahead of a serial killer; try to reconnect with his teenage daughter; have a personal relationship with a fellow cop; deal with unscrupulous co-workers; he must also learn to navigate departmental politics while maintaining his integrity and adhering to his strong sense of justice.  As the credits of Episode 10 roll, I prepare myself for another season. Hopefully it's a hit, will be renewed, and I will be able to binge watch Season 2. I give it 4.5 to 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O6DIWE27Z23S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3MMLHC#wasThisHelpful","R2O6DIWE27Z23S","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a true Nora Roberts fan, I can say while not totally original and slightly anticlimactic the final book in the Cousin O'Dwyer trilogy was enjoyable. There was nothing really new and original, but there is always something about finishing a Roberts book that is satisfying to the soul. There are a few things that you know from the onset...... Nora Roberts is going to follow her tried and true formula that always works well for her supernatural or paranormal stories....i.e., good will always overcome evil or the light will overcome the dark. Of course there will be some romance and loving among the characters. Usually pairings, by three (in her trilogies), with a little angst thrown in for good measure. Dark Magick is no different. I won't really rehash the storyline, as a ton of others already have, but I will brush over what my thoughts are. Branna and Fin were destined to be together. We saw it coming from book #1. Branna refuses to allow Fin (her true soul mate) into her heart because he bears a symbol of evil and her most trusted enemy, Cabhan. Cabhan is an evil sorcerer who has been trying to take ""the three's"" (Iona, Branna and Connor) magic in the hope of becoming all powerful. Typical bad guy musings. And don't get me wrong, I understand she has vowed to destroy Cabhan (along with her brother and cousin) to right a wrong from long ago, but I wanted to scream, ""give Fin a break, quit punishing him for something that he had no control over"". He was cursed by your ancestors for goodness sake.  But instead, Branna brudes and cooks elaborate meals while getting punchy with everyone. And she constantly denies her feelings for Fin while he secretly searches for answers and travels the globe for ways to remove the evil symbol and possible curse, so that they can be together. So for two books now, we have seen them dance around each other, snip at each other, and fall deeper in love. And you know what is coming, and have to sit back and enjoy the ride. Why then the 4 stars and not 5? Well, Cabhan was a little lackluster in this installment....never really doing anything truly evil (ok, he did hurt a puppy that Fin had grown to love), but with that exception, he was around, but not really around. And then they threw in some demon stuff but it wasn't really that well developed, so hence the reduction. So when the plot twists were revealed.....among them Fin's role in the upcoming showdown.....and Branna finally got herself together, you were a little underwhelmed. With all that being said, I did enjoy the vivid imagery (Ireland)...and I like anything to do with witches, sorcerers and demons.....basically magic, so I enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3ZVJ9FGAVXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIXJ36#wasThisHelpful","RN3ZVJ9FGAVXO","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually don't do much with my brows with the exception of brushing them lightly to tame them. On occasion I will clean them up with a nice snip here or there, but every day I just brush them in place. This product however is a nice trade off. It doesn't take a lot to do, simply brush along your natural brow line, and you are as good as new. The small brush that it comes with is easy to handle. So you don't put a ton on. It doesn't appear to stain, smear or clump. It also didn't make my brows look hard or stiff. The end result is a more polished and put together you. And while this particular color (transparent) may not be the perfect for everyone (because the gel is clear but I do think it comes in other colors, like brown or black), it is perfect for me because my brows are dark.

"In theory this should have been a wonderful product. It's aesthetically attractive and would be a wonderful tool in the kitchen (on the sink), if it worked. Everything you need in one dispenser. Well, it doesn't. Work that is. It's cute and that's about it. It leaks!Buyer beware: first, you should know, and just in case you don't, it doesn't come with the scrubber or brush that you see in the photo. And even that would be fine, it the thing did not leak. While pleasing to the eye, it is just not practical because the soap seeps into the other compartment which defeats the purpose. I tried to even use a thicker liquid soap hoping that would help (which is dumb I know...but I was keeping hope alive), but it didn't matter. I think even lotion would eventually leak into the other compartment. With all that being said, $15 is a little high for something that looks good but doesn't work. The average consumer would NOT be able to justify the purchase.With all things considered....the looks, the functionality and the price, I can honestly give this product 1 star.

"When I ordered these, they were to be a spare pair to ones that I ordered from the optometrist. And knowing that Foster Grant has been around forever and is a reputable company, I didn’t see what it would hurt. You know what? I haven’t been disappointed. While these are slightly more than a dime store pair (these are about $39), they are better made. They are attractive and smart looking (tortoise colored), with a traditional shape. I only have one small concern, and hesitate to give these glasses 5 stars….and it is the multi-focus component. Which yeah, I know is the main feature…But, this multi-focus technology definitely takes some getting use to, but it could be based on the individual. For me, a recipient of lasik several years ago it was hard getting use to. As I have aged, I have noticed that I need a little reader to sharpen things up a bit. So in theory, a pair of glasses that contain multi-purpose lenses…ones that I can use when reading, using the computer and interacting (tv)…..would be wonderful. What takes some time getting use is the shifting between purposes….or tasks that you do. Over time I am sure that my eyes would adjust a little quicker, but initially, when my eyes move from the reader portion (which is the bottom) to the computer or tv, my vision would become slightly blurred. While with my normal rimless readers, I can look up and down at my book….merely moving my eyes up and down, with no side effects (if that makes sense). Otherwise, these are perfect as backups and I give them 4 stars. ","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUNP9QSSHW7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHUW1HU#wasThisHelpful","R2WUNP9QSSHW7F","A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Benzac Skin Balancing Foam Cleanser is gentle (even for my sensitive skin), lite (doesn't feel heavy on the skin) and super easy to use. I have what the dermatologist described as ""adult acne"", go figure......I grew up, had two kids and now suffer with the occasional breakout (certain times of the month on the chin and cheek). Anyway, I like the fact that this cleanser is in a pump bottle, although I always feel cheated with pump bottles because it doesn't seem to be a lot of product in the container. Regardless, I like that you can control the amount of product that you use...meaning one pump is more than enough. The main ingredient is salicylic acid which is gentle. After using this product my face isn't red, irritated or peeling.  I have even added a little ""Purpose Cleansing Soap"" to the foam to make it creamier. And it smells good (sandalwood), not like the traditional acne medicine (which smells like a medicine). And finally..... the price. As a kit (all 3 steps), $34 seems reasonable especially when you compare it to other products on the market. Overall, I liked this product. Of course, only time will tell (long term use) how this product really works. For slight to moderate acne, or the occasional breakout, it seems to work, but I am not sure if it will work for someone who has severe acne. My 16-year-old son suffers from (moderate) acne as well and I am going to let him try this product, as well as purchase the last two steps of this kit (spot treatment & blemish clearing hydrator) so that he can experience the full treatment.

"I own an Oreck XL Tall vacuum and have found that ordering my replacement bags on Amazon is less expensive than purchasing them in the store (I save a few dollars especially when I use Prime).

When I was reached out by Sentey to test their product in exchange for an honest review, I had my doubts mainly because of two key reasons. One, it was a company as to which I have never heard of, and two package that is being offered seems too good to be true for it's price point. Well, let's just say I feel idiotic for bashing something before even giving it a chance.From the very beginning this item screams premium. The headphones come packaged in a very nice box along with great art, providing all the details and highlighting the design. The headphones come packaged inside the box within a large protective shell case which has a very nice matte appearance, and seems very sturdy. It is a case I'd definitely trust to protect my headphones if I were to drop them from a high altitude. Now I am going to be listing the Pros and Cons and elaborate, this way it will be easier for you to decide whether or not these are for you.ProsA) Design - The aesthetics of this product is very surprising for it's price range. Majority of the headphones are crafted from steel with  brushed finishing, giving it a very premium feel and image. The headband feels very sturdy and a easy to size for the perfect fit. The ear cups are a mixture of hardened plastic and steel, but looks great. The ear cups also has very soft large foams which cover your entire ears, blocking outside noise sources and providing comfort for long hours.B) Sound - The sound quality on these headphones are really good. While it does lack a little bass compared to it's competitors, this product is no slouch compared to the price point you are grabbing it. Due to my limited resources, I was only able to compare these to my V Moda M100 ($300) and my Audio Technicas ATH-M50 ($130) and I must say they are pretty close in terms of sound quality for general listening. If you are a fan of bass, they won't do much for you as per say a pair of V-Moda headphones would, which in my opinion provides the best bass under $500. Also these won't provide as solid of an overall balanced sound such as the ATH-M50s would, however they fare very well and I was quiet surprised. Overall, solid sound at the price range.C) Comfort - The headband is very easy to adjust and provides a lot of room to fickle around, enabling you to achieve the perfect fit. Also the ear cups are very soft, providing a comfortable grip for longer listening periods.CONSA) Size - While it isn't an issue for me, these headphones do run rather large and can be a little intimidating for some.Overall this product is a hidden gem. While Sentey might not be a very popular brand, I assure you that these are a great buy for the price you are attaining them for. If you are in the market for an affordable over the ear headphone, look no further because not only do these sound good, but the overall experience is very premium.Once again, Disclaimer. I was provided these headphones by the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20U56LGVQ0RAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R20U56LGVQ0RAG","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a person who does not prefer cases on phones and prefer to use them naked. As gorgeous as the Galaxy Note 5 is, it does tend to be a little slippery due to the dual glass body build. So I decided to opt for a full body screen protector in order to protect it from scratches and to get a better grip on the phone. I've never had prior experiences with Skinomi but I did use another manufacturer who produces screen protectors very similar and they were pretty solid. Since it is very affordable, I decided to give Skinomi a shot.When I received the package, it came packaged very nicely. The instructions were clear, the products were all placed separately and everything seemed awesome. So far so good right? Well, it went downhill from there. I've installed numerous screen protectors using the solutions before from a different manufacturer and never had an issue. However, these weren't the same. I cleaned my device thoroughly and washed my hands prior to starting, in order to prevent fingerprints while installing the screen protector. As usual, I installed the screen protector and wipe out the excess solution under the protector. What I find odd is that they do not provide a rubber to push out the water, which is easier to use but rather they provide a microfiber cloth which is a terrible idea because rubbing the cloth hard only causes it to deteriorate and the little pieces of cloth starts to go all over. I left my device untouched for a few hours and once I came back I started to notice streaks under the screen protector and they did not disappear by the end of the day. What I also noticed is that the back of the phone which has curved edges, the screen protectors were slowly peeling off at the edges and this was under 24 hours. Maybe I received a defective product but I couldn't recommend this product to another consumer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HEDTZA0J5WIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LXLIEG#wasThisHelpful","R1HEDTZA0J5WIV","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great fresh design, comfortable, easy to store, affordable, and decent sound quality.......a great buy right? Well, not really. When I first received this product I was really ecstatic. Unlike other Bluetooth headphones, this product has a great new fresh design which I think other companies should start adapting to. It has a magnetic clip which opens and shuts, so you put them on as if you were putting on a chain. The most important aspect is as to how lightweight they are. Once you put them on, it is very easy to forget that you even have headphones on, so for exercising sessions these are perfect. Battery life is about average; listening in about low to mid range volume, you will receive close to 4 hours of battery life from a full charge. So far so good right? Well this is where it went downhill for me. The sound quality is average, something I won't be harsh towards due to the price range. It performs very well and has a somewhat balanced sound which is a little bit dominated from overpowering bass, however the sound output of this product is absolutely horrendous. When I first connected the headphones via Bluetooth to my cellular device, I could barely hear anything. I cranked up the volume all the way up on the phone and it still seemed very low, so I resorted to increase the volume on the headphones also. Within a few clicks I reached max level and they were still very low. With outside interference you wouldn't be able to hear anything since they really do not provide any sort of noise cancellation.I love the design, I love the lightweight and compact size, and I absolutely adore how comfortable they are BUT a headphone is only as good as they sound and these definitely under performs due to terrible sound output. For full disclosure, I was given this product by the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review. Would I recommend these? Not really. There are some better alternatives within this price range of which I have had the pleasure of testing. However that being said, I think Syllable has something great in their hands here. With some improvements and adjusted made, I think the future iterations of this product can be great!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35LK52WDCTV5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R1S6LC#wasThisHelpful","R35LK52WDCTV5D","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In every category there are companies that are considered to be hidden gems due to their high quality products being offered at an affordable price. I believe Brainwavz is a company which applies to the prior statement. I've had the pleasure of trying a few of their products prior to this one so I already had high expectations when I was offered the opportunity to review this product. As usual, the packaging is outstanding. The product comes packaged within a box, inside a protective carrying case which can be used everyday if you are the type of person who tends to lose their headphones. One thing I truly appreciate that Brainwavz does as a company for all their products is that they provide numerous sets of earbuds, this allows the listener to try on different types of earbuds to find the perfect sound they sought after.The design of the headphones are really well done. The components are housed within a metal casing with a mixture of polished and brushed finishing, creating a sleek look within different lighting. They are a mixture of various shades of grey and light maroon, which is the usual Brainwavz signature color, and I must say not only does it look great but it sets you apart from the rest of the crowd which tends to use popular solid colors. While the headphones are built with metal casing, they aren't heavy at all and actually very comfortable, even for longer periods of usage. The wire consists of a little remote which allows you to control the volume, play/pause and switch songs with double click. However, as stated on the box, the controls seems to not work for Android but rather iOS devices only but the play/pause works for both platforms.Now to the main aspect of a pair of headphones, the sound quality. I say this about every Brainwavz headphones and once again it is present within this product, and that is how good they are at balancing the sounds. Usual headphones these days tend to have overpowering bass which creates muddy noises that cancel out the mids and even highs sometimes. I am a person who loves genres of music that are very instrumentally driven such as Rock/Metal/Classical etc. These headphones are superb when it comes to balancing the sound of various instruments. Everything seems to be on level and nothing overpowers one another. If you are more into bass heavy genres such as electronic music or hip/hop, don't worry these does the job as well. The bass is very tight and drops sounds incredible. If I had to complain about one thing, it would be that the sound output could be a little bit better. While they do get loud enough and block out any outside interruptions, their max volume isn't that impressive. However it varies from device to device, on computer they can get pretty loud but while I tested between two phones (Galaxy Note 5, iPhone 6S plus), they were a little bit on the lower side but performed better on the Note 5, but the difference is very minimal.Overall, these are incredible headphones which should cost much more but hey, as a consumer that's something we should never complain about! Once again I was provided these headphones in exchange for an honest review and I couldn't be more honest when I say these are incredible and a steal at this price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAE0H9Q5Q5UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0162C1P9O#wasThisHelpful","R1EAE0H9Q5Q5UB","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a no case guy, I refuse to use cases on my phones. Since Samsung knocked it out of the park this year with their flagship designs and performance, I had to pick up the note 5. However I haven't fallen in love with a phone this much in a long time, so I decided to opt for a case in order to protect the phone. The case itself is very sleek. The case consists of a TPU plastic which hugs your phone and provides a solid protection, and it is rounded with an aluminum bumper. Usually aluminum bumpers degrade your reception but not once have I experienced that issue with this case. The case does provide a lip around the device so you can lay your phone face flat, but it does take away from the no bezel design Samsung has managed to create. Overall this is aa beautiful case that I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ8EE9IZCEBUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012P5MVL8#wasThisHelpful","RQ8EE9IZCEBUP","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The product itself comes packaged very well however, the quality is pretty mediocre. After installing not once, but two of them, both of the tempered glass wouldn't stick on the edges and left huge air bubbles. I gave it to days and the edges still wouldn't stick. They eventually came off and ibhad to throw them away. I guess the statement you get what you pay for applies to this situation. I'd recommend consumers to spend a little bit more for a higher quality screen protector.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ISMOST8RI4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MEX8I0#wasThisHelpful","R15ISMOST8RI4C","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I even start this review, I must say these are awesome! For the price, this is an absolute steal and I will elaborate further as to why. First of all, presentation. Unlike other headphones within this price range, this actually comes packaged very nicely in a box which gives them a much higher grade appearance. Even better, they come with a heavy duty carrying case just in case you want to keep them protected, which once again is very rare within this range. The sound is also very good, a bit better than you can expect from this price range. Bass is very solid, but not over empowering. Highs can kind of get messy but not noticeable unless analyzed carefully. I was provided this product by the manufacturer in exchange for a review, with that being said would I ever purchase them? I absolutely would without any hesitation. Not only they look good, but they sound great and best aspect is that they are highly affordable for what you get!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZ7T9YGM02F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGK8AS6#wasThisHelpful","RPZ7T9YGM02F6","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently I have gotten into fashion and I slowly started to develop a liking for loafers. When I came across this loafer it captured my attention right off the bat. The shade of blue used on this loafer actually depends on the amount of light it is exposed to. In darker environments it seems as if it is dark blue, whereas in a brighter environment they look very light. It is hard to dress up with these loafers since  the shade of color constantly looks different, so I'd opt for a different color. In terms of comfort, they are incredible. I wear them for long periods such as 8-9 hours and not once does my feet. They do run a little large however, I'd go a half size down. I'm usually a perfect 11 but these are a little big for me. Overall solid shoes and I couldn't recommend them enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QOQTQ3BSGDTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTVGHUY#wasThisHelpful","R3QOQTQ3BSGDTS","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted a selfie stick for everyday usage. Something that had to be durable, compact and most importantly reliable. I have come across a few affordable selfie sticks which had terrible battery life and standby time, that used to die while not in use. I was a little hesitant to purchase this product since it was very affordable but I decided to go with my hunch and purchase this anyways since I needed something fast. Let's just say I feel idiotic for having so many doubts because this product is awesome. Not only does it feel good on the hand but also it is built very well. I am someone who uses their phone without a case, and I have the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. The Edge is a very beautiful phone built of aluminum and glass, so it can be very prone to damage (even though the new Gorilla glass 4 is tested to be 50% stronger than previous generation). However, I mention this because I wanted to emphasize as to how I did not feel worried putting my phone on this selfie stick and extending it all the way out since it was built so well. On one full charge it will last you the entire day and even more. The response is very quick and connecting it was a breeze. Overall a wonderful product for the price, if you want a selfie stick at an affordable price you cannot go wrong with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KP1MX4G4K7W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S10QXWU#wasThisHelpful","R1KP1MX4G4K7W7","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love fitness and I love music. Finding the right headphones for exercising can be really irritating because of comfort and fit issues. I initially purchased the famous jaybirds x but for their price they were really disappointing. They never fit really well, water resistant wasn't good (broke from rain) and most importantly their battery life were terrible, not even close to the advertised time. After that disappointment I decided to look for another product at a much more affordable price since I didn't want to deal with warranty issues and something that wouldn't break the bank if it were to break. Considering I had positive experiences with Brainwavz products before, I decided to give these a shot and I am glad that I did. The headphones aren't the most secure fit when it comes to exercising but the sound is incredible. For such an affordable product, it has great bass, clarity and most importantly a balanced sound. Even at max volume the bass is solid and the highs does not distort. Battery life is also superb compared to it's competitors. On one full charge, I can get around 4-5 hours of continuous playtime, which is almost double of what I received on the Jaybirds. Now the aspect that impressed me the most about these were the build quality. The wire is not too long and the headphones themselves are cased with a aluminum body which not only looks premium, but feels premium also. I would not feel worried if I were to drop them or put them under rough usage, they feel very solid. Overall a wonderful product that I am glad that I have tried, If you are in the market for an affordable Bluetooth headphone which not only looks good but performs well, these are a great choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L96PJYTVQV20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDVY34Q#wasThisHelpful","R1L96PJYTVQV20","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a Bose sound system a few years back that never received any use since I don't really purchase CD's anymore. Since it was a large investment, I decided to seek for a portable Bluetooth audio receiver in order to connect my phone to the sound system and listen to some music. I came across this product at an affordable price and I became very curious. I have never had any experience with this manufacturer before so I was kind of hesitant. Receiving the product, my initial impression was kind of negative. It was packaged in a very generic box without much instructions or branding. However at the end of the day, I only care about how well a product performs rather than how it is packaged, and well....it is awesome!Connecting this device is very easy, just hold the button in order to turn it on and connect it to up to two devices via Bluetooth. It has a range of up to 30ft without sacrificing any audio quality. The sounds come out crisp, bass is solid and highs are usually very clean. I was surprised as to how well this device performed for the price. The battery is very well also, on one full charge it lasts up to 5-6 hours of continuous play. Of course you can always keep it plugged in order to listen to music for a longer period of time.If you are on this page looking for an Bluetooth Audio Receiver, this is a great choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17RBS1FQ4IJNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5NCPHA#wasThisHelpful","R17RBS1FQ4IJNC","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for an everyday belt, I came across this item at an affordable price. I was very curious for the quality and from the picture it looked very good. When I received the belt, I wasn't so stoked on it's overall look.The belt is actually very thick and big, and the buckle is lightly plated with gold, and it is already starting to wear off a little. The longevity of the plating isn't something you should look forward to, as it will come off from everyday use and expose the metal underneath. Aside from that slight negative aspect, the rest of the belt is very well made. It is thick, very well padded and most of all seems very durable.

"For the price, it is quiet attractive and built very well. Upon first glance, I was very impressed with the Syllable D700's. Not only did they look premium but also felt very sturdy. The headphones are built in a way where you can adjust almost every portion of the headphones to give yourself the perfect and most secure fit, which enables them to stay on your ear even through the most rigorous workout sessions. I've used this product for over a month now testing it's durability, battery life and sound quality. Of course for the price, you cannot expect a performance that rivals products which costs 5-6 times more.During my first week, I have come to realize that the battery life was very good. While listening to music in mid range volume, I'd get about 5-6 hours of music playback through one full charge. While listening to high or max volume, the battery level dropped to about 3-4 hours, which isn't bad. It charges rather quickly, within one hour completely. Overall I am very pleased with the battery performance.The comfort of these headphones can be a hit or a miss. I say this because for me personally, I loved the snug fit that enabled them to stay on my ear while I ran or went through rigorous daily weightlifting routines. Not once did they come off or fall in middle of physical activities. However my brother who listens to music more casually did not find the fit to be comforting but rating irritating. If you are someone such as me who prefers a snug fit for a secure fit, you will adore it. However if you do not, you will find it irritating and uncomfortable.The sound quality is good but not great, these lack serious bass. On most tracks you will hear clear highs and mids but the bass is almost on existent. I mostly listen to genres which involves instruments so it wasn't a big deal for me. However if you are an individual who prefers electronic or hip hop music, you will not be happy.Overall for the price these are alright. They look good, provides a comfortable and secure fit, has a great battery life but falls short in the most important aspect of a headphone and that is the sound quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18JO2XDM0JBC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWM3J62#wasThisHelpful","R18JO2XDM0JBC7","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in search of a portable wireless charger which I could use during class or work, so I could charge my phone without having to worry about any wires. I came across this product and was intrigued by the decent reviews it received. I wasn't in the market for something spectacular, but rather something which could provide me with one full charge in middle of the day since I am a heavy user. My daily driver is the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge which consists of a 2600mAh battery. Since this charger is advertised 4000mAh, I expected that it would provide me with at least one full charge, knowing that wireless charging wastes more energy while transferring compared to regular USB. However while completely charged, I was only able to get anywhere between 70-85% on it's full capacity. The standby time was also very disappointing. While not in use, the battery depleted by 25%+ over two days. Yes it does look very good and has a good build quality, but at the end of the day if it doesn't provide me with functionality, I am not going to be a happy consumer.

"Big things come in small packages, a perfect statement to describe this little gadget. Bluetooth speakers are slowly becoming popular and for all the right reasons. I have slowly stopped using stock speakers on my phones and tablets mainly because I own a few Bluetooth speakers and they provide incredible sound. When I was offered to review this product, I was really intrigued mainly due to two reasons. One, Mengo is a small company but their products have been nothing short of spectacular so far. Two, their customer service is superb. I have not experienced much companies who respond within minutes after reaching out to them. That being said, I was intrigued by this product due to how compact it is. As for sound quality, I did not expect much since it was so small, but my assumption was so wrong.Pros1) Sound Quality- For something so small, the sound quality is superb. The Mengo AquaCube has openings on opposite sides and vibrations are put out in order to create a sense of surround sound, it is incredible. It has the perfect balance of Bass, Mids and Highs. Bass is punchy, highs are clear without hurting the ear and the lows are noticeable without being overpowered by mids or highs.2) Controls- The controls of this product are great. Everything is on top of the speaker and has a great tactile clicky feel to them, it screams premium.3) Durability/Water Resistance- The product consists of high grade rubber. It does not pick up any dirt, even after being exposed to water so it always stays clean. I have dropped it as high as 10 ft on concrete to test it's durability, no blemishes to report. However I do not recommend trying such feats, it was only done for the sake of testing. Also as advertised, it is highly water resistant. It isn't waterproof as the title states, that is a misleading advertisement that many companies tend to use. Just for testing sake, I submerged this little guy under water, about 2 feet deep. The duration of the test lasted about 15 minutes and it worked flawlessly right out of the water. This product is surprisingly well built.4) Looks- Compact, durable, and on top of that it is fashionable. The lime green isn't bright and it is a very safe color in terms of being unisex. Included along with this product is a little key chain which can be attached to a backpack or other utilities, making it easy to carry with you on the go.5) Battery Life (Maybe)- I listed battery life as a con due to the fluctuation of the durations it lasted per charge. On my first full charge, I was able to get around 3 hours of continuous playback at max volume, which is pretty good. On my second full charge, I was able to get almost 4 hours of battery life with random usage, which is spectacular as well. My first negative experience was on my 3rd full charge, the battery lasted around a little over 2 hours from continuous playback at max volume, which was a bit disappointing. However, on my most recent charge, I haven't ran out of juice after 4 hours of usage, on and off. So overall, battery life can be a little confusing but since it was a new product, it takes a few complete charges for the battery to become stable. On an average, you can expect 3 1/2 hours of battery life per charge, which is amazing for such a small device.Cons1) MicWhen receiving phone calls, the output is very clear however it does not pick up your voice very well. When I was making calls, I had complaints that my voice was being overpowered by the background noises. However this isn't the main reason as to why we buy Bluetooth speakers, so it isn't a big deal.Overall this is an incredible product. It is fashionable, durable, compact and most importantly, it does what it is supposed to do and that is to provide great sound. This is hands down by far my favorite Bluetooth speakers as of now due to how compact it is and the sound quality it provides. I would recommend this product to anyone without any hesitation. Bravo Mengo on creating another great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AI486TD46XQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJ7C0YI#wasThisHelpful","R3AI486TD46XQX","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we come across affordable items, especially products that are significantly cheaper compared to it's competitors, we tend to think of them as cheap and assume they would be of poor quality. If you are an individual who has such a perspective such as myself, I urge you to disregard that perspective and purchase this product. Why you may ask, and I will gladly state my reasons in a list basis, highlighting the Pros and Cons.Pros1) Battery Life - On a full charge, you will receive about 4 and a half hours of continuous playback at max volume. Of course there are Bluetooth headphones in the market that provides better battery life, however be prepared to pay 4 times the price. I mainly use this for the gym, and I only end up charging about twice a week. My favorite aspect is that every time you turn the headphones on, you are informed as to what level of battery is left ranging from Low, medium, high. So without guessing, you will always be aware as to whether or not you need to charge your headphones before heading out the house, bravo!2) Sound Quality- The sound quality is superb, blew my expectations out of the water. These are a little bass heavy but never gets to the point where it produces a muddy sound. The lows are clear and the highs are balanced, never hurts your ear. However the only weak point are the mids, which can get overpowered by bass but not a huge complain, just nitpicking to be specific. I mostly like to genres such as Rock/Hard Rock/Heavy Metal etc. One thing I have noticed about these headphones is that you can actually feel a ""kick"" from bass pedals during songs which makes listening to genres with instruments so much more enjoyable. It is a feature you really don't experience in headphones under $100.3) Controls- The controls of the headphones are awesome. They are raised from the body in their own unique shape, so whenever you put your finger on top of the icons, you will know right away by feeling as to what it is, whether to increase the sound or to pick up a call.Cons1) Balanced Comfort- By balanced comfort, I mean that the body doesn't stay in place due to weight difference of both ends of the headphones. The right side of the headphones consists of more components than the left, so while wearing these, the headphones always start to shift towards the right side and hangs in an awkward balance. However it isn't a big issue while you are working out, for casual use it might be annoying.2) Magnets- The earbuds stay in place at the end of the headphones through magnetic connection. However the magnets aren't as strong, so while walking they tend to come off easily and dangle on your neck, cause slight irritation and annoyance.After all is said and done, I would gladly live through the little cons this product consists of due to how good these sound. This is an affordable product which does what it is supposed to and that is to provide great service at a fraction of cost compared to it's competition. I would highly recommend these without any hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WIUFGXA8Z40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R2WIUFGXA8Z40","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While wooden watches may not be for everyone, they definitely have their place in the industry. I used to be a skeptical individual who wrote of wooden watches as soon as they started to become popular. However once I received this product, I was really impressed. While it doesn't provide the same heft as a stainless steel or tungsten watch would provide, one word that comes to my mind when wearing a wooden watch is comfort. These watches are very well built but making the shift from wearing heavier watches to wooden watches such as this, the weight is almost unnoticeable. The wood is hypoallergenic so wearing them for longer periods of time is no problem to the detrimental of the wood used on this watch. The watch is big coming in at 45mm, however the light weight makes it a breeze to wear. The watch has been keeping excellent time within 5 seconds after one week, which is great for an entry level quartz movement. The bezel of the watch is fixed and cannot be moved, the entire case of the watch is uni body, which is pretty impressive to see within this price range. The Canadian Maple wood is very light and the red hour markers just pop when wearing on the wrist, it is a great vibrant summer look. Overall this is a good product. If you want to try out a wooden watch without breaking the bank, this is a wonderful product to start with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IN5B2QBCDINI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWTYSSS#wasThisHelpful","R3IN5B2QBCDINI","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While it seems identical to the LG's bluetooth headphone product, the overall performance might surprise you. The headphone is very sleek. While crafted from plastic, it does not look cheap at all and has a very nice polished finish. The weight is very light and it does not cause any discomfort if worn for a long period of time or during physical activities. The ear buds clip and hide right under the blades using magnets, so you never have to worry about wires gangling around your neck. Considering the price range I did not expect much but these truly blew me away. The sound quality is superb. With a very solid and tight bass, you never experience the muddy overexposed bass noise which most headphones tend to do within this price range. The mids are clear and the lows are very easy to pick up on. The battery life has been superb. On one full charge, I was able to get around 4-5 hours of battery life listening to music on loud settings. However while putting the sound down to low-medium range, I was able to pull well within 7-8 hours of battery life. These are also very durable. I have been using them as my gym headphones. I always toss them around but they have yet to show any damage. While on the neck, the headphones tend to shift to the left overtime, it isn't a big deal but sometimes can become cumbersome. I suggest in the future products similar to this, the weight is more balanced for a better experience but overall these headphones are superb for the price range and I highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RBDB0YJ8AL8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7I5158#wasThisHelpful","R1RBDB0YJ8AL8M","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first received this product I had my doubts. Considering the low price for a Bluetooth 4.0 headphone, I did not expect much. My first impression was very positive. The packaging of the product was very beautiful. It definitely did not reflect it's price point but rather something much more expensive. However once I opened the package and retrieved the product, I was a little disappointed. The overall build of the headphone is plastic and feels flimsy. The big branding of ""Bluetooth Headphones"" are unnecessary and looks tacky. The buttons on the headphones have a light coating of silver to give it a stainless steel appearance, but they are plastic and will look bad overtime. The comfort can be annoying, leaving your ears warm and sore. However aside from all the negativity associated with this product, let's get down to the main aspect, which is the sound quality. The performance on these headphones are superb. Bass is solid, while can be muddy at times, it isn't distracting. The mids are surprisingly noticeable and the lows are consistent. I have tested them out to various genres such as electronic, metal, hip/hop, rock etc and they all sounded very good. The battery life has been solid, in medium to high volume range, I have been able to get about 4 hours of battery life. However under low to medium sound range, I have been able to pull around 6-7 hours of battery life. Overall if you are in the market for a pair of Bluetooth headphone which won't break the bank and provide great sound quality, these are a wonderful choice. However if you are in the market for bluetooth headphones which looks good and performs well, this isn't it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R220UV2X6YH3SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMUF616#wasThisHelpful","R220UV2X6YH3SW","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a fan of vintage watches, look no further. While big considering it's design, this watch has a certain elegance to it that will make you fall in love the second you open your watch box upon arrival. While having a square design, the bottom of the case has been arched in order to provide a very comfortable fit on the wrist, which is extremely rare for watches within this price range. While a big watch coming in at around 45mm, it isn't comfortable at all due to the very low weight of the wood. The dial has a coating on it giving it a glossy look, which adds to the polished hands and hour markers, making it very classy. The movement has been performing very well, keeping time within 4-5 seconds after one week of constant usage. For being an entry level quartz movement, that is very good. My only gripe is that the links on the bracelets are big and the length of the bracelet isn't that large. I have a 7 and a half inch wrist and out of the box, the bracelet was almost a perfect fit for me. If you are someone who has a wrist size bigger than 7 and a half inch, you might need to purchase additional links. I also mentioned the links of the watches were too big because when sizing the bracelet, removing one link makes the watch too tight, whereas adding an extra will make it too loose. I suggest adding half sized links in the future products so consumers can have a better fit. Overall this is a wonderful product as an entry level watch, if you have been on the fence of trying wooden watches or looking for a good gift, this is a wonderful product to begin with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJ85132G9WAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VT0YQ2I#wasThisHelpful","R1UJ85132G9WAI","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a very wonderful finish and a gorgeous color, this is an attention grabber for sure. While it has the regular look of a diver or sport watch, it wears very differently on the wrist. Compared to a regular Stainless steel watch, this is very light. One aspect of wooden watches that is slowly turning me into a fan is their comfort. Since it is a very light watch, wearing it for long periods of time is a blast since I almost forget there is a watch on my wrist when I am involved in activities. Since the watch is hypoallergenic, it will keep to it's true color and not turn green over time, enabling you to wear it as a daily driver. The watch can be big or small depending on what is your preference. The case is 45mm and the lug width on the bracelet is around 25-26mm. While it does wear big on the wrist, it doesn't have any comfort issues as I have stated before. Something rare within this price range is that the watch has a slightly domed crystal which adds much more to the overall look.  The bracelet has a beautiful dual deployant clasp, which rare for this price range. The hour markers and hands are coated with super-luminova in order to provide the glow in the dark effect under low light situations. The movement has been very well, keeping time within 3 seconds after one week, which isn't bad at all for an entry level quartz movement. Overall for the price this is a wonderful product. If you are on the fence of trying a wooden watch or want to give it to someone as a gift, this is a wonderful place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSNU3WAJC7ABW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VR6XIL4#wasThisHelpful","RSNU3WAJC7ABW","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first noticed wooden watches starting to become popular, I was kind of skeptical. As someone who has a passion over collecting watches and learning about the engineering behind them, I was intrigued but not too excited. When I first received this watch, I was pretty surprised...in a good way. First thing a person will notice who shifts from wearing a regular stainless steel watch to a wooden one, is the comfort. This watch is very light. While it is a big watch, coming in at about 45mm case and 24mm on the bracelet, you barely feel any sort of discomfort on the wrist for wearing it long periods of time. The bracelet is very well made, the links are big but that will turn to be an issue for some, as it did for myself. When sizing the bracelet, removing one link might not be enough for a comfortable fit, but removing two links will make it too tight. I suggest in the future products TopWell adds half sized links for a much more comfortable fit. The clasp is nice, secure and easy to close. The watch has a mineral crystal protecting the dial, with no anti reflection coating so it can be hard to tell the time under sunlight, but for the price range it is completely acceptable. The Japanese quartz movement has been excellent, has lost no time the past week I've been wearing it. The most important aspect about this watch is that it is hypoallergenic, which means the wood will stay looking fresh and clean for a long period of time, making it accessible as an everyday wearer. Overall for the price I am really impressed and if you are someone who is on the fence of trying a wooden watch, this will be an excellent affordable choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPUH2P3X11YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWWOTVQ#wasThisHelpful","R3PPUH2P3X11YO","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I start this review I must admit that I absolutely disliked Samsung devices prior to this phone. With a cluttered software that only caused frustration while using their phone on a daily basis, I stayed away from Samsung when it came to cellular devices. However with the new S6, Samsung has promised that they have toned down their software, also known as Touchwiz by 40%. A promise of no lag experience and a simpler UI, Samsung plans to win back their older fans and rise back to the top. Did they achieve their goals? Let's find out.ProsDisplay - With a Quad HD super AMOLED display, there is not a single phone in the industry as of now that can compete. With a pixel density of 577 pixels per inch, this is the most vibrant and beautiful display you can acquire. The colors are accurate, the white can be somewhat on the yellow side but that can be altered through the settings. With auto brightness, the screen can go as bright as 600 nits, which makes it extremely easy to read under bright lights. The screen itself is 5.1 inches but almost creates a no bezel experience due to the edge screens.Design - This has to be the most improved category for Samsung. As a company Samsung has always functioned under the philosophy of function over aesthetics. However after a disappointing year last year, Samsung reevaluated their approach as a company. They have thrown aside the plastic builds of past phones and has finally entered the world of premium and luxury. With a gorgeous pair of Gorilla glass 4 covering both the front and back of the phone, it creates a seamless feel on the hand like none other. Both pieces of glass are secured in place by a beautiful Aluminum outer rim that feels cold to the touch every time you pick it up.The buttons are snappy and very clicky and the edges of the outer aluminum rim are polished. Samsung has put great attention to detail that matches and reflects the quality of finishing as other luxurious jewelry. Thanks to the bent edges, the phone feels very slim.However one drawback of the glass body is that it picks up a lot of fingerprints. Luckily if you prefer the white color variation, the finger prints do not show at all. So if you are someone like me who does not like cases on their phones, the white color is the safest bet which is I personally purchased the white variation myself.Performance - What an improvement did Samsung make. With their new iteration of Touchwiz software, samsung had shed off over 40% of bloatware and created an almost lag free experience. I mention lag free because when the phone is in use for longer periods of time, it can become warm and causes lag here and there, but not a deal breaker. I like to be honest so I mention everything. Multitasking has never been better. Even though it is a small real estate in terms of screen size, running two programs at once is completely lag free and enables you to take care of various tasks and save time.Camera - This camera is hands down the best camera in phones as of now. The colors are crisp, the details it captures are astonishing, and most importantly it is fast. The interface itself is very minimal. With double clicking on the home button, it opens up the camera under 0.5 seconds. The software itself is so good, if you are someone who just prefers a camera for point and shoot, I feel very comfortable in saying this phone will replace any cameras you have lying around the house for that purpose (Disregard DSLR cameras etc.). With the addition of f1.9 lens, lowlight pictures are better than ever. Even though they tend to be over exposed, the picture itself comes out very clear. This is an incredible camera and I cannot stretch that enough. I've had people mistake my pictures for DSLR, yup it's that good. My only beef is the front facing camera (FFC abbreviated). Even though the FFC is really good in it's own right, the software tends to create a air brushed finish when taking selfies. This causes a somewhat unnatural look on your skin, but this happens very rarely.Finger Print Scanner - Gone are the days where you have to swipe your finger in order to open your device, now very similar to Apple, just placing your thumb on the physical button unlocks your phone. This method can also be used to verify and pay for some services online.Battery (Charging) - The new fast charging is blazing fast. Samsung promises 15 minutes of charging can provide four hours of battery life. While may be a little exaggerated, you get results very close to that promise. From 0 to 100 percent, it takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes, sometimes even less. Another addition is that the S6 now compatible with any kind of wireless charging. While wireless charging is slow at the moment, it doesn't hurt to have this feature because I use it on a daily basis myself. I have a wireless power bank which I carry around with me on a regular basis and I leave my phone charging whenever it drops low while I take care of other tasks.Cons -Battery Life (Duration) - With such powerful specs means a hungry phone. Samsung has implemented aspects such as fast charging in order to make up for the mediocre battery life but it boils down to what you prefer. With a full charge, you can expect an onscreen time from anywhere between 3 1/2 hours to 5 hours. It is very random. However if left idle and used lightly, it will easily last an entire day. Standby time is also great, it loses about 1-2% battery every 4-6 hours. Overall it is a good performer but once the heavy hitters are present such as playing video games or taking pictures, the battery drains rapidly.Overall this is by far the best phone I have ever used. I am a huge tech nerd and I am switching devices every 3-4 months whenever something new is released. I have had at least 10 different phones within the past 2 years, including all the flagships but I have never enjoyed my time so much with a single device as I have done with this one. it is such a pleasure to pick up this phone every time. Aesthetically it is unlike any other and the egdes of the phone are a pleasure to look at every time. It has the best build quality, best camera and by far the best display of any phone. Even though the cost is high, this purchase is a no brainer to me. If you are in the market for the best there is, this is it, the next big thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPED2RTFDTW08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5M09EY#wasThisHelpful","RPED2RTFDTW08","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to this product I have never had an experience with Smart Doorbells before. Skybell was generous enough to reach out to me in order for me to test out their product. When I first received this product, I was very impressed with the packaging. The overall packaging was very minimalistic, and the box did not contain much other than a clear instruction guide and the product itself.Installation can be a pain and I would suggest you get an electrician or someone with knowledge with wiring before attempting it yourself (wasn't pretty when I tried, due to my own idiotic self). After the hard part is done, the rest is pretty simple. Just download the Application from google play or the app store, and start using this product.The design itself is very pleasing. As someone who is big into horology, I pay close attention to smaller details. The finishing on the surface is a brushed finish which looks very premium and the button has a green LED under which makes it very visible even under low light conditions. Depending on your wifi connection, the response time from someone ringing on your doorbell to receiving the notification on your phone happens almost simultaneously. it is such an awesome feature to have. There were days where I used to miss deliveries but those days are long gone.The only con about this product is the motion sensor feature, it is a bit too sensitive. The range is pretty high, which causes unwanted doorbell to go off even if someone isn't near your door.Overall, it is a wonderful product that I highly recommend if you are someone who is looking to purchase a Wifi video doorbell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R384GJCQK21BSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBS7YIW#wasThisHelpful","R384GJCQK21BSU","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the new powerhouse and absolutely stunning device from Samsung, protection is a must for your investment. I was really pleased to see when Caseology reached out to me and offered me a chance to review their product. Prior to this experience, I have had nothing but positive experience with their products. Whenever I purchase a new device (usually every 4-5 months), this brand is one of the first I purchase a product from. However before going to the negative aspects, I will speak about the positive things I have noticed about this case.ProsFit - The fit is absolutely superb on this case. It is a little hard to put it in at first, however with a little pressure on the corners the phones slides in with ease and is very secured. The outer edges provides a lip, so putting your phone face down won't be an issue since the screen does not make direct contact with the surface. The back of the case is not absolutely clear (however it could be only my review unit, more on this on the con section) but it does show case the beautiful design of this device.Design - The design of this case is superb. The color is an exact match to the phone itself and does not look out of place. It is not slim by any means but nor does it add too much bulk. When holding the case in hand the first thought that pops into the head is quality. The cutouts are precise and the buttons work flawlessly.ConQuality - Now, before I go on I must say that this really applies for my experience only and I cannot speak for others. Maybe I was provided a used case for reviewing purposes but that wasn't stated by Caseology initially so I am going to state it just so the shoppers can be aware. When I received the case, it looked brand new. The case itself had no scratches, however the clear back was heavily scratched and did not look clear at all. Maybe this is a reflection of their quality control but a product in such bad shape should not have sent out. So when placing an order for this case, just be aware.Once again, maybe it was sent to me under that condition due to it being for reviewing purposes, but I like being honest and exposing every angle so shoppers can be aware.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29N58U7NF0I2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSRT5D0#wasThisHelpful","R29N58U7NF0I2G","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a person who is always on the go, a portable charger is much required for me. I take care of a lot of tasks using my phone and that leads to a lot of battery consumption. I am currently using the Galaxy S6 edge as my daily driver and it consists of a 2600mAh battery. I am mentioning this because the product itself states it has the capacity to hold 4,000mAh battery, which means under one full charge, it should be able to charge my phone completely once, and around 50% the second time around, and it just does that.The product itself is built wonderfully. The solar charge while big, looks very nicely put. It does not take away from the overall aesthetics and creates a very rugged appearance being surrounded by silicone. Which brings me to my next point, durability. The product itself is very durable. It comes with a clip which let's you attach it on a bookbag so while you are traveling and going about your daily business, that charger is charging through the solar light. The solar charger itself is very slow, but that is understandable and something you should take into consideration while purchasing this product. Being exposed to bright light for about 4-6 hours will gain about a 25% charge, which isn't bad at all. My favorite aspect about this charger is that it does not overcharge if left plugged in while charging. I leave this product charging overnight and once it finishes charging, it automatically shuts off, which speaks positively for the longevity of this product.Overall it is a very durable and stylish product that not only looks good aesthetically, but performs just as well. I have to mention that this product was given to me as a review unit but I was so pleased with it's performance that I ended up purchasing an additional 2 for my other family members. Great product and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OKH9QZS1IA7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNV8SRS#wasThisHelpful","R3OKH9QZS1IA7A","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always used the regular old school pump dispensers for my kitchen. However when I was approached by this company to try their new product for an honest review, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try something new. My first impression was very positive. The quality is superb and looks very nicely finished. It is well constructed and has a minimal but an eye catching design nonetheless. The dispenser is large and holds a solid amount of soap. My average time between refills was about once every two weeks. The sensor works like a charm. Every time I placed my hand underneath the dispenser, it released soap without hassle. Good thing is the amount of soap released was moderate, which enables you to manage the soap amount better. I've been using this product for about a month now and I must say it is still performing flawlessly. Between me and my family, we use it at least 10-12 times a day and that brings me to the battery life. When I received the product initially, I put in a fresh pair of AA required battery and it still is running strong without showing any signs of slowing down.Overall I am truly pleased with this product. The built quality and performance is superb for the price point. Most importantly, this product does what it is supposed to do and does it efficiently. On a side note, from the few interactions I've had with the company and it's leaders, I feel very comfortable in saying that this product is also backed by a great solid team who is willing to provide great customer service. I know I'm not required to mention such things and it might somehow undermine my review, however credit should be given where its due and this company has done everything I have asked for in order to make sure I've had no questions or concerns over their products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZ0E6WLSTIWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSQR1ZM#wasThisHelpful","R3OZ0E6WLSTIWY","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bluetooth speakers are usually either a hit or a miss. Some tend to lack in performance while others tend to suffer in sound quality. When I was approached by the manufacturer to review this unit, I honestly did not have much expectation. Why you may ask? Well it's because of my own idiotic reasons. One, it was a product from a company of whom I have never heard of before and the other reason being was the price. Bluetooth speakers within this price range usually don't perform very well. However after exchanging some e-mails with the owner of the company, I decided to review this unit because of the great positive vibe I have received. Well enough about the less important details, let's get on to the main thing at hand and that is this product. Is this worth your hard earned money?

It is placed inside a clear hard plastic box that showcases the device along with the instructions and charging cable. The product already comes halfway charged so you can try it right away. Right off the bat, you can tell it is very easy to use. The function buttons are very large and are placed on top. If you are someone who does not have the best vision, it should be very easy on the eyes and will be easier for you to differentiate between each button. The build of this device is completely plastic with the function buttons being rubber. It has a polished look and the bezel on top around the buttons is painted with a shade of dark sky blue, if that makes sense. The bottom of the device has a huge suction cup that enables you to stick it on the wall or place it somewhere in the bathroom. Even though the device has some heft to it, the suction cup is strong enough to hold it in place. I placed it inside my bathroom about 2 weeks ago and it has still stood in place with no signs of falling off. Which brings me to the next aspect, the battery life. The battery performance has been wonderful over the last 2 weeks I have had the device. I use this speaker on a daily basis for about 20 minutes when I am taking my shower. I charged the device completely the first day of receiving it and ever since it has still been performing and did not need a recharge. As well as the battery is, sadly it is also the biggest flaw of the product. To charge this device there's only one way, and that is through using an Aux to USB cable. It is a negative because majority of electronic devices these days does not charge through such a method. So if the cable provided with the product were to break, you would need to repurchase the cable from either the manufacturer or somewhere else instead of using other cables around the house that you might have for other devices. Now to the main aspect of the device, and that is the sound quality. I must say, this product really caught me off guard. Not only does it have good clarity but it also has great bass and mids. I listen to genres that ranges from classical, to hip-hop and mostly heavy metal or hard rock. It provides a great balanced sound with punchy bass that does not sound muddy.Overall this is a wonderful product and well worth the money in my opinion. The build quality is good, and more importantly the sound quality is great. If you are in the market for a loud, clear and stylish wireless speaker, this is a wonderful choice. Hopefully my review was hopeful. If you feel as if I missed anything or you would like to know more, feel free to contact me always for additional information.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26TI9VSKWALHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N69MYU6#wasThisHelpful","R26TI9VSKWALHZ","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never been a fan of wallet covers for phones. Every wallet case I have used over the past few years either turn out to be too bulky or rather slim which doesn't allow for much storage. Due to my past experiences, I have always shied away from such cases. However recently I came across this product from Husk. The concept behind this product seemed to be abnormal, but in a positive manner. Not only did this product look good, but rather seemed very useful due to the new approach to wallet cases.The case itself doesn't provide much protection to your phone, but keep in mind that it isn't the highlight of this product. The case is very slim that provides a nice thin layer of protection on the back of your phone and closes very tightly. While inspecting the case, you can come to the conclusion that the product was very well thought out and you appreciate the work of detail. One aspect I noticed this case has that I have never seen in another case is that the inside of the product has a layer of microfiber cloth glued on the case, so the back of your phone will not get scratched and stay clean while you have the cover on your phone. This also stops dust particles from penetrating inside the case.Now to the highlight of the case, which is the back. The rear part of the case consists of two separate entities. The first thing that catches your attention is the little pocket which enables you to store cards/money/papers etc. However if you do not feel comfortable or secure storing such items in that exposed area, there is a hidden or rater private pocket which is hidden away thanks to the magnetic clasp. In order to store anything there, all you have to do is pull back the magnetic tab and store anything to your desire. One thing I found very exciting was that as to how secure the compartment was. I used this wallet regularly for about three weeks and not once did the clasp open in my pocket. It closes with a snap and stays closed very securely.Overall this is a wonderful product. Inspecting up close you can come to the conclusion that it was very well thought out. Not only does it look good and feel premium on the hand, the attention to detail makes you appreciate the product even more. The price might be high and some of you might feel hesitant and I completely understand. However I think the statement ""You get what you pay for"" perfectly applies to this product.Hopefully I was helpful. if you have any questions or would like to know more information about this product, always feel free to contact me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13D3VZ2BXMGSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ROPMLY2#wasThisHelpful","R13D3VZ2BXMGSX","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful case that provides a very slim and sleek look while providing coverage for your device. I purchased the clear case to showcase the beautiful build of the nexus 6. Surprisingly it isn't so slippery and looks great. Of course since it is a clear plastic case so you can expect it to be a fingerprint magnet and it does look bad if you sweat a lot or have oily hands. I knew the plastic case would be a fingerprint magnet and I purchased the case being aware of the flaw of the material so I am not going to hold it against the company. All the cutouts of the case are perfectly done, buttons are easy to reach and the USB port to charge your phone is easily accessible.The overall fit is perfect, a little too perfect which is its biggest flaw. I know, you might be thinking to yourself is this guy serious? And I don't blame you, let me explain why. The case fits the phone like a glove and barely adds any bulk to your phone. If a slim appearance is what you seek, that is what you will get. However since it does cover the entire phone, it is almost near impossible to take off the case. The case clips on to your phone very tightly and if you want to take off the case, you need to use some strength to bend one side of the case to take it off. It is scary because the two times I had to take this case off, I was literally scared that I would damage my phone. Compared to the Spigen slim fit case, this product is better overall in terms of build and quality BUT I do like to change cases once in a while and because of that reason alone I use the Spigen case over this product, just because I don't want to risk damaging my phone taking the case off. If you aren't someone like me who won't change cases every few weeks, then you have nothing to worry about. However for someone such as me who likes buying different accessories and changing the case up every now and then, this might be an annoying experience for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C6V8MBD19TUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PM5RJMK#wasThisHelpful","R3C6V8MBD19TUR","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now that I am a little older I really do not suffer from severe acne anymore, however once a month or so I will have a usual breakout where I will experience a few big pimples. This spot treatment along with the Panoxyl 4% cream face wash combined really helps me recover at a rapid pace and clears my face up within a few days. Before I started using this spot treatment, I only used the face wash. Just the face wash alone would take about a week to clear up my face so this spot treatment really helps me deal with the bigger and badder pimples and reduces the time it takes my skin to recover. I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1XV8K5YNZPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M21ECYK#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1XV8K5YNZPU","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a new comer in a very saturated market, being a standout company can be very difficult. Brainwavz was a company I have never heard of before and when the company reached out to me and offered me a chance to review this product, I was very curious and decided to give it a try right away. Now, I have to admit that I had doubts prior to receiving this product. Compared to other established company's around, I wonder how a smaller company would stand out in terms of packaging, extras included and quality.Let's just say after I received the product, all my doubts were gone.The headphones came packaged beautifully in a box with cool graphics on the cover highlighting the product. The front of the box has a flap that you can pull open and it reveals the beautifully crafted headphones. It is nice to see that a company puts so much effort on packaging, it is definitely a missing art in the industry and it is nice to see Brainwavz going the extra mile to make their product as perfect as possible. In the package you get a lot of stuff. The most obvious, you receive the headphones along with a carrying case. You are also given 6 different pair of tips for different functions and size for the most comfort to your need. Finally, an airplane adapter is included which if perfect for someone who tends to travel often.First, let me start with the body of the headphones. The headphones are built completely of stainless steel and quiet large in size. It has a beautiful brushed finish all around that makes them not only feel, but look very premium. The headphones are attached to memory wires that gives you total control and enables you to mold the wire to your comfort desired for the perfect fit. However, as much as I loved the memory wires, they can be a con for many. I have used this product regularly for about 3 weeks now. I use them for the gym, traveling or for just casual listening around the house. When I used this for a long period of time, the stiffness of the memory wires did cause irritation behind my ears and it started to cause pain. However to my surprise, the owner of the company reached out to me and informed me as to how they are actually removing the memory wires from the product and they will be regular cables in the future, so that will be an amazing upgrade and make this product even better than it is.Now to the most important aspect, the sound quality. Let's just say that it is absolutely incredible. The overall sound is very balanced. The bass is tight and pumpy, the mids are very well balanced and vocals are crisp and clear. I am truly surprised as to how good these are. To give you a better idea, I will describe my experience of listening to different genres so you can decide if this product is right for you.Rock/Metal/Hardcore - Usually it is very hard to find a pair of headphones that work with these genres. Most headphones these days are tweaked to sound good with the more mainstream music with enhanced bass which causes sounds of instruments to sound muddy and unbalanced. However, these headphones are very good. It provides good balanced sound with crisp and clear vocals that gives sort of a surround sound feel. The bass is tight enough for you to hear bass drums and it creates an awesome experience.Hip Hop - These headphones are solid for this genre however not the best. Due to the balanced sound the clarity is great, you can hear all the different instruments involved however the bass isn't as heavy as most people prefers. This problem however can be solved easily. If you use a smartphone as your music listening device, you can just install an application called ""Music EQ"" that gives you total control of the sound output of your device and you are then able to crank up the bass.Electronic Music - This genre does shine when it comes to this product. The sounds are very crisp and you can hear every effect involved very clearly. The bass drops are very strong and a total pleasure to listen to. I don't have much to say other than that these are quite good for music such as EDM, dubstep etc.Overall these headphones are phenomenal. From the build quality to the overall sound, these scream premium. The price point might be a little high for a lot of people but I am very sure that these are worth the investment. Not only are you getting an amazing product but you are also getting an amazing customer service team behind it. From my experience of speaking to the owner of the company, I can assure the future buyers that they will be in very good hands. I highly recommend this product and truly believe this is a great investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTTL35NXJ5RCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4V0QSK#wasThisHelpful","RTTL35NXJ5RCF","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in the market for a pair of affordable headphones with quality sound. I already own a pair of high end headphones but did not feel comfortable using them for rough usage such as going to the gym or when I am working around the house fixing things. Thankfully, brainwavz reached out to me and offered me this product to test it out in order to provide an honest review. At first I had a very low expectation because I had no experience with this company before. However, once I received them in the mail, I was blown away. The quality and performance for this product far exceeds its price point. Starting from the build quality, the ear phones have a metal outer body with a beautiful brushed finish that not only looks good, but also feels very comfortable. The ear phones are very compact, they fit inside the ear and stays in firm and secure. I have used this pair of headphone under rough conditions such as jogging every morning and they never fell out, stayed inside very secure. The most amazing aspect of this product has to be its performance. The sound quality is superb. It is very balanced, has huge clarity and good bass. Most in-ear headphones in this price range usually outputs sound with heavy bass that creates a muddy sound, which compromises clarity. However as I have stated before, The Brainwavz delta earphones have a very impressive balanced sound with a good balanced bass.Now to provide an accurate review for the sound quality, I have tested this product for different genres of music. I am going to list them and share my experience so you can focus on your favorite genre to see if this works for you.Rock/Metal/Hardcore - I listen to a lot of rock and heavy metal music. I personally prefer a balanced sound with a kick on the bass for a powerful sound. For these genres, the headphones perform very well. Sometimes it does lack bass but vocals are very well balanced that does not overpower the instruments. Overall they are very impressive.Electronic Music - What can I say? I am in love. I do not listen to much electronic music but I truly believe a good pair of headphones can enhance the experience. While listening to this genre, the instruments was crisp, precise, and very balanced. The bass was very good and to hear the drops were a pleasure.Hip-Hop - This is the only genre where the headphones lacked a little. The vocals are very good, and sounds very balanced mixed with the beats. However, for many songs the bass was not very strong. I personally prefer a balanced sound so I enjoyed my experience, however for people who listens to Hip-Hop/Rap and prefers heavy bass, you might be a little disappointed.I am very happy with this product. It definitely outshines it's competitors within its price range. I feel guilty for doubting Brainwavz in the first place but after trying this product, I must say I am a fan. If you are in the market for a pair of affordable headphones, do not look any further. Drop all your doubts, and purchase this product, it is excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UKKYZAEFDPZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSA8VQ2#wasThisHelpful","R3UKKYZAEFDPZK","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Music is a big part of my life. Whether I am at the gym or I am at work, music is always there with me. I work with friends who are producers and musicians so I am always exposed to high end headphones. Over the years I have developed a love for them and slowly started to collect them just because various headphones perform better for certain genres of music. When I came across Brainwavz, I was really intrigued. The designs are very original and they promise great sound at an affordable price. Of course me being a headphone junkie, I had to try these out to make sure if the products actually performed to their promises.When the product first arrived to my house, to be honest the packaging caught me off guard, in a positive way. The headphones come packaged very nicely in a big box displaying the product, however it has a flap on the front of the box that you can open which exposes the headphones inside the box along with a beautiful carrying case. On the opposite side, you are given thorough details of the headphones and the technology behind it. After reading all the details on the box, which by the way is a good read, I opened up the box and took the headphones out. Right away, I was very impressed by the build quality. The headphones are built from metal and has a very nice finishing on the surface, close to a bead blasted finish. They are designed to go over your ear. Now I will admit that I am not a huge fan of the over the ear design, but I seriously fell in love with this one. Why? well there are two reasons. The first reason is, the selection of the tips you are given. Brainwavz really goes out their way to assure you of your perfect fit. They include 4 sets of tips, in two different colors (Grey and Black) to match your preference and comfort. For serious bass heads, there is a triple layered tip that goes deep in your ear to provide a big bass sound that cannot be achieved from normal buds. I have never seen such tips before and I fell in love with them instantly. However, if you are someone that cares for comfort more than sound, don't worry. Brainwavz also includes a pair of tips that are constructed of memory foam which are extremely comfortable and I use them regularly. Second reason why I love the design is because of the balance. Usually in ear headphones tend to be very unreliable when it comes to a secure fit. During my workouts they always tend to either pop out or become uncomfortable. That is why I do not use them anymore. However it has been a different case for these. The over the ear design not only provides a better fit, but it is also a more secure fit. However nothing is perfect and there is one aspect that did bother me, but might not be a big deal to others, heck it might even be a positive. The wire of the headphones tend to run a little to big for my liking. I usually use bluetooth headphones for my everyday activities because I dislike cables getting in the way. While I was trying out these headphones for the gym, they were kind of bothersome because the wires kept getting in my way, however for my brother who also tried these headphones on (for a second opinion) he had no problem. So it really depends on your preference.Now to the most important thing, sound. Even though the headphones have a wonderful build quality and appearance, it really does not compare to the performance of this product. I was honestly blown away by the balance and clarity. I usually listen to genres such as Rock, Heavy Metal, Classical, and more genres that are driven instrumentally. Usually headphones these days are geared towards the popular music such as EDM, Hip Hop, RnB etc. They usually have heavy bass and those headphones are really not fun for other genres because music tends to come out muddy. Of course to provide accurate information, I tested these headphones on the general popular genres just to see the range it is capable of. I cannot stress enough how impressive the range of these earbuds are compared to the price. When I listened to Rock/Metal music, it was not so bass heavy but rather clear. I was able to distinguish all the different instrumentals being played while still getting the kick from bass drums. The vocals are usually overpowering but with these headphones everything flows very well and it is honestly a pleasure to listen to. If you listen to rock/metal but prefer a much more heavier sound from bass, these won't be the best choice but these still have some serious bass power which balances very well without making the sound muddy. Next, I listened to some EDM and Hip Hop music. Keep in mind these are genres I do not listen to very often but I was thoroughly impressed. The bass was loud but once again not muddy, even at high volume. The one thing I keep going back to and that is the clarity of the sound it projects. While listening to these genres, I was able to hear the beats/sounds clearly and it was honestly a wonderful experience. Afterwards I decided to mess around with the equalizer and I was able to get a very bass heavy sound that messed up the clarity, but it did create a heavier sound that many people prefer.Overall these are wonderful headphones. The build quality is great and the performance is superb. With so many headphones these days it is really hard for us to decide on which to purchase and which is right for us. These headphones provide great sound with clarity that should be appreciated. For the price point, I think this product is an absolute steal and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of entry earbud that provides a taste of high end sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W1LCAGCFAEJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4UQ6U8#wasThisHelpful","R3W1LCAGCFAEJH","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With summer right around the corner, I have been looking around for a portable speaker that I will be able to carry around with me. I do a lot of work around the house and it does get annoying wearing headphones for long periods of time, especially when I am doing a lot of physical work. I already have higher end speaker systems around the house, so I was not planning on investing too much money for another new listening device. After much research here on Amazon, I landed across this product. Now, when I saw the low price point I honestly had really low expectations. I just required something simple so I purchased this device anyway expecting the worst. Well I guess the term ""never judge a book by it's cover"" applies perfectly to this situation. This device is absolutely incredible and I will explain why I feel that way.Right away, the first aspect that grabs your attention is the beautiful appearance of the device and it's build quality. It is very simple. The entire body of the device is crafted from plastic, however do not let that turn you away. To test it's durability, I have dropped this device about 3 times from about 4 feet high and it did not break nor did it have any cracks. When you first turn on the device, right away you see two bright blue LED lights start blinking under the device to inform you that it is ready to be connected to a Bluetooth device. The connection was very easy and simple, took about 30 seconds. If you don't have a bluetooth device, you can still use this speaker. Not only is it a bluetooth device, it can also be used as an external speaker by connecting a music player to the speaker using an AUX cable which is also provided along with the speaker, which is a great addition. Don't like carrying around a music player along with the speaker? no worries this device also has a port for a mini SD card in the back of the device. Once you enter the SD card, the speaker automatically loads the music files and starts playing.Aside from the looks and functions, let's talk about the most important aspect and that is the sound quality. I must say, I am blown away. The sound is very clear, projects to create a form of surround sound, and has a very strong punch for good bass. I mainly listen to Hard Rock/Heavy Metal music. For me the key essential thing is clarity. I like hearing every instrument being balanced along with vocals and to my surprise this device did just that. I have headphones/speakers that cost 3-4 times more than this device but does not project music with this much clarity. Now, I understand my preferred genre isn't the most popular, so I decided to test this device on other genres. For listeners of electronic music, you can expect to hear those big bass drops without having a muddy sound and actually see the speaker vibrate, it is awesome. For Hip-Hop/Rap listeners, you can expect a perfect balance between the vocals and beats. For fans of vocals such as RnB music or country, this bad boy is for you guys also. It projects vocals very well and as I have stated many times before, the clarity of the music being projected is scary good for a speaker at this price point.Now last but not least, endurance. This speaker has a lifespan of about 3-4 hours with one full charge while perforing at full sound. Of course it does work while charging. To charge the device completely, it takes about two hours, which is my only con for this device. I wish the lifespan per charge was a bit longer due to the long charging time. However, it is one compromise I understand. For a product to be priced this low and perform this good, it is darn near perfect.If you are in the market for an affordable portable speaker, this is it. I highly recommend this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MVY3CL7VAN9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HR1TZBA#wasThisHelpful","R1MVY3CL7VAN9A","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a wall charger, this is it. I currently work and attend college full time, so basically I am out of the house for majority of the day. My life and work related tasks revolves around my wireless devices such as my phone, tablet, etc. So, I always require my devices to be charged and ready to go every morning. Every time I had to charge my devices, I had to connect them in three different inserts around the house and it would be an annoying process to constantly check up on my devices to make sure they didn't over charge. So I decided to look around to see if I could find an alternative to my problem and well, I came across this product.The OXA 4 USB Port Wall Charger is just plain awesome. Not only is it very compact, but it also has a very appealing appearance. Front the front, the adapter looks very simple and has a classic design that we see everyday on other products similar to this, however the true beauty is where the insert of the ports are. The back of the Charger is done in a very stylish blue plastic, which reveals 4 USB ports. Once you connect the the wall adapter, it springs to life and the entire back of the wall charger lights up brightly, it is very nice. However, does it really matter if something looks nice but cannot perform? So I decided to put this product to the test. For a week straight, I charged 4 devices on it at once, twice a day. I charged an iPad, and 3 phones at the same time. I honestly expected the product to break from the high stress test but to my surprise, it performed just fine and still gets the job done.I am very pleased with this product. For the price point, I did not expect such a beautiful and solid product. I've had a few questions and the OXA customer service team has provided me with outstanding information. I am definitely a fan and highly recommend this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2T18MQKGLD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN6SC7I#wasThisHelpful","R1L2T18MQKGLD3","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As of today, wireless devices has become a part of our everyday lives. We use them for various different reasons. However, as much as they make our life easier, they tend to be weak in one aspect, and that is battery life. I am someone that relies heavily on my cell phone. I am currently a full time student while working full time. I am always out the house and I never get a chance to charge my device. It is crucial that I have my phone up and running at all times, mainly because I use it to keep track of my clients for work and any downtime can be hurtful to my business. So, I have tried all kinds of solution to solve my problem. From carrying around a charger to carrying around a spare battery, I have tried it all. that is where this power bank comes into play.So what is a PowerBank? Well, a simple answer is that it is a device that can be charged to hold electrical power. Since it is portable, you are able to carry this device with you anywhere you decide to go.OXA was very generous to reach out to me and asked me if I would be interested in trying this device out. Thank you to my previous experience with OXA, it was a no brainer for me since their products are always solid. When you receive this product, you will notice right away that it is packaged very well. So what is included the package? You receive the powerbank along with a USB wire that has a detachable head. This enables you to charge any device whether it be an apple product or an android device. The device has a very sleek appearance, the outer shell is crafted from polycarbonate and has a polished (shiny) finish throughout. My favorite aspect of the device has to be the display screen. Most powerbanks use lights to indicate the remainder balance of the device, however the display screen on this device shows the amount of power stored in percentage, which is really helpful since it is providing you with detailed information as to how much power you have left. Another nifty aspect of this device is that, if you click on the power button twice, it turns on the flashlight which is on the right side of the device.If you are someone who isn't very familiar with technical terms when it comes to technology, you might be asking yourself as to what 10,000mAh stands for. Well, in simple terms mAh is mainly used to measure the capacity of a battery. The higher the number, the more power it will be able to provide to keep a device running longer.Still confused? Well let me provide you with some examples.If you have a iPhone 4/5/5S, you will be able to charge your phone completely using this device about 3-4 times per charge.If you have a Samsung Galaxy Device, you will be able to charge your phone about 3-4 times.If you have a phone with a larger battery capacity such as the Galaxy Note 3 or LGG2, you will be able to charge your phone on the go about 2-3 times completely using this device.I tested this device mainly on my Google Nexus 5 which has a battery of 2300mAh, and I was able to charge it 4 times from one full charge on the OXA Powerbank.Overall for the price point, I think this is honestly one of the best buys when it comes to power banks.

"Suspense, dark settings, and mystery are key elements required to keep us at the edge of our seats. Edgar Allen Poe's short story ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" is based on just that. Growing up, I have always been intrigued by the supernatural and loved reading literature based on the certain subject. Whether it be a fictional story or actual experiences, it would peak my interest. While attending college, a professor of mine recommended that I read this story. For it's time, it was a very controversial story. What's not to love right? Well since it was written such a long time ago, the old English was hard for me to get a grasp of and was quiet difficult to comprehend as to what was unfolding in the story. It was sort of upsetting that I wasn't able to understand and could not decipher this story properly. Luckily, I came across this rewritten version of the book in contemporary English. Now, these authors did an excellent job. The story was rewritten very carefully with the same amount of detail as the original and not once did I feel confused nor have a hard time understanding.Reading this short story in contemporary English has helped me comprehend as to why this story is such a timeless classic. I want to give my gratitude to the authors for rewriting the entire story in contemporary English, they have done a wonderful job rewriting this classic while keeping the same elements of the original!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZMZOEKGOPQKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X09GGY#wasThisHelpful","R1ZMZOEKGOPQKI","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My days are hectic. I currently work full time and attend school full time. My days are filled with constant work, whether it be physical or mental. By the end of the day I am exhausted and burned out. Sleep is very important for me because it helps me regain my energy and prepares me again for the next day. Lately I have been struggling trying go get a goodnight sleep due to some back problems and just not being comfortable while asleep. So I decided to give this product a try and well, I am extremely excited that I did!The pillow is very firm but yet soft, extremely comfortable. It comes packaged very nicely and looks very nice. The pillow fit perfectly inside the pillow cover and right away looked much fluffier and better than all the other pillows in my house. My first night, I did not know what to expect. Usually I sleep on two pillows to get a comfortable balance for my neck. Since this pillow is firm and big, I decided to sleep with just this one and not use the other pillows. To my surprise, it was very balanced and felt amazing. To explain the best way possible, it felt as if I was laying on a marshmallow. For the past few days I have been using it, I've been getting great sleep with no back pain whatsoever like I used to experience before. It is kind of astonishing as to how important and what a difference a pillow can be for a good night sleep.I usually try to stay neutral while reviewing a product but it is going to be hard for this one. I highly recommend this pillow if you are looking for a firm but soft pillow that will give you great balance and comfort while sleeping. The price point is definitely great, and the customer service behind this company is outstanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSOB77KTIJTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUTQLRQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BSOB77KTIJTR","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a full time student and employee, I am barely ever home. Having a cell phone up and running is very important. Not only do I use my cell phone to keep in touch with friends and family, but I also use it to for work related tasks. Now, as great and powerful cellphones are today, they do lack something very important and that is a good battery life. I have tried many alternatives such as carrying an extra battery, charging in middle of class, and going as far as carrying an extra phone to make sure I never lose contact with my clients. However, all those alternatives turned out to be a hassle. Eventually I came across power banks and decided to give them a try. So why did I decide to try this product? Price and size.The Oxa power bank comes packaged very well and looks very professional. I was kind of surprised to expect such presentation for the low price point. Once you open the package, you receive the power bank and USB wires to charge the device of your choosing. It does not come pre-charged, well at least mine did not. It took about an hour to charge the power bank completely. When in charge, there is a hidden LED light under the case that just springs to life, letting you know that the device is under use. There are many aspects of this product that one can cherish, such as the compact size that makes it easy to carry, the led light confirming that the product is under use, and the different devices it is compatible with. However there is one aspect that stopped this product from becoming great. The power output to charge a device is very slow. It took about two hours to completely charge one device of 2300mAh. I have similar power banks which cost about twice the price, but however they charge at double the rate.At the end of the day if you are looking for an affordable power bank that you can just grab on the go and leave plugged in your bag to charge your device, then this is absolutely great. However if you are someone such as me who lives a fast paced lifestyle and requires more power and efficiency, than you would be better off spending a bit more and getting something stronger, such as other higher end oxa products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WQ91FC1G22E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E2YI052#wasThisHelpful","R18WQ91FC1G22E","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living an active life, I am always on the go. From checking e-mails to contacting clients, let's just say my phone is always under use. As great as smartphones are these days, they still lack one thing and that is a strong battery life. Thankfully, 5 Star America reached out to me one day and offered me to try out their power bank. I thought this was a great opportunity because considering my lifestyle, it would be the perfect situation to test this product. I've tested this product over a period of weeks to test not only it's performance but it's endurance. Over the years I have tried many products that worked great out of the box but failed to perform after a few weeks due to its poor quality, however that didn't turn out to be the case with this product.My performance and endurance test is pretty rigorous. I fully charged this product twice everyday. Once in The morning when I wake up and once before I leave work. After charging fully, I used it right say to charge my phone, which gave my Nexus 5 one full charge with a little bit of juice left in the bank. After this doing a little over a week, the charger still performed flawlessly and I have been using it since. Overall it is a wonderful product and for the price, not only does it look good but it is also a good performer. If you are in the market to try a power bank, don't be hesitant to try this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIJJ46E6DNUZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ71LMA#wasThisHelpful","RIJJ46E6DNUZS","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As technology progresses, we are introduced with new products that can be either useful or just for entertainment. I've always been intrigued by wireless chargers however I never wanted to pay the premium price that big manufacturers are charging as of now. I was very honored when the RavPower team reached out to me and offered me a chance to try out their new product for an honest review. I jumped at the opportunity and went in with an open mind. The RavPower team was very hasty. They shipped my package the same day of my response and the package arrived to me within two days.My first initial impression was a very positive one. The packaging of the product is very appealing. It is an all white small box with the product display picture on top, very simple but stylish. Once you open the package, you see the product right away, packaged very carefully. The design of this product is what made me fall in love. It has a very appealing look and very easy to store away since the size is so compact. The length of this product Is only about 4 inches long and has a grip on top to keep the phone being charged to stay in place and stay secure. I have tested this product using my Nexus 5 and it stood in place securely even when I bumped the phone lightly to see if it moved or fell off. Keep in mind the Nexus 5 is much larger than the charger and a little push or nudge will cause it to move and fall off due to it being unbalanced but I have not experienced that while using this product, the grip is very secure.Now the most important part, performance. I have always preferred the classical way of plugging in the charger and leaving my phone to get charged over a few hours. When I first received this wireless charger, I had to adapt to a new way of charging. I decided to take it to work and leave it on my desk, just because it looks so stylish. Every morning my phone would barely have any battery left at around 2% and I would just place it on the charger, which would start to charge the phone instantly. Within about 1 hour and 15 minutes, my phone would be fully charged. The Nexus 5 has a battery of 2300Mah, and I find it very impressive that the charger was able to charge my phone fully within such a small time period considering it is wireless.A wireless charger is not only a ""cool"" concept but also a very useful accessory. Why is that? Well it is a charging base that you can just place your phone on and it will start charging right away, without requiring you to keep finding a wire to connect to your phone every time you are willing to charge. Another huge advantage is that it gives you the ability to be portable. Whenever I am at work and I receive a call, I can just pick up my phone from the charger and talk without having to worry about unplugging anything. When I'm done talking, I can just place my phone back on the charger and it will start charging again instantly. Overall it is a wonderful product and I highly recommend it to anyone who are willing to get into the world of wireless charging without breaking the bank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZRWCKKIVATQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN5U5N8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZRWCKKIVATQX","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently I have had a urge to wear clothes that are fashionable, but much different than the norm we see in the states. I decided to browse around Amazon for some interesting designs and discovered this brand H2H. I've noticed that this is a Korean company and sizing is usually smaller than what we are used to in the US, so I decided to go one size higher than my usual. I normally wear Medium, but decided to go Large in US size.Once I received the cardigan I was very impressed with the overall quality and feel of the product. It is thick and soft, very comfortable to wear. At first you might be think the material might not be heavy enough for the winter time, however it keeps you very warm, I adore it. This cardigan does have only 1 button that holds the two sides together, right in the middle.Now I do have one issue with one color. I can't speak for the most of the colors but when I purchased the Red cardigan, I expected it to be like the picture. However when I received the product, it was a very and I mean very light shade of red, almost close to pink. It is a very feminine color and many people thought I was wearing a women's cardigan. I do like the look but I ended up giving it to my mom who loved the cardigan and I decided to grab a black one, which looks much better in my opinion.Overall it is a beautiful product that I couldn't recommend enough. It is light, warm, fashionable, extremely comfortable, and everything a good cardigan should be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36KZ51FUMPKW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQVPO12#wasThisHelpful","R36KZ51FUMPKW7","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My schedule is hectic. Almost every day I attend college from 8AM to 3:30PM, and right after I work from 4PM to 12PM. Both school and work involves me using my phone. Whether it's contacting clients or researching information for classroom discussions, let's just say my Galaxy S4 is always under heavy usage. Even though the S4 has a much improved battery life than the previous models, it is still no where near perfect to run an entire day on one charge. I was lucky enough to be contacted by RAVPower to try this product. When I realized this product would enable me to charge my device and a spare batery, I was very excited because this would solve my battery issues for long days. Due to my previous positive experiences with their products, I decided to try this one out without any hesitation.Within two days the product was at my doorstep. The charging dock came packaged very nicely in a box. Once I took the product out of the box, I was very impressed by the overall build and quality. For the price point, the design and attention to detail really caught my attention. The front part of the docking system has a beautiful glossy finish to match your S4's body, whereas the sides of the product has a matte finish, complementing the S4's brushed steel look. The back of the charging system has a little insert to charge a spare battery. Now, it has a little LED light to show if the battery is charging. When the LED light is glowing red, it indicates that the battery is charging. Once the charging is complete, the LED light switches from RED to GREEN. The charging time for the docking system is extremely fast, within about an hour I can charge my phone completely. The charging time for the spare battery isn't as fast, it takes about 1 hour and 40ish minutes to charge the battery completely, which isn't bad at all.For the price point, RAVpower is enabling customers of Amazon to get a gorgeous charging dock for a very low price. The quality and performance of the product does not make sense for the price point. If you are someone such as me with a busy schedule or if you are just someone who likes to put their phone under heavy usage, this is a great product for you because it will always enable you to have a spare fully charged battery, no matter where you are.RAVPower has an amazing customer service team. I've never had any problems with their products but they have always taken their time to respond to any questions I have ever had in order to make sure that I was fully content. I highly recommend this product, not only for it's performance and quality but also for the company that is behind it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3ROKICQ2B9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E7NWAKY#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3ROKICQ2B9P","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love watches, they are a passion of mine. Once in a while I decide to change up the look of my watches by changing up straps to create new looks to keep them interesting. Recently I purchased a watch that had a poor quality bracelet and I decided instead of buying a new bracelet, I would replace it with a good quality leather band. Now, after browsing through amazon for a few hours, I came across this pair and I really fell in love with the light tan color displayed on the picture. However, I realized that the watch band was from the manufacturer DeBeer. Recently I bought a bracelet from the same company, and it was a very negative experience. Why? Well because the picture used to display the product was complete opposite. The description provided by the company was completely wrong and the quality was way below average (feel free to go to my profile and read that review). Me being a nice person, I decided to give them another try by ordering this product because frankly, everyone makes mistakes once in a while and I honestly thought this would be a good purchase.So after waiting anxiously, my package arrived after four days and I was very excited. As soon as I opened the package and took out the product, Once again I was hit by dissapointment and frustration. Once again they have provided me a product that looked nothing like the picture and the padding was completely different. The color of the band is much darker than the display picture. It is a very feminine orange, sort of a creamy color that is very shiny due to the oil tan finish. However to write a proper review, I decided to inspect the product up close in order to provide an accurate statement of the quality. Well, lets just say I wasn't surprised and I should've expected it. Similar to my previous experience of another product from this company, this strap was also of very poor quality. The bands were very stiff and felt very hard. I can't think how these straps would be comfortable. Just a horrible experience.At the end of the day I am done with this manufacturer. Not only are they overpriced for their poor products, but they also provide inaccurate information and misleading pictures in order to trick consumers into purchasing their products. I understand the price isn't high compared to other brands, however within this price range there are various other companies such as Hadley Roma that provide much higher quality. Also another factor to keep in mind, DeBeer does not pay you for return shipping, even though they provide misleading and inaccurate information. So buyer beware. If you decided to order, keep in mind you will be out five bucks if you decide to return the product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJHR3WT2QRU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KFN42S#wasThisHelpful","R2RJHR3WT2QRU7","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am one of the very few people who actually prefer slip on shoes sneakers. I came on amazon to browse for a slip on sneaker that was all black because it is a very versatile color that looks good with anything you decide to wear for the day. After searching for a while I came across these shoes by puma. From the pictures, it looked very nice so I thought to myself why not try it? Considering Puma is a very reputable brand, I ordered without hesitation.Now when I received the package, and took out the shoes, they looked very stylish. However, looks aren't everything and some aspects of the shoes threw me off right away. First of all the shoes are very light in weight, and feels very flimsy. The entire shoe is made of synthetic leather. There isn't any sole in the middle of the shoes that cause them to bend, which can cause injuries to your foot if you live a very active lifestyle. The grip on the sole is also not very good, it can cause you to slip on wet or slippery floors. My job requires me to constantly move around and I have came across many times where I almost slipped. These shoes also run a little small when it comes to sizing. My shoe size is 11 but I usually wear 11.5 for a little breathing room but at 11.5 size, these shoes were a perfect fit on me. So order half a size larger than your normal size for a comfortable fit.These sneakers are very stylish like I've mentioned before. When you wear them, it feels as if the sneaker is a glove for your feet, giving it a very slim and sleek look. However the fit also becomes another con. I have very slim feet and even for me, the fit of the shoe is way too tight and does cause a tight grip around my ankle, causing pain and discomfort. If you however walk around for a while, the grip tend to loosen up a bit and it becomes quiet comfortable but if you stay idle or sit down, the grip tightens up again causing pain and discomfort.At the end of the day if you have slim feet and looking for a sleek sneaker that will look good with skinny jeans or summer wear, then these are great for you. However if you are looking for a comfortable pair of slip on sneakers or do not have slim feet,  avoid this one because you will be highly disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1Z5QFCF2OKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AONVENK#wasThisHelpful","R1L1Z5QFCF2OKG","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not really a huge fan of leather straps. I usually prefer the looks of bracelets much more. However as a watch enthusiast, I like to change up the look of my watches once in a while to keep things interesting. A good quality leather strap can cost a lot, sometimes over $100. I wasn't looking to spend that much, so I decided to browse amazon to see some selections and what were my options for an affordable pair. Now this was during summer time and I hate when sweat builds up and cause the leather bands to release a horrible smell. After doing some research I came across many who recommended water resistant leather bands which does not absorb sweat and does not cause horrible odors. Of course I did not believe it at first, but considering Hadley Roma is a reputable brand and the price was so low, I decided to purchase this item.My first impression was a very positive one. The leather straps came packaged very well in a clear plastic box, exposing the item. Once I opened up the package and took out the straps, right away I realized the quality was very good. The stitching is done very well and the straps actually taper down from 24MM to 22MM creating a sleek look, that does not create an overpowering presence that takes away from the watch. At first the straps are sort of stiff and will need breaking down for it to be comfortable. After a few days, the straps broke in and became very comfortable to wear. During the summer I wore this strap for long periods of time and not once did it absorb a lot of sweat and cause any sort of odor, so the water resistance coating is very well stitched and done.Overall for the price, I truly believe this product is an absolute steal and if you are in the market for a good pair of leather straps that does not cause odor and also comfortable to wear, consider this one. I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD7KUVA39H313/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EJGXVW#wasThisHelpful","RD7KUVA39H313","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a world where technology is advancing every day, we are always introduced with new products. When I first heard of wireless chargers I was astonished by the idea. I kept thinking to myself how is that even possible. Right away I knew it was something that had my interest and I was convinced that I had going to get one. However, wireless chargers tend to be very expensive and sadly I could not afford it. Then came this product from RAVpower. Now at this price you have to be a little skeptical, it's natural to question great deals and sadly I felt the same way. RAVPower decided to reach out to me and offer me a discounted deal to try this product, and that gave me assurance because I respect a company that goes out of its way to back it's products to customers.Within two days the product showed up at my door and I was very excited. My first impression was very positive. The product came packaged beautifully and very securely. When I opened up the packaging and took the wireless charger out, I was thoroughly impressed by the quality and modern look of the product, It is very appealing in person. Now the set up is probably the easiet thing in the world, you do not even need the instruction guide that is provided. All you need to do to get started is to lay down the charging pad, and connect the adapter to the wall. In order to charge your phone, just lay it down on the pad, give it a few seconds, and watch the phone start charging. Now keep in mind not all phones are capable of wireless charging, even very new models such as the Samsung Galaxy S4. Since I am a S4 user, I had to purchase an off market Qi Receiver, which is a very thin pad that you attach on top of your battery on the inside of your phone. They are generally very very cheap and can be bought from amazon. Once the Qi receiver is installed, you are good to go!I have tested this product extensively, putting it under a lot of stress and heavy use this past week. I've charged back to back phones for seven days straight and it is performing flawlessly. Keep in mind since it is wireless charging, your phone will not charge from it as fast as a regular charger. However, the downtime isn't that big off a difference where it is a deal breaker. A traditional charger takes about two hours to charge my S4 completely whereas, the wireless charging takes about three hours. At the end of the day it is a very hassle free way of charging and a very cool concept. Not only is the price one of the best in the market, if not the best for a reliable, durable and beautiful wireless charging pad, but the RAVPower team also provides amazing customer service. For me even if a company has good products and great deals, I will still avoid them if they have mediocre to poor customer service. I've never had any problem with RAVPower products over the past year since I've started using them, however the few times I did reach out to their customer service team with questions, the head product manager took time and took care of me to make sure I was completely satisfied. If you have any worries, put them aside and purchase this product. This is a great company that not only provides amazing deals, but also makes sure that their customer is happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3443SPG5UKZKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMZPQIG#wasThisHelpful","R3443SPG5UKZKP","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a watch enthusiast, I am always looking for ways to change up the looks of my watches to keep things interesting and the best way to do that is to change straps/bracelets. I have never really liked NATO straps before but for some reason I just decided to come on Amazon and browse through the selection. To be specific, I was looking for an Orange/Black combination and this was the one that was the most appealing to me. Since NATO straps are cheap, I decided to order this one just to try it out. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I received the package the very next day and put it on my watch right away. At first I thought my watch looked a bit funny because I was not used to NATO straps, however I fell in love right away after putting it on.The quality of this NATO is superb. The stitching's are done very precisely and the bracelet is very thin. The three buckles are highly polished and they are of very good quality. The strap was very easy to install and on the wrist it is very comfortable, for the summer days it is perfect. The strap is quiet long and I am sure it will fit anyone's wrist up to 8 1/2 inches. Overall for the money, it is a very good investment and if you are on the edge of purchasing this product, trust me buy it. I am very happy with this product and it has helped me become fond of NATO straps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9K43MGYEKMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005V904I8#wasThisHelpful","R1H9K43MGYEKMR","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently the bracelet for my Hamilton Jazzmaster Cushion broke and I decided that instead of switching to a pair of  leather straps I already owned, I was going to replace the bracelet. So I came on Amazon to see what kind of bracelets were being offered in the 24MM measurement and after browsing around for a while, I came to the conclusion that this product was the most appealing and best fit for my watch. Without hesitation, I ordered and waited patiently. The first thing that bothered me was that the company never provided a tracking number and it had me a little worried, but the item did arrive after 3 days. When I received the package I was very excited because the field of horology and collecting watches are a passion of mine, and changing bracelets/straps is a huge but very exciting part of the hobby. I opened the package right away to find the small packaging that included the bracelet. The bracelet was being displayed beautifully on the package but there was a red flag right away. The bracelet was missing the top links on both sides, which means that if you were to put the bracelet on the watch, it would have 2 little holes and expose the spring bars, creating a horrendous look. Another thing that really upset me was that the description provided by the company and listed on Amazon was completely wrong. The description on Amazon states that the outer links are polished and the inside links are done with a brushed finish (Just like the display picture) but the actual bracelet is exactly the opposite, which is the inside links are highly polished and the outer links are done with a brushed finish. The display pictures for the listing is completely wrong and needs to be updated along with the description listed.Even though the bracelet was missing the top two links and the description was completely wrong, I decided to take it out of the package to see if the quality was good in order to provide an accurate review. As soon as I took the bracelet out of the package to inspect it's quality, you guessed it, another huge red flag. First of all, the finishing looks very cheap and I've never seen a bracelet pick up so much fingerprint/dirt so quickly. Second thing, the bracelet was very light and feels very flimsy. Just by holding it, I can tell the links are hollow and would break very easily if they were to be exposed to any kind of harsh stress/contact. To give you an idea, you can expect a bracelet of this caliber from a very cheap watch and that is very disappointing.It's understandable if you get one or two things wrong, but to advertise with pictures and descriptions for a product that is exactly the opposite, it kind of makes me feel like I have been scammed. Not only was I fooled, but the quality of the bracelet is very poor. I know of a few small manufacturers who create bracelets of very good quality, superior quality compared to this product, but charge way less. Not only did I waste time waiting for this product to arrive, I ended up being highly disappointed. I ended up returning this item and it is ironic that the company did not cover the return shipping charges, even though it was a mistake on their part. If you are in the market for a 24MM bracelet, I highly advise you skip this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CELNFISB4DIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003P8BNWI#wasThisHelpful","R2CELNFISB4DIX","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many of you out there, when I am taking a shower, I tend to become a genius. I've come across many ideas for work, writing music, and even sometimes for projects involving school. Usually when I do think of such wonderful ideas, I try to keep repeating them in my head so I can remember them once I get out of the shower, but sadly I fail most of the time. Thanks to my wonderful girlfriend, she has purchased this product for me since I always complain to her about how I come up with such great ideas, but always tend to forget them. Well not anymore! This product is absolutely brilliant. It is very compact, easy to install, and not to mention very easy to write on while the water is running. However nothing is perfect. The impermeable cover on the sheets tend to fall off when exposed to moisture for a long time, about a week or so. If you are someone who do not plan on using these regularly, you will need to rip out the front sheet every few weeks because as I have mentioned before because due to the exposure to moisture, the impermeable cover on the sheets will come off, making them non-waterproof. Also a quick suggestion, after your shower is over, I recommend that you give it a bit of time for the sheet to dry up a little because it makes the sheets easier to rip off. If you aren't a regular user, you can also place this product outside of the shower, so they do not get too much water contact. It will make the sheets last much longer. Hopefully I was helpful! If you are someone like me who comes up with great ideas while in the shower, this is a must have for you! A great little invention, I ma a huge fan!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCHDM1USU739/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003W09LTQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FCHDM1USU739","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:03 MinsAs a young watch enthusiast, I do not feel comfortable financially investing in the higher tier watches, however I am slowly building my watch collection by attaining some affordable luxury watches which are true Swiss Made and from a reputable company with a rich history. Now if you do not know of the brand Hamilton, it was originally an American brand but however they are now owned by the Swatch group which is a Swiss watch group that consists of legendary brands such as Longines and Omega. Within the watch community or to watch enthusiasts, Hamilton is a very reputable company and held dear by a lot. Knowing that, I decided to purchase my first Hamilton, however I did not know at the time which model to choose. After browsing through the catalog, I decided my first Hamilton would be something from the Jazzmaster series, and if you are not familiar with the Jazzmaster series, it is basically Hamilton bringing a lot of retro designs back and adding a little modern edge to it to make it very fashionable and appealing to today's world. While browsing through the catalog, I came across this design and it caught my attention right away because of the case shape, which is what the watch is named after, the cushion. Now living in a modern society, you will rarely see in your life someone wearing a cushion shaped watch, and just because of that reason alone, I purchased this watch, for its uniqueness. Of course, there is a lot more to the watch for the price being higher than your average watch, and I will clarify as to why. I will be setting my review up within three categories so you can focus on the aspect that is the most important to you before investing on this watch.Body/Dial - the body is the most important aspect of this watch as we know from the name. It is a very unique shape that will definitely stand out from the crowd and will definitely get you attention. The beautiful cushion shape body has two finishing. The bezel and sides are done with a high polished finish, however the lugs are done with a brushed finish. Hamilton is by one of the superior companies compared to most of the industry when it comes to constructing a case, and they are very well known for it. Once you take the watch out of the box you will find no imperfections, all of the brushed finish is done with every stroke perfectly aligned and the polished finish just looks as if the metal is melting and merging naturally with other parts of the watch. The dial of the watch is absolutely breathtaking which is protected by a beautiful sapphire crystal with an anti-reflective coating on the inside of the crystal. While keeping it simple and retro, Hamilton modernized the watch by adding a smaller sunray dial in the middle while leaving the outer portion matte black.  Most companies or designers would not be able to execute these two entire different looks together, however Hamilton did an outstanding job. The hour markers and the hands are all silver with a very thin layer of luminous material that glow vividly in the dark, but only for a short moment with a full charge. Since it is a dress watch, the lack of lume is quiet understandable. The date is presented in the inner sun ray dial by the 3 o clock position. The back of the case has an exhibition case back, which means the the case back has a mineral crystal exposing the movement of the watch, letting you see the watch in action.The measurements of the bodyCase Diameter - 43MM but wears quiet larger, close to 45MM due to it being a cushion case.Case Thickness - About 12MMLug Width - 24MMMovement - The stock movement for this watch is the legendary ETA 2824-2. Now if you are not a watch enthusiast, you might be wondering to yourself, what the heck is that? Well for the people who are not very knowledgeable about movements, the ETA 2824 is considered to be a high grade automatic movement produced by ETA which is a manufacturer based in Switzerland. ETA is also part of the swatch watch group and known to be the largest Swiss movement manufacturer in the world. The ETA 2824 is a high caliber movement that is used by many companies that are producing high end Swiss watches, some coming in around $2,000 to $4,000. So what is so special about this movement? Well first of all an automatic movement requires no battery and it is purely mechanical that consists of hundred of micro components which are put together by bare hands, they are considered to be a pure work of art by many, that is why the cost of automatics are so high. The ETA 2824 consists of 25 jewels to add beauty to the movement but mainly to add more accuracy. Lower end automatic movements vibrate at about 21,600VPH whereas, the ETA 2824 performs at 28,800VPH. Now why is vibration so important? Well the higher the VPH of a movement, the more accurate it will be, not to mention the second hand will also be much more fluid and create a wonderful smooth sweeping motion across the dial. Over a week of having this watch, it is running about +10 seconds fast, which is remarkable for an automatic movement. The power reserve of this movement is about 42 hours fully winded, what that means is that if you keep the watch outside of a winder or do not wear it, the watch will have enough power to run for about 2 days. Keep in mind that the ETA 2824 has 3 variations that it comes in. First variation is the standard, which ETA supplies to most companies outside to the Swatch group that keeps time within 30 seconds per day and then there is the elaborated version, which is an improved version to keep more accurate time, within 7 seconds per day. Then there is the highest grade which is COSC certified, keeping time within 4 seconds a day. This watch comes stocked with a standard ETA 2824-2 but it can be regulated to be much more accurate.Bracelet - The bracelet of the watch is absolutely stunning visually, however in terms of quality, it was the one problem I had with the entire watch. Before my complains on the bscelet, lets focus on the positive aspects. Even though the bracelet is on the thicker side at 24MM, the bracelet actually plays very well on the wrist because of its slim feature. The outer links of the bracelet are highly polished and the inside links have a beautiful brushed finish. Both finishes are done flawlessly and looks absolutely stunning on the wrist, a real wow factor. Hamilton is very generous when it comes to the bracelet size. Unsized, the bracelet will easilt fit a wrist up to 8 1/2 inches. The weight is very light of the bracelet and that is where my only complain comes in. Hamilton is known to make decent bracelets but could do better for a brand that is considered to be luxurious by many. Instead of using screwed pins, the links are held together using friction pins, which are not as durable and known to break in the long run. Even though the bracelet isn't of the highest quality, the light weight actually balances the watch very well on your wrist and it is very comfortable overall. Since this watch comes in different variations with a leather strap, I am sure you can order the leather straps directly from Hamilton if you end up not liking the bracelet. However, I would always buy the bracelet variation over the leather strap variation just because lesther straps are much affordable to acquire compared to a good bracelet.At the end of the day this is a wonderful watch from a very prestigious brand with a very rich history. Hamilton is recognized around the world by many. For the price, you are not only getting the name and prestige, but also you are getting a legendary movement paired with a beautifully crafted time piece that is very unique and bound to turn heads while worn in public. In this price range, I cannot think of a better watch and I truly believe this is a true bang for the buck, a steal almost. Keep in mind from an authorized dealer, you will be paying the full retail price of $875, however thanks to amazon you are getting access to the most reputable online grey dealers who can offer you a much better price. After reading everything if you are still on the fence on whether to purchase this watch or not, trust me, go for it.Hopefully my review helped! If you have any question, comment or concer, always feel free to reach out to me because I am always up for a chat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD829BZ7IR00W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YT11OS#wasThisHelpful","RD829BZ7IR00W","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a society where mobile technology dominates, we are all accustomed to balance our life around our cell phones. From being a student to a person being involved in a professional career, we all need to use our mobile devices on a regular basis for various tasks. Sadly, nothing is perfect and as we all know from personal experience, battery power on mobile devices are very poor. However, there is always solutions to a problem, and this product happens to be a great one. For those who do not have much knowledge on what is a power bank, well it is a small device that has the capacity to store electricity, which enables you to charge your mobile devices anywhere on the go. It is such an important device because it gives you a peace of mind and now you will never have to worry about losing your phone's battery life while in the middle of an important task.Now before I wrote this review, I decided to put this device under very rough usage over a span of 3 weeks in order to test it's durability and performance. I wanted to make sure if you ended up purchasing this product, that you would get a solid Power Bank that would serve it's purpose over a long period of time. Before I get into the specifications, I would like to take a moment and talk about the construction and build of the product. First of all, the product comes packaged very well in a small white box. As soon as you pick up the box, you can feel the weight of the product, and yes it is a bit on the heavy side but it is to be expected since is a high capacity power bank. Once you open the box, you see the item placed by itself and the presentation is quiet nice and simple actually. The product itself is very well built with a thick plastic body and it is a great fit in the hand due to it's compact size. Even though at first it is only a piece of plastic box in your hand, you can actually pull out 3 different types of connectors from the sides which are used for different devices. The main connector is the 30 Pin connector made for apple products, but that is to be expected since this product was made mainly for Apple products. However, the other two connectors are for devices that require an USB plug-in or a micro-USB connector for devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Series or many different digital cameras. The coolest aspect of this gadget is that it has 5 mini bright LED lights that show's the capacity left. Each light represents 20%.Now on to the performance, as I have stated before, I put this device under very rough usage over a span of 3 weeks. To clarify, I have charged this to it's full capacity and drained it's entire capacity every single day. Since I do not own an iPhone, I let my girlfriend test the product for me under my conditions for a span of a week and a half. According to her observation, the device charged her iPhone completely from 0% about 3 times in one full charge. For each full charge for her phone, it took the device about 1 1/2 hours or 90 mins. Considering that she was on the go, it is a really quick charge while leaving the device connected to the phone in your bag. You are also able to use your phone while the device is charging it.Of course I wanted to do another week and a half of testing on my own to make sure her observations and the device was going to provide similar results for me. Since I do not have an iPhone, I decided to test the battery on two separate devices that I own, and they are the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the iPad 3. First of all, unlike the iPhone 4 my girlfriend used for testing, The galaxy S4's battery has about 33% more capacity, coming in at 2600maAh. So for the product to be successful, I expected the device to charge my phone completely about 2 times per full charge. I am glad to say after testing the product constantly for another week and a half, the device was able to charge my phone completely 2 times from a full charge every day and it took roughly two hours to charge my phone completely. So after 3 weeks of brutal testing, I decided to test it's ability to charge the iPad 3. From one full charge, it was able to charge my iPad 3 from 0 to 70% within three hours.It is ironic how I came across this product before but ignored it because it is manufactured by a company I have never heard of, however after trying this product I must say this is an absolute steal for the price and performance. Over the last couple of months RAVPower has really impressed me with their amazing customer service and their solid built products. This device was given to me as a sample to provide an honest review and I must say, I am quiet impressed. If you are in the market for a high capacity power bank for your mobile devices, don't even bother looking at the much more expensive power banks, purchase this one. I have tested it under rough circumstances and it withheld and did it's job, just a wonderful product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPZQF755LM5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009S0NIDO#wasThisHelpful","R1NPZQF755LM5I","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am the type of person that never carries around money but always my card. Ever since I have been introduced to wallet cases, it has been a huge bonus for me. Instead of carrying a wallet in one pocket and a phone on the other, now I can save much more space by having a case that acts as both. I am going to be setting up this review in different categories in order to give you a better idea of what you can expect.Body - The stitchings are done very well and the materials are of good quality. The outer portion of the case is stitched with Polyurethane leather, which gives you a solid feel, but also makes it very versatile because it is much more durable than normal leather and tear and wear won't cheapen the overall look like pure leather would. The inside of the case is padded to gives your phone extra protection just in case an accident were to happen. Inside of the cover there are 3 Slots for cards or money, whichever you prefer to store. The case stays close with a magnetic flap that closes on its own to keep the case shut, which is a big plus. Most flip covers does not have this magnetic flap mechanism and tends to move around enabling dirt and small particles to enter, which can end up scratching the screen of your phone. However, this case stays shut very well and provides great protection. The best aspect of this case that is not listed is that this phone is actually a Smart Cover. Just because it does not have the S Window, it is hard to notice that it does function as a Smart Cover. Now if you are not sure what a Smart Cover is, it is basically a cover that puts your phone on stand by when you close the case, putting it to standby mode enabling you to save battery. Great case!PROS- Smart Cover.- Built and stitched very well.- Padded to provide extra protection.- Auto closing magnetic flap, keeps the case closed.- Stores 3 Cards or money in the slots.Cons- Adds a bit if thickness, but not close to being a deal breaker.Overall this is a wonderful case that has features most expensive flip wallet cases do not. It is an absolute steal at this price and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a case similar to this one!If you have any questions or concerns, I highly urge you to contact me.

"I am somewhat of an unordinary child. Growing up, I always used to read about watches and movements from magazines around the house. About a while back, I picked up an issue of watch time and absolutely fell in love. They covered many watches in the affordable range and also gave me us an inside look at the very prestigious brands that I could never afford, but it was nice to get a glimpse of the work of arts. It was very well balanced, many articles for every collector. However, recently the issues have shifted towards the luxury brands and completely ditched the affordable watches. Watch time shifted from being a balanced magazine to a much more high end watch magazine for the rich. It is still a fun magazine to pick up and read about various aspects of the watch industry, however if you are someone like me who cannot afford the big names just yet and appreciate collecting and reading upon affordable watches, then you will be disappointed with Watch Time.It is still a fun read at the end of the day. If you are someone such as me who loves reading on horology  and gaining new knowledge, then you will still appreciate watch time. If you are someone who prefers variety, and an inside look at the more affordable watches, then you are better off not subscribing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13B59PQKXO05F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UHI61I#wasThisHelpful","R13B59PQKXO05F","A2UG220UJU5DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UG220UJU5DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In our current generation, almost everyone has a smart phone. Smart phones have become an essential part of our lives and they are under constant usage for everyday tasks. It's amazing to think such a small device can perform at such a high level and be able to support so many aspects of our lives. Now, every thing has a power source, and sadly smart phones still lack a very good battery life. However thankfully, there are a few alternatives to tackle this issue. Some prefer to carry around a power bank, which can be used to charge your phone anywhere and some prefer to carry around an extra fully charged battery, which is what I prefer.This High capacity Li-ion battery is from the manufacturer RavPower. Now prior to this item, I've had no experience with this company, so I did not know what to expect. Considering the price range for this 2800mAh battery, I honestly did not have high hopes. Once I received the item in the mail, I opened it up right away and was quiet surprised at the packaging, it as very well done. I decided to take out the stock battery that came with my Samsung Galaxy S4, and popped in the new battery by RavPower. The battery already came halfway charged, however I was astonished as to how fast the battery charged to it's full capacity.  Usually it takes me about 30-40 minutes to charge my S4's stock battery from half to full capacity, whereas this battery only took somewhere between 20-25 minutes, that's quiet an improvement. Another reason to consider this battery is, the stock battery is 2600mAh, whereas this battery comes at 2800mAh. Without the technical terms, what it really mean is that you will get a little bit more battery life out of this product.I was given this product as a sample to test after I came to an agreement with RavPower's product manager that I would provide an honest review of my experience, even if it were to be a negative one. After speaking to the product manager, I can assure you that this company has a great staff standing behind their products and provides great customer service. I mention that because this product comes with a no question asked 30 days money back guarantee and a year long warranty to replace the product free of charge if it were to break down. Many companies state such claims but fails to provide them, however that will not be the case with RavPower. After testing this product out, I recommend it to you with confidence and I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you have any questions or concern, please feel free to contact me.

"I just bought this machine for a friend for an early Christmas present. We bought from JoAnn's because it gives a free lesson plus she can take it in for repairs or any kind of question she has. I have the 7258 which is the same machine but did not come with nice extras like the extension table and walking foot like this one does. I sat with my friend while the salesperson went over all of the features plus she showed her how to use all of the feet that came with it. The 2 best features are the auto tension and needle up or down. (so important if you are turning square corners). I highly recommend this machine. I buy a lot from Amazon and they have the best return policy, bar none, but my friend needed extra instructions because she is new to sewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32670YYSJKN96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADSGAF8#wasThisHelpful","R32670YYSJKN96","A2U2OJCDRNQNBF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U2OJCDRNQNBF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The forward to this book is promising. It states that this book consists of two lectures given by the illustrious Italian political philosopher Giorgio Agamben at a seminar at Stanford University concerning civil war on October 2001. The subtitle for this book is “Civil War as a Political Paradigm,” promised to be an illuminating read of Agamben presenting his theory of civil war following the cataclysmic changes wrought by 9/11.This is not what the book is about, sort of. The book consists of two lectures alright, but one lecture describes civil war in ancient Greece and the other is (sort of) about civil war according to Thomas Hobbes.The first lecture concerns civil war in ancient Greece. Essentially civil war was considering to be an inter-family dispute and struggle, not surprising considering the close-net nature of society in Greece at that time. Fairly straightforward.The second lecture concerns civil war according to the political philosophy of Hobbes. While the subject of civil war is mentioned, of course, but the main focus of Agamben is on other matters. But that’s okay. Agamben’s discussion of those other matters is probably more interesting.I would say the main focus of the second lecture is the decipherment of the famous engraving of the first edition of the Leviathan which graces many, if not most, modern editions of the work.  This engraving is packed symbols containing esoteric meaning which can be understood only with reference to Hobbes’ philosophy, and, according to Agamben, made according to his express instructions.As I indicated, this is the most interesting part of the book. Political philosophers such as Carl Schmitt have expounded on the meaning of the symbolisms in the frontpiece of the Leviathan. Agamben even talks about why Hobbes’ work was even so named. The Leviathan, after all, is the Biblical anti-Christ and arch-demon. Was this Hobbes’ opinion about the rough and tumble nature of everyday politics? Agamben does not provide any answers but plenty to think about.When Agamben returns to the subject of civil war, the purported topic of this book, it can be understood only with reference to the general philosophy of Hobbes. Here, Agamben might lose the general reader or those not intimately familiar with Hobbes’ political philosophy. I have more than a passing knowledge of Hobbes but I had to stop reading this book to consult Wikipedia and re-familiarize myself with Hobbes’ philosophy. Be that as it may, broadly considered, civil war for Hobbes was considered a struggle between the population in a state of nature (called the “multitude”) and the population who have conceded power to the sovereign (“People”).As with the other matters, Agamben does provide any answers and this is not a definitive book about the nature of civil war. It does provide plenty of food for thought and is a good start for those interested in political philosophy. Therefore, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SGSTBTR0WKJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804797315#wasThisHelpful","R2SGSTBTR0WKJN","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone is familiar with the triple-LP, double-CD, Live Europe 72 from the Grateful Dead.  The songs selected for this collection represented a mere fraction from their 1972 European Tour. The tour covered twenty venues. Rhino Records released the complete recordings from this tour, in seventy-three CDs, in 2011, in a limited edition  suitcase, and later as an ordinary box set. These collections instantly became a collector’s items, and if one is lucky enough to find one online, the collector’s suitcase edition alone will run almost one thousand dollars. Rhino released individual concerts on CD, but even these are becoming difficult to find. Finally, these concerts are now available for download.This “concert” represents a change of pace. After beginning the first leg of the Continental portion of their European Tour, the band appeared on German television. The occasion was an appearance at the Beat Club, in Bremen, Germany. The telecast last a little in excess of one hour, and it featured many of the songs they would perform, had performed, in other concerts in their European tour, but in abbreviated form. Without the luxury of playing a stadium or an audience for upwards of three hours and more, the band largely performed tight, economical versions of those same songs, without the occasional jamming or improvisations. What improves were executed were understated and pointed.There were some bumps along the road, however. The band experienced a false start with Playin in the Band where there erupted a shrill burst of feedback emitting from one of the speakers. Then, later, with Truckin there was another false start. Sensing that something wasn’t right, and also that they were on television, JC deftly plays the chords of a melody from William Tell before stopping the song. Oh, the virtues of live television! The band soldiered on with Truckin, however, leading the way to a twenty-minute rendition of The Other One.

"Everyone is familiar with the triple-LP, double-CD, Live Europe 72 from the Grateful Dead.  The songs selected for this collection represented a mere fraction from their 1972 European Tour. The tour covered twenty venues. Rhino Records released the complete recordings from this tour, in seventy-three CDs, in 2011, in a limited edition  suitcase, and later as an ordinary box set. These collections instantly became a collector’s items, and if one is lucky enough to find one online, the collector’s suitcase edition alone will run almost one thousand dollars. Rhino released individual concerts on CD, but even these are becoming difficult to find. Finally, these concerts are now available for download.This “concert” represents a change of pace. After beginning the first leg of the Continental portion of their European Tour, the band appeared on German television. The occasion was an appearance at the Beat Club, in Bremen, Germany. The telecast last a little in excess of one hour, and it featured many of the songs they would perform, had performed, in other concerts in their European tour, but in abbreviated form. Without the luxury of playing a stadium or an audience for upwards of three hours and more, the band largely performed tight, economical versions of those same songs, without the occasional jamming or improvisations. What improves were executed were understated and pointed.There were some bumps along the road, however. The band experienced a false start with Playin in the Band where there erupted a shrill burst of feedback emitting from one of the speakers. Then, later, with Truckin there was another false start. Sensing that something wasn’t right, and also that they were on television, JC deftly plays the chords of a melody from William Tell before stopping the song. Oh, the virtues of live television! The band soldiered on with Truckin, however, leading the way to a twenty-minute rendition of The Other One.

"Most are familiar with the story of Grace Kelly, the American Academy Award winning actress who married the Prince of Monaco. If the newspaper accounts at the time are to be believed, they lived happily ever after, a story-book ending for the fairy-princess.According to Grace of Monaco, all was not well in story-book land.In was 1961 and there was plenty of drama and palace intrigue behind the glitter and glitz of royal life.Grace Kelly, conflicted and dissatisfied with royal life, wanted to return making pictures, at least to star in Marnie, a role Alfred Hitchcock offered to her. Grace believed Ranier did not appreciate her.  This may have been true. Ranier was preoccupied with his neighbor, France. France was fighting a war in Algeria and pressured Monaco, a small dot of a principality on the Mediterranean, to impose an income tax on its subjects and forward the revenues to France.  Or else. Or else France would invade, take over Monaco and depose Prince Ranier. If this  weren’t enough, it was discovered that the sister of Prince Ranier was betraying him by being a spy for France.A quote allegedly from Grace Kelly herself at the beginning of the movie summed it up: The story of the fairy tale princess is itself a fairy tale.The main performances are strong in this picture. Tim Roth plays Prince Ranier, regal, of course, but with a hair-trigger temper. In one scene a French diplomat was slurring Grace Kelly and Roth/Ranier cracked him across the face. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Kelly, who plays the role with appropriate ...  um,  ... grace.Some of the supporting characters are throw-aways. Frank Langella, who is ordinarily a fine actor, has a weak role in this movie, and yes, I’m afraid to say that Derek Jacobi’s role was wasted. But the performances and events they describe are enough to bear repeated viewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318VDKG2YGFOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5NGS8O#wasThisHelpful","R318VDKG2YGFOQ","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With the appearance of the Islamic State (or ISIS, ISIL, IS, ISI, or Deash)  —  this is how they want to be known and this is how the author refers to them  —  there have been a plethora of books on the subject. These books cover the political spectrum, and they vary greatly in informational value.This is the best book on the Islamist State for one reason: It strives to be, and largely succeeds in being, one of the most objective accounts of this group.The Islamic State is a digital caliphate. What sets them apart from other terrorist groups is their technological know-how. They skillfully navigate the back channels of the dark internet to recruit soldiers, obtain financing, move money, conduct cyber-intelligence, or hack internet or bank accounts. Without the internet, Atwan tells us, the Islamic State could not exist.This book introduces us to the shadowy world of international terrorism and crime and is more powerful than any book of fiction. The IS has media savvy and an incredible technological knowledge of the internet. They know how to propagate their views to produce the greatest effect to the largest number of people. The immolation of the Jordanian airpilot was a good example. The brutality of the airman’s death shocked both the Western and Islamic world and was their way of saying using shock and awe methods that they are in the Middle East to stay.While the subtitle indicates that they are the digital caliphate, a good part of the book, perhaps one third, concerns the origins of the Islamic State. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that the United States is responsible for creating the IS when it completely destabilized Iraq following its invasion. According to Atwan this is only partially correct. Other factors such as the civil war in Syria and internal strive within Muslim jihadists contributed to the birth of IS.The main promoter of the Islamic State, the author tells us, is our most intimate, stable, ally in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, who consistently and regularly funnels millions of dollars, not only to the IS, but to other terrorist groups.This book contains real information. The Islamic State has displayed a savagery, ferocity, and brutality that has shocked both the West and the Middle East. But the Islamic State is not just an ad-hoc bunch of unruly thugs. For all intents and purposes, the Islamic State is a de facto nation state. The territory under IS control covers the area greater than that of Great Britain and over 9 million people. It issues its own currency; it revived the monetary unit of the Mediaeval Caliphate, the golden dinar. It issues passports; requires vehicles within its territory to display Islamic State license plates; has its own flag, and coat of arms. Islamic State soldiers even have their own salute; ironically, it is the same salute Sasha Baron Cohen’s character used in The Dictator  —  the right index finger pointing upwards. The IS areas have a working postal system and a functional governmental and judicial system.It has a treasury with millions and millions of dollars. Widespread news accounts indicated that when IS besieged Mosul, the Iraqi national troops fled and left an enormous cache of cash, one-half billion — that’s a “b” — dollars, and military equipment. Atwan relates that this year the IS published its first annual budget: $2 billion.Areas under IS control have a functional governmental It is particularly ironic that in an area of incredible internal instability, law and order reign — if not under the constant threat and implementation of Sharia law — in areas controlled by the Islamic State. IS has taken control of oil fields and sell the oil on the open market, collecting the revenues from the confiscated fields.This book is helpful even for news junkies such as this reviewer, to explain the dire situation in the Middle East and clarify the sometimes confusing inter-connections between the terrorist groups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XZ8OT5SK113/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520289285#wasThisHelpful","R22XZ8OT5SK113","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Rhino released individual concerts on CD, but even these are becoming difficult to find. Finally, these concerts are now available for download.The band began this concert following playing in another venue before an appreciative but ultimately indecisive audience in  Tivoli Hall three days earlier. Playing there must surely had been a frustrating experience, because while the band played as expertly as always, it seems they did not know where they stood with the audience, given its response to the music. Here, they knew they were plying in front of a student crowd — a university student crowd no less — so the band undoubtedly felt more secure and within their element. Knowing the audience would be more responsive, the band played accordingly.In general the numbers featured in this concert were played with a greater degree of musicality. That is to say, the arraignments were more complex, played with their usual sense of abandon, but with obvious great care in how they played.If JC’s guitar dominated the previous concert, here Phil Lesh’s bass lines dominate. This concert is a fine example of Lesh using his bass in providing the bottom while at the same time using it as an improvisational instrument in its own right. This concert is a fine of example of his musical skills. The keyboard lines from Pig Pen are also prominent. While in the previous concert JC’s guitar was piercing and searing, here it is muted and proceeds in the background with a warm fuzzy phatt tone, making ample use of the wah-wah peddle. All told, this concert produced an enjoyable version of their playing where all elements in the band are in balance and no one instrument dominates.Playing in the Band opens with a unique, extended intro and proceeds with complex, intricate solos, guitar and keyboard taking turns doing their own improvisations, a mini medley as it were.The band gets into their improvisational jamming soon thereafter. The third number undertaken was a twenty-minute jam of Good Lovin’.This concert displayed one of the finest closing numbers of the tour. Following Truckin’ the band falls into a spacey, twelve-minute improvisational jam, entitled simply, “Jam.” After a short interlude rendition of  The Other One, the band switched to a standard uptempo version of Me and My Uncle, returned to The Other One, then moved to Not Fade Away, changing to an impassioned version of Goin Down the Road Feelin Bad, and returned once more to Not Fade Away. Fifty five minutes of sheer joy, tampered by deft, flawless performances. The audience went wild.There was no encore apparently. Weir simply said in closing, “See ya,” and left, even though the audience clearly wanted more. There was good reason for their abrupt closing. On the next day, the 17th, the band was scheduled to play in their previous Denmark venue, Tivoli Hall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14VD8O465SE7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFTW5J8#wasThisHelpful","R14VD8O465SE7R","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Newcastle is in the extreme northern border of England, almost at the Scottish border. Given air travel in 1972, it was certainly a long trip to Denmark. I don’t think the band was prepared for what was in store for them in this next venue.Their opening number, Bertha, was lively and uptempo. The band played peppy and uptempo throughout. The band, however, appeared to be befuddled by the response from the audience. We do not know exactly how the audience reacted with only an audio recording existing: The audience clearly enjoyed the music as their whistles and voices of approval can be heard on the recording, but early in the concert Weir asked the audience, “How many [in the audience] can understand what we are saying?” looks at the response from the audience and then dismissively states, “Not very many.” Finally he says, “You [the audience] can do anything you want, sit, whatever,” before getting back to the music. My guess is that the audience was simply sitting in their seats and not dancing around as is the wont of the typical GD audience.Perhaps due to their perceived language barrier, the band performed generally straight renditions of the repertoire, carefully singing the words.  Short of a tell-all autobiography we will perhaps never know the dynamics of this concert.Then, perhaps to shake the perceived passivity of the audience, the band launches into an incredible one-hour set consisting of Dark Star, followed by Sugar Magnolia, then with two different parts of Good Lovin sandwiching a rendition of Caution. The audience gave their polite yet fervent applause.After Ramblin Rose, the band offered another mini medley consisting of Going Down the Road and Feelin Bad, with improvisations of Not Fade Away on either side.The band closed with a closing number which will be used for most venues of this tour — One More Saturday Night.So while the concert perhaps got off to a rocky start, but both the band and the audience appeared satisfied with the gig. In two days the band will play another spot in Denmark, Aarhus University.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18DC1PTCUU9YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BYICBM#wasThisHelpful","R18DC1PTCUU9YJ","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This year the Magna Carta will be 800 years old. To celebrate this event, David Carpenter has presented what will surely become the definitive edition.For anyone reading the document without its historical context, the MC is a puzzling, mysterious document. Yet, there is no other more important single document in Anglo-American jurisprudence. For example, without the language in the document, the Fifth, Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, arguably the most important in American law, would never have had been devised. Carpenter brings new life to the Magna Carta, giving the general reader the understanding of why the Charter was written and explaining the historical context within which it was written for the modern reader.This book has enough academic content to satisfy scholars, but also written to attract the widest possible readership with a popular, extensive history of the life and times of the king which created the need to have a “Great Charter,” King John I.The beginning book contains a short description of the available manuscripts of the Magna Carta. This may be of interest mainly for academics. Thereafter Carpenter presents a translation of the Magna Carta, with the original Latin on the opposite page.What follows is the real innovation of this edition. Carpenter gives a detailed historical account of King John and the events which lead to the signing of the Magna Carta, events which occurred both in and outside England, and the application of the historical background to the signing of the Charter. This account is rendered in a lively, non-academic voice. The historical material is written with constant reference to the Magna Charta and serves as a detailed commentary of the contents.Carpenter brings the life the life and times of King John, who surely was an errasable personality. If not for him — and mismanagement of the Kingdom  — future generations would have never the Magna Charta.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28H51G7X0R2W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0241953375#wasThisHelpful","R28H51G7X0R2W7","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who has followed this film on the internet or who reads some of the other reviews in this website will know this movie has generated a lot of buzz. This is not the usual movie hype which follows a popular film. It is that rare film -- and there truly are not a lot of these films -- in which the audience projects its own opinions, beliefs and positions onto the film, so much so that the film becomes a reflection of its audience.  So when the audience comments on the film, it says more about the person making the comment than the film.On one end of the spectrum, you have the comments from the Left. Sonali Kohatker calling the main character a ""Psychopath."" Bill Maher saying that the film should have been called, ""Psychopath Patriot."" Seth Rogen will compare it to the Nazi sniper on ""Inglorious Basterds."" The Guardian saying that the movie was about a ""hate-filled killer."" ...  And, of course the infamous comment from Michael Moore saying the protagonist was a coward.Jane Fonda, once the leftist pin-up girl, said the movie showed the problems veterans have in adjusting to civilian life, much like the protagonist in ""Coming Home.""The Huffington Post on the one hand says the movie ""sanitizes"" a ""bone-headed war"" and is ""dangerous propaganda,"" and on the other hand comments that the movie exposes still unresolved issues about the Iraq War.On the Right end of the spectrum there are comments from Vice-President Biden who ""teared up"" at the ending. Sara Palin called all who panned the film ""pansies.""  CNN called the movie a ""pro-military masterpiece.""Fox News answers the movie's critics in saying the film is much more nuanced in displaying the horrors of war and more effectively than most movies in showing how combat will affect humans with all of their faults and frailties.Real American snipers also say that the movie sanitizes the war, but for a different reason. The real war was actually much more horrible. Clint Eastwood, the director, calls Amercan Sniper an ""anti-war film.""All of these comments apply to ""American Sniper"", and at the same time none of them do. This is not a simple war movie; it is a movie about one person's personal mission to fight in the Iraq War. It works on different levels. The scenes about actual engagement with the population in Iraq and the combat scenes are intense, nearly unbearable. This intensity is increased because the engagement and combat is viewed through the eyes of the protagonist. The focus is always on Chris Kyle, who fights for patriotic reasons, but at the same time is incredibly conflicted about his mission. This is not remote-control killing through drone warfare. He always sees the face -- or at least the figure -- of his victim, so his mental anguish is palpable. His visceral conflict accounts for the strong comments from both sides of the political spectrum.This movie does what every great movie should do: touch a nerve and spark comment. This movie will change your viewpoints and after seeing the film you will not be the same person. It will affect your outlook on war and peace. You will leave the theater and wonder at how superficial is the everyday life so much of us lead.This movie is Eastwood's masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EARXKCHMNSAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGZ94SG#wasThisHelpful","R2EARXKCHMNSAL","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let it Be is a difficult film to watch. The Beatles were once on top of the world. Young, cocky, truly appearing to be enjoying their success, by 1969, they were mentally and spiritually burned out.John was nursing a serious heroin habit. He only found satisfaction in the drug and in his new-found love interest, Yoko Ono. He seemed uninterested in making music, and as you watch him in this picture, when he is lucid, he is secretly waiting for the right moment to break away from the group.George was disgruntled. Frustrated at not being allowed to display his talents in the group, he was harboring deep resentments at the main songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, for holding him back. That sullen look you see in George's face is genuine. The ""highlight"" of the film is the argument he had with Paul. The result of that argument was George leaving the group for a few days until the other band members begged him to return. By the time the film was being made George had a cache of songs, and as you watch this film, he was secretly thinking what he can do with these songs. Of course, these songs became his three-LP album, All Things Must Pass, which was released after the Beatles broke up.Ringo is just Ringo, but he also left the band for a few days during the filming of this movie. The  distant look in his face is his attempt to distance himself from all the drama in the group.And then we have Paul. He is the only member of the band happy to be a Beatle. In this film he is constantly trying to lift the spirits of his band mates, mostly without success. On the surface, he appears to be a total control freak. This might very well be the case. But the spirits of the other members were so down, it is difficult to tell what were the real dynamics.The Grey Eminence, the Darth Vader of the group was Yoko Ono. She was not liked by most Beatle fans and despised by the other band members. This reviewer's memory when seeing this film for the first time in the theater was that someone emitted an audible hiss when the camera first panned on her face.For the longest time this movie was not available on DVD. For good reason. The four people we see on the screen are not the happy-go-lucky youths running down a street, chased by fans, nor the young lads peddling their bikes on a Carribean island. It is a depressing film, a documentary about the break-up of a band.See it for the Rooftop Concert. All the in-fighting, grumbling, and drama were forgotten, and for one brief moment it must have felt like old times. And so it will for you, watching the Beatles perform for the last time. Perhaps they were so happy because they knew, secretly, it would be their last concert, and they wanted the last one to be a good one, and create the magic they were known for, in a concert they will and should be remembered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFNIQK6QE4L6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLSJTCE#wasThisHelpful","R2NFNIQK6QE4L6","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the Road movie to end all Road movies. There are two main characters: Bruno, a movie projector repairman who lives in his van and whose job requires him to travel all over Germany repairing movie projectors in small-town theaters, and Robert, who is depressed, estranged from his father, his marriage on the rocks, and whose life is a mess. The two meet when Robert, depressed, makes a half-hearted effort to kill himself, drives his car in a river.The movie is set in the rural villages of Germany of the 1970s, in what surely must now be as long-gone as the areas around Route 66 in the United States. The dialogue is minimal, the scenes of the German villages are lovingly depicted, and camera pans of rural Germany are long and expansive. Wenders was making a statement in this movie. This movie is about self-discovery, both for the characters involved as well as the German countryside Wenders must have known and knew was vanishing.For years, this early masterpiece was not available in DVD. The only copies which could be had were cumbersome two-pack VHS tapes. This DVD is remastered and the black and white cinematography has a crisp, sharp picture, unlike the graininess of the original. In many ways, the murkiness of the original print was a perfect match for the existential struggles experienced by main characters though the picture.While this is a Road movie, it has none of the destructiveness, self and otherwise, of Easy Rider, a movie which heavily influenced Wenders. Every character, major and minor, live in a quiet desperation and Bruno and Robert, while traveling throughout the country, attempt to resolve their anxiety and inner demons as best they can. While there is no final resolution from the film, any conclusion that may be drawn can be obtained from the original title of this movie, Im Lauf in Zeit, meaning, ""in the course of time.""The ONLY drawback is that this movie is available only in a PAL format, and will not play in DVD players formatted for the United States and Canada markets. This movie is a good excuse to find a serviceable region-free player and savor this marvelous film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQHFK5OROELW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048VTT7M#wasThisHelpful","R2WQHFK5OROELW","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In addition to being an eminent philosopher, Slavoj Zizek is also a well-known Marxist theoretician and cultural commentator. Thus, a book about the crisis in global capitalism from a Marxist perspective, from a legitimate Marxist philosopher no less, raises the expectation of new insights into the crisis from a noted social philosopher. Sadly, this is not the case.Nowadays, writings on the crisis in capitalism are nothing new. This book is unique in that this is the most direct statement from Slavoj ZIzek on capitalism.The ""Paradise"" is the promise Fukuyama outlined of the End of History following the downfall of the Soviet Union, discredited by the turn of historical events at the hands of the Neocons for whom the doctrine was addressed. The ""Trouble"" refers to a movie by Ernst Lubitsch.On the contrary, the ""trouble"" is the manner in which ZIzek is presents his thesis. In his own inimitable style, Slavoj Zizek examines the present state of global capitalism. Based on lectures given in South Korea, Zizek discusses the crisis in capitalism in medical and faux medical terms of diagnosis, cardiognsis,  prognosis and epignosis. The diagnosis, the present state, cardiognosis (his term), and prognosis, ""what is to be done."" He also offers his epignosis, a term borrowed from theology, what the new capitalism looks like.Zizek says that the cure of the crisis in capitalism comes not from capitalism but from communism. A daring hypothesis but one never fully or systematically discussed in the book. He is very vague on this cure. As in previous endeavors, Zizek frequently diverts into cultural observations and such musings are distracting. And so in Trouble in Paradise he makes frequent social and cultural commentary between discussing the crisis in global capitalism. These cultural diversions actually supplement, rather than detract, from the point Zizek is attempting to make.His analysis of the crisis in capitalism, however, is unremarkable and unfocused. The ""analyses"" are scattered, unstructured musings of the current state of global capitalism, for example: * People do not revolt when things get ""very bad,"" but when their expectations are not met.  This rule was involved in the revolts in the Arab world in 2011 and has potentially serious consequences for China in the future. * The best method to diagnose and cure the defects in the Capitalistic system is found in Communism. * The neoliberal Capitalist system is a victim of its ideological mother, Ann Rand, the author of Atlas Shrugged, and the unbridled greed which fed on the system like a cancer. This is pure Marxian ideology. * The best illustration of the class struggle is in the current fight for a free internet. Presumably Zizek means the struggle for net neutrality but does not expand on this statement. * The defining characteristic of the present crisis in global capitalism is that the concept of unemployment has changed. In the classical model, unemployment was a discrete pool for the source of labor. Now, as a result of the 2008 meltdown, unemployment now includes a segment of the population which have been ""written out of history.""  This phenomenon is what the news media refers to, when the quarterly unemployment figures are released, to those who have given up finding work.Zizek offers gems of insight, but to  get there you have to sift through a lot of rubble.Trouble in Paradise is thus a mixed bag. I will employ a bit of cultural commentary Zizek likes to use so much: When the Beatles were world superstars, they stopped in Los Angeles after their concert there to see their idol, Elvis Presley. The arraignments were made and they would indeed see Elvis. The problem was this was circa 1965, Elvis' career was in a slump, and when they actually met him, he was detached, unresponsive, and frankly not all that interested in seeing them. The Beatles got lost trying to find Elvis' residence in LA, and continually asked themselves, ""Where's Elvis?"" After they actually saw him, they left, disappointed, and in leaving asked themselves, ""Where's Elvis?""While he occasionally makes a brilliant observation here and there, on the whole Trouble in Paradise could have been much better.""Where's Zizek?""","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZDSTKREQ8MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0241004969#wasThisHelpful","R1SZDSTKREQ8MH","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many accounts about the Paris Commune. Many are written clouded by a particular political viewpoint. Some accounts are written about specific stages of the insurrection, either about the causes of the insurrection, the insurrection itself, or the aftermath or the long-term consequences of the uprising.This book is unique in providing a practically hour-by-hour, day-by-day, blow-by-blow account. Merriman provides  a broad, balanced, beginning-to-end, account of the Commune, its causes, the aftermath and, yes, the bloody massacre of the insurgents.Yes, the amount of detail is sometimes dizzying, but Merriman offers many little-known details: * The Commune, for instance, was allowed to flourish in part because the Central government, while initially deployed security forces to quell the insurrection, then strategically withdrew the military support which allowed the spirit of rebellion to mushroom. * Once the Commune commenced, it easily obtained financing for its day to day affairs from French banking institutions, including the Rothschilds. * The Communards were not a bunch of wide-eyed radicals, although there were such elements in the ranks, but very much a bourgeois rebellion mainly consisting of tradespersons and professionals. * There was a great deal of dissension and lack of organization within the  Communards. Its ad hoc organization worked against them in the end. Central government troops were able to breach the barricades blocking Parisian streets because those barricades were completely unmanned. * While the ferocity of the Central government's response is well-known, Merriman meticulously describes the ruthless extent to which the Commune was shockingly put down. The Central government, for example, engaged in indiscriminate bombing of entire neighborhoods in Paris with little regard as to whether the inhabitants supported the Commune or not. The government soldiers shot first, asked questions later. The author estimates that upwards to 100,000 individuals lost their lives as a result of government retaliation. * There was a surreal character to the entire affair. Merriman relates in several parts that while the Communards were being butchered, life in Paris otherwise went on as ususal, as if nothing were happening.The account of the Central government's retaliation is written in an exciting and engaging style, occasionally reminding the reader of the sad, inevitable outcome. Such is the pace and the detail of the battle is that the author places the reader there.The great benefit of Merriman's work it that it relies on French sources for which English translations are not available, as well as other available English resource material.This book is highly recommended for anyone wanting a deeper understanding of the Paris Commune.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4EEK96LBS2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465020178#wasThisHelpful","R1I4EEK96LBS2R","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those interested in Easter philosophy and religion the writings of Swami Krishnananda can always be counted on to provide important perspectives and insights. SK was trained in Western philosophy and has a great ability to explain the tenants of Indian philosophy and religion in terms intelligible to Western readers. In this book, SK summarizes the important points of the major schools of Indian philosophy and religion.What is noteworthy about this book is that the Swami provides a detailed analysis of the Purusa Sukta, the mantra in the Rg Veda that explains the creation of the manifest universe. An explanation of this Sukta has been the subject of entire books; authors have declared the importance of this Sukta without giving an adequate explanation of its meaning. In the space of a few pages the Swami analyses this Sukta into five levels and provides what is the most complete explanation of the meaning and importance of this Sukta concisely and with the focus of a master. These pages alone are worth the price of this marvelous book.This explanation of Indian philosophy is basic enough to benefit the beginning and has enough insights to benefit the reader familiar with Indian philosophy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HB1GQ7GPKGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DRNW70#wasThisHelpful","R14HB1GQ7GPKGH","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The specter of global warming has risen from mere scientific speculation to how best to find a political or societal solution. This book is a significant contribution to the conversation. It posits that the solution may not be political, societal or even scientific, but one of attitude. Through a daring, plausible,  interpretation of the most ancient surviving writing in world literature, the Rg Veda, Murthy demonstrates that the earth is a dynamic organism, intimately connected with the entire surrounding universe.Murthy begins with his interpretation of the Rg Veda. He begins with the geographical and geophysical interpretation of the Vedic deities. This interpretation is not so far-fetched. As Murthy reminds us, the “Veda” in the Rg Veda means “knowledge.”  The Rg Veda is a book of knowledge, not simply a philosophical or religious tract. Therefore, according to this interpretation, • Indra becomes the cause of precipitation and earthquakes, after the numerous reference in the Veda of Indra as “the bringer of rains” “the Thunderer” and “the shaker of the earth.” • Agni, becomes the geothermal field in the earth. • The Maruts and Vayu become the Winds and the weather respectively. • Varuna is the gravitational field. Murthy arrives at these appellations from a detailed discussion of mantras from the Rg Veda. In a similar fashion, Murthy examines the earth’s relationship with the planetary system and constellations. Notably, the Adityas represent the twelve houses of the zodiac. After this analysis, Murthy arrives at a ten-point exposition, a summary of the Vedic view of the earth which affirms its divine origin and sacred constitution. This book will change your perspective on the environment and ecological matters and is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVNAF5C1S4U2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8124600910#wasThisHelpful","RVNAF5C1S4U2Z","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To anyone not familiar, John Cleese is a founding member of the Monty Python Flying Circus and went on to have a productive career as an actor and director. Whether you know him or not, this, his autobiography, should be picked up and read and enjoyed, if not to get inside the mind of a great comic, then to enjoy a good read.Anyone who has seen John Cleese on talk shows know that he is a great raconteur. That witty eloquence shines on every page. There is a personal style to this memoir. His memories are not written in a vague first-person narrative. He writes in a lively style, with aplomb and grace. It is as if he is sitting right there at the dining table or in the parlor room, reminiscing, one-on-one, of the past.Many celebrity memoirs are throw-aways, self-serving narratives written with an agenda by a ghost writer because the subject has fame but never had a formal education. More often than not with a remarkable selective memory, these autobiographies are northing more than a mere recitation of events which have not been wiped out by age or other factors.This autobiography is different. Cleese delves deep into his life memories, and in hindsight looks back at those peoples and events with the acquired wisdom of the present, putting those events in an accepting context. At many times, it more resembles a meditation of a life than a simple autobiography. It is all done with a comic, reserved English reserve we have all often seen in some of his characters in the Circus.And what an amazingly literate memoir this is!  Anyone familiar with Monty Python sketches will know their facile use of language for comic effect. Cleese displays his skills as a wordsmith throughout his remembrances.I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X7IE1A5QI2XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038534824X#wasThisHelpful","R1X7IE1A5QI2XO","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Dale Scott has written many books about the Deep State at work in the U.S. government. Scott depicts American society as structurally and inherently schizophrenic. Just as there is the public government and the deep government, and ordinary events and deep events, there are two dominant forces permeating United States history: One egalitarian, believing in fairness, inclusion, and free expression, and the other militaristic and exclusionary, which is only interested in social control.According to his thesis, there are two levels of government, one the government the public is familiar with, with a Senate, House of Representatives, a President, which enact laws. The other government operates on a deeper level — thus, the “Deep” State — and consists of the national security apparatus, armed forces, and intelligence agencies.  The thesis in Scott’s present book is the glue that binds these desperate forces together — many times in a symbiotic manner —  are the monied elements in Wall Street and their interests for acquisition of global resources (oil, etc.), often working with other major capitalistic countries such as Saudi Arabia and Japan.Of all of Scott’s books — any one of which are highly recommended — this present release is perhaps the most coherent, cohesive analysis of the different levels of governance at work in our society today. Scott examines the significant deep events  — those “mysterious events” which involve some level of criminal conduct such as murder with the elements of the deep state — from the last fifty five years — such as the assassinations of JFK, MLK, RFK, Watergate, the October Surprise, Iran Contra, BCCI — and establishes a clear convergence between these events and the persons and interests involved in them, leading to the institutional and constitutional changes enacted after the occurrence of 9/11.That monied, capitalistic interests drive American domestic and foreign policy is nothing new. And Peter Dale Scott is not some wide-eyed conspiracy sensationalist making hair-brained, half-baked, or screwball theories of deep events. What sets Scott’s book apart from similar books is that every assertion, every conclusion, every connection of persons, places and events are referenced, footnoted and fact-checked. Roughly one half of the book consists of endnotes, many of which themselves feature pertinent and important discussions augmenting the main text.It all makes for compelling reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTSEOYV6D5KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442214244#wasThisHelpful","ROTSEOYV6D5KQ","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will admit it: I am a great Takashi Miike fan. He is one of the most interesting directors today, definitely the most versatile. Even when making a conventional genre movie, he produces a film which will stand out from the rest.This movie, Shield of Straw, is a good example. At first glance, it is your typical chase movie. It is the story of the transport of a sociopathic killer who the rich relation of one of his victims has offered a billion yen reward for anyone who kills him “legally.” That means the sociopath’s killer must be either the State or the State’s representative; in other words, the police officers charged with transporting him to the authorities. The price on the sociopath’s head is so big a price that everyone’s loyalty and duty is challenged.But “typical” usually is not in Miike’s lexicon. This movie is in a way Miike's variation of the essential plot to ""3:10 to Yuma."" Sure, there multi-vehicle chase scenes, explosions, and shooting. The first part of the movie has a magnificient mult--car pile-up. This is not a typical chase because the movie is supported by an excellent script (not a cookie-cutter plot), real dialogue (not corny cliches),fully developed characters (not one-dimensional caricatures found in too many movies), and real drama.This movie is more assessable than your average Miike film. He is famous for employing non-linear, hyperlink, story-telling, forcing the viewer to pay attention and watch the film. The story-telling here is simply and directly told in a totally linear fashion.At least currently the movie is not available in NTSC format, so in order to vew this movie a region-free DVD player must be purchased.

"The I Ching certainly is one of the most obscure, cryptic and mystifying texts in world literature.Its real meaning is lost to the ages, and it probably will be impossible to divine its intended purpose and meaning.Fortunately, ironically, the most cogent explanation of the I Ching comes from this father and son team, Richard and Hellmut Wilhelm.This collection of lectures consists of the combination of two separate books, Change: Eight Lectures on the I Ching by Hellmut Wilhelm and The Constancy of Change, by Richard Wilhelm. Both titles are contained in this one book.Hellmut’s lectures consist primarily on how the hexagrams should be interpreted, interspersed with a discussion of their philosophical foundations. Hellmut’s lectures contain extensive quotations from commentaries found in Richard’s original translation. Richard’s lectures contain mostly philosophical ruminations concerning the issues and inspirations of the I Ching. Richard’s lectures assume familiarity with the meaning and function of the hexagrams, and therefore may be too advanced for the general reader.Hellmut’s lectures, on the other hand, are probably the best introduction for the reader to whom the I Ching is a complete mystery, which probably includes 99.9% of all of us.

"Takashi Miike is one of the most interesting directors at work in the cinema today. This movie, Lesson of the Evil, confirms his standing.Judging from the advertisement on this website, this movie from Takashi Miike appears to be a cheap rip-off of Battle Royal. After all, both movies are generally about the wholesale slaughter of Japanese high-school students. But there is where the similarity ends. While the blood and gore in Battle Royale originated from a bizarre social experiment conducted by the protagonist, the main character in Lesson of the Evil murders his students as punishment for cheating on tests and bullying. This is not a simple slasher movie. Miike abandons his typical non-linear style of story-telling to delve deep into the mind of a psychopath who manages to obtain a job as a high-school teacher. The use of flash-backs and hyperlinked segments are at a minimum. Miike produces real drama as the students are killed. It is testimony to Miike’s versatility as a director that even in telling a simple slasher movie Miike can produce a compelling story.The only downside to the movie is that it is available only in DVD regions not compatible to the US or Canada.

"The Amazon website indicates that this book is unavailable. Unavailable through Amazon, that is, but available elsewhere.. This is really a shame because this is a fascinating book and well worth the effort to find, read and understand.This book consists with three parts. The first part comprises with a self-described text written in the 1930s, the Sarata-Catussatika. The Sarata-Catussatika is a short exposition of Tantric philosophy with regards tp the Sri-Vidya mandala. Hindi and English translations are provided.The second part is a follow-up, a short essay which analysizes the Sri-Vidya yantra, part by part,\.The third and last part is an essay on the mantra on the yantra of the Sri-vidya.This book is indispensable to an understanding of the Sri-Vidya. Bindu, the very center of the mandala, is the concentration of the energies and forces that surround it and are depicted in the mandala itself. The bindu is encased in a triangle. Some mandalas feature an upright triangle, some, a down turned triangle. From bindu every line and figure has meaning: • The upright triangle — in fact, any upright triangle in the mandala — signifies the masculine energy in the universe, or Siva; • the down-turned triangle signifies the feminine energy, Sakti, in the universe. The union of Siva and Sakti is the very essence of the mandala. The mandala is pregnant with meaning. Some of those elements: •  Circles in the mandala signify consciousness; • Squares signify the elements; • The lotus petals signify the principle of regeneration. All of the chakras are represented in the mandala. The mandala represents the universe as a macrocosm, and the individual psyche in macrocosm. By fully gazing upon and understanding that one is the other, liberation is achieved. This book greatly helps the sadhaka who seeks this liberation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZO9FY2ID0NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8170308364#wasThisHelpful","R1GZO9FY2ID0NH","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is an account of the development of the numbering system in ancient Indian mathematics. At first blush this may appear to be an academic, dull, dry book. Wrong. This book, while technical at times, is an engaging exposition of the scientific innovations of ancient Indian science. Some interesting facts are known, others not so well known. Those factoids include: • Ancient Indian mathematicians such as Pingala posited the concept of zero approximately at 200 B.C.E., approximately one thousand years before Western science “discovered” it. This is relevant information because up through the Middle Ages it was unthinkable in the West to speak of the concept of zero. The Indian mathematicians conceived and posited the concept of zero at least one thousand years beforehand, perhaps earlier. • Indian mathematician Baskaracarya postulated the sine function in calculus and trigonometry at least 500 years before Newton and Leibniz. • Decimal systems were used in the Harrapan civilization in the Indus valley, circa 2000 - 3000 B.C.E. The most interesting portion of the book is found in the last half. In this portion the author describes the number systems by which many of the Indian texts on mathematics and astronomy were written.

"The memory of Alexander the Great is still alive and well in Modern Greece. There is a popular saying, O Megas Alexandros zei kai vasilevei, translated as “Alexander lives and rules,” which  is still spoken in Greece to this day. Such is the modern memory of Alexander.Much is made in this book of how Alexander ruled, to date, the largest empire and was never defeated in battle. True enough. The lessons derived from his life and manner of leadership still is able to inform modern life.This book concentrates on the military prowess of Alexander the Great. It is derived primarily from accounts given in Plutarch and Xenophon and other ancient sources.Admitted the book does not deal with the political savvy possessed by Alexander the Great. In every land he conquered he encouraged his soldiers and officers to intermarry with the local population. The conquered lands thereby became centers of Greek culture and learning. He was not concerned with mere military conquest but a true investment into the future. Alexander did not limit his activities for short-term military goals but looked ahead to the future. In this respect this is a lesson that bears repeating.The book touches upon these political aspects but does not dwell on them, emphasizing the military side of Alexander.For those looking for the military genius of Alexander this book is more than adequate.O Megas Alexandros Zei kai vasilevei!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C77802EI9DBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230619150#wasThisHelpful","R3C77802EI9DBV","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no shortage of books about Robin Hood. This totally engaging book is unique becauwe it analyzes the Robin Hood myth as a historical, social, political, media and cultural phenomenon, and explains Robin Hood within his contemporary historical context. The book applies the lessons of Robin Hood to our own uncertain times.War, corruption, taxation, and internal discontent --  England at the time of Robin Hood was a very unstable country. A war with France had bankrupted England's money reserves. The money situation was made worse by corrupt government officials who looted the money reserves for their own personal gain. The central government then leaned on the common citizenry by levying more taxes. Tax collectors exacted their own set of abuses to collect the tax. There was a widespread belief among the 1% of the populace that the Magna Carta, the landmark legal document which was intended to benefit the rights of the ruling class, should apply to everyone. The local discontent was fueled by a population was increased by disaffected, disillusioned soldiers coming home from the Crusades who were skilled in the then-state-of-the-art weaponry  -- the bow and arrow.If all this sounds painfully familiar -- all except the bow and arrow bit, of course -- this explains the phenomenal popularity of the Robin Hood myth. Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. This has always been appealing, probably more so in our times, and especially after the financial crisis of 2008.Readers will enjoy the skillful use of graphics and text which serve as interludes to the depictions of Robin Hood in movies, literature and history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YCUWIO5ODZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604863188#wasThisHelpful","R5YCUWIO5ODZ0","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the very heart of the crisis in the Middle East is what to do about the Palestinians dispossessed from their homeland when the State of Israel was created. Resolve this issue and the root cause of all other issues in the Middle East are or can be resolved. This book examines the legitimacy of the State of Israel in a clear-headed manner. This book is extremely relevant to issues of our times.The Idea of Israel is a mirror placed in front of the State of Israel. It is also a highly readable alternative history.This is not a book about Zionism. That topic could easily take up a separate volume.  In interviews Pappe has remarked that the idea of Israel is riddled with an inherent internal contradiction. On the one hand, a point mentioned but not fully elucidated in the book, the State of Israel was founded on the ideals of Zionism, which in turn is a product of the Western liberal tradition, and because of this shares the hallmarks of that egalitarian tradition. On the other hand, a set of justifications supporting the legitimacy of the State of Israel have developed that are in direct contradiction to the liberal origin of Zionism. These two sides are direct polar opposites and are destructive, one to the other. This book is not about the ideals of Zionism, but about these set of justifications which were promulgated when the State of Israel was established and how these justifications have evolved into what they look like now.Pappe fully discusses the merits of those justifications in full in the first one third of his book. Those justifications included: • Before 1882, the land of Palestine was an empty homeland; • From the very beginning, Palestinian terrorism was always present; • The Arab-Israeli War of 1948 was waged to prevent the total annihilation of the Jewish community living in Palestine; • In 1948, Israel was a virtual “David” facing the all-pervasive Arab “Goliath.” • Palestinians were not forced to leave their homes, but either left voluntarily or were told to leave by their leaders. • Prior to the 1948 war, Israel had agreed to the creation of a Palestinian state which was proposed by the United Nations, but this proposal was rejected by the Palestinians. • In 1948 the Arab world was determined to destroy the Jewish state.Pappe carefully analyzes the historical record and exposes these justifications for what they are: myths, misconceptions, distortions, historical inaccuracies and/or untruths, or outright lies.Pappe goes on the describe how the idea of Israel changed with relevant local and international events. The Oslo Accords in the early 1990s brought what Pappe calls the “post-Zionist” movement. It was a resilient movement and survived even the assassination of Yidzak Rabin, but could not take hold. The occurrence of the Second Intifada in the late 1990s, early 2000, created a reactionary neo-Zionist movement. The hallmarks of this movement is the legalization of an apartheid system in the State of Israel, one which applied to Palestinians, of course, but paradoxically to the so-called Arab Jews, the Seraphim and Mizrachai Jews, and other repressive measures.Good alternative histories should demonstrate that, as the Firesign Theater says, “Everything You Know is Wrong.”  This is revisionist historical analysis at its best. It is clearly and engagingly written, even though its message may not be welcomed and succeeds admirably in its task.This is required reading for anyone seeking insight into the State of Israel and its relation to its neighbors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JSMCQVAEDZAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844678563#wasThisHelpful","R2JSMCQVAEDZAD","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Martin Scorcese has made a career of movies about gangsters.The movie very much follows the themes Scorcese examined with organized crime.  His examination of criminals in movies such as Casino, Goodfellas, The Departed, informed the consequences and repercussions of the quest for and exercise of Power, power over people and manipulation of surrounding events of life.In Wolf of Wall Street Scorcese examines Greed, pure, unadulterated, naked Greed. Scorcese displays the debauched and sordid life of Belfort. This movie documents the real story of a stockbroker, Jordan Belfort, his skills as a huckster, his con man charm, his addictions to power, money, sex and drugs, and his ignoble fall from grace. The movie displays, in lurid detail, the debauchery of his sex life and the excess of his “sales meetings,” which, more often than not, resulted in spontaneous orgies.While these scenes were undoubtedly a good selling point in promoting this movie, this was not Scorcese’s point. Scorcese’s movies are all about excess. So while his hoodlums, drunk with Power, eventually spontaneously combust, Scorcese is saying in the Wolf of Wall Street that the addiction to money leads to naked Greed, which leads to other addictions, to sex, drugs, or to whatever — and left unchecked, will spontaneously combust.In his gangster movies, the spontaneous combustion is exhibited with the hoods killing each other. Here, in the Wolf of Wall Street, Belfort gets nailed by the Feds. In either instance of excess, there is a Fall from Grace, the jig is up, and all bets are off.Wolf of the Wall Street very much, then, fits the mold of Scorcese’s previous movies about Gangsters. With the advent of the Financial Meltdown of 2008, it was only a matter of time before he would make a movie about the REAL gangsters — the con men who populate Wall Street. Wolf of the Wall Street is a modern morality play born from that crisis, and behind its titillation, is a word of warning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1955FRW8EGX5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9KKKAY#wasThisHelpful","R1955FRW8EGX5J","A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can I say about a band that follows up the most satisfying album of their career with one that's just as good?If you like to describe your music in 25 words or less, these guys probably aren't for you. I refuse to label them beyond ""good music."" Check out the opener (and make SURE you head on over to YouTube and enjoy the beyond-strange video for it), ""X-Ray Visions."" It's a beautiful display of focused rage that is meaningless, but at the same time it makes perfect sense. And that beautiful interlude at mid-song...""And on the drums...Gemini. On bass guitar...presenting Pisces. On lead guitar...we have Aries. And on the microphone....SCORPIOOOOOOOOOOOOO GO!""The band doesn't take a breath as they lurch into ""Firebirds!,"" but then it's time for a song you wouldn't call a ZZ Top ""tribute""...but in may ways it's exactly that...""A Quick Death In Texas,"" The vocals and riffs have that unmistakable Reverend Billy G sound, including a ""Please forgive me, Mister Gibbons"" aside. A joy, a pure joy...at this point you should stop reading my review and BUY this, but I'm not finished.The jaw-dropper...the eye-opener here...is how they unleash all of their fury and shock and awe on the CD's closer, the 7-minute ""Son of Virginia."" If you've heard the latter-day Molly Hatchet, with lead singer Phil McCormick, you will know that on this track, Clutch beat those boys at their own game. It's got that swampy, menacing sound of the best that Molly Hatchet ever had to offer, and it just SMOKES.No filler, not a bad song here, easily one of the best releases of 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DRVGK1NQP85O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CKVTCE#wasThisHelpful","R2DRVGK1NQP85O","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's impossible to dismiss anything from this period of Miles' career in the same way that it's impossible to dismiss the entire career of The Grateful Dead. A person can say they don't LIKE the music...and many have...but in 1970, Miles was on FIRE, he was NUTS, he was CHANGING music again, just as he had with ""Kind Of Blue."" Like it or not, Miles was, is, and will ALWAYS be the father of electric jazz / fusion, and this is the sound of the man in his laboratory, concocting that sound.This recording has been rendered somewhat obsolete by the release of ""Miles at the Fillmore - Miles Davis 1970: The Bootleg Series Vol. 3"" (the complete shows from which this set was drawn).In the vinyl days, critics really didn't know what to make of it, because rather than offering ""songs,"" the four sides of the two-LP set were broken down to ""Wednesday Miles,"" ""Thursday Miles,"" ""Friday Miles,"" and ""Saturday Miles.""The ""Bootleg Series"" version of the four nights has been getting 5-star reviews; it really is worth the couple of extra bucks to invest in a powerful slice of the Davis legacy.The band consisted of Miles (trumpet), Steve Grossman: (tenor and soprano sax), Chick Corea (Fender Rhodes electric piano), Keith Jarrett (electronic organ), Dave Holland (acoustic and electric bass), Jack DeJohnette (drums), and Airto Moreira (percussion). As this was the ""electric"" period of Miles' music and he was collaborating extensively with John McLaughlin in the studio (In A Silent Way, Jack Johnson, Bitches Brew, Big Fun, and more), Corea and Jarrett fill in the missing electric guitar dynamic. For fans of Miles & McLaughlin, the ""Cellar Door Sessions"" box set provides a great way for you to compare the band of this era with and without a guitarist in the mix (the box captures the Wednesday-Saturday shows, John was present for the Saturday show only). On the ""Cellar Door"" set, Jarrett carried the full weight of keyboard duties (Fender Rhodes electric piano, Fender Contempo organ).If your favorite Miles album is ""Kind of Blue"" or ""Sketches Of Spain,"" this is probably not the album for you. While not as extreme as some of his later ""noise / electric jamming"" albums like ""Pangaea,"" ""Agharta,"" or ""Dark Magus,"" it IS the sound of the musicians sending shards of raw, jagged sound into the night air. MANY musicians listened to this album. MANY ""borrowed heavily"" or just flat-out stole the concept and tried to make it their own. But that's the thing about legends...you can only learn from them and never truly make what was their shining hour into yours. Essential listening, but as i said earlier, pop for the ""Bootleg"" box instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SBKEG7GHC1EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00138KHOM#wasThisHelpful","R3SBKEG7GHC1EW","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this four stars because it is the REAL Grateful Dead...no Mayer, no Anastasio, no Furthur or The Other Ones or ""The Dead""...it's Jerry, Pigpen, Bob, Phil, Bill, Mickey, Keith, Donna and Brent...The Grateful Dead. The problem I have with this 4-CD set, and the reason why I am not encouraging you to buy it at the very beginning of my review, is that it is a 4-CD distillation of the 80-CD box set, 30 complete concerts. I have no idea who the ""intended audience"" for this one is. If you remember the ""Road Trips"" series, there was non-stop grousing over the fact that complete shows weren't presented. I find it very, very hard to believe that anyone other than a very casual fan of the band is going to be happy with a set that pulls ONE song from each of the 30 concerts in the 80-CD box set. Of course, that set was extremely limited (already out of print) and extremely expensive, so...unless you chase it down through alternate sources...this is the best you're going to get.I have a short list of Dead songs that are my favorites, and in a package like this, I always look for them first. Yes, there is ""Bird Song."" But a TEN MINUTE version of ""Dark Star?"" Plus no ""The Other One,"" no ""Wharf Rat,"" no ""Stella Blue?""There are 17 songs, 2 hours and 34 minutes, from the Brent Mydland era (his first show with the band was April 22, 1979). By comparison, there are 7 songs, 58 minutes from the Pigpen era, and 7 songs, 67 minutes from the Keith & Donna years. There are NO songs from the period when Keith, Donna and Pigpen shared the stage (December 1971 to June 1972). It's a known fact that the Pigpen & Keith / Donna years are in much higher demand among fans...look at the Road Trips and Dave's Picks series of reissues if you need proof of that. So does the fact that Brent material SIGNIFICANTLY outweighs those years, does this mean this is the Brent Mydland Collection? To a degree, obviously. And that's where your ""glass half empty /  glass half full"" sensibilities will kick in. Two hours of Pigpen, Keith & Donna alongside 2-1/2 hours of Brent. A pleasant surprise OR a disappointment for you, depending which side of the fence you're on.I can think of a L-O-N-G list of Dead CDs I'd buy BEFORE this one...superior performances, superior song selection. Get ""From The Vault III""...the Pigpen band on FIRE. Get ""Road Trips Volume 1 No 2""...Summer '71, more adrenaline. Get ""Road Trips Volume 3 No 2""...Austin '71. These were archive releases to get excited about. When you listen to Jerry sing ""Comes A Time"" on this new set, (Cal Expo Amphitheatre, Sacramento, CA 5/3/86), he sounds strained and weary. The band takes the song at ""nodding off"" pace. There are so many other superior versions of the song available. Other than being a collector and a completest, why would you want this one?Like I said, it's The Grateful Dead. Reading my review will with make you want it or not want it, but it's an honest review from someone who owns EVERY commercially released album by the band. I'm not a Dead Head, I have no ""tapes""...but all of the ""official releases"" have passed through these ears and this one isn't the crème de la crème. Doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. Just means you shouldn't expect to be knocked off your feet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYLDB1JWI88GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDF76AK#wasThisHelpful","RYLDB1JWI88GI","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the ten best albums released in 2014, period. The jury may be out on the Doobie Brothers...did Michael McDonald save 'em, sink 'em, or none of the above...but this album proves what true music lovers already know...the hits this band generated are timeless, like it or not. And yeah, there are a lot of people out there who hold the band in contempt, but that's life.For my personal tastes, the single most successful track on the album is ""Black Water,"" because it's one of their best songs, and also because Zac Brown shines here. Zac catches enough heat of his own...just like Buck Owens before him, he refuses to be pigeon-holed as a ""country artist"" and records what feels right, not what the public thinks he should record.

"This movie is everything it intended to be, and more. You can't judge a film like ""Machete Kills"" or a director like Robert Rodriguez using ""current box office standards."" first, Rodriguez...like his ""sometimes partner in film"" Tarantino...does what he wants to do, follows his own vision. Both directors obviously have influences up the wazoo...""Machete Kills,"" like Tarantino's ""Death Proof,"" is more about cheesy retro exploitation cinema of the 70s or 80s than it is ANYTHING going on in 2015. But these influences are utilized at will, when they serve the greater purpose of the director. It would be the same as a musician in 2015 writing a song and saying ""let's put a solo in right here like Jeff Beck would have done with the Yardbirds."" It doesn't mean the song has now become a ""tribute"" to either Beck or the Yardbirds. It simply means the artist found that specific influence to be ""useful"" in the moment.What can you say about a film that features Charlie Sheen (under his real name, Carlos Estevez), as the PRESIDENT, with him playing the role in a way that gleefully exploits every square inch of the tabloid fodder he himself generated? Or crazed madman Mel Gibson in a role that followed his own media inferno that presented him as...well, a crazed madman?The scorecard: Danny Trejo is everything you would want or need him to be in this role, he just nails it. Amber Heard as ""Miss San Antonio"" is pure evil honey, a joy to behold. Michelle Rodriguez as ""Luz"" is a lot of fun, and she delivers some of the best lines in the script. Sofia Vergara as ""Desdemona: is playing her role in a deliberately over-the-top manner, which...for my tastes...veers close to ""annoying"" at points. The ""La Camaleón"" role is a master stroke, jointly played by Walton Goggins, Antonio Banderas (amazingly playing the opposite of his ""image""), Cuba Gooding Jr, and Lady Gaga. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s take on the role is especially tasty as he is often cast as the ""voice of conscience"" or the ""stable"" member of an ensemble cast, and here he is just cold and unrepentant evil. Tom Savini is always good for a laugh when he appears in these films. Put that together with Danny, Mel and Charlie, and you have a five-star stab at reliving the past while inventing the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DS6GT7LRFRZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDDNFDW#wasThisHelpful","R3DS6GT7LRFRZZ","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got to be brutally honest with you here, folks...I'm kind of shocked by the number of 5 star reviews for this one. Having followed the Dead's career from beginning to end, appreciating live performances from ""The Brent Years"" has always required me to develop some form of amnesia for what came before them. What you really don't want to do is listen to ""The Other One"" from ""Dick's Picks Volume 4"" (2/13 & 14 / 70, Fillmore East) and then listen to the version here, unless you're of the belief that it was ALL good, just ""different."" I wasn't really a Brent fan...didn't care for his songwriting contributions or vocals, and thought his keyboard style often relied too heavily on brittle synths rather than the roaring organ of Pigpen, or even the more organic ""wires and wood"" approach of Keith Godchaux. That said, many people found Keith to be ""simplistic,"" and if you believe some of the behind the scenes gossip about the band, Phil (for one) became increasingly annoyed by his tendency to fall in line behind Jerry and just accent what he was playing. I'm the first to admit that Brent was easily more ""adventurous""...and maybe on the tracks that never featured Pigpen or Keith, that was OK...I just found his style to be cold, machine-driven, lacking in any real fire or electricity. Also, like it or not, this was not a peak period for Jerry, either. His health was going uop and down and his vocals on what should be standout tracks like ""Wharf Rat"" can be a tough listen. Some have said Weir is phoning it in here...I don;t think this set is a peak for the band OR any of its individual members. Would I rather hear this than Bob, Mickey and Bill jamming with John Mayer? Yes, I would. But there's a LOT of other Dead product you can purchase BEFORE laying out the money for this set. If you're in Brent's cheering section, and if ""late period"" Jerry isn't an issue, go for it. Maybe not at ""collectors"" prices, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEKQUMMV78BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M6OGZ8#wasThisHelpful","RKEKQUMMV78BV","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It alsmost seems foolish to write a review for an album that is SO essential, one you really need to own (and most of the people reading this probably own it anyway). It's a transitional album, the sound of the Brian Jones Stones making way for the Mick Taylor Stones. Jones and Taylor each play relatively minor roles here. Even Taylor's ""baptism by fire,"" throwing him into the deep end of the pool for the live set ""Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out,"" has been dwarfed by later live archive stuff like the ""Official Bootleg"" of ""The Brussels Affair"" as well as the Leeds, Marquee and Roundhouse concerts accompanying the ""deluxe"" reissue of ""Stick Fingers."" That's where the new band was fully formed, where it became a great, howling, ferocious behemoth unequalled in the history of rock & roll. Consider the famous boast that opens ""Ya Ya's""...""The GREATEST rock & roll band in the world, The Rolling Stones..."" It's true, you know? The Beatles were a cultural phenomenon that could hardly be contained by the label of ""rock band."" The Who were a force of nature, but they were never an ""everyman"" band unless you felt comfortable inside of Pete Townshend's head, dancing with his demons. No, it was and will always be The Stones...Keef, churning out precise, deliberate machine gun blasts of Chuck Berry riffs, Charlie holding it all together with his trademark bemused / bored stiff expression, Jagger and that rooster strut. I don't think the band fully knew where they were going during the ""Let It Bleed"" sessions. It was an exploration, a search for something bigger and bolder than what they had in the moment, even though they were kings of their particular hill. Compare ""With The Beatles"" and ""Revolver""...same thing. ""Let It Bleed"" and what follwed was NOT ""better than"" anything from the Brian Jones prime years. It was different. It was a band evolving.Obviously, ""Gimme Shelter,"" ""Love In Vain,"" ""Midnight Rambler,"" and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" went on to become ""concert staples,"" with the ""Ya Ya's"" version of ""Rambler"" becoming ""definitive,"" but as I said above, maybe left in the dust by some of the tougher performances from the Taylor era that finally saw the light of day.For my tastes, Johnny Winter took ownershiop of the title track on his ""Still Alive And Well"" album. He just tapped a vein of sarcasm, ennui, humor, just SOMETHING that Mick & Keith glossed over by comparison.""You Got The Silver"" finally saw a well-deserved rebirth in the ""Shine a Light"" film, and ""Monkey Man"" has been trotted out on stage a few times, too.There are NO ""disposable"" tracks on this one. All nine, all 43 minutes worth, this is as good as it gets. It's history that still rocks, still moves, still inspires.It's as essential as it gets, so...what are ya waiting for?

Some are pretty obvious (""Quitting Too Soon,"" ""Letting Others Control Your Life""), while others are more subtle and are probably doing more damage than you realize because they have burrowed so deep (""Acting Too Needy,"" ""Talking When Nobody's Listening"").See, the secret is to catch yourself in the act of doing these things and then put in the fix WITHOUT beating yourself up for it.That's how this book can help you. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TKDXS8UNVL8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWVGJY2#wasThisHelpful","R1TKDXS8UNVL8Z","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked three stars for this review because when you roll over the three stars the prompt you get from Amazon is ""It's OK"" and that is exactly hiow I remember the vinyl copy of this I bought when it was brand new...OK. Not bad. Not great. OK.There was some chatter in interviews about Eric Clapton, who obviously was the inspiration for ""Blues Breaker."" They dedicated it to him. Problem is that Clapton HEARD this album, and his response...I kid you not...was ""These guys can't play."" The track is kind of like some of Roy Buchanan's stuff...NO ONE questioned his status as a master, but SOMETIMES, his tracks would go on for what seemed like forever without actually arriving anywhere. Same thing here. ""Bluesbreaker"" sounds like the clips you see on YouTube of guys demoing new guitars. It lacks any kind of inspirational qualities. And if you don't need that, you might give this one four or even five stars.At the time of its release, most music fans went nuts just to have Eddie jamming on these tracks. In terms of flash, yeah...it's Eddie and Brian. In terms of ANYTHING memorable making it to 2015, let's just say that it's an artifact from 1983.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNIAVGHT6NYTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FJ1ABE#wasThisHelpful","RNIAVGHT6NYTY","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the way performances should be filmed. It succeeds on so many levels that it's almost not worth writing about it....just BUY it. First and foremost, it is an excellent overview of the best of Jeff's many albums. Second, he is in fine form and is very gracious toward the audience and is having a blast with his band (as they are with him). The word ""joy"" is the best word to describe it, and you'll also see it on the faces of Jimmy Page and Robert Plant as they sit in the audience. There are three vocal performances on the DVD, including an encore with Eric Clapton, but the interplay between the band members is so tight that when the guests come out on stage it almost seems like an intrusion. In addition to virtuoso and Zappa alum Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, you get bass phenomenon Tal Wilkenfeld and keyboardist Jason Robello. Much has been written about Tal's age and gender but I think dwelling on that does her a disservice. Yes, she was 21 at the time of this show (Beck was 64), and yes, she is a ""female bass player,"" but so what? She more than holds her own here, especially among such heavyweights. You have to do your homework when you purchase Jeff's music...there have been hits like his ""Blow By Blow"" / ""Wired"" / ""There And Back"" trilogy, but there also have been some misses where things just didn't gel. In terms of what you probably want to hear from the man, this one is a 10 on a 10 scale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHXHE3R47CYJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NP8PQM#wasThisHelpful","RHXHE3R47CYJQ","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this book for my laptop's Kindle today. I'm going to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers who dismissed this as lightweight or as a paid infomercial for some of Mark's other works. Self-promotion is OK...look at the careers of Jeffrey Gitomer and Brian Tracy. It doesn't get in the way of their best efforts, and it doesn't get in the way of what this book has to offer.For me, it's not about how much ""brand new information"" an author provides, because let's face it...when it comes to your mind and how it works, how it moves you forward or holds you back...a LOT has been written. It's about CONTEXT, what an author DOES with that information, how he or she presents it. The end result will either inspire you to take action, or it won't. And while it is just my opinion, I am of the firm belief that this book could inspire YOU to take some necessary steps in your life, because that's what it's done for me.The book is SO dense and fully-packed with powerful insights that I think it needs to be taken a chapter at a time. This is not a ""quick read,"" and it probably would not serve you well to move on to the next concept before mastering the one you're on.Some of the concepts may be a little ""out there"" for some (like the ""Fish Bowl Guided Visualization,"" for one) but think for a moment. What you know and how you put it all together is how you got where you are right now. If you are 100% happy with that and satisfied with every aspect of your life, why would you possibly be considering this book? New perspectives are sometimes just what the doctor ordered, even  if they may seem ""offbeat"" at first. Maybe everything in this book will not resonate equally for you. Name the LAST book where THAT happened.I don't want to say too much about the specific content of the book, because it would detract from the joy of your own discovery process. Suffice it to say that it's a book about mastery...mastering your thoughts, bringing discipline and focus to your actions, so that you can make progress while others are standing still.This is NOT one of those ""I've read it all before"" books. I'm not sure how some of the other reviewers came to that kind of conclusion but I encourage you, at minimum, to download the Kindle sample and decide for yourself. Then get the book and start taking full control of your life and your happiness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9MP4XQUFUKGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APT1C5S#wasThisHelpful","R9MP4XQUFUKGP","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you click ""5 stars"" at the start of an Amazon review, the caption that appears is ""I love it!"" Let me be specific, I love 7 of the tracks, like most of the rest, and wish one hadn't been included. Still a 5-star CD, though.The David Coverdale years of Deep Purple (""Mark III"" and ""Mark IV"") are somewhat like the ""Van Hagar"" years of Van Halen. While Sammy has performed a few DLR songs onstage with Eddie & Alex & Michael, You're never going to hear Roth croon ""Love Walks In."" Same goes for Ian Gillan...the lyrics to ""Burn"" will never pass his lips.It's a shame, because the ""Burn"" album was a downright classic. The song itself has a Ritchie Blackmore riff as catchy as ""Smoke On The Water,"" and the songwriting on the entire album is pretty rock solid. As you know, Blackmore would snatch ""Mistreated"" for Rainbow set lists, and Ronnie James Dio performed it in his solo shows as well.""Stormbringer"" was an admirable effort to bring Deep Purple into new and uncharted realms. It was also enough to make Ritchie leave the band. ""Come Taste The Band,"" the one album with the late Tommy Bolin, was OK...it ""sounded more like Deep Purple"" than ""Stormbringer""...it just didn't have legs. They plodded on until April 1984, when the ""Mark II"" band orchestrated one of the most powerful ""comeback"" albums of all time, ""Perfect Strangers.""The Coverdale band was a mix of the singer's own sometimes Robert Plant-ish vocals and the high wails of bassist Glenn Hughes. On the studio albums, Hughes had some restraint, but on some of the live albums, listening could be a painful experience as reach exceeded grasp. The FIRST thing you will notice about ""The Purple Album"" is that Coverdale is often singing in lower registers than on the Purple originals, and there is no attempt made whatsoever to replicate Hughes' contributions. You get straight harmony vocals, and that's it. ""Might Just Take Your Life"" starts of mimicking swampy acoustic Delta blues, and then BANG, there are the electric instruments, and Coverdale struts in a very Whitesnake-ish manner throughout the song, but the Hughes segment is just painted over in the arrangement. I'm not sure how Hughes fans are going to react to this...slighted because their guy was passed over, or relieved that Coverdale didn't seek out a Hughes soundalike?The only song that makes me wince a little is ""Love Child,"" but then again, it made me wince on ""Come Taste The Band,"" too. If you're a fan of Kip Winger and his take on ""romance,"" you might like it. For me, it has too much of that sleazy, leering quality to it, and while Coverdale was 24 years old when he sang it, he's 63 now, and it just doesn't feel good to hear him coo lines like ""Squeeze 'n' tease me honey, When you shake your body, You move my soul...Let me be your lover, Won't you let me be your child."" It's a song for a younger guy to sing, or...if you have my tastes...maybe no guy at all. Just put it out to pasture.The KEY performances...the ones where the concept is MOST effective...are ""Burn,"" ""Might Just Take Your Life,"" ""Sail Away,"" ""Mistreated,"" ""The Gypsy,"" ""Stormbringer,"" and ""Soldier Of Fortune."" The rest (minus ""Love Child"" are good, maybe not great.It's Coverdale's legacy, he has every right to claim it, and this is a purchase-worthy CD if there ever was one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ASYZ3MLLS2M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U02LURA#wasThisHelpful","R3ASYZ3MLLS2M3","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What works best for the Zac Brown Band can also work against them, depending on your point of view. This is not a band that you can pin down to one specific style, and you'll find the multiple personalities to be refreshing...or you won't.In 2013, I was a DJ in a small club out in the middle of the Nevada desert. In addition to all of the expected songs from Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Buck Owens, and all of the other legends of Country music, I mixed in a lot of current top 25 songs as well. I didn't care for much of the pop songs, and I really grew weary about guys singing about how good their baby looks in her blue jeans. The newer bands / performers who rose to the top of my favorites list...and as a result got played more often in the club...included Dierks Bentley, Justin Moore, and The Zac Brown Band. The song that was on the charts at the time was ""Goodbye In Her Eyes""...which followed the release of this live album...but it was easy to tell Zac was going a few layers below skin deep when it came to the complexities of love and life.One of his major influences, which you'll find out as soon as you give him a listen, is Jimmy Buffett. Once again, glass half empty or glass half full. You'll him along and tap your fingers to a song like ""Toes,"" or you'll skip it altogether. It's all a matter of taste.The material I like best can best be described as a mix of the pre-""Copperhead Road"" Steve Earle and Bruce Hornsby & The Range, from their first album ""The Way It Is."" If you listen to Zac's ""Highway 20 Ride,"" it's a kindred spirit to Hornsby's ""Mandolin Rain."" The other three tracks on this CD that, for my tastes, I consider to be the best are ""Whatever It Is,"" ""Colder Weather"" (featuring Little Big Town), and the SUBLIME medley of ""Free"" and Van Morrison's ""Into The Mystic."" There's a clip of Zac on YouTube performing this medley live with...Jimmy Buffett. But anyone with even a casual knowledge of Jimmy's music knows there is the ""Pirate Looks At 40"" Jimmy, and the ""Cheeseburger In Paradise"" Jimmy. My tastes run to ""Pirate."" I'm less enthused by snappy uptempo songs about getting toasted on a boat, whether they're from Jimmy or Zac, but that's just me.There's a live version of the Marshall Tucker Band's ""Can't You See"" here with Kid Rock on vocals...fun, maybe not essential. But this CD is an excellent introduction to Zac's music, very highly recommended. The only caveat I can offer...and as you can see, it was not enough to keep me from giving this five stars...is that if you like albums where the tone and mood are set on the first song and stay that way until the end, this is not the album for you. Zac's an explorer, and in order to really appreciate what he's doing, you have t be willing to follow him all over the map.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKWPUMEL1AKDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039OC0O8#wasThisHelpful","RKWPUMEL1AKDI","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one was a GAME CHANGER. I don't know where YOU were in 1978, when this was released...but I can tell you EXACTLY where I was. I was working in a warehouse in Sunnyvale, California. We had several transistor radios strategically placed throughout our department and we went back and forth between KSJO and KOME...the two biggest FM rock stations of the day. We were at the ""death rattle"" days of Disco...it was no longer amusing, we hated it, Peter Frampton and The Bee Gees had jumped the shark with the ""Sgt. Pepper"" movie (release date,  July 24, 1978). It was OVER. And blasting out of these cheap little speakers in our warehouse was ""You Really Got Me."" The ARRANGEMENT sounded like The Kinks, but The Kinks never sounded that tough. WHO WAS THAT?Eddie, Alex, Mike and David came along at a time when the world hungered and thirsted for the return of ROCK, and they DELIVERED.There is really nothing you can say about this album beyond ""buy it."" It still holds up, the songs are still classics. I thought that each Van Halen album got progressively weaker in terms of songwriting and performance. By the time of ""1984,"" Eddie was CLEARLY telegraphing his ""Van Hagar"" power ballad, keyboard-driven punches. But on THIS album, it's only rock and roll, and I STILL like it.I am even willing to forgive them for the quadruple dip (original vinyl/cassette/8-track, initial CD release, 2012 remasters, 2015 remasters). People who read my reviews know I have the most low-rent ""sound system"" imaginable. Is the 2015 remaster ""better than"" the 2012 remaster, and is THAT ""better than"" the original CD release?

"While Molly Hatchet has gone through more changes than most bands, they have pretty much been slammed critically from Day 1. Derided as an inferior Skynyrd knock-off, they might have gotten a bit of slack for the ""Flirtin' With Disaster"" album, but other than that, it's been the fans who have kept this band afloat, not critics.""Locked & Loaded"" is not a perfect album, and it may not be anywhere near as good as ""Double Trouble Live,"" their first live album, with the ""sort of original lineup"" and Danny Joe Brown on lead vocals. But even on THAT album, they featured ""Stone In Your Heart,"" a song that was slammed as being too pop and ""not a Molly Hatchet song"" and wouldn't ya just know it, they had SYNTHS on there. SYNTHS! On a ""Southern Rock"" song? Cue the angry villagers and their torches.Make no mistake, the Dave Hlubek / Phil McCormack edition of this band has made a few boneheaded missteps during their tenure. They are not a ""perfect"" band...they never have been, never will be, and once again, this goes all the way back to the Danny Joe Brown days.But when they are ON, they can ROCK. Case in point is ""Saddle Tramp"" from ""Silent Reign Of Heroes,"" which may be their single most solid post-Brown track. ""Devil's Canyon,"" from the album of the same name, is another brutal stomper. Sure, they jumped the shark with that ""Southern Rock Masters"" album. They completely missed any trace of irony in the Stones' ""Tumblin' Dice,"" and apparently they think their version is a winner anyway, because it shows up here. The ""core"" songs which make up ""Classic"" Molly Hatchet...""Flirtin' With Disaster,"" ""Bounty Hunter,"" ""Fall Of The Peacemakers,"" ""Whiskey Man,"" ""Gator Country,"" ""Beatin' The Odds,"" and ""Dreams I'll Never See,"" and all here, and they're in pretty decent versions. For the record, Gregg Allman was not a fan of this band. He got pulled aside by an MTV veejay back in the day and was asked about the band's version of ""Dreams,"" and he replied with a terse ""NO COMMENT."" So much for ""Southern Rock Masters.""This isn't a band that's going to change the world. This is a band that is going to show up at some local biker rally or state fair and play ""Flirtin' With Disaster"" and the crowd is going to go nuts. Music can do a lot of things, and one of them is make people happy. Nothing wrong with that, and nothing wrong with the album. As far as the sound quality is concerned, I'm listening too it as I type on my Acer laptop, which...even though it says right on it ""DOLBY HOME THEATER,"" still has two speakers the size of quarters. When I'm not listening here, it's behind the when of my Honda Pilot, with its factory-installed sound system. If the ""audiophiles"" aren't delighted with ""Locked & Loaded,"" I suggest they go complain to mama, and maybe she'll give them a cookie.

"King Crimson...the edition that included John Wetton, Bill Bruford, and...sometimes...David Cross and Jamie Muir, alongside founder Robert Fripp...was the one band most responsible for the ""Prog Metal"" sound you hear today in bands like Dream Theater. They were very similar to Mahavishnu Orchestra (the ORIGINAL ""Inner Mounting Flame"" / ""Birds Of Fire"" configuration) in that they were all virtuoso performers and all somewhat volatile when it came to the dynamics of playing in a band. One of the great highlights of the various box sets and reissues that have followed this edition of King Crimson is the ongoing peek into Robert Fripp's personal diaries. According to Fripp, this individuals in this edition of the band used to like to inch up their volume onstage, a precursor of Christopher Guest's ""Nige Tufnel"" remark in ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" referring to his amp...""this one goes to 11.""For YEARS following the vinyl release of USA, Fripp resisted re-releasing it or presenting the full show in its correct running order. He insisted that there were better shows, and in order to prove it, he gave us the ""Great Deceiver"" box set, as well as numerous ""King Crimson Collectors Club"" archive shows. Didn't shut people up, though...like any good collectors, they wanted USA, and the best version of it they could get.There have been MEGA-box sets of ""Larks Tongues,"" ""Starless & Bible Black,"" and ""Red."" On the ""Road To Red"" box set in particular, the Providence show (also offered in the ""Great Deceiver"" box) may be one of the toughest and tastiest gigs in this band's history.But it still...does...not...matter. USA is a piece of history. It may not be the BEST Wetton / Bruford era show captured on tape, but it is what it is. And back in 1974, prog fans went NUTS over this.No one band member is really responsible for this album's stature...they're ALL on fire. At the time, this was the album a friend used to introduce me to King Crimson (that's right, I first heard them after they'd all packed up and gone on their separate ways).I'd heard the first album, and everyone knew ""21st Century Schizoid Man,"" but my friend dropped the needle in the groove and said ""Wait till you heard THIS guy sing it). He was right, Greg Lake delivered the appropriate level of menace to Pete Sinfield's lyrics on that first album, but Wetton tore into it like a pit bull on a pork chop. Bill Bruford might be THE most ferocious drummer in the history of Prog, and I say that after having seen Phil Collins with Genesis at his peak, with Steve Hackett still on board.USA now consists of the original album plus ""Fracture"" and ""Starless."" ""Fracture"" is always a highlight...in the Belew era it was reborn, in a manner of speaking, as ""FraKctured,"" and the urban myth...should you choose to believe it...is that Fripp would decide whether the band would play it or not depending on ""how well behaved"" the audience had been throughout the show.You can get ALL of the music on this CD (with the exception of the improv ""Asbury Park"") in different, perhaps ""superior"" versions...but this is a real time capsule artifact.

"The David Coverdale era of Deep Purple is kind of like the Sammy Hagar era of Van Halen....Dave won't perform Sammy songs in concert, and Ian won't be doing ""Burn"" any time soon. It's a shame, because while the Coverdale-Hughes Purple was somewhat of a different animal (so different that Ritchie Blackmore bailed after ""Stormbringer""), there are some solid songs in that catalog that led up to the launch of Whitesnake. Coverdale is well aware of that...the upcoming ""Purple Album"" pays a long-overdue tribute to the best of his time in the band.Even casual fans probably know that this live album includes Purple drummer Ian Paice and the late, legendary Jon Lord. What makes it a 5-star album is the fact that, much like pre-Alive! KISS, the initial Whitesnake studio albums never really caught fire. Even though they had Martin Birch on hand and the aforementioned DP alums, the songwriting and studio performances didn't add up to the stuff of legends. Here, however, they STOMP, they go for the THROAT, and the result is just as good as you want it to be.

"Yes, it's short (37 minutes, 5 songs, not counting the ""Walk On"" and 90-second ""Banshee Legs Bell Hassle"" interlude). Then again, so was 1994's ""VROOOM,"" the E.P. that introduced Adrian Belew to the world of All Things Crimson (6 songs, 31 minutes, and Fripp called it a ""calling ""card"").Here's my take on the new line-up, a mixture of my own thoughts and reactions to what others have already said:1). YES, it is great to have Tony Levin back.2). YES, the three drummers...while initially sounding like a gimmick...do play with precision and do not collide.3). YES, Jakko Jakszyk is an admirable foil / sparring partner for Fripp. While Belew excelled in the ""soundscapes"" and noisy dogfights, Jakszyk seems more of a perfect match for revisiting the Lake / Burrell / Wetton years of the band (as is evidenced by the choice of two tracks from ""Islands"" and one from ""Red""). The Belew band started out as somewhat of a Robert Fripp knock-off of Talking Heads...and while Belew did sing in a ""traditional"" manner on songs like ""Heartbeat"" and ""One Time,"" after a while...no matter how amusing or entertaining one of his performances might be...I found myself wishing he would ""sing"" rather than ""bleat like a sheep."" Jakszyk SINGS, and while his voice may be missing the warm baritone of a Greg Lake or John Wetton, he sounds pretty good here.4). YES, it is GREAT to have Mel Collins back. It was easy to forget how essential his contribution to the KC sound was after making it through the last two decades of the Belew-dominant band.5). FULL DISCLOSURE -  I did NOT hear 2011's ""Scarcity Of Miracles."" As such, I'm basing my reaction to this band solely on ""Live At The Orpheum."" They are no longer a ""new"" group, so what they will be able to accomplish in the studio...if they choose to record a ""new"" Crimson album...remains to be seen. Looks promising. Fripp is just as likely to abandon and experiment as he is to dive in head first, so time will tell.Short but tasty...recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMD8ESHCSGER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJH5O9K#wasThisHelpful","RHMD8ESHCSGER","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Something's missing here, and it's not limited to Michael Anthony.In terms of SONG SELECTION, it's pretty much a Van Halen fan's dream come true (except for ""Tattoo,"" but let's not go there). Eddie sounds like Eddie, which is at least half the reason why you're here, right? But Dave? The years have not been kind to Dave. The set kicks off in high gear with ""Unchained,"" but Dave's like a lot of ""power"" lead singers who get the point of cheating, sort of ""shout-singing"" the lyrics, and a lot of the hoots and howls he uses to punctuate his vocals (long a Diamond Dave trademark) are now forced and off-key. He TALKS much of the way through ""Runnin' With The Devil"" and there is more of the off-key groaner stuff as well.I'm not going to get into the politics of the band and whether Wolfgang meets or exceeds Michael Anthony's bass playing but he certainly is no match for him on background vocals.As you might suspect, there are NO Sammy songs in the set. Hagar had to tackle 3 Roth songs on ""Live: Right Here Right Now,"" but it's not reciprocated in this set.""Panama"" is a groaner. Because of Dave. When he hits the line ""Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue"" you WILL wince. Trust me.My understanding of the original Roth-era shows was that they could be sloppy. When Sammy joined the band he said, on record, that concerts would no longer be a matter of ""ripping the kids off with a clown show."" In 2015, who knows what's behind Roth's motivation or in his heart (or if he even has one). Maybe he's doing his best. And with a band that based their reputation on 6 hard rock albums unleashed on a rock-hungry world (remember that the first album hit the airwaves at a tie when disco was in its final death throes), what's on this album simply isn;t good enough. Three stars and trust me, I'm being overly generous out of nostalgia.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAH1UGHMIZU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T38G0Z4#wasThisHelpful","R1EAH1UGHMIZU6","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think your enjoyment of this series will come on one of two levels...one, you love ""so bad it's GREAT"" entertainment, or two, you get sucked into the vortex of this show's premise and root for the good guys (I'm not convinced there ARE any...they ALL have an agenda) and boo the bad guys (easy targets all). Personally, I don't think there are any people worth cheering for in this show because of the reasons I just named.Let's start at the top with ""Maw Maw"" Mabe. She gets a visit from Brandon and his fiance and says ""Well, I was reading, but I GUESS I could stop."" Then she tells them ""Well, y'all look like you're ready to get up and leave, so...GET UP AND LEAVE!"" Brandon forces a weak little ""I've heard all of this before,"" but if you don;t have blood ties to this cantankerous woman, chances are you'll have a different expression on your face.Then there are the parents. Dad likes to rub Brandon's nose in the fact that he built up the business and just ""handed it to him."" And Mom is a few notches past Oedipal in her assertion that Brandon's wife-to-be Megan isn't ""good enough"" for him. Both parents are FIERCELY protective of the business, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. It's just the way it manifests itself. Watch the show and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.Brandon, in the crosshairs of all of this, is part ""I am going to do what's right for this family"" and part wimp. To his credit, he defends Megan against the venom both parents send her way. To his discredit, all it takes is a few hard words from Mama and he's got his tail between his legs, slinking away with that ""I don't know what I'm gonna do now"" nonsense, even though he knows EXACTLY what he WANTS to do. He just won't cross Mama for ANY reason, and watching his struggle makes him come off weak and a bit of a sneak sometimes as his whole purpose seems to be plotting an end run around both parents before they know he's pulled it off.Megan...she whines, she's manipulative, she's paranoid and neurotic and WAY beyond insecure, and she's probably the single most entertaining member of the entire cast.Breanna...""Breezy""...the real reason why she's not on stage with the rest of the family is, to put it politely, she is homely and can't sing. That's it...she's not slick enough to join the Mabes onstage. She sees breast augmentation as the answer to her dilemma but everyone in the audience knows it's going to take a lot more than that.Denton Mabe...another whiner whose talent level is right around that of your average Saturday night karaoke barfly. He hits the right notes but anyone could fill those shoes. His dear departed dad sold out his interest in the business and Denton spends most of his time whining about how he has no ""voice"" in what goes on.  He also had a creepy kind of Norman Bates thing going on in the episode where he quizzed down Heather over the armloads of clothes she was bringing into her dressing room.Heather Gentry, the ""new girl"" brought in to give the show some youthful sex appeal that they couldn't accomplish by putting ""Breezy""...a fellow Mabe...onstage, because while she is youthful, her sex appeal is non-existent. And what does Mom do? Spend most of her time trying to dampen that sex appeal.Whether you agree with me on any of these observations or not, I'm confident you'll take ONE thing away from my review. This show has a LOT going on. The people...if they are really this way ""in real life"" or not...can get a little loathsome and irritation but hey...isn't that what ""reality TV"" is all about?I have watched the entire first season, and unlike some folks, am looking forward to a second.

"""Cold Calling""...or ""Prospecting,"" or whatever you'd care to call it...is one of the most loathed and avoided tasks among salespeople. You've heard it said before that the salespeople who are at the top 2% of their game are there because they regularly perform all of the tasks that most salespeople avoid or simply refuse to do. Cold Calling is one of those tasks. It's a push-pull thing...unless customers are pushing down your door to get at what you've got, you MUST pull them in. The process of elimination...turning complete strangers into ""suspects,"" turning ""suspects"" into ""prospects,"" turning ""prospects"" into ""customers""...that's a salesperson's job, the entire reason behind their receiving a paycheck, whether it's base and commission or straight commission. So if you are a salesperson and you cannot or will not make cold calls, you can start counting the days until your boss invites you to seek employment elsewhere.The fear / avoidance of Cold Calling...referred to as ""Call Reluctance"" in trade terms...is handled in Rosen's book better than I've seen it handled in most places. He devotes Chapter 2 (""Becoming Fearless"") to this subject, but the ""25 words or less"" version of what he's trying to get you to understand is summed up near the end of the chapter:""Get out of your head. Once you get yourself out of your own way, you are then able to generate extraordinary results.""You see, ""Cold Calling techniques"" are great, and there is no shortage of them in this book, but until you become comfortable with the concept of making those calls repeatedly (and making as many calls as it takes to close as many sales as you ultimately need to close), the techniques will simply teach you something that you do not want to do.So Rosen peels back the layers and helps you ask the questions you need to ask. WHAT are you afraid of? WHY are you afraid of it? WHAT benefits might you receive if you are able to ""get out of your head?""Humans, in general, love to over-think and over-analyze most aspects of life. But when you are out there trying to make a living, paralysis by analysis will not serve you. You need to sit down, determine your goals, make a series of actionable steps, and go to work.If you've determined the pathway to your goals is best supported by being a salesperson, Rosen's book can...and WILL...help you.The book is about 1000% better than its title. Why he chose to label such a fine work in this manner is beyond me, but don't dwell on that. Buy it, learn from it, put it into practice, and be successful. YOU CAN! You just hhave to convince yourself first and then you'll have no trouble convincing everyone else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4I7VGQRLZ3ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AR1802C#wasThisHelpful","R4I7VGQRLZ3ZZ","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm giving Claude four stars for this one largely due to the pragmatic nature of his approach. I am a sole proprietor...which means I am also my ""sales force."" There are no clients unless I go out and get them. A cornerstone of Claude's approach is making a LOT of contact with a LOT of prospects:""Phone faster.. in 1 hours time you’ll get a couple of solid appointments if you phone fast. Then you’ll say, “Wow, this works”. If you call only a few every hour, it will feel like you never get an appointment. “It doesn’t work.. I called for a whole hour!”. Phone faster.""Now, the only CHALLENGE with that...if you want to use a list of pre-qualified prospects rather than the Yellow Pages shotgun approach...is that you either have to purchase the list or compile it yourself. Decent, ""scrubbed"" lists cost a lot of money. Do-it-yourself lists are the best, because you can be assured of their accuracy before you pick up the phone or walk in, but it takes many, many hours to come up with even the smallest of lists. That's true of what I do...Web Design. For your product or service it might take more time, it might take less.Claude doesn't really offer a solution for that obstacle, he just assumes you're reading the book on the other side of it. He does offer a few list sources, but sometimes a low budget means no budget, and when it comes to ""free"" list brokers, you get what you pay for. Unless you can afford the best list available, you really are better off investing the sweat equity and compiling it yourself.What I like BEST about Claude's philosophy...the source of my 4 star rating overall for the book...is his ""care while not caring"" principle. You have to care enough to pick up the phone or hit the streets, yes. But you have to immunize yourself against ""caring"" about prospects who don;t want what you have to offer. That's where most salespeople slow down or stop...they take the rejection personally, which is foolish, because it's never really a ""personal"" exchange with a prospect on first contact anyway, unless you're coming to them via a referral.This is a book for WORKING salespeople...he's not teaching any tricks or gimmicks here. It's more ""old school"" than some of the modern sales gurus like Jeffrey Gitomer. I would not say that this is the one and only book on sales that you should own. I would say that you should own it, that you should learn as much from it as you can, and add it to the well-rounded knowledge you have gained from other sources. Study the ""sales dogs"" like the immortal Zig Ziglar and Brian Tracy. Get a couple of Gitomer books like ""The Sales Bible"" and ""The Little Red Selling."" Add Claude's expertise to that mix and you will be one empowered individual, ready for success.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ4JIAL86OB8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICR4V1C#wasThisHelpful","RQ4JIAL86OB8E","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit right up front that I don't read a lot of ""rock biographies."" Many of them are poorly written and too one-sided (the performer must be a saint of sinner with no room in between).I place this book on similar standing with the Neil Young bio ""Shakey"" by Jimmy McDonough. The backsstory on that one...briefly...is that it was / is an ""authorized"" bio, that Neil gave McDonough unrestricted access to his ""inner circle,"" and once he read a copy of the first draft, locked down everyone and everything. That's why it moves along at such a smooth pace and then stops on a dime...Neil stopped it because McDonough told the truth and Neil didn't like seeing it on the page.So this is not a ""tabloid"" book where Bockris rips Lou mercilessly to shreds, and it's also not Tiger Beat. I didn't know Lou. There's basically one person who knows how ""true"" the truth is in Bockris' words and that would be the late, great Lou himself. It FEELS true. If you lived through it, the albums and the backstage / offstage stories and the whole ball of wax, this book FEELS like an accurate document of who and what Lewis Allan ""Lou"" Reed actually WAS.You know, it is OK to tell the story of the man and still hold up the music as groundbreaking, legendary, and unforgettable.Lou had some issues.So does Neil.That happens sometimes when you're dealing with a genius.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HW48H1IV0M00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306807521#wasThisHelpful","R3HW48H1IV0M00","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing that I liked about this book was the format. Writing a book in small, easy-to-digest in one sitting chapters has become increasingly popular...just look at the collected works of sales guru Jeffrey Gitomer. This book gives you the content of the chapter, followed by an ""Action Step."" The author recommends a ton of external resources. Obviously, you won't read or view all of them, but many of them will jump off the page as exactly the kind of sage wisdom you need in your life right now.

"I first discovered Dr. Robert Anthony's books via a 12-week Sales & Management Training class I took in the late 80s. His writings were basically ""The Secret"" in the modern era, decades before Rhonda Byrne's 2006 book. Both Anthony and Byrne drew heavily from the turn-of-the-20th-Century books you will find collected under the covers of ""The Prosperity Bible"" (a five-star purchase if there ever was one), as well as the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Earl Nightingale's ""The Strangest Secret."" Anthony delivered the ""You are what you believe you are / what you think about with the most consistency and emotion"" message in a modern language that eschewed much of the dated quaintness found in the ""Prosperity Bible"" books. It's simple, it's direct...from your moment of birth you have allowed yourself to be programmed by your parents, your family, your classmates, your teachers, your successful and failed romances, pretty much everyone you've come into contact with. The good news is that you can make a conscious decision to assume your role of ""deliberate co-creator"" of your life and erase the old tapes and live life on your terms. It's easy on one hand, but on the other, many people just can't come to grips with the tenacity and consistency required to drive nothing but empowering thoughts into their subconscious mind until change actually takes place. This book is far superior to so many that followed its publication. I recommend it without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJYDJZKRLQZPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LSTB1C#wasThisHelpful","RJYDJZKRLQZPP","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It looks like Jeffrey has retired his ongoing ""Little Book Of..."" series. I've also noticed that he's updated The Sales Bible...again...with more detailed info on Social Media. I have to admit I winced a little...actually, MORE than a little...when the word ""Unbreakable"" ended up in the title of this book. While fellow Sales Guru Brian Tracy doesn't own the copyright to the word, try not thinking of his books ""The 100 Absolutely Unbreakable Laws of Business Success"" and ""The Unbreakable Laws of Self-Confidence."" It's not the first time Jeffrey has sacrificed originality over new product, but I still have to give him 4 stars for what's between the covers. Is it a re-hash of everything else he's written? Of course it is, and if you have to ask that question, you're probably not a follower of his collected works. The payoff, for me, came during his discussion of intention: ""Beyond your goals, to-do list, and urgent matters of the day, it's your INTENTIONS that drive your actions - both daily and long term. Intentions precede actions and are the mental drivers to achievement. In short: YOU ONLY DO WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO. As you think about your priorities and prepare your list of ""must dos,"" identify and affirm your willingness to make the priorities happen, OR YOU WILL FIND A CONVENIENT EXCUSE FOR FAILURE. If you don't intend, you won't achieve. The main reason goals are not achieved is simple: YOU DIDN'T INTEND TO ACHIEVE THEM."" You see, my personal belief is that if you read a book and find ONE dynamic idea...one butt-kicking that you DESPERATELY need someone to give you...then you got your money's worth. Like it or not, this book is a bullet-point ""check up from the neck up"" book. That's not to say that there aren't a wealth of ideas for your selling efforts...there are. But if you want a book that will reflect reality in the trenches as a salesperson in 2015  and will help you sell NOW...especially if you are feeling the crunch...consider John Rosso's ""Prospect The Sandler Way: and Art Sobczak's ""Smart Calling."" ""The Sandler Rules"" from David Sandler and David Mattson is also a very helpful read.Jeffrey has long been a critic of ""Cold Calling"" (he sells a ""Cold Calling"" audio CD that basically tells you to not cold call), and the message in this book is no exception. He tells you that if you put his Cold Calling alternatives into play starting today, ""...it will take you six months to get it going, and one year to make it happen. After that, the phone will ring."" So what happens if you are behind the 8 ball TODAY, if you have bills you need to pay TODAY, if you don't HAVE a year to make this alternative fall into place? Simple. You heed the advice of Brian Tracy and the ""40 Plus Formula."" It states that if you are working 40 hours a week right now, it may be enough for your survival...MAYBE...but it is not enough for your success. So do what you need to do in order to survive, and meanwhile, water the seeds of a better long-term strategy daily.This is a valuable book...maybe not Gitomer's best (I'm tempted to give that distinction to hiss ""Little Red Book Of Selling.""). My advice, if you're sitting on the fence (as I was) is to go to a local bookstore or library and actually thumb through this one rather than basing a decision completely on these reviews. I'm finding it helpful and I've read every one of his other books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A7IHXVYC9GOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3QOBHE#wasThisHelpful","R1A7IHXVYC9GOZ","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Case in point: The ""How Are You Today? Use It Or Not"" section on using ""small talk"" at the beginning of a call. The final advice is ""Use it if you are comfortable."" I am self-employed, a sole proprietor, so I am also my ""sales force."" Any time I am cold-called and someone asks me ""How are you today"" I'm almost immediately irritated and abruptly ask ""What can I do for you,"" which...if it's a telemarketer on the other end...throws the person off their script as chaos ensues. So I get the wisdom behind ""Use what works for you,"" and in my own sales calls...whether I am making them or receiving them...""How are you today"" is the kiss of death in the first ten seconds of the call. There is a wealth of information in the book about that first ten seconds. It's on you to read the book, and by trial and error, personalize its content so you are appropriately approaching your prospects, presenting a value proposition that moves you to the next level of the conversation, and leads to a sale. The issue is that you won't be able to buy this book, read it, put it into practice and grow into the top two percent of sales professionals who prospect like champs. The issue is that when you pick up the phone and dial you have 10 seconds to separate yourself from the other 98 percent of rookies, hacks, and insecure salespeople who are also out there dialing for dollars. I recommend this book along with John Rosso's equally essential ""Prospect the Sandler Way."" Between the two books you will have all of the raw material you need to find your ""sales voice,"" while avoiding the achingly common pitfalls that result in a ""not interested"" and abrupt hang-up for so many salespeople who don't like telephone prospecting, don't understand how to do it like a pro, and lack the basic self-confidence required to learn from every MOMENTARY ""failure."" The two books will help you with call reluctance, and they will also help you manage your expectations as you prospect. It's never been about memorizing ""sure-fire"" scripts and ""closing the sale"" in a phone call. It's about having something of value that people want and need (sometimes ""wanting"" is is enough, they don't always have to ""need"" it), and presenting yourself as a professional and trustworthy individual who can deliver it, as promised, on time, and a price that results in you making a profit and the customer feeling that their money was well spent.

"I am going to share the EXACT moment in this book in which I said ""John Rosso ROCKS."" I am a self-employed Web Designer. I am a ""sole proprietor."" That means business comes in one way...if I go out and get it. I AM my ""sales force."" I've read Zig Ziglar. I've read Brian Tracy. I've read Jeffrey Gitomer. There are a few other authors I've found to be equally helpful, INCLUDING two other books by Sandler authors: ""Sandler Success Principles"" by David Mattson and Bruce Seidman, and ""The Sandler Rules"" by David Sandler and David Mattson. THIS book offered a moment of clarity and ""you are not alone"" honesty that made my jaw drop. In recent years, I have seen a SHARP rise in the ""answered prayer"" dodge when it comes to prospects. It goes like this...you walk into a business and strike up a conversation and tell them at the appropriate moment (that moment being when the store is empty and they are not serving customers) ""I am a Web Designer"" and they respond with a BIG smile and ""WHO would have believed it? It's a MIRACLE! I was just saying that I needed a Website and what HAPPENED...YOU walked in! Could my luck BE any BETTER?"" Then, a week later, they won't take your calls. As Russo writes, ""And then we make that last call to follow up, and all of the sudden we find that our prospect has entered the Witness Protection Program. We get stuck in this Buyer-Seller Dance. And guess what? The buyer is leading the dance."" He discusses this at length, and I am not going to ruin the book for you, but suffice it to say that when you are out there selling and you take specific forms of rejection PERSONALLY and then find out they are UNIVERSAL, it empowers you to get out there and sell. As David Mattson wrote in The Sandler Rules, ""You don't have to LIKE prospecting...you just have to DO it."" Russo tells you that he is not going to give you scripts, he's not going to ask you to memorize anything. Instead, he gives you SCENARIOS, and you READ the scenario, and you internalize the ""vibe"" of the scenario, and use that as the foundation to start having natural, free-flowing conversations with prospects. You see, FAR to many salespeople get discouraged and fail because they think they are going to ""close the sale"" on an initial cold call, either on the phone or by walk-in. It doesn't happen that way. What you are doing on initial contact is seeking permission to have the conversation that COULD lead to a sale. YOU ARE SEEKING PERMISSION TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. That's IT. You are finding out if THEY would be a good client for you, and if YOU would be a good vendor for them. If you both have a little spark, some chemistry, you have the conversation. If the conversation goes well, you might ""close the sale."" What Rosso is doing is empowering you to turn as many ""first contact"" situations into appointments for the actual sales conversation. We waste too much time with prospects who have no interest in what we're selling. The days of some clown in a leisure suit pressuring someone into buying something they don't want are long gone. Sell for a living? Then BUY THIS BOOK.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3LO4UAEUK83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFTL9A0#wasThisHelpful","RD3LO4UAEUK83","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this three stars...which Amazon classifies as ""OK""...because, well...it's OK. It starts off in a funny, amusing (and sometimes R-E-A-L-L-Y grating and annoying) way. Remember Lou Reed? I was a BIG Lou Reed fan, still am. Imagine a self-help book written by Lou Reed on a particularly combative day, now make Lou a woman, and you get the idea. Ms. Sincero has the full audio book out on YouTube. Now it becomes a mash-up of Lou Reed and Fran Drescher from ""The Nanny."" But that's not the point. I was amused by the sample chapters I downloaded for Kindle. So much, in fact, that I was ready to pop for the book as soon as one of my clients' checks came in the mail. Hearing the whole book on YouTube made me change my mind. She sets you up for another walk through ""The Law Of Attraction."" Now, after ""Think And Grow Rich"" and ""As A Man Thinketh"" and ""The Master Key System"" and ""The Secret Of The Ages"" and all of the other classic books Rhonda Byrne ""borrowed"" when assembling ""The Secret,"" PLUS being well versed in the collective works of Dr. Wayne Dyer and Esther & Jerry Hicks (""Abraham / Hicks""), I don't need another copy of ""Law Of Attraction,"" even if it IS written by Lou Reed and read by Fran Drescher. This could have been a much better book if the author stayed closer to the opening of the book. As it is, she provocatively lures you in, and in place of the red meat you were hoping for, you get warmed-up leftovers. Attitude isn't enough...I buy books for content. She's right, if you sit on the sidelines and doubt yourself and get high and binge-watch Netflix while stuffing your face with Taco Bell, you're not going to die a superstar.

"I compare this album to the current lineup of Journey. I don't care for Arnel Pineda at all, but I thought that Steve Augueri...even though he was a shameless Steve Perry clone...sounded fine in the band. In Yes, I enjoyed Benoit David's work on ""Fly From Here,"" even though no one is going to label it their finest album. To take it a step further, I thought his work in his own band, Mystery, far surpassed anything he did in Yes in terms of performance AND material.I'm probably running the risk of many ""not helpful"" votes by saying I'd like to see Jon Anderson back in the band, but come on...this is one of the FEW bands that build its foundation on someone with a very distinctive performing and songwriting style. He was never the ENTIRE band. But he was such an integral part of it that his absence is felt here.There is nothing WRONG with this album at all. It's just that there is nothing here that you haven't hear before, and in a more powerful fashion. Don't believe me? Get a copy of Transatlantic's ""Kaleidoscope"" album and listen to their take on ""And You And I."" Kaleidoscope, for those not familiar with the band, is a ""sipergroup"" of sorts made up of members from the ""second wave"" of prog...former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, former Spock's Beard keyboardist Neal Morse, Marillion bassist Pete Trewavas, and Roine Stolt from the Flower Kings. Simply put, the students now sound better than the master. We live in sad times when a cover of a legendary band's classic can blow the current band right out of the water.This is tastefully performed ""so what"" music. It plays well in the background but I challenge you to remember any song from it after first listen.You have Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White from the ""classic"" lineup of the band (although II have always preferred Bill Bruford over White). You have Geoff Downes on keyboards, whose primary function in Asia for decades was to steer the bus straight down the middle of the road in search of radio-friendly hits, rather than acting like unhinged wizard Rick Wakeman. And at center stage, you have Jon Davison, in way over his head. Remember the so-called supergroup ""GTR?"" Steve Howe, Steve Hackett, and vocalist Max Bacon, one of the least distinctive frontmen in the history of rock and roll. The current lineup of Yes isn't quite as bad as that, but they are committing the cardinal sin for a band that made its bones on stoner bombast...they have become safe and B-O-R-I-N-G.Then again, Asia's still around, so a ""Yes Lite"" version of Yes could prosper for years to come. I just won't be standing in the crowd with my Bic in the air.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JHVLC9S52NPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQHON74#wasThisHelpful","R3JHVLC9S52NPL","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I installed these strings and, as the advertising states, they minimize ""squeak,"" but after a few minutes of playing them I realized I LIKE the ""squeak"" on acoustics. It's part of the charm, it's something I've come to expect, and it's never bothered me. The strings felt different to me...they are obviously steel, but the wrapped strings almost felt like nylon. I haven't had them on the guitar long enough to tell you if i'd purchase a second set, but my overall verdict is that they play well, but probably wouldn't convince me to give up my normal brand of strings.

"Not for me, unfortunately. Over the years I have smoked (but not since 2002) and drink a cup of black coffee or two.

"You remember that, right? Weir decided he'd like to play slide guitar, but instead of learning how to to that and then stepping onstage with the Dead, he LEARNED onstage. It made for some uneasy listening, but the Deadheads went along with it because, after all, it was the Dead.Same for Neil. Crazy Horse has never been about precision and unrelenting focus. Sometimes the ""ragged glory"" of the moment springs out of the passion and sloppiness of the performance. Sometimes.Case in point, Neil's reach exceeds his grasp on ""Barstool Blues."" First, this isn't 1975, so the vocals drop a key or two. The original was jam-packed with trademark Neil ""isn't he going to hurt himself doing that"" high notes. Here, he lays back and plays it safe. But it's the SOLO, the part you WAIT for, where Neil sort of stumbles around looking for a groove he never quite finds.Same can be said for much of the rest of the album, too. When ""Broken Arrow"" was released (the studio album that preceded this one), the band had that lind of heavy, lumbering sound going on. Of course, this was before ""Psychedelic Pill"" and the song ""Walk Like A Giant,"" where he pushed the sludge thing right past ""excess"" and just kept going.Another issue here is that Neil revisits some of his weaker material like ""Sedan Delivery."" We got that one on ""Rust Never Sleeps"" and ""Live Rust""...how badly did we need a third version?There's a ""high lonesome"" version of ""Mr. Soul""...Neil on acoustic guitar and harmonica...that provides a nice little breather from the meandering jams.It's not his WORST live album, but it certainly isn't his BEST.

They never came within a country mile of their original mojo until Warren Haynes joined them for the ""Seven Turns"" album, and they were dangerous again.You can tell it's over on this album but you also have a few ""career best"" performances here...the title track, the smoking cover of Muddy Waters' ""Can't Lose What You Never Have,"" ""Nevertheless.""

"How do you NOT love a book that has lines like ""When Jessica was full, she bit Lily again?""This is a collection of 13 short stories by L.F. DePaula, a notorious Silicon Valley legend now living several states East of the Cali border. He wasn't run out of town on a rail due to the infamous Rail Shortage of 2002. The locals wanted to, they just couldn't find any rails. The shortage was THAT bad, folks.Authors are an interesting breed. Who wouldn't want to sit down with Mark Twain, sipping a glass of icy cold lemonade from a mason jar, while he regaled you for hours on end with wild, vibrant stories about our nation's past?When it comes to L.F. DePaula, you kind of want him restrained in that Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter mask while he recites his terrifying tails from behind bars. While a couple of Dobermans stand by, just in case. Yeah...Dobermans. Because when you read this book you won't sleep for at least 18 days. It happened to me, don't laugh. I tried everything...warm milk, chamomile tea, you name it...18 days of sitting in the corner of my room with a flashlight and a baseball bat because by the time you read this book cover you'll be at least a little bit scared of everything, but especially L.F. DePaula. He'll bust up your granny's favorite chair without blinking, G.Ice Spiders. People feeding squirrels every day. Getting hit in the head with a tree branch by Alphonse Patrizzi and having even worse things happen to you at the hands of Johnny Gray. Little bits of L.F. DePaula's New England upbringing that are not-so-fictionalized (""Sheriff Poole""). Parents busy setting fishing nets when a flash flood comes down on them without warning. Severe concussions. Fractured right cheekbones. Two broken ribs. And one more thing that's worse than all of those things put together. Such is an average day in the life and mind of L.F. DePaula, a man Stephen King once described as ""WHO?""All kidding aside, the Internet age pretty much killed off new print writers, people with stories to tell, people who do what it takes to get those stories out of their heads and onto paper and in the hands of people who still enjoy the incomparable feel, smell, and sight of a good BOOK in their hands.This is a good book.

"My guess is that the majority of people reading the reviews of Road House have seen the film, if not once, then multiple times. That said, I don't think I could offer ""spoilers"" for a movie so well known, but as a courtesy to anyone who hasn't seen it, I'll refrain.This is EXACTLY the kind of entertainment that made it into ""heavy rotation"" on cable TV. It's made for late night viewing, just kicking back and getting lost in the nonsense under the roof of the Double Deuce. Swayze does a great job with the Dalton character, who is extremely conflicted. On one hand he practices Tai Chi and  mouths a lot of pseudo Zen wisdom, but on the other hand, he makes a living cracking skulls. Sam Elliott shines as Wade Garrett, Dalton's friend / mentor. Garrett's age and degree of physical decline after years or abuse  don't stand in the way of him still being the best at his chosen trade, but when he goes one on one with Brad Wesley's goon Jimmy (Marshall R. Teague), it's Dalton who steps in to save the day. Speaking of Brad Wesley, its' a signature role for Ben Gazzara. His unrepentant glee upon every act of aggression keeps him from being a ""sympathetic character""...he's just plain BAD, in the grand tradition of Edward G. Robinson's ""Johnny Rocco"" from the Bogart classic ""Key Largo."" Kelly Lynch as Dalton's love interest is a bit of a stretch, unless you view the character as a woman smart enough to know better but still drawn to the ultimate ""bad boy."" At one point she looks him right in the face and tells him ""I KNOW you're not a nice guy."" The heart wants what the heart wants, you know? Each time the plot moves forward, it's in a pretty inevitable direction. If this were a mystery, the butler DEFINITELY would have done it. That said,  it is also a truly sublime film, laced with a wealth of performances from the late Jeff Healey. The bad guys are impossibly bad and the good guys, in the great tragic tradition, have ""heroic flaws."" The movie set a template for MANY inferior imitations that followed (including an actual ""Road House 2"").

"I can give you my review in one sentence, then I'll provide some details:""This one is going to be too subtle for a lot of people.""It's hard to discuss this one in detail without dishing up spoilers.But here's one. Alan Arkin has just finished a tryst with a working girl and the owner of a brothel...the ""menage a trois"" he's had on his bucket list for years.The owner tells him ""You've ruined me for any other man.""Arkin replies ""It's OK. You'll get over it.""The movie DOES start a little slow, primarily an interaction between Walken and Pacino, and after they ""rescue"" Arkin from a rest home (in a stolen car), things get NUTS. It is VERY subtle, tongue-in-cheek humor. It gets progressively weirder. But if you're looking for ""Dumb and Dumber"" you WILL get bored.Listen, this isn't Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane. It's an extremely eccentric mash-up between three legends. If you're in the mood for rapid-fire story lines and acting, watch something else, and when you're feeling like kicking back and letting the weirdness of this one slowly unfold, do it. It's FUNNY.

By the time you get to the end of the first season all of that has changed, and it IS extremely reminiscent of Steve Martin's Vincent 'Vinnie' Antonelli character in ""My Blue Heaven""...he just gets BUSY, making connections, pulling scams, and taking time for a little romance.

"Other than the fact that Arnold is a little older and moves a little slower (and makes jokes about being old and not being able to eat yummy  double bacon and double cheddar omelets, apparently a specialty in his town), the movie is a rocket ride that doesn't disappoint. The plot is a bit convoluted...a drug dealer in a race to the Mexican border, which means he has to pass through Arnie's turf. Forest Whitaker appears as FBI Agent John Bannister and basically does what he does in 85 of all his other movies...look really concerned and give a lot of orders. Peter Stormare (Fargo / Big Lebowski) is another bad guy who ramps up the fun just by being Peter Stormare. Johnny Knoxville adds comic relief to the action. Veteran character actor Luis Guzmán (you'll recognize him immediately) does a brilliant turn as Arnie's deputy...he wants no part of what's about to come down and doesn't hesitate when it comes to saying it. Lovers of the Chevrolet Camaro will be heartbroken during the cornfield scene, but the moment this pristine red beauty appears on screen you know it's not just going to spend the entire film parked in the red zone. Is this as great as Arnie's first wave of classic action films? No, but he can still deliver the goods, and he is still undeniably fun to watch on screen. The plot is a bit of a mess and other than Whitaker, whose role could have been played by anyone, the cast is fun. If you like car chases, gunfire, and explosions, you've come to the right place. The movie was MUCH better than I'd expected.

"The title of my review is ""A great choice for the right user"" for one reason...if you are a Web / Graphics professional (or intend to be one), you'd better have ""Adobe Photoshop"" on your resume. Photoshop is still THE industry standard for this kind of software and if it is your intention to seek employment as a Web /  Graphics professional, much of your credibility will come from using the expected industry standard tools.That said, Corel PaintShop Pro X6 sells for about $650 less than Photoshop, and unless you are a Web / Graphics professional who requires many of the high end features in that package, PSP will meet (and exceed) the needs of most people looking for a ribust image manipulation / enhancement program.The Corel PaintShop Pro X6 installation MAY annoy the ""one click"" lovers out there. After the initial install, you download the PDF Users Guide separately, and there are three ""additional content"" modules you can download once you apply for a (free) Corel membership: KPT (Kai's Power Tools), Script Guide (with scripts) and Creative Content (brushes, etc). All three are ""exe"" (executable) files, you simply download and double click and they are automatically installed into the appropriate directories.You'll either be amused by the KPT filters or you'll roll your eyes and avoid them. ""Back in the day,"" they were extremely popular and sold as a stand-alone product (along with Alien Skin and a few other similar products). But like drop shadows and bevels and every other Photoshop trick, they were abused and became somewhat antiquated. That doesn't mean that you won't find them to be useful. It's just that when it comes to filters and the way they are seen by Graphics professionals in 2013, they've sort of become the equivalent of Miley Cyrus twerking...not everyone's cup of tea. Caveat Emptor.Years ago, when Paint Shop Pro was a product of JASC Software, it was THE affordable solution for hobbyists and photo enthusiasts. It was popular die to its user friendliness, and as I stated above, unless this is how you make your bread and butter, you may WANT Photoshop, but you may not NEED it. I have friends who were GIVEN ( ! ) copies of Photoshop and gave up very early in the game because they found it ""too hard to learn."" Since PSP has become a Corel product, the learning curve is a little steeper than it was in the JASC days, but it is also more feature-packed.If you've used image software before, the interface won't be totally foreign to you. There are palates as well as toolbars that run along the top and left. If you're going to use the program for ""red eye removal"" and similar tasks, you'll probably pick up what you need to know pretty quickly. If you're into creating art or doing major restoration / reconstruction, you're going to move a little slower. But the tools are there for you and the ""Learning Center,"" which you'll find on the right side of your screen, is especially helpful.If you've used Photoshop or its stripped-down ""Photoshop Elements"" version, you will find that things like layers and text behave a little differently here. I've never been a fan of the way PSP handles text, but it's a minor quibble. All you really need to know is that you can produce extremely polished and professional results with this program, with a MODERATE learning curve (expect one, and don't tell me later that I didn't warn you).All things considered, PSP is WELL worth the sale price. I've had friends who have passed layered Photoshop files back and forth between Photoshop and PSP, and there are occasional glitches. The two programs don't work together ""seamlessly,"" and if they did, you'd have two software companies sitting across from each other in court (remember Macromedia, anyone?). As long as you don;t plan to collaborate with Photoshop users, it's not a problem, but if you do...problem.One more caveat: PSP is also available in an ""Ultimate"" edition for approximately another $20. That gets you three modules that are NOT in this version...""Perfectly Clear"" (one-click image corrections), ""Face Filter"" (retouching tools), and ""Creative Collection"" (similar to what's available as a download in this version). I haven't tested the ""Ultimate"" version, and Corel only offers a downloadable trial version of the ""Pro"" version. If you think you MIGHT want to spend the extra $20, I suggest you go to Corel's product page for Ultimate and review what's there.In conclusion, please just consider what I've written here regarding your intended use of the product. That will help you decide if it's right for you, and as I said up front, it's a great (and affordable) choice for the right user.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0C97EK5IP1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOI2TD0#wasThisHelpful","R2A0C97EK5IP1E","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a 50th anniversary box set. There's no way that the ""casual Beach Boys fan"" is going to fall in love with all 174 songs on the 6 CDs in this mammoth box set.BUT...you will find EVERY great Beach Boys track, from their initial ""Surfin' Trilogy"" (""Surfin'"" / ""Surfin' Safari"" / ""Surfin' USA"") to the LAST GREAT Brian Wilson-penned Beach Boys track recorded while all three Wilson brothers walked the Earth, ""Sail On Sailor.""Your take on what happened AFTER the Holland album (1973) is a matter of personal taste. There were moments of fun, maybe moments of genius, but I contend that the LEGEND of the Beach Boys was built on the Brian/Carl/Dennis/Mike/Al foundation, and THAT'S what this set celebrates at its core. You'll find tracks from the ""Brian Is Back"" era (""15 Big Ones"" in 1976 through ""The Beach Boys"" in 1985), plus the obligatory ""final hit,"" the Mike Love / Scott McKenzie / Terry Melcher / John Phillips song ""Kokomo,"" as well as a nod to last year's ""reunion"" project, That's Why God Made the Radio. Add in live tracks, tons of outtakes, and you have pretty much all the Beach Boys music anyone would ever need. You also get the ""lavish packaging"" for those who find that to be important.Even though the previous box set, 1993's Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys had a few GLARING omissions (how could you do a ""definitive"" Beach Boys set and leave off ""Girls On The Beach?""), it was TIGHTER and CLOSER to something the non-rabid fans would want. There IS NO single (or double) ""best of"" compilation that really captures it all. THIS may be it, the ""one stop shopping"" that offers every significant track in the band's half-Century career. That may be stretching it a bit...MANY fans feel the final curtain came down with the passing of Carl Wilson in 1998, after which a Mike Love and Bruce Johnston ""touring edition"" was assembled and constituted the only way to hear the band until the 2012 reunion, minus Dennis and Carl.Also, at the time of the ""Good Vibrations"" box set's release, The Smile Sessions (2CD) and Brian Wilson's Smile...two COMPLETE reconstructions of the legendary / mythical lost Beach Boys album...didn't exist. Having ""Smile Sessions"" tracks on THAT set was a draw and a novelty, having them on THIS one is more a matter of ""I already own that.""The one common thread among Beach Boys fans is that there IS no common thread beyond the fact that in early 1960's Hawthorne California, a group of guys got together and changed music forever. You'll find ample evidence of that here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PHDEXFO9X9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XZKSRY#wasThisHelpful","R23PHDEXFO9X9P","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few things up front...yes, many critics (as well as fans of the series) hate this one. I don't think it's possible for me to post ""spoilers"" here because after reading some of the other reviews, key plot points have been given away. But as a fan of the original Friday the 13th and its sequel Friday the 13th - Part II, I've always felt the series was hit or miss (mostly formulaic ""miss"") after those two anyway.The opening scene of the film is INTENTIONALLY over-the-top and bombastic...literally...meant to hook you in. If you're a fan of the F13 / Halloween school of filmmaking, I think you'll like it. The problems begin AFTER the opening scene. No spoilers, like I said...let's just say that the filmmakers attempt to something a little different with the Jason concept. You may think it's edgy and original or you may yell ""BOGUS!""After you get past THIS part of the film, your back in the land of pre-fab formula slice & dice.The introduction of the ""Creighton Duke"" character (portrayed by Steven Williams) is an attempt to add an additional undercurrent of menace beneath the already existing menace of Jason Voorhees. It ends up less of an ""Oscar-worthy performance"" from Williams and more of an idea that probably sounded great on paper...bad lil' doggie's bite never quite matches his bark.The movie was SUPPOSED to seque directly into ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" which didn't arrive until a decade later. Instead, F13 viewers got ""Jason X"" (sending Jason into space so that he could orbit the Earth while the powers that be untied the knots in the ""Freddy vs. Jason"" project).In the final analysis, this movie may hold more value for you as a rental than as a purchase...hard to say, depends on your tastes. Definitely not the BEST film in the franchise (that would be the first two, taken as a pair) and definitely not the WORST (I've always felt that ""honor"" went to Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5SRWA4IIFF47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006FDBT#wasThisHelpful","R5SRWA4IIFF47","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think anyone reading this review is going to ask ""Who are these guys?"" That's 100% of the draw, 100% of the reason for even considering purchasing this. So the question becomes ""How good is it?"" We know how the ""supergroup"" thing goes...put four or more guys in a room and magic happens (or it doesn't).A long time ago in a land far, far away, a Guitar God named Jeff Beck thought he could make magic by fronting a power trio that included two of the guys from Vanilla Fudge. Rolling Stone's reviewer called the resulting album ""surprisingly docile."" One album, in, out, and I'm guessing Jeff trashed a motel room or something or maybe fired his manager and publicist and then went on to his next project. A pity, really. But I digress.Do PSMS (no way I'm gonna remember that) rock in the free world, or are they ""surprisingly docile?""Answer? It is what it is. IF YOU LIKE the members and all of the bands they've been in, you SHOULD like this...no reason for you not to. However, if you ONLY like death metal (or maybe Miley Cyrus) and wouldn't touch Dream Theater with a ten foot pole, this CD won't convince you. I always thought that Sherinian played on one of the single greatest and most criminally underrated D.T. albums (Falling Into Infinity), so hearing him revisit some of that terrain (along with Portnoy) was a treat for me. You get ""Hell's Kitchen"" and ""Lines In The Sand""...both highlights from that album...and the opener of THIS album was also the opener from D.T.'s Change of Seasons E.P. It then becomes a matter of ""Do I want to hear Tony Macalpine play John Petrucci's guitar parts or would I rather just dig out my copy of F.I.I.?"" The band is solid...the band rocks, and they do come out of the gates in full bombastic ""prog metal"" splendor. The opening track lurches into Liquid Tension Experiment's ""Acid Rain"" and...well, you get the idea. They touch on their solo and group work and throw in a few tasteful covers like the Tommy Bolin touchstone ""Stratus"" from Billy Cobham's legendary ""Spectrum"" album. Fusion meets Prog, Jazz meets Rock, it's all about giving the band members room to stretch out.I really had my doubts about Jeff Beck's ""The Pump""...simply because Jeff's original is SO SUBLIME, and becaise Larry Carlton and Steve Lukather have already logged a magnificent version on their No Substitutions: Live in Osaka album. That said, they do a pretty admirable job with the track and it's another tasty break from the speed riffing and power playing.I don't want to cop out on my review but I have to state again that if you ALREADY LIKE this kind of music you will probably LIKE...or LOVE...this CD. But if the bands and performers I've named are a turnoff for you, this CD is not for you. It's nothing more or less than these guys doing what they do, not breaking any new ground, not offering any real surprises (beyond the Beck and Vobham songs, but they are pleasant surprises, not shocks).It IS a pleasure hearing Sherinian and Portnoy on ""Lines In The Sand""...it was a freight train then and it's a freight train now.Highly recommended because I like this kind / these kind(s) of music. That's my sole rationale, as well as having followed the individual performers for decades.

"There was something about the 1969-1970 Dead...maybe it was the sheer POWER. When Keith & Donna joined the band things got a little smoother, and when Brent came on board, things got a little TOO smooth for me at the time. But the Pigpen Dead? All of those Fillmore / Avalon shows that you can now access via Road Trips, Dick's Picks, Dave's Picks, assorted box sets & compilations?Jerry did something in the Pigpen era that he didn't often do in the later years of the band, and that was to explode, to go nuts, to riff like a jazz virtuoso from Mars. Listen to ""The Other One"" from this set...around the nine and a half minute the band comes out of the ""Drums"" section and Jerry just WAILS, he is HOWLING, shredding off notes like you've seldom heard if your primary exposure to the Dead is those L-O-N-G ""Fire On The Mountain"" and ""Row Jimmy"" excursions from the later years.This easily COULD have been a standard commercial release. The premise behind Dick's Picks was ""warts and all""...hence the ""Caveat Emptor"" warnings on every label. But if you've been sitting on the fence regarding this one, get off the fence and buy it. It's everything you think it is and more. ""Dark Star"" and ""The Other One"" are worth the admission price alone, but it doesn't end there. Pure brute force, style, and precision.

"If Jerry Garcia were alive today, he'd be sickened by the fact that this box set is out of print and being SCALPED at ""4 new from $378.09.""That said...if it were going for a REASONABLE price...it's as essential as essential gets.ALL of the studio albums PLUS a disc of outtakes. The favorites, for me, are the first album and ""Reflections."" The Dead performed ""Bird Song"" many, many times, but the version on Jerry's first solo album SHIMMERS with a beauty you won't find anywhere else. The ""brother / sister"" to this song is ""Laughing"" from David Crosby's If I Could Only Remember My Name. Same feel, same achingly sweet pedal steel from Jerry.The second album (""Compliments"") was pretty much TRASHED by critics on its release, but its charms are undeniable, especially on ""Let It Rock,"" ""The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game,"" and ""Turn On the Bright Lights.""These albums didn't stray that far from what Jerry was doing with the Dead, and MANY of the songs found their way into ""heavy rotation"" on Dead set lists.

"It was a much different world in 1971. We didn't have ""Dick's Picks"" or ""Dave's Picks"" or the lengthy archive releases and mega box sets (many of which came after Jerry's tragic passing).We had what Warner Brothers sold us, and the Dead Heads traded tapes.Before I go any further, let's get this out of the way...in 1971, when this was released, it was a killer album, and it's still a killer album four-plus decades later.Looking past the obvious wealth of songs that would remain setlist favorites for the entire life of the band (ALL of them except ""Big Boss Man,"" a Pigpen blues cover...I don't know the set lists well enough to know if Weir ever tackled this one after Pigpen's death), it's a peak live set from an undeniable peak of the band (the end of the Pigpen era, the ablum that followed, Europe 72, was the transition into the second golden era, the Keith & Donna years).Fast-forward to 2013 and the ""Bonus Disc"" that was released through the Dead's Website as part of the ""Dave's Picks"" series. There's a 13 minute version of ""The Other One"" that is a freight train, just blunt force trauma to the head that puts the ""Skull & Roses"" version to shame (it was recorded December 21, 1969, at the Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco).None of the performances on ""Skull & Roses"" constitute definitive VERSIONS, but it is an album that defines the career of the Dead and it is a classic. The same holds true for Europe 72...in 2011, the Dead released the massive 22-concert box set of the complete Europe 72 tour. Does this mean the original triple vinyl set is no longer a classic? No, it simply means that it scratched the surface, like ""Skull & Roses,"" and the further you venture into the Dead, the greater treasures reveal themselves (like the MASSIVE 52 minute Dark Star-> Drums-> The Other One jam that awaits you on Europe 72 Vol. 2, excerpted from the box set's Bickershaw Festival show).This means nothing to the casual Dead fan...having this album plus Europe 72, as well as Live / Dead, Workingman's Dead and American Beauty might be all that they need for a long, strange trip.I still think ""Skull & Roses"" is a great introduction to the band, the CD you give a friend who only knows songs like ""Casey Jones"" or ""Truckin"" or ""Touch of Grey.""

"First and foremost, this entry in the ""Death Wish"" series gets four stars because of its ""Midnight Movies / Golden Turkey"" charm. The remaining films, Death Wish IV (in which Bronson's ""Paul Kersey"" takes on the ENTIRE Los Angeles ""cocaine underground"") and Death Wish: The Face of Death, were just groaners...bad films with an increasingly exhausted Charles Bronson in the lead.The first film, Death Wish, was a no-nonsense action film along the lines of ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon."" The sequel, Death Wish 2, was also pretty straightforward...and had the added perk of a Jimmy Page soundtrack. It also provided some closure on plot points from the first film.With Death Wish 3, the formula started to stretch a little thin. If this were a real ""inner city"" war zone, Paul Kersey...no matter how crafty and resourceful...would have been blown to smithereens by the bad guys in the first ten minutes. So ""suspension of disbelief"" is DEFINITELY required if you want to enjoy this one, but the GOOD news is that it IS enjoyable.Martin Balsam brings a little added ""star power"" to the film. You may not recognize the name ""Ed Lauter,"" but the minute he hits the screen you'll remember him as a well-establishe character actor. And then there's the crown jewel of casting in this film...Gavan O'Herlihy, formerly one of TWO actors who played the soon-forgotten brother (""Chuck"") of Richie Cunnigham on ""Happy Days."" O'Herlihy has a bad guy face...it's just what God gave him. Even when he played Chuck, a basketball-dribbling idiot, he seemed like the kind of guy who could cut you with no warning.In this movie, he cuts people with no warning, so it works out pretty well.In scene after scene after highly improbable scene, ""Paul Kersey"" just kicks major inner city gang scum tail.

"How you view Season 2 of Leverage will depend largely on how you view Gina Bellman's ""Sophie Devereaux"" and all of the underlying melodrama, the romantic tension between her character and Timothy Hutton's ""Nathan Ford"" (it's Leverage's ""Sam and Diane"" will they / won't they meme). Gina spent most of season two preparing for the birth of her daughter, and the series creators brought in Jeri Ryan to cover for her...not ""replace"" her. She's seen in countless ""on the phone"" segments to remind you that she's away, but not ""gone."" That gives Hutton plenty of opportunities to bounce back and forth between ""giving her space"" and asking her to ""come home.""This gave Aldis Hodge the opportunity to shine in ""The Ice Man Job,"" because the team ""needed a grifter,"" and with Sophie absent, Hardison stepped in. Of course, he's not a grifter by nature, so his masquerade leads to his being captured by the Russian mob. The series creators also take full advantage of this, using Christian Kane's ""Eliot"" character to rib Hardison over this in a later episode. The cast really excels at the ""sibling rivalry"" discord...they can come together to pull off a ""job,"" but they can also squabble like kids who have had too much sugar. The series creators wisely keep this in check and never go overboard with it. In small doses, it's fun. Overdone and ""Leverage"" would become ""Three's Company"" in a heartbeat.Beth Riesgraf as ""Parker"" shines here, especially in the ""Ice Man Job"" episode (""No stabbing, Parker!""). She's smart enough to pull off major heists but is conflicted in every way imaginable when it comes to dealing with others on a ""normal"" basis...case in point the first Season 2 episode, where Hutton wakes up to find her eating cereal in a nun's outfit. She's gorgeous and crazy and brings an ongoing sense of oddball charm to what is already a somewhat oddball cast and concept.Timothy Hutton definitely sinks his teeth into the multiple characters he plays...some ridiculously eccentric (like Dr. Melcher and his ""Melcher Method""). Others are more ""normal,"" but the undercurrent of the Ford character is that you have a recovering alcoholic whose life is still a mess in many ways (including the ""is this a relationship"" relationship with Sophie). He manages to pull together a team of criminals to do one Robin Hood good deed after the other, and there are times when the Ford character...even in moments of success...seems empty inside. He will occasionally order a drink (his condo, the ""team clubhouse,"" sits over a bar) and walk away without taking a sip. Sherlock Holmes had cocaine, Nathan Ford has alcohol. Every genius has his or her demons.This series is head and shoulders above the normal ""cable TV drama"" in every way. Killer cast, well-written eposides, and actors who seem to have a great deal of fun.

"I've used several other Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoos, and have found them to all be of a consistent high quality. I've used Head & Shoulders for years and as a result haven't had a problem with dandruff, but I also like to mix up my shampoos every now and then to see if I can get better results.

After use you'll be back to nothing but clean, fresh hair with no residue from previously used products. You'll see volume that you may have missed with products that don't do the full job...I know I did. Finally, a little gos a long way...it doesn't take much to produce a thick and ample lather.

"I gave the first Transporter movie five stars. I still love it and watch it a couple of times a month. It had ridiculously cool and choreographed car chases and fight scenes, the beyond-gorgeous Shu Qi, and a main character who pulled off all of the standard ""action movie"" requirements without becoming annoying for a second. And oh yeah, one more thing...plot and character development.If you've read many of the available reviews for this sequel, you've heard that the car chases and fight scenes and explosions were ramped up at the expense of plot. That's true to a degree, but 99.9% of the folks who come to a movie like this...myself included...aren't looking for the kind of filmmaking that went into the classic John Ford Westerns. They want to see car chases, they want to see things blow up, they want to see the hero take on a half dozen guys in a parking garage and drive away without a scratch.In short...they come to a movie like Transporter 2 knowing what to expect and having their expectations met.I won't go too far into the plot or offer any spoilers. Suffice it to say that in the sequel, the ""package"" Frank is transporting is Matthew Modine's kid, to and from school. There are bad guys, there is an engineered virus. There is a female ""bad girl"" who is, I assume, supposed to represent equal proportions of ""crazy"" and ""hot."" If this movie were made in the 80s, you can GUARANTEE the role would have been played by Brigitte Nielsen...it's EXACTLY the kind of role that put her on the map. But it's not the 80s, and the bad girl in question is Kate Nauta. If best actress awards were granted solely for the creep factor, she needs to clear a space on her mantle and thank the Academy.Franois Berléand returns as Inspector Tarconi. In the first movie, he was the super-cool, tongue-in-cheek sly fox, sort of the Claude Rains to Statham's Humphrey Bogart, ""Casablanca""-style. One thing I did NOT like about the sequel is that the character is played for more comic relief...less cool, more of an idiot, but not quite and Inspector Clouseau idiot.It's an ACTION MOVIE, and there is no shortage of action. The action looked a little more realistic in the first film...some of the over-the-top stuff in the sequel is a little half-baked and obviously the result of computer wizardry in the studio. But once again, you pop it in, you turn it up, things blow up, bad guys hit the deck, car tires screech...you get what you came for.The movie wasn't GOOD enough to make me ""eagerly anticipate"" Transporter 3, but wasn't BAD enough to make me avoid it. Statham is Statham and he did the best he could with the script he was handed. There are a few ""groaners"" here...specifically in the dialogue between Frank and Amber Valletta, who plays Modine's wife. Maybe the screenwriters weren't entirely comfortable with the ""character development"" thing...maybe the groners were intentional, to make it fun. Who knows?I give it four stars with a caveat...rent this one before you buy it. You may watch it more tan once, or once might be more than enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U2YR1HIUJ60U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BTITKS#wasThisHelpful","R2U2YR1HIUJ60U","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think I'm going out on a limb when I say that this album has already taken its place as one of the best of 2013, rght up there with the Emmylou Harris & Rodney Crowell collaboration Old Yellow Moon.While the ""Bakersfield"" vibe is prevalent and runs like an undercurrent through every track, it's Bakersfield via Gram Parsons & The Flying Burrito Brothers rather than Bakersfield via Buck or Merle. Jay Farrar doesn't have the most expressive voice or the widest range...Gram didn't either...but just like Gram, his voice is right for the material. He also doesn't tap into the rocking side of Parsons and the F.B.B.s (what would Let It Bleed or Sticky Fingers have sounded like if Keef hadn't inhaled several lungfulls of Gram?). This is the lazy, bluesy, stoned-to-the-bone, broken down and broken hearted but not without hope Bakersfield sound, and Farrar pulls it all off magnificently.I remember Buck Owens' passing, and how Dwight Yoakam's first move was to release an album called Dwight Sings Buck. That's what it's all about...keeping the music alive, whether it be in the form of a tribute album or paving new roads. ""Country"" music is so much more than some leering, lip-licking beefcake moron with Don Johnson Miami Vice beard stubble and a ten gallon hat moaning about how good baby looks in her blue jeans and how he can't wait to git 'em AWF. ""Country"" music is bigger and better and grander and broader than all of that adolescent garbage. So when an album like this comes along, one that taps into vital roots without being derivative or irrelevant, it's time to stand up and cheer.If you like this kind of music...especially if you like ANY of the references I've cited...this one's for you.

"First, let's get this out of the way up front...I hate ""limited edition"" or ""import only"" discs that sell for two to three times of a normal CD. Music should be available to everyone who wants to purchase it legally. That said, this one is worth owning.In an interview, Sammy revealed that Joe was initially cool on the idea of joining forces, stating that he ""didn't play other people's music."" With two studio albums and this one under his belt, it looks like Joe had a wise change of heart.When I heard the first album I enjoyed it, but also thought, ""these songs need to be heard in concert."" Take a song like ""Down The Drain,"" easily the highlight of the first album. Sammy introduces it by saying ""This song started out as a jam session, and we turned it into a song...tonight we're turning it back into a jam session."" That's what you get with Sammy live, like a special order pizza...it comes with extra cheese, but that's why the fans love him, and have kept his career afloat in one form or another for FOUR DECADES.No one's ever going to accuse Michael Anthony of being Stanley Clarke or Jaco Pastorious or John Entwistle or John Paul Jones, but that boy CAN anchor himself steadily to the center of chaos and his harmony vocals are still killer and helped put Van Halen on the map.Joe and Sammy share one thing in common...in a band setting, Joe (when performing vocal rather than instrumental tracks) is always better with a vocalist. He's sung a few but it's not his gift. Sammy is always better when he's not the one casting the sole deciding vote, when other members are there to keep his excesses in check. Chickenfoot appears to be more of a laid back ""democracy"" than Van Halen, where Eddie and Alex ruled the band with an iron hand.The songs, for the most part, are tight and tasty, although when it comes to lyrics, Sammy can still crank out the occasional groaner. That's why the electricity and crunch and roar of a live set lifts everything up to a higher level.You'll love to pop this one in your car's CD deck...it's the best driving music. And as much as I hate the price, maybe it will become available to a mass audience at a more reasonable price on day. In the meantime, if you're a Hagar / Satrani fan, you really can't be without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29L4BJM3DPE2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009X1STUK#wasThisHelpful","R29L4BJM3DPE2P","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story's pretty familiar by now...""new guy"" Mike Nelson was only ""new"" in terms of his role as on-camera host. He came with an extensive tenure as writer and performer in numerous between-movie skits (one of my favorites being ""Glen Manning"" in the MST3K version or ""War of the Colossal Beast.""Mike and Joel had different styles, but the first episode stuck pretty close to the show's Joel-driven formula. Things like ""the invention exchange"" would soon go by the wayside because Nelson never seemed comfortable with Joel's prop comedy approach. Trace Beaulieu (""Dr. Clayton Forrester"" and ""Crow""), Frank Conniff (""TV's Frank""), and Kevin Murphy (""Tom Servo"") were all on board, although Trace and Frank would ultimately leave (reuniting with Joel for ""Cinematic Titanic,"" his answer to the Mike Nelson post-MST3K project ""RiffTrax"").We know that EVERY MST3K episode fell into one of three categories:1). GREAT movie with GREAT riffs by Mike/Joel & crew2). AWFUL movie saved by GREAT riffs3). Movies SO BAD even the riffs couldn;t save them""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" is a certified 5-star, hall of fame CLASSIC in the realm of 50s/60s cheesy black & white horror/sci fi flicks. That said, even with the transitional feel of this first Mike Nelson episode (MANY of the between-movie jokes are based on him being ""the new guy""), this is a 5-star MST3K episode all the way, one that I would call ""essential"" without hesitation.The DVD also employs a format that wouldn't last long...the MST3K version and the non-MST3K original version on the same disc. If you're familiar with ""Brain,"" you know that his film...like another MST3K target, ""Horror of Party Beach""...exists in poor quality, heavily edited/censored prints. THIS version is uncut and probably as pristine as you're ever going to get.The creme de la creme of MST3K.

"This is a good, clean-smelling soap...not ""perfume-y""...think oatmeal soap. The box touts:1). 1/4 moisturizing cream2). Deep cleansing formula that rinses off easily3). Classic scent4). Purifying grainsI'm not sure of what the ""purifying grains"" are supposed to accomplish.

I generally use Dove Unscented soap and have been pleased with its performance for years. As such, I have no real incentive to switch to this soap, other than going from an unscented bar to a scented one. I use Axe Body Spray, Twist 4oz, 4oz Cans (Pack of 6), so it really doesn't make sense to use two radically different scents when bathing.

"I've been a fan of KISS since the first album.Rolling Stone ran three reviews...one for the first Montrose album with Sammy Hagar, one for the first KISS album, and one for a band named Stray Dog. They predicted that all three were the superstars of tomorrow. They were right about Sammy and Montrose. They were right about KISS. Stray Dog? Well, two out of three ain't bad.Here's what I have to say about the new KISS album. It rocks, it's solid, you should buy it.No matter how much marketing and hype and KISS Army B.S. Gene and Paul want to float, they will NEVER make things right about Tommy Thayer donning Ace's makeup and Eric Singer donning Peter's.There are three sides to every story...Gene & Paul's, Ace & Peter's, and the TRUTH.Tommy and Eric have NO RIGHT to the legacy laid down by Ace and Peter, but because they serve at the pleasure of their masters Paul and Gene, they suit up every night as if they did.THREE stars for a solid rock album. MINUS TWO to Gene and Paul for KISS-ing up to your fan base while doing what you KNOW is WRONG. I don't think ANYONE would object if you did it Kulick-style...Gene, Paul, Eric & Tommy...WITHOUT makeup, or WITH Tommy and Eric in NEW makeup, like you did with Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent.But to do what you're doing insults Ace and Peter, it insults the legacy, and insults the fans.The shame, Gene and Paul, is that you KNOW this, and you don't CARE, because the almighty dollar is the only thing that has ever concerned you.Three stars that should have been five.Follow the example that was set by the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow, Paul and Gene...go to the wizard and get a brain and a heart.

"I've NEVER been a fan of the ""double-sided DVD"" format...it's a recipe for disaster. I did actually get a defective copy of this first time around and exchanged it. So that's the ""glass half full"" aspect of Universal choosing to do this in the first place...KEEP YOUR RECEIPT when you buy this because there's a 50-50 chance you'll be using it to make an exchange.That said, there are two ""very good"" films in this set...""Murders In The Rue Morgue"" and ""The Black Cat""...one which is simply boring, plodding, and not fun at all (""Black Friday"")...and two that are ESSENTIAL simply because of their downright WEIRDNESS, ""The Raven"" and ""The Invisible Ray.""Lugosi and Karloff are known, of course, for the ""monster"" films to a large degree. But they each made a number of films that were all over the stylistic map. Karloff signed better contracts, but Lugosi's super-super-super-low-budget films like ""Ape Man"" and ""Devil Bat"" were so mind-numbingly bad that they rivaled the BEST of any of Ed Wood's films (meaning: FUN).""Murders"" and ""Cat"" are more in the mold of the ""classic Universal horror films."" But ""The Raven"" features a completely insane Lugosi played against the low-rent hood Karloff. At one point Lugosi famously says to Karloff ""SO, you held the burning torch in his FACE..."" Karloff pauses for a moment and says ""Well, some times you can't help things like that."" Lugosi plays a character who, to put it simply, is really into torture, to the point where he replicates torture devices from Poe classics and then finds unwilling victims. It's a perfect role for Lugosi, he really rips into it, and Karloff counters that by playing his role with sustained tongue-in-cheek black humor. I don't want to talk about the film in detail because I'll be giving up spoilers. If this were a stand-alone movie I'd give it 5 stars and would be badgering you mercilessly to buy it NOW.Same goes for ""Invisible Ray,"" but this time Karloff steers the plot. He glows in the days before ""special effects"" were as effortless as a couple of mouse clicks. He wears a welders' helmet and melts rocks and has a work crew of African villagers who decide they've had enough and as they are preparing to leave says ""watch this"" and melts a huge boulder and the workers say ""OK, we'll stay."" The scenes shot inside Karloff's castle ""at the top of the Carpathian mountains"" have all of the WONDERFUL gothic vibes found in the BEST Universal flims of the day.So if you OVERLOOK the chance that you have a 50/50 chance of getting defective discs and view this as a DOUBLE FEATURE of two MUST-HAVE films, two pretty good ones, and one you don't have to watch if you don't want to, the price is right. EVERY Halloween I do a ""Universal Marathon"" and watch ALL of the Frankenstein, Wolfman, Dracula, Mummy & Creature From The Black Lagoon films throughout the month of October. I include ""Invisible Ray"" and ""The Raven."" If you like the monster films, there is no way you can be without these.

"I'm not sure what I thought when this one was first released. Any fan of Batman knows there isn't ""one Batman."" I also remember that during Frank Miller's ""Dark Knight"" comics, in which he essentially reinvented and revitalized Bob Kane's character, there was talk floating of Clint Eastwood playing the character, which would have been AMAZING. The ""Dark Knight"" Batman was older, and in many ways, just as messed up as The Joker. Eastwood could have nailed it, but it never hapened.""The Dark Knight"" was released under the shadw of the untimely and sad passing of Heath Ledger. Ledger didn't do the campy, jovial buffoon of the late-sixties DC comics era, and he didn't do the over-the-top, scenery-chewing nutcase that Jack Nicholson portrayed in the Tim Burton film with Michael Keaton. Ledger's portrayal of the the character is based on a man who is GONE, and ain't comin' BACK.Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nothing more than a placeholder for Batman. Michael Keaton did well with the brooding, angry, insular world of the millionaire crimefighter, but Bale's Wayne lacks any true joy, charisma, joie de vivre...he's just marking time before the next time he puts on the suit.It's really Ledger's film. He's the reason to watch, he drives the plot, he has the best lines, he is the protagonist. He plays the character as if he's constantly on meds, flipping out only one time in the film (and when he does it's pretty chilling). If Cesar Romero played the role as Bozo the Clown, Ledger played it as John Wayne Gacy.It really is a decent Batman offering. I thought the first Bale film was weak, and I haven't seen the third. If you are in need of a Batman fix and you like your ""Caped Crusader"" dark, intense, and p*ssed off, this is the Batman film for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL6ZR9D90HNAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GZ6QDS#wasThisHelpful","RL6ZR9D90HNAH","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first stumbled upon this film 6 months ago, and because I knew I was going to be moving to Pahrump, coincidence of all coincidences, I got to watch a film made in my soon-to-be new home town.Pahrump is not like any other town you can think of. You basically come here with whatever expectations you might have and they immediately get turned inside out. So if I were to make a statement...as an outsider...like ""Maria Conchita Alonso is completely unbelievable as the town ""Sheriff""...well, once you set foot in town, you might run into a gun-totin', protectin' and servin' Sheriff who looks just like her. Just take anything you expect and flip it to the opposite and you have a good ""beginner's introduction"" to the town.Looks like everybody in the film grabbed a producers' credit, which means they starred in it, and they kicked in some bucks as well. There's perpetually Über-Creepy Billy Drago (perhaps best known as Frank Nitti in Brian DePalma's classic ""The Untouchables), there's ""Captain Spaulding"" from Rob Zombie's films, Sid Haig, who basically stops by to drop some f-bombs and be Sid Haig, there's Alonso, who's seen better days (maube botox, maybe plastic surgery, maybe a little of both, but she's not looking that great and her acting is forced and wooden).It's really not worth wrapping our head around the ""story"" in this one...rival werewolves who just happen to be father and son, a local girl who discovers that she likes her men pouty, fanged, and covered in a luxurious coat of fur, locals (including Haig) who fill the CLASSIC role from the old Frankenstein flicks of ""the angry villagers,"" a sort of moody, boogie-blues soundtrack that ain't half bad...It's campy fun, and it bears the distinction of being filmed in a town most people don't know about. Watching Billy Drago walk out of the public library is kind of trippy. So are some of his other scenes, but I won't spoil them for you. Let's just say that he doesn't get the girl and live happily ever after.So the premise of my three-star review is ""you could do a lot worse."" If you like trashy ""midnight movies,"" you will probably like this. I enjoyed it. But rest assured, George Romero, John Carpenter, and Tobe Hooper didn't lose any sleep over this film's release.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EIB86O1X0DC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EYEE42#wasThisHelpful","R1EIB86O1X0DC9","A1K9IW99EFBZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IW99EFBZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are some of the most comfortable gaming headphones I have come across yet. They claim to be able to cancel out noise and they do a pretty okay job at that. I typically test my headsets using different levels. These were sent to me by Sentey for review and I took these headphones through the same tests as I have every other gaming headphone set I have come across. I check treble, bass, and elasticity. The bad has cushion where it sits on top of the head as well as where it touches the ears. I can't say that this headset is extremely durable but it did withstand the drop test. Luckily the mic part of the headset was not damaged. The clarity of sound is extremely impressive and the mic was able to pick up my voice without glitch or static. Very nice.Why did this headset receive 5 stars?The headset is geared towards gamers who are concerned with using their money for games versus repurchasing equipment. When this headset passed the drop test it games star 1. When I was able to actually feel the bass in my ears it gained star 2. As I spoke into the mic there was no glitching and I was able to be clearly heard which gave this set star 3. I wore this headset for several hours and it did not cause a headache or put extreme pressure on my ears due to the thick cushion, giving it star 4.

" 1:04 MinsI will say that I did not know what to think about this diffuser when I came across it. USB? How powerful is my MAC supposed to be in order to warm this up? (No, I didn't think to connect it to a wall charger. To me, USB screams computer). The diffuser came with instructions but I swear I did not even need them. So cool! It comes with the actual diffuser, usb cord (its extra long), blotting paper (there are several), and instruction manual (its a mini foldable pamphlet smaller than the diffuser).I plugged the diffuser up, and was able to smell the oil much sooner than I thought I would. (To be honest I didn't think I would smell anything so I started working on my site--barely 4 minutes passed when I was able to smell the awesome scent of peppermint--don't judge, its my favorite).The diffuser continues to burn off the oil until the oil is gone. This does not turn off the diffuser (keep that in mind). The most awesome part about this diffuser is that there is no burnt smell. There is no smell of plastic or paper being set ablaze (even when all of the oil is burned off).Seems the diffuser is powerful enough to work effectively yet not so powerful that you would need to be alarmed or afraid to walk out of the room while it is still plugged in. Only reason I knew the oil had burned off was because I stopped smelling that awesome scent of peppermint that I spoke of earlier.This diffuser is great for a home office. It is compact and comes with an extra long usb cord. When the diffuser is on it shines a bright blue light. The time between plugging the diffuser in and the diffuser warming up is not long at all.There are several benefits to choosing this usb diffuser over its larger plugged-in counterparts:Extremely portable.

"This Lavender essential oil is fragrant, smooth, soothing and very pleasant. I would describe it as velvety so calling it Kashmir Lavender really describes the scent quite well. There is so many uses for Lavender and that is why its one of my favorite essential oils. It's truly ""Essential"".Kashmir to me is a way of describing something in a luxurious way but its actually a place in India so I believe the reason I have the impression about the word Kashmir as I do is because of the area of India where this oil is mainly produced.The health benefits of lavender essential oil include its ability to eliminate nervous tension, relieve pain, disinfect the scalp and skin, enhance blood circulation and treat respiratory problems. The Latin name of lavender is Lavare, which means “to wash”, due to its aroma which has a particularly clean aroma.Lavender oil is extracted mostly from the flowers of the lavender plant, primarily through steam distillation. The flowers of lavender are fragrant in nature and have been used for making potpourri for centuries. Traditionally, lavender essential oil has also been used in making perfumes. The oil is very useful in aromatherapy and many aromatic preparations and combinations are made using lavender oil.A few of the benefits are:1. CalmingRub 2-3 drops of lavender oil in your cupped palms, then use the inhalation method to draw the scent all the way into your amygdala gland (the emotional warehouse) in your brain to calm the mind. Then, rub on the feet, temples, wrists (or anywhere) for an immediate calming effect on the body. Great for use in crowded areas like planes or subways to carve out your own personal oasis.2. Sleep aidAgain, use the cupping and inhalation method. Then, rub a drop of Lavender oil on your palms and smooth on your pillow to help you sleep.3. Bee sting / Insect bitePut a drop of Lavender oil on a bee sting or insect bite to stop itching reduce swelling.4. Minor burnPut 2-3 drops Lavender oil on a minor burn to decrease pain. I recently did this after I spilled scorching hot tea on my hand at Starbucks and luckily had my lavender with me. Result: NO redness, swelling or pain. NO sign of any burn. Lavender works wonders!5. CutsDrop Lavender oil on cut to stop bleeding, clean wound, and kill bacteria.6. Eczema / DermatitisMix several drops of Lavender oil with a nut or vegetable mixing oil (coconut, sesame, etc) and use topically on eczema and dermatitis. I have a dear friend who suffers from severe eczema and swears by this.7. Nausea or motion sicknessTo alleviate the symptoms of motion sickness, place a drop of Lavender oil on end of tongue, behind the ears or around the navel.8. NosebleedTo stop a nosebleed, put a drop of lavender oil on a tissue and wrap it around a small chip of ice. Push the tissue covered ice chip up under the middle of the top lip to the base of the nose and hold as long as comfortable or until the bleeding stops (do not freeze the lip or gum).9. Dry or chapped skinRub lavender oil on dry or chapped skin.10. Chapped or sunburned lipsRub a drop of lavender oil on chapped or sunburned lips.11. Hay fever.Rub a drop of lavender oil between your palms and inhale deeply to help alleviate the symptoms of hay fever.12. Dandruff.Rub several drops of lavender oil into the scalp to help eliminate dandruff.13. Cold soresPut a drop of lavender oil on a cold sore.So now you see why this is one of my favorites and why you might want to add it to your own cart. I absolutely love this oil and recommend it to anyone and everyone and I hope it becomes one of your favorites too!

"I am definitely loving this handy tool! I bought some mango's in anticipation of this tools arrival. It is thick and substantial and very well made. The yellow hand grips are textured to provide good anti slip traction and provide better leverage as you push through the mango. The pit pops out beautifully and I couldn't be happier. It is packaged nicely and fastened to a slick gloss cardboard hang tag printed in full color by two twist ties. The yellow grips actually have a gentle curve which I would classify as ergonomic. I found it to be quite comfortable to use and my family loves mangos so we go through a good share of them. I was not able to find a similar product at my local grocery store and if I had I still think I would have chosen this one as it has fantastic qualities, You really know you are using a well made product when you touch it.

"Ok I needed a good waterproof bag, My daughter does a lot of sports and she was the one that actually asked for this. I ordered the largest size of these and its much bigger than I thought it would be. This would be great for a coach, with a bunch of equipment. Its very well build, it is made of a very thick plastic or rubber material and anything you have in this bag for sure, WILL NOT GET WET. Top quality, expertly manufactured. Very satisfied customer.

"My family burns through back up battery packs pretty fast. I really liked this one though. It came packaged nicely in a box with instruction sheet, but its pretty simple to handle so that isn't necessarily necessary. I charged it off the computer because I was on the computer the day it came. There is a plug box included and you can charge it up that way if you prefer. It has three cables that are fused together with a USB on one end and three different common charge ends on the other. There was a micro, an Apple and another, maybe another micro, those two looked very similar. Any way it fit both mine and my husbands Android phones just fine. One or the other of us is frequently low battery and tethering to a charger or a car charger isn't always practical.We had a soccer game to go to last night. Parents night. My husband had 38% battery. So I decided to test it out at the game. Once plugged in it started charging at a pretty good rate, I wish I had charted the time started and the time it was done but like I said we were at the game and I wasn't paying attention. The battery pack itself is kind of heavy but it has a sleek design, the size is about that of a normal phone but slightly slimmer. The texture is amazing. I have to say I LOVE the texture of the batter pack, it's like anti skid almost, not smooth and slippery, which I think allows it to grip the dash when placed in a car, maybe, not sure, but it's nice.By the time we got back in the car the phone was charged up and there was still battery life on the charging battery. It has 4 lights so you can tell and it had 2 remaining when I checked. There is also a button on the side so you can plug in and remember to push the button. It makes sense because otherwise it could be leaking charge while sitting there not plugged into anything so I like the on off button feature.I was really surprised at the quality and speed at which it charged my husbands phone. The USB port got warm but it wasn't hot so I think that is a good feature too. Over all I rated it as a 5 star and we are very happy with its performance, not to mention the price. Its really a great deal and quite affordable so if you chose to do it, you could get each member of your household one and not be out a lot of money. I think this would make a great holiday gift as its durability and quality are outstanding and the box lends itself for easy wrapping and gift giving.This is an excellent product and I received it at a discount as part of a promotion but I would highly recommend for others and will likely be purchasing more for my own gift giving this holiday season.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AEDN7NFTGBDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQYJWVS#wasThisHelpful","R1AEDN7NFTGBDR","A3MRXWB56DCAMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MRXWB56DCAMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, several things about this lamp. I bought it for the purpose of clamping to the shelf above my desk. I have two computers there and no other lamp has been able to angle in from the top like this and adequately provide the desired amount of light to light up my desk. The blueish hue it offers provides a very day like light without the yellow mist that is common with many other lamps. Ok that has a lot to do with the bulb but Im saying these are great for an office. The 2 Levels of Brightness allow me to adjust for overcast days or bright days when the sun is coming in the window but also allow for enough light to brighten my desk top and computer keyboards well into the evenings when the house becomes dark. I also like its flexibility as it adjusts to the required angle and shape to accommodate the full range of lighting needs. I want the light on my hands and on my computers and desk top but not in my face, over my shoulder or top of my head.  The clamp is strong, supports the lamp easily and protects from scratching the wood on my desk shelf.I love that it uses 3xAA Batteries and is powered by AC Adapter or USB, it automatically uses the AC Adapter's Power to light the lamp so you have some options, depending on the wiring of your office. Mine is horrible and the long wall that my desk sits against doesn't even have one plug. I have to run an ungrounded extension cord over to my computers and just the location and electric set up of my office is rotten. This lamp adjusts to such a situation well. For this reason I gave it a 5 stars. I am very please with the lamp and although I got it at a discount as part of a promotion I would definitely recommend it to others. Thank you for providing such a wonderful light source. I appreciate it to no end!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVO4IQBK4SQ1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NAPDE#wasThisHelpful","RVO4IQBK4SQ1E","A3MRXWB56DCAMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MRXWB56DCAMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two track athletes in my family and I ordered these compression sleeves for one with shin splints. To really understand how compression socks and sleeves work, it’s important to have a basic understanding of how blood flows through the body. The heart pumps oxygen containing blood to our extremities and working muscles though arteries. Once the cells use the oxygen and other nutrients from the blood, the then deoxygenated blood, along with lactic acid and other waste products enter the veins to get taken back to the heart. Once the blood gets back to the heart, it’s oxygenated from the lungs and the process is repeated.Keeping oxygenated blood flowing to muscles is important for performance. The more oxygen the cells have, the better they will function. During exercise, the body produces lactic acid as a waste product. If this lactic acid is not removed from the muscles, it can contribute to soreness and decreased ability to perform. Another factor in decreased performance is muscle fatigue. Muscular vibration during physical activity contributes to fatigue. Think about how much shock and vibration is going through your leg muscles as you pound pavement with 3-5 times your body weight while running. Over time, those little vibrations of the muscles add up and they become fatigued.Now that we know what the blood and muscles are doing while we are running, let’s talk about what compression socks and sleeves do to help the body. Compression socks and sleeves provide graduated compression, meaning the compression is higher (tighter) at the foot and ankle and lower (looser) as it moves up the calf and lower leg. This type of compression helps to fight the effects of gravity and assist the body in venous return (deoxygenated blood flowing back up to the heart).My daughter said she put the socks on and ran her events and she remembered them ""feeling tight"" at first but she quickly forgot about them and felt great during her events. I received this product as part of a promotion in exchange for this review and I think understanding how they actually work is important in reflecting on the performance of the product. Based on the technology that has gone into these sleeves and my daughter's testimony on her shin splints disappearing from her mind I have to rate these as a 5 star and highly recommend them.

"Love this Argan oil! I love to use organic products when I can and was very happy to get hold of this. Argan oil loads with various nutrients. It is primarily used for hair or skin care, though some cosmetics will also take advantage of this oil. Read on to get more detailed information of the its benefits. The unique combination of antioxidant and moisturizing properties in this oil can help to maintain skin elasticity while preventing moisture loss that can contribute to the aging process. This oil can make the skin look softer while limiting the appearance of stretch marks, under eye circles, burns and wrinkles as well and damage from smoking, pollution or harsh sunlight. It can help to regulate sebum so the skin will not look greasy and manage the body’s pH so the skin will be less likely to become irritated.Applying argan oil to the hair can make it look healthier by preventing frizz and split ends. It can make the hair look shinier and eliminate limp tresses by hydrating the roots and strengthening the hair, making your hair more manageable. This can help to reduce the risk that outdoor activities or styling will break or damage the strands of hair. Argan oil provides a high dose of fatty acids that can make brittle hair stronger and improve the protein structures without adding a sticky, oily component to the hair. The high antioxidant content of argan oil can help to improve immunity to certain diseases including endometrial, prostate, breast or colorectal cancer. Using this oil has been known to improve brittle nails, soothe arthritis and rheumatism pain and insulin resistance. Men have found that using argan oil can improve triglyceride levels to help ward off cardiovascular disease.Argan oil is very high in omega-6 fatty acids and linoleic acid which can provide anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, antioxidant and moisturizing properties for the skin.It also contains omega-9 unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin A which provide high doses of antioxidants.This oil also contains 620mg of trocopeherols which have the same activity as vitamin E. This is twice the amount of this chemical compared to the more common olive oil.The trocopherol content of argan oil makes it a powerful antioxidant that can help to protect soft tissue by neutralizing the effects of free radicals.I love this oil in particular because it feels silky and smooth and soaks right into my skin. I feel it nourishing my hair and my skin and hair look vibrant because of it. I received this product at a promo discount and would absolutely recommend it to others. EXCELLENT quality! Thanks so much!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13X2S6FQ69DY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXDWFG2#wasThisHelpful","R13X2S6FQ69DY2","A3MRXWB56DCAMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MRXWB56DCAMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter has been using this and she likes it a lot. She says she gets hungry but when she is eating she get full very quickly. She has lost about 3 pounds in the last week and hasn't put a lot of effort into it other than taking this supplement. It has only been about a week so I will try to come back and update my review as she progresses. She is 16 so she isn't exactly a ""child"". She's very active but for some reason she likes carbs and I think that is her main downfall. The supplement seems to help her control that and she is doing well on it.

"Grace Evangeline, successful romance novelist, has decided the next goal of her career. She wants her newest novel produced for the stage, and she wants Devin Bressard, also a playwright, to be the producer. In fact, she won't consider anyone else. When he pans her work to her face, she douses his (face, not work) with her glass of sweet tea, but she doesn't give up. She's going to prove him wrong not only about her novels, but also about the nature of art itself. Drama in real life does happen, and dramatic art fortifies the soul to face its own trials, and Grace is going to prove this to Devin if she has to stalk him to do it. Fortunately for characters and reader alike, Grace is a naive and inept stalker, and Devin quickly finds her out. When they are compelled to work together on a new project, their polarized points of view result in a battle of wits and wills and ignite a passion between them they never expected or wanted, but that just might begin healing they both need.I entered this book with excitement because I've been a fan of Heitzmann for almost ten years and have read most of her novels. But I also knew this is classed as a romcom, and I avoid comedies (and this author is the only exception I can think of to my avoidance of romances). I expected to enjoy it but hoped the humor would work for me. Well, by the end of the first chapter, I felt the magic. I was grinning as I flipped pages, often laughing out loud, devouring the brilliant banter between Grace and Devin. The book is probably 70% dialogue, but it never feels like ""too much talking."" These are voices you can hear in your head and characters you want to have coffee with (even Devin, even if he calls my writing less than art). I was settled into the comic groove of the book and perfectly happy with it despite my usual genre preferences. However, there were hints: all is not as light as it seems. Devin's cynicism and Grace's resolution against it are more than comic vehicles. Life has happened to these two people--life has hurt them, and they have each adopted a defense that suits them.And yes. Around the halfway mark, the passion between them creates consequences neither of them are prepared for. They don't know what to do, and since they're broken people, they do the wrong things. They grab their shields and huddle behind them, stumble away from each other at least as messed up as they were when they met.Here's the beautiful thing, though: the story's only half done. By the end, what began as a battle of wits and wills becomes ... well, it's a romance, so I'm sure you can guess. But while certain pieces of the story are dictated by the genre, the journey that brings us there is overall a fresh one. I could have done with fewer tied bows at the end, and at worst, one could accuse the book of a tonal shift at the halfway point that some readers might not be on board with. But if you go in looking for clues to the human undercurrents in the hilarity, you will find them, and you'll anticipate discovering the pasts that made Devin and Grace who they are. This book takes a look at defense mechanisms and how they affect our perception of the world around us--people, events, and yes, art. Devin and Grace's quarrels about art's purpose in life are some of the shiniest gems of the book.The dialogue sparks and sparkles and delves deep. The characters make me worry and cheer. I'm looking forward to meeting Grace and Devin again in the sequel TOLD YOU TWICE, as well as getting inside the head of secondary character Bo Corrigan. TOLD YOU SO proves Kristen Heitzmann can write anything and do it right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7O2JZHW8VQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017TES84O#wasThisHelpful","RT7O2JZHW8VQV","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matt Hammond is a recruiter for the fictional (but fact-based) ""SC2,"" an espionage organization in World War 2 that parachutes its agents behind enemy lines to aid the French Resistance. The eponymous Madeleine is a recruit with whom he, you guessed it, falls in love. Historical detail about the espionage missions is really interesting, but the characters are too under-developed to care about, and the dialogue reads like a history textbook.Matt, the first-person narrator, seems to exist only to train, fall for, sleep with, worry about, and all but worship Madeleine (you'll be thinking, if he compares the color of her eyes to burnished whiskey one more time ... and then he will). When one of her messages to SC2 is cut off and followed by complete silence, Matt takes it upon himself to worry some more and at last go into France after her. On the plus side, he does this under orders rather than going rogue to save his girl. On the minus side, his search isn't nearly as interesting as what's been happening to Madeleine while he searches for her--something we don't learn until the final twenty pages of the book, when a secondary character spouts lots of exposition at Matt about where his lost love has been all this time.It's not just the choice of narrator that damages the book, though. The fiction craft doesn't work on any level. Despite being written in first person, the book lacks any real point of view. ""Talking heads"" fill these pages, and most of the dialogue is informational. None of the characters have a unique voice (unless we're counting the way Watson hyphenates Madeleine's words whenever she's impressed by something: it's not ""amazing,"" it's ""a-maz-ing"" ... sigh).Part of what drew me to choose this book for review was the blurb's description of Matt. Injured in the war, lost a lung, barely escaped with his life, determined to keep fighting for the cause although he can't be in the field anymore. I expected to live this reality with him, to see his struggle and frustration and see him rise above those things as he works with the recruits. There are a few cursory mentions in dialogue that ""yes, I lost a lung, yes, it's painful, yes, I'm not supposed to smoke anymore but I still do,"" but it isn't part of Matt's life because the author never puts his reader into Matt's head. Never lets us experience the world around him through his senses. Matt occasionally tells us ""I was beside myself with worry,"" ""I felt pretty glum,"" etc., but the author never shows us Matt's heart and never lets us feel anything with him at all.Madeleine is a Mary Sue as well: redhead, best in her class of recruits, lovely sotto voice, sexy accent, and of course, eyes like burnished whiskey. Still, I kept wishing I could see the story through her eyes. Maybe there was more to her if I could get away from Matt's over-idealized view. Most of the plot elements happen to her, and certainly the story of her and Philippe is more compelling than the story of her and Matt (again, something we're finally told in the last twenty pages of the book).This is one of those novels that makes me wish it had been written by a novelist, not a historian. Fiction requires more than accurate historical details to make it compelling. It requires deep point of view that immerses us in the thoughts and senses and motivations of that character; dialogue that sounds like human speech, not like a textbook; real-time scenes that focus on the emotional high points rather than the historically important ones.MADELEINE'S WAR falls flat because its characters are not people. They're cardboard props for the history taking place around them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JLQDHTVROXR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539797#wasThisHelpful","R1JLQDHTVROXR1","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Agnieszka lives in a village on the edge of the magical, malevolent Wood. Its power is held in check by the mysterious wizard who lives in the tower and is known to her people only as the Dragon. Once a decade, the Dragon chooses a young woman from the village population, and she serves as his maidservant for the next ten years. Of course, he chooses Angieszka (or else this wouldn't be her story).I went into this book expecting a romance in the Beauty and the Beast vein, and at times the author seems to think she is writing a romance, but that's not what this book is. It's a dark, violent fantasy in which the villain of the tale turns out (in the final ten percent) to be more interesting than any of the heroes and in which none of the heroes are given a true character arc. The romance thread is stilted and confusing, dropped for a hundred pages in the middle of the book and then picked up again without any growth of Agnieszka or the Dragon toward each other emotionally. Every time they interact, the Dragon is verbally abusing and degrading Agnieszka; or the two of them are creating magic together; or they are having sex for no apparent reason (this occurs only once but it comes from absolutely nowhere and is a surprisingly explicit scene).The age gap between the Dragon and Agnieszka (150-year-old sorcerer, teen peasant girl) inevitably brings the Edward/Bella trope to mind. The Dragon is surly and insulting. Agnieszka is clumsy and ordinary and un-beautiful and just happens to be one of the most gifted witches born in a century. She frequently upstages the Dragon's magic abilities despite the text telling us that he is the most powerful wizard in the land. She also several times points out the obvious in such a way that everyone else in the room stares in awe at her strategic acumen.And then there's the writing itself. So many words could be cut from this text. So many. Every paragraph is swollen with adverbs. The Dragon isn't angry; he's ""furiously angry"" and in the next paragraph ""even more wildly angry."" He's not sarcastic; he's ""cuttingly sarcastic."" People say things ""silkily,"" ""dismissively,"" ""unhappily,"" ""horrifyingly,"" and on and on. Explanations of events, actions, and dialogue are given at every turn, even over the most obvious things. I felt like shouting ""I GOT IT!"" at nearly every page of this book.The storyworld is interesting. The Wood itself is the most interesting element of the story. But none of the characters, not even Agnieszka and the Dragon, possess the individual human nuances needed to breathe them to life. This one wasn't worth it for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23FVJH65GJMT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179034#wasThisHelpful","R23FVJH65GJMT0","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went into this book expecting a literary grandmother of Anna Quindlen; happily, that's what I got. ORDINARY PEOPLE is indeed about its titular cast, and the stakes of the novel are personal/internal stakes. The perspective alternates between Cal Jarrett, a successful tax attorney, and his son Conrad, eighteen years old and recently come home from a mental hospital. The reader soon discovers that Cal and his wife Beth ""had two sons, but now they have one."" What happened to their other son, Buck, is of course revealed bit-by-bit throughout the story.The author's voice took some time to immerse in, but there's something almost hypnotic about the stream-of-consciousness style. (And I was not expecting present tense from a novel published in 1976. Interesting.) Cal frustrates me to no end, but Conrad makes me root for him. Some of the book's best scenes feature Con and his therapist Berger, as together they unravel what led to Con's suicide attempt and how he can heal. Beth, too, is an interesting character, especially as we only get to see her through her husband's and son's eyes.This is a thoughtful, quiet, probing novel about things that have been explored since fiction began (living and surviving, guilt and innocence, facades and true selves). It took me a while to get through, partly because it's not about plot escalation--or escalation at all, really. It's about living life every day, even when only surviving is easier. I'm glad I took the time for this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5N2JULW2U6N1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140065172#wasThisHelpful","R5N2JULW2U6N1","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bob Saginowski ""just tends the bar."" Cousin Marv used to own the bar but has been bought out by bigger badder criminals and can't get respect from anyone around him. Eric Deeds considers himself a big bad criminal and wants Bob to return his pit bull puppy, which Bob claimed from a garbage can after Eric beat it nearly to death. These three characters (and the dog) fuel the plot of THE DROP, which revolves around Cousin Marv's bar, a ""drop bar"" where mob money is sometimes temporarily hidden from the police. It is unusual Lehane in its sparseness (only 250 pages), but it is classic Lehane in its characterizations, setting, and dialogue.I deliberately read this book before watching the film, though I realize the film existed first. I wanted to read it as a novel and not allow my experience to be colored by others' complaints that ""it's like reading a movie."" And I'm glad I did. Had I watched the movie first, I might have liked the book less. No arguing this book is short on the introspective character development found in other Lehane works. We don't know much about Bob for most of the story, although he has the most page time and we are ostensibly in his head. We don't know any of the characters from their thoughts; we only know them when they act. However, this removed point of view is no accident. Revelations about Bob's character wouldn't have been revelations if he'd have been as forthcoming internally as, say, Patrick Kenzie. Lehane wants us to be surprised by Bob. It's an interesting choice, especially from this author, but if you read the book through the lens of this choice, it works.So for what it is, I enjoyed the book. I also enjoyed the film (and Tom Hardy's genius). The final scenes are different in important ways, and I prefer the film's closing dialogue to the book's (for one thing, I respect Nadia more in the film, based on those ending exchanges). But both skillfully create a slow build of tension that culminates in a trademark Lehane explosion of violence at the end. Both ask questions Lehane often asks--about redemption, secrets, right vs. wrong and where the lines are really drawn between them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT1NOUKV6ZKD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365444#wasThisHelpful","RT1NOUKV6ZKD5","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been eight months since the end of SAVING YESTERDAY, and Gabby Creed is feeling like a failure. Her pre-ordained Pairing is interested in another girl; her father is getting arrested for drunk driving and refuses to emerge from his hole of depression, convinced Gabby will leave him again at any time. But there's her biggest failure: in eight months, Gabby hasn't seen her Shifter friends, hasn't seen Michael. She hasn't shifted. She's concluded that her previous failures in shifting missions have made Nicholas reject her for good. So when Erik shows up, offering her a chance to shift again, how can she say no? Sure, the Shifters all say he is the enemy of Nicholas and everything good, but he's offering everything she's ever wanted. And the Shifters haven't always been the most forthcoming bunch. Maybe they're wrong about Erik.Unlike some middle-of-the-trilogy books (which have no new plot of their own and could probably be skipped if necessary), this book goes in a brand new direction with the plot and pushes Gabby into brand new growth. The pacing remains relentless. New details are revealed about the Shifters and Shades that make the storyworld even more compelling. New, devastating stakes continue to rise all the way to the final page.The historical scenes are written with care and appropriate gravity. I hadn't known about the tragic capsizing of the ship Eastland in the Chicago river, and Evander's handling of the event as well as Gabby's reaction to it made me ponder the lesser known stories in history, what made history remember the Titanic and forget the Eastland. It's only one scene in this book, but it's a memorable scene.Gabby has grown since the last book, but she also has growing left to do, and it's delightful to read a book in which you can feel the author's knowledge of both these things (without ever intruding herself onto the page). The story is weighted with Gabby's quest to belong, her willingness to give up everything to save her parents, and her struggle to trust anyone at all. None of it is quick-fixed, and none of it is glossed over; yet the pacing doesn't suffer for this. The plot is constantly escalating, and the final twist is something I defy any reader to see coming. Gabby's sarcastic voice delivers some hilarious one-liners even in dark moments, but Evander never pushes this too far, never makes Gabby feel ""too cool"" or unaffected by the chaos around her.This series is Gabby's journey, but I can't review CAPTURING TODAY without mentioning old secondaries who gain new layers here (Donovan and Lark) and new secondaries I'm now rooting for (Yasmine and Carl). I especially loved Donovan this time around. And, of course, our leading man ... Michael. We get a good amount of page time with him in this book (considering necessary plot elements sometimes take Gabby away from him), including some great revelations of competence and personality, things that were hinted at in the first book but shown more clearly here. Michael is a rarity in YA fiction: a hero who doesn't spend all his time brooding mysteriously or grinning with mischief. Instead, he is a rule-follower for his cause, smiling despite the sadness in his past, ceaselessly kind and selfless without realizing it. We also get to see that he conducts his missions differently now than he did before he met Gabby. This is the mark of a couple I can root for: Michael and Gabby challenge and inspire each other to be better people, not with cliched ""you make me want to be a better person!"" speeches but with actions.This book has solidified my love for the TimeShifters series. I need that third book. I need Michael and Gabby to be together and safe (please?). I need to know what plot twists Evander has in store for us next and how she's going to resolve that stakes-through-the-roof final page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31GF980X6F99V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPQ7GJY#wasThisHelpful","R31GF980X6F99V","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lynn is sixteen years old, living in a world after the Shortage of drinking water. Her mother has raised her in a farmhouse near a pond and taught her not only to distrust strangers but to shoot them if they come near her water source. Lynn never hesitates—until the brutality of her world forces her to interact with others and question whether survival is enough to live on.I read the companion/sequel, IN A HANDFUL OF DUST, when it came out last year. Lynn was my favorite character in that book, so I anticipated getting to know her as a teenager in this one. I wasn't disappointed. McGinnis again weaves her story with frank, pitiless prose, reflecting Lynn's stunted emotions as well as the scarcity of the storyworld. The strength of the book is seeing Lynn discover that she does have a conscience and feelings, that she can even make choices that seem contrary to her own survival only because they are right choices.I didn't find much interesting about Lucy (the protagonist of the sequel) in this one, but she's only five years old here. She sometimes talks older than her years, but usually she’s just a five-year-old girl without much to distinguish her as a person. The most intricately developed relationship in the book is that of Lynn and her neighbor Stebbs, which evolves from strangers to family. Stebbs would father Lynn more if she'd allow it, but he also respects her and treats her like an adult.As for the twist in the last twenty pages ... I should be saying it doesn't work. It's more meaningless than the tragedies in the sequel, and more meaningless than any of the tragedies in this book that come before it. But McGinnis seems to be saying something with it--maybe that trying to find meaning in loss is a futile endeavor. Having read the sequel, I at least knew this was coming, and I can see how it shapes the woman Lynn becomes. It would not be my choice of an ending, especially so near the end of the book, but it doesn’t change the respect I have for these two books together, well-described on the cover of this one as “brutal but beautiful.” I’m glad to have met Lynn, Stebbs, Lucy, and the others; and I might even read McGinnis again, when I’m in the mood for a stark voice and unflinching bleakness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13NGJZAR04GJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062198505#wasThisHelpful","R13NGJZAR04GJF","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thirty-something twins Charlie and William (""Whiskey"") are barely on speaking terms when a car accident leaves Whiskey in a coma and Charlie in an unexpected crisis. He's the one who chose distance between himself and his brother. Now he only wants to erase that distance. But the weeks wear into months, and Whiskey doesn't awaken. Most of this novel is told in vignettes named for the phonetic alphabet (Alpha to Zulu): flashbacks of Charlie and Whiskey's relationship, their closeness and then the results of their falling out. Interspersed with these backstory scenes are unnamed ""present"" scenes, many taking place in the hospital, as Charlie and his family question, hope, and cope with Whiskey's condition. It's an intriguing setup, and the theme of family reconciliation is of course classic. This incarnation would have worked better with more subtlety in both the narration and the dialogue.The alphabet-titled vignettes stretch plausibility at times (by the time I reached ""Victor,"" I was hoping this would be Whiskey as victor over the coma or something; but no, Charlie and Whiskey really do know people named Juliet, Mike, Oscar, and Victor). I could go with that, though, if it were the only contrived thing about the book. Twice, the characters describe their lives as a soap opera, and the story does a few times enter classic soap territory (mainly the arcs of Whiskey and Charlie's parents and half-siblings). The dialogue is quite direct, everyone stating what they mean and talking in mini-speeches much of the time, which adds to the soap-opera style. If I'd been more attached to Charlie and Whiskey, I might have been willing to follow them through the plot convolutions, but the style of the book kept me at arms' length. While the flashback scenes are written in real time, they are peppered with narrative summarizing. The story would have been easier to track, the characters more sympathetic, if more had been shown in action and dialogue rather than spelled out in chunky summarizing paragraphs of Charlie's thoughts.Still, the premise is solid, and the author's choice to filter everything through Charlie's warped perspective is interesting. As the reader unravels the lies Charlie believes about his family and himself, personal stakes rise: whether Whiskey wakes up or not, Charlie has to face things he's allowed to fester inside him his whole life. This digging into the main character kept me reading--that and wondering how Charlie and Whiskey had fallen out so drastically. (Unfortunately, the cause of this was revealed only in a paragraph of narration rather than a scene.)Though the story could have been given better immediacy with less summarizing, better subtlety with more natural dialogue, it's a thoughtful exploration of a character who is too self-centered to be likable but also feels human in his blindness and flaws.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EN3OO7AMN988/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149260786X#wasThisHelpful","R2EN3OO7AMN988","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kate Brennan has a lot of life-juggling to do. She's a college freshman struggling with calculus and hoping to get into medical school. Her family is firmly in the dysfunctional camp, especially her controlling, passive aggressive mother. She's eighteen and has never dated, but she's hoping to change that very soon. She's really not looking to add any new stress to her life, but apparently God has other plans. A fire tattoo has appeared on her wrist, and a stranger named Nathan is telling her this is a sign she's been called as a Guardian--a protector of the innocent against the Fallen, former Guardians who use their powers for evil. Because, oh yeah, Nathan also tells her she's soon to develop a Gift (supernatural power) that will aid her in the fight. Kate just wants a way out of this calling, a way back to normal life ... if such a thing still exists for her.This book started out slow for me but was worth pushing forward. The voice, dialogue, and characterizations all strengthen as the book continues. Kate starts out as an extremely negative voice, constantly talking herself down in addition to resisting her calling as a Guardian. She is by turns both frustrating and understandable, slowly growing toward the latter as stakes rise and she gets answers from a group of Guardians who have taken her in to train her.Supporting characters each have an important role, with some more deeply fleshed out than others. I'm most interested in Nathan, whose Gift is ""Knowledge"" (a form of prophesy/visions); Ty, Kate's rebellious but redeemable (or so I'm betting) brother; Jackson, the six-foot-seven Guardian with enhanced strength and a (usually) easygoing nature. And of course, I want to know more about Hassan, whose unique backstory and surly disposition promise further layers and growth in future books.Part of my enjoyment of this book, however, has nothing to do with characters or plot. The ideas delved into are impressive, and Vandel doesn't do half-measures with the issues raised. She skillfully depicts the psychological aftermath of Kate's terrifying encounter with one of the Fallen Guardians; the ethics of vigilantism vs. law, self-defense vs. murder; and the enormity of taking a life in any situation. The mythology here is biblically derived, building on the premise that supernaturally gifted Guardians have existed since the time of Pentecost to serve as protectors of God's people; the Fallen are those who have chosen to use their powers selfishly. It's sort of a fantasy version of spiritual gifts combined with guardian angels, and there's also mention of the Fallen using demons to increase their power. But the story is never spiritually heavy-handed; it's clear the author is using biblical concepts as a jumping-off point for fantasy. Anybody who enjoys superpower stories can enjoy the premise of this one.It's a fast read once you get past the first few chapters, and at this point, Vandel could go almost anywhere with the story. I'll be picking up the next book for sure. Christian speculative fiction is hard to find; this one is recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R164IJCKCD6VPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5PQTOA#wasThisHelpful","R164IJCKCD6VPS","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lex's brother Tyler killed himself on December 20. On February 5, Lex gives in to her counselor's suggestion of writing in a journal. Lex tells the story of her present and (via journal entries) her past as she faces the rest of her senior year--college plans, her parents' difficult responses to Ty's death, the loss of her boyfriend Steven. To add to it all, Lex feels that Ty wants something of her and wonders if she's seeing his ghost.One of the only genres I avoid is the spoon-feeding ""social issues"" novel. This book's back cover blurb imparts only the information that Lex is the main character and her brother has recently committed suicide. Based on that blurb alone, I would never have picked this up. So why did I? Because Cynthia Hand wrote it. Truly the only reason. I don't read much YA, but the UNEARTHLY series is one of my favorites; I love Ms. Hand's voice and her characters and her dialogue. So rather unwillingly, I gave this one a try.I could sum up this review thusly: I will read whatever Cynthia Hand writes for the rest of her career.Nothing about this novel is sledgehammered into the reader's head. Lex is a person, not a mouthpiece for social awareness. She's a math genius waiting to hear if her dream of MIT will become reality. She's an atheist raised by a church-going mom. She's a perfectionist, a conscientious firstborn who claimed her baby brother as ""mine"" the first time she met him. She's in love with her boyfriend and afraid to believe in love. She wishes she were more adept at swearing and she likes cherry Pop-Tarts.This story is Lex's journey--heartbreaking, life-affirming, yes. But also beautifully written, unraveling slowly toward revelations from the past and resolutions in the present. Not neat and tidy wrap-ups, not a happily ever after, but a final ""goodbye"" that will let Lex live even though Ty didn't.Driven by character moments and deep, human truths, THE LAST TIME WE SAY GOODBYE is an honest patchwork of hurt and humor and anger and aches, a book that faces both death and life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCD251L8C59V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062318470#wasThisHelpful","RSCD251L8C59V","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Caleb Stiles has, with God's help, remade his life. Once an angry, helpless foster kid, he's now twenty-four and doing what he can to help foster kids, and ... well, okay, he's still pretty angry sometimes. He meets Kate Hawkins at a bar. Turning twenty-one, dragged here by her friends, Kate is using her fluffy pink coat to cover her too short dress and wishing she was anywhere else. At first, Caleb and Kate's connection is just a long glance across the room. Then he witnesses something that could put her in danger, and he surges into action. Later, it's a few dinners, discovering their mutual love for old music and record collecting ... followed by an unexpected revelation not only for Caleb and Kate but also for the reader. These two can't be together. It will never work. Problem is, they might be falling in love.The book blurb doesn't reveal Caleb and Kate's giant relationship obstacle, so I won't either, although discussing this book is hard to do without it (I mean, it pops up 35% in!). What I can say: it's a wholly original twist that kept me turning pages. This is a Christian romance novel that smashes quite a few Christian-fiction stereotypes. Believers are not living charmed or whitewashed lives. Nonbelievers are portrayed sympathetically--yes, even their skepticism is portrayed sympathetically. And even minor characters defy stereotypes (thinking here of Scott's role, especially near the end of the book).A few more plus points: the dialogue is natural, and the first-person voices of Caleb and Kate are artful and endearing, if sometimes similar. The twist of who they really are, both inside and outside, adds layers to both of them. Matayo has a knack for carefully (but not overly) detailed backstory. And the last line of the last chapter is beautiful and would have been the perfect place to end the book.The things that detract from the story, for me, are things its genre requires, so I can't really blame the author for them. The epilogue wraps things up too neatly, and sometimes two or three sentences of character introspection could have been tightened to one. But I say this as someone who dislikes ""happily ever after"" (and most epilogues, come to think of it) and who prefers sparseness in character thought. Romance isn't constructed that way, which is why I typically avoid it. The fact I inhaled this book anyway is a salute to the author.SWAY is a bold, thoughtful romance that challenges reader assumptions, explores questions of faith without sermonizing, and still manages to stay character-driven. You don't have to enjoy romance novels to enjoy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33EPKTQPBXUA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502325896#wasThisHelpful","R33EPKTQPBXUA8","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A teen girl named Juneau lives in Alaska (yup, really). Post-apocalyptic Alaska, or so she believes. Turns out, the adults of her community have pulled a Village-esque ruse on the younger generation. There was no World War III, and the rest of the world is quite livable and functional and, unlike Juneau's community, modern. When her clan disappears, she ventures out to find them.I wasn't a fan of THE VILLAGE, but this book lets you know on the back cover that ""everything she'd been told her entire life was a lie,"" which seemed more interesting and less manipulative. I must confess the cover wooed me, too. I love a beautiful sky. What I don't love--plot coincidences, flat characters, and overwritten prose.The meeting of Juneau and Miles (the other point-of-view character) is only one of many contrived events in this story. Whatever Juneau needs to continue her journey is magically provided for her the moment she needs it. Sometimes literally magically, as she uses her connection to the ""superorganism"" of nature to do random things like camouflage herself, short out an iPhone, keep a car from starting (until later when she wants it to start), read the memories of a raven that flew over her pursuers, etc. A plot can't create suspense when a character is able to override the very rules of nature without any real consequences or limitations.As for the characters, I never cared. Not for a minute. Miles is a spoiled rich kid stereotype who seems to be acting out for no purpose other than his father is a distant rich businessman stereotype. Juneau's many Mary Sue qualities only further highlight Miles's many dull, incompetent qualities. The romance between them is forced and shallow and mostly comprised of Juneau's feeling electrical sparks when they touch. The motivations for Miles's actions are left undeveloped.The prose is overwritten to a maddening degree. Every line of dialogue in this entire book has a dialogue tag. Maybe literally every line. And Juneau and Miles ""say"" things mostly with adverbs. They also ""rebut,"" ""protest,"" ""mumble,"" ""clarify,"" ""insist,"" ""confirm,"" ""moan,"" ""offer."" The narration is first person, but both characters frequently think their thoughts to themselves. (For example, p. 154: _Yes, you can!_ I reassure myself.) In addition to these eyesores, the prose needs general trimming. This book could have been twenty percent shorter without cutting any scenes.A few of the plot revelations are intriguing setups for the second book. Unfortunately, Miles Juneau's road trip drags on so long, the rewards they (and the reader) get at the end are far too little too late, especially given the other flaws in the book. And the last scene is an eye-roll of a cliffhanger that, rather than baiting me to give the second book a chance, severed any interest I had left.AFTER THE END offers a beautiful cover and an interesting premise but, for me, nothing more than that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWP2NOB78EL0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006222560X#wasThisHelpful","RWP2NOB78EL0P","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cadence Sinclair is seventeen years old and part of a wealthy, cloistered family whose primary cause in life is materialism. Every summer, the Sinclairs go to live on their island (yes, Cady's grandfather owns an island). Except last year, Cady didn't go. Because the year before that--her fifteenth summer--something happened. Something that left her with headaches and amnesia. Something that left the relationship with her cousins/best friends Johnny and Mirren, and her boyfriend Gat, strained and distant. This is a careful, ominous novel that peels away the layers of ""summer fifteen"" on the Sinclairs' island. And yes, as trite as it's become to say this, one really can't discuss WE WERE LIARS without discussing the twist at the end. But I'll try.Firstly, I guessed the final twist on page 36. By page 50 or so, I knew I was right, and the clues throughout the book continued to reinforce what I knew. I'm not sure what Ms. Lockhart's intention was here. Did she count on most readers knowing what was going on, or not knowing? Did she want us to be shocked at the reveal, or simply nod with a ""yeah, of course I was right""? Cady's epiphany, if one can call it that, is moving and awful whether or not one already knows what she doesn't. And if I had reached this revelation and it had gone against my expectations, I would've felt cheated and been even angrier than I was. In a way, you can't win with this novel. But that's the entire point.The dialogue doesn't always fit the ages of the characters, especially when the ""Liars"" (the best-friend foursome, whose nickname is never really explained) are supposed to be fourteen. Sometimes, they seem like real, human kids. Other times, they seem like the author's attempt to create ""precocious teen characters,"" one each of the usual types: the clown, the waif, the professor, the ringleader (or so Cady says she is; this isn't always apparent). Other characters, too, waver between types and individuals. The conflict between the aunts and grandfather wavers between forced and frustrating-but-real. Despite this, I found myself caring about the Liars and about the book.The prose is sometimes odd, sometimes overwritten, but this seems deliberate on the author's part, a tactic of deep point of view to show us how damaged Cady is. Her flights of morbid fancy would make me roll my eyes, except for my knowledge that she is extremely messed up--and why. Without guessing the twist, I might have checked out emotionally rather than allowing Cady's trauma to flavor the story and excuse some of her absurdities. Again, how one reads this book really depends on that twist.As for the twist itself. I hate it. I really hate it. I'm not okay with it. I'm not okay with the fact that Ms. Lockhart wrote a story solely to end it like ... that.And yet.In real life, this book happens. Some lives get twisted just like this. Lives, people, like Gat and Johnny and Mirren and Cadence. Like the entire Sinclair family.And I guess that's all I can say.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOVVC517PX9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574126X#wasThisHelpful","R2NOVVC517PX9H","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allison Chamberlain is a 40-something woman who's lived her Christianity behind stained glass. She's never had any interest in riding a Harley, certainly not in buying one, but one morning at church, she feels a divine ""Nudge"" to do exactly that. With no idea why God could possibly be asking this of her, Allison obeys. The purchase puts her on a road to meet new people. Her life changes, both instantly and slowly, as for the first time she is faced with the plight of ""the least of these.""Ms. Rue's first person voice and dialogue are engaging as always. I really love her deep-point-of-view style. In fact, this might be the main reason I've never missed one of her adult novels (until this series; I realize all three are out and I only recently got to the first one). Her craft is truly excellent. This is a stellar example of a character-driven novel. If you're a reader who defines ""plot"" as high-speed action, then this book will move slowly for you. The story is about people, their interactions and reactions. Its fuel is more tension than suspense. But when the characters are well-drawn, this apparently works for me.In the first chapter, Allison downright irritated me. I wanted to keep reading to discover if I'd ever like her. (I do, of course.) She's a complicated character--sardonic and sincere, tough and vulnerable, uncertain and determined, relationship-impaired in her own eyes yet constantly forging new connections with people who need her help.Then there's Desmond, a fatherless twelve-year-old whose mother is slowly destroying both of them with her drug addiction and prostitution. Desmond is nearly as layered as Allison herself, swaggering and sweet-talking his way out of trouble, swearing and stealing because he's never been taught not to, yet also an artist with surprising insight into the people he draws. Another unexpectedly nuanced character is Bonner, the annoying-like-a-brother guy Allison knows from church who'd ask her out if she'd say yes. I didn't expect him to come through in such great ways by the end.The Sacrament House ""sisters,"" women rescued from prostitution and turning their lives around with the help of Allison and God, are more a collective character than individuals. Though each has her own broad personality type, they aren't given the details that would breathe them to life. The same goes for Allison's small group at church. However, I can't really consider this a flaw. The book has quite a large cast. Not everyone can be as deep as Allison and Desmond.One character I hope will be developed a lot more deeply in future books is Chief. He's pretty awesome already (Harley-riding lawyer with piercing ""eagle eyes"" and an unflappable personality), but I know almost nothing about him at this point. I want details on his skepticism toward God, his friendship with Hank and how it began, his family (does he even have one?) ... etc. Yes, I'm most definitely going to be reading UNEXPECTED DISMOUNTS, and curiosity about Chief is a big reason for that.And now, a word (or ten) about the theme, since that's clearly where this novel's creation started. I could do with a little more subtlety. In fact, I was surprised how close the author came to preaching, since that isn't her usual tendency. Her message is two-pronged. First, legalism is not what Jesus taught and, as such, is not true Christianity. (With this, I agree entirely.) Second, love is what Jesus did teach and, as such, is what true Christians will spread and teach.With this one, I agree, too. But Allison (and thus the author) often seems to believe that love equals acceptance. Period. It's a thin line to walk, I know, but it is a line. The scene that most bothered me is between Allison and her soon-to-be-former pastor. Now, to this point, Allison's church has not in any way supported her efforts with sheltering and rehabilitating these women. Her fellow church members (including her pastor) are all in favor of checking the women into rehab and doing other things from a distance. But up close and personal with hookers is a little too dirty-hands for them, and Allison's involvement is making them uncomfortable. Reverend Garry shows up to try to bring her back into the fold of the prim and proper. Thing is, his theology isn't wrong, merely his application of it. But Allison condemns both. From page 403:[Garry]: ""I just don't want to see you water down the gospel. We can't call someone a Christian just because she's stopped using drugs.""[Allison]: ""Our trouble is that we're not talking about the same gospel. The gospel I know is the one where Jesus preached and lived the unconditional love of salvation. You know--the one where he ate at the same table with the hookers and the drug addicts and the victims of injustice and poverty--that one. The one you're talking about is the one I haven't read--where only the right kind of people get into the closed club and get saved.""The implication is that the Gospel is simply unconditionally loving people. End of story. Yes, Jesus ate with ""tax collectors and sinners."" He also called them out on their sin and told them to repent. There's not a single scene of repentance in this novel.Interestingly, however, there are moments in which one or another of the rescued women seems to be behaving post-repentance. They're studying the Bible. They're telling others about Jesus. They're taking communion and seem to understand and embrace its meaning. Near the end, Allison describes salvation as embracing Jesus ""as our personal savior"" and describes one of the women as ""on her way to a life of discipleship."" So I guess the Gospel is present here, on the whole, but some parts of it are definitely glossed over. Which would likely bother me less if the book didn't fervently want me to agree with everything Allison says.For the overtness of the themes and some truth blurring, I've got to deduct a star. However, I fully intend to read and enjoy this series. Nancy Rue has penned some of the best literary Christian fiction I've read. Her dialogue is clever and genuine and contains just enough humor. Her prose is unobtrusive yet artful. And her point of view is delightfully deep. I'm still a fan, and I look forward to the next book and, hopefully, finding out who Chief is on the inside, and why.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KYLAYKZX3TKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IEA2T8#wasThisHelpful","R2KYLAYKZX3TKI","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Detective Inspector Sean Duffy is, on multiple levels, a ""cop who needs a break."" He's embroiled in politics that threaten his very job, tasked by MI5 to stop an IRA bombing suspect whose location and plans are unknown, and waylaid from said task by a family member of the bombing suspect who refuses to talk unless Duffy can solve a cold case for her. To understate, the tension never lets up in this book. Sean Duffy is an angry, sarcastic, self-deprecating, persevering hero and Ireland in 1984 is a vivid, bleak setting for this mystery-fueled manhunt story.In 1984, I was an American toddler. Going into this novel, I had almost no knowledge of its time and place. McKinty paints not only the landscape, the loss, the upheaval of the time; he also lets us glimpse the hearts and mindsets of the people and the reasons behind their views. None of it eclipses the plot or the protagonist, but (perhaps obviously) this plot and this protagonist would not exist in any other setting. The Troubles have shaped Sean Duffy into the man he is.Speaking of Sean Duffy. What a wonderful character, and what a voice McKinty has given him. From that first scene (ignoring his emergency police beeper in favor of his Atari game), he's intriguing--smart, cynical, resentful. He turns out to be the kind of cop who underestimates himself before his enemy, who doesn't take condescension from anybody, and who doggedly works a case as long as it takes. He enjoys music of many genres, eats too little, drinks too much. He tells his story in a witty and lyrical voice that observes the quietly profound beauty and sorrow of the world around him. Yet Mr. McKinty understands author restraint. There's no theme-spouting here, from Sean or anyone else. The beliefs of the characters belong to themselves.The plot unfolds rather oddly, jump-starting with the IRA bomb threats and then detouring almost entirely from that element to the cold case. A relative of the bomber, who believes a certain ""accidental"" death wasn't, demands closure in exchange for information. Without other leads, and despite his MI5 contact's lack of enthusiasm, Duffy agrees. It's an unusual author choice, and I can understand why not every reader would want to follow McKinty here, but it works for me. At first, upon finishing, I felt the bomber's story thread was too marginalized; there's personal history between him and Duffy, and I wanted to know more. But really, the book is understated, not underdeveloped. I want more not because something's missing but because I'm invested in what's here. It all works.IN THE MORNING I'LL BE GONE succeeds on so many levels--dialogue, characterization, setting, mood, plot, and above all, voice. The first two Sean Duffy novels have just leaped to the top of my to-read list.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZJ5N5TUG8DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616148772#wasThisHelpful","R1EZJ5N5TUG8DV","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This contemporary debut is told in the first-person voices of four people who never should have met--Bashkim, a child of struggling immigrants; Luis, a young, wounded soldier; Avis, a mid-fifties suburban wife whose husband has just asked for a divorce; and Roberta, a children's Court Appointed Special Advocate. The plot is, essentially, a domino of events that bring these characters together. The author paints Las Vegas as a character no less vivid than the people who live there, giving memorable texture to this character-driven story.WE ARE CALLED TO RISE is a strangely uneven offering that presents several symptoms of the debut novel. Most notably, the author doesn't seem to trust the intelligence of her readers, especially with regard to her themes: paying it forward, random acts of kindness, the butterfly effect, the resiliency of human nature. All of these are hammered into us until Bashkim's final-page epiphany holds less punch than it should. Really, though, Bashkim (and Avis and Roberta) don't need to think these profound thoughts in the first place. The events and the characters' choices would have led us to the profound thoughts for ourselves, if they had been allowed to do so. Hopefully, Ms. McBride's next novel will be written with greater faith in her readers and therefore greater subtlety.As for the characters themselves, maybe other readers will latch onto Roberta and/or Avis. I never did. Roberta especially has no depth of character; she exists mostly to give the reader information or to opine about the themes and the personality of Las Vegas (the latter of which is interesting). More happens to Avis, but she still frequently comes across as a theme megaphone for the author. And when she's human, her willful blindness to her son's problems is frustrating. Sure, there are parents who delude themselves this far, but I could never feel sorry for her. Ironically, given the themes of reaching out to others, Avis seems abnormally self-centered. Maybe that was the point--a theme mirror of sorts? But I never found her all that unique or compelling as a character.The boys, though. Eight-year-old Bashkim is a marvelous, realistic kid. His teachers call him a worrier, and his explosively angry father has given him good cause to be. He's somber and conscientious, longs to play sports at school but knows his family doesn't have the money, enjoys watching the sharks in the marine lab. His voice is authentic, perceiving more than the adults realize but convincingly immature when he should be. The things he wonders about, the things he misinterprets--poignant and sweet. Then there's Luis, a Las Vegas native deployed to Iraq, who we meet in a DC hospital after a head injury he can't remember. His voice starts out almost as childlike as Bashkim's (if more profane, appropriately), struggling to remember and even to compose thoughts. The reader learns what happened to Luis as he learns to process and cope with both PTSD and his brain injury. The letters written back and forth between him and Bashkim demonstrate his struggle to regain his verbal skills. He and Bashkim are well written characters, with more detailed personalities than Avis or Roberta's.The plot moves along at a suitable pace, and I was engaged throughout. The climax/conclusion, however (the final scene is both of these), jumps right off the plausibility cliff. I don't believe this would ever, ever happen. I simply don't. The author could have wrapped up her theme in several other ways that would have been hopeful yet still believable. In addition, quite a bit of the dialogue feels more ""informational"" than human in its content, often stilted. It's also spotted with unnecessary ""yeses"" and ""nos"" and character naming with every new speaker (general examples, not exact quotes: ""Roberta, I think we should ..."" ""Well, Marty, I don't agree..."" ""But, Roberta..."" ""I said no, Marty..."").Had the conclusion been a bit more plausible, the dialogue more natural, and the themes less spoon-fed, this would have been a four-star book for me. I found myself invested in the plights of Bashkim and Luis. I wanted them to find safety and healing. I even wonder what will happen to them next and would read a sequel about them. This novel is an unusual mix of things that work and things that don't, but on the whole, I'm glad to have met Bashkim and Luis and Laura McBride's Las Vegas.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BGMHBVWQ159/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476738963#wasThisHelpful","R3BGMHBVWQ159","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seventeen-year-old Lucy Dane is the only friend Cheri Stoddard has. Cheri is a year older in age but about a decade younger, mentally. When she disappears, not even her mother cares to find her. THE WEIGHT OF BLOOD begins a year after said disappearance, when Cheri's dismembered body is discovered in a tree. Lucy strives to solve Cheri's murder and, as she gathers clues, realizes she may also be close to solving the disappearance of her own mother, Lila, who's been gone since Lucy was two years old. But it's no easy thing to solve a crime (or two?) in Henbane, Missouri. The Ozark townsfolk live by the law of silence, and even Lucy, who's grown up here, might not be able to break it. If she does, the consequences might be greater than she's imagined.As a reader who (unlike the author) is not personally familiar with the Ozark setting, I was most impressed with this book's sense of place and its integral part in the unveiling of the mysteries. In fact, the town of Henbane may be the most roundly developed character in this book, while sometimes the characters feel more like setting details. Ms. McHugh writes lovely description, evoking mood and personality in the caves and swimming holes, the woods and dirt roads and old farmhouses.The pacing is also well done. I read this book in a few days (fast, for me) and was glued to it by curiosity. Who in this cast of characters knows what really happened to Lila? How is Lucy going to learn the truth? I appreciate that the author didn't try to turn every event into a surprise. Yes, Crete is bad news (not a spoiler--it's quite obvious quite early, and after all, the author admits in an interview with Karin Slaughter that she would cast as Crete an actor who terrifies her). Since the author doesn't hide the villain's identity, we experience trepidation for Lucy, who knows him only as the uncle who's been good to her all her life.Given this transparency in the storytelling, it's odd that so many reviewers (including myself) didn't realize until about fifty pages in that Lila is Lucy's mother. The book's first part is told from their alternating first-person perspectives, and at first I expected them to meet. Then I did the math of secondary characters' ages and realized there was a time gap here--and only then did I realize, oh, Lila is the disappeared mother. Not many pages after I put this together, Lucy first refers to her as ""my mother, Lila."" Apparently this was supposed to be a surprising twist, but the information delay serves no narrative purpose.I found McHugh's style as a whole to be enjoyable--a balance of word-smithing that's neither under- nor over-written. Some of the character details are real and touching (Cheri's chipped butterfly necklace, Ransome's baby quilt). However, the first-person voices of Lucy and Lila are essentially the same voice. In Parts 2 and 3, the secondary characters' third-person chapters are told with very little variation in said voice. And the voice engages in a lot of telling-not-showing. A lot. Point-of-view killers abound: I saw, I realized, I felt, I thought, I knew, I wondered if ..., It occurred to me that ..., etc. A little more subtlety and a little less explanatory introspection would go a long way here.Also, the characterization of Lucy isn't very deep. Her penchant for library books might be the only individualizing quirk she has. Mostly, she's a searching-for-self seventeen-year-old with enough determination to solve a murder case. But in the final third of the book, her reactions to her situation become problematic. There's a bit of contriving as McHugh isolates Lucy using a severe storm and a conveniently unreachable adult character to whom Lucy wants to present her evidence. Still, even with these obstacles, there are safer, more sensible options than the ones Lucy chooses, and I don't understand the motivation for her choice. Is she still hoping Crete is the uncle she knows and not the monster she suspects? Fair enough. But does that emotion make it onto the page? No. Ultimately, this might be my problem with Lucy: a lot of thought, but almost no feeling. Case in point being the climactic scene, in which she has no emotional response whatsoever to things that should be terrifying, devastating, even enraging. I'm not saying I want a basket case of a protagonist, but a blank one isn't any more realistic or sympathetic (barring extenuating circumstances like severe trauma, but Lucy is not a traumatized character).And speaking of that climactic scene. After letting her readers in on so many of the secrets well before Lucy, Ms. McHugh carved out a tough job for herself. Almost any climax was bound to feel underwhelming, when I knew for so long what probably happened ... and then I wasn't proved wrong. If the book had ended with some bizarre twist, however, I probably would have scoffed. The ending McHugh does give us is mostly credible, other than Lucy's reaction.THE WEIGHT OF BLOOD succeeds on many levels: setting, mood, pacing, and carefully crafted prose. It loses stars for an under-developed protagonist and indistinguishable character voices. But three stars (from me) means I don't regret the hours I gave this book, and the author is likely worth keeping track of. There's great promise in this debut of greater books to come.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GVBTXPYKN9C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995201#wasThisHelpful","R2GVBTXPYKN9C7","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Noah State's last name says it all. His mind and body have been enhanced in the service of a government that has replaced ""traditional"" justice with a simpler system: all crimes are punishable with death. As a liquidator, twenty-year-old Noah is judge, jury, and executioner. His latest mission: liquidate all members of a rumored resistance movement.Undercover on said mission, he meets Maddison. They share a growing attraction and trust, deep grief in their respective pasts, hidden hatred for the totalitarian regime. But how can they have a chance together when disclosure of his true identity would push her away for good? Not to mention he'll be liquidated himself on the day of his mission deadline, when he doesn't satisfy his superior. Noah can't take any more blood on his hands, even if the cost is his life.This book is a lovely blend of high stakes, dystopian storyworld, and character relationships. As for the stakes, there's of course Noah's mission. There's also Maddison's dabbling in the resistance, wanting freedom and revenge on the regime (unbeknownst to Noah, of course, because things just weren't tense enough). Further complicating everyone's lives (and safety) is Noah's liquidator brother, Daniel. Unlike Noah, Daniel enjoys his job. Really enjoys his job. (He also really enjoys antagonizing Noah.)As for the dystopian storyworld, I'm not much of a description reader, so I don't need much in this area. Tinnin makes sure we know where we are and we feel the contrast to our own world, but she doesn't belabor it. There's a reasonable amount of futuristic tech, but gadgets don't drive the story. There are definite hints this world was previously our own, but place names have all been made generic (cities are numbered). Noah's super-senses, speed, and strength are an excellent feature, too, well written and fun to read. The most detailed and vital elements of the world, though, are found in governmental power and societal attitudes, which are represented well by a few varying bit characters.And now for the characters (a.k.a. Why I Read). In a sentence, I love them.Maddison is no Distressed Damsel. She isn't weepy or passive. She doesn't twist her ankle in the woods. She makes her own decisions, fights her own battles, tries to protect the people she loves with a deep ferocity and anger at the world that threatens them. But she isn't Too Tough or Too Cool. She makes questionable decisions. She gets scared. She apologizes when she should. She cries. She bakes too many cookies when she's stressed. She loves with her whole heart. Maddison is a person, not a type.And ... well, Noah. Noah who wakes up at night thinking his hands are coated with the blood of people he's executed. Noah who worries not only about his own soul before God, but also about his brother's. Noah who loves to drive his ""smart car"" manually just because he can, who restores dilapidated, physical books because they're rare pieces of history. Yes, he's a person, too.Together, Noah and Maddison (not the stakes or the storyworld) drive this book. They've both been through so much, and they've both learned to hide their true selves--from their world, of course, but also from their loved ones. But from each other, no hiding is needed. This relief in openness, in acceptance, is what makes me root for them as a couple. Yes, their dates and their banter are fun to read (and balance the tension and darkness of much of the book), but the sense of home they find in each other is the real gem here. I want to see this relationship continue to grow.However, the brightest gem of the novel might not be Noah and Maddison but rather Noah and Daniel--their shared past, the wedges between them, the constant conflict. Daniel refuses to acknowledge how he's wronged Noah and refuses to treat him with respect. For most of the book, I considered Daniel a sociopath, but a moment at the end suggests otherwise. Any path of reconciliation for these brothers will be an uphill, rocky one. I want the second book as much for Noah and Daniel as Noah and Maddison.Yes, that's the gist. I want the second book. I want it right now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RAJZQ8C2DQM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496028120#wasThisHelpful","R1RAJZQ8C2DQM6","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Morgan Spencer has built a name and a fortune for himself as the ""success guru,"" turning floundering corporations into impressive profit-makers. Solutions are what he lives for--or used to. After the death of his wife Jill, he's now focused only on his two-year-old daughter Livie ... until he meets Quinn Reilly. A man from her past is out of prison, ready to exact revenge on her for putting him there. Drawn to each other despite themselves, Morgan decides to solve Quinn's problem and Quinn decides to let him. But is this the answer God wants for them? With so much grief in Morgan's past and so much betrayal in Quinn's, how can they find a path through the future together?This is an unusual offering in the romantic suspense genre, more leisurely paced and driven wholly by the characters. But characters are why I read, and I'm an extreme fan of Kristen Heitzmann's. Morgan Spencer is on my Top Two Heitzmann Heroes list. This is the third book featuring him, though it can be read as a standalone.Heitzmann has created in Morgan a unique and uniquely flawed hero, a man whose ego and self-loathing are barely balanced (or not so balanced at times), who begins this book wealthy and bereft, devoted and withdrawn. And no one creates character quirks better than Kristen Heitzmann. As much as I love Morgan for his nobility and his mistakes, I also love him for his fast driving and his panic attacks, his impeccable taste in fine dining and his refusal to eat whenever he's stressed, his love of a quiet California beach and his German metal music. He's so nuanced I want to go out into the world and meet him, because surely he exists out there.Not to ignore Quinn. Morgan's layers probably only exceed hers because we've had three books with him. Quinn has her own contradictions and quirks--stubborn in one situation and yielding the next (but both reactions make sense for who she is), self-conscious about her short stature and unruly hair, terrified of horses and excited to go fishing, guarded out of necessity but yearning to be part of Morgan and Livie's lives.I love this author for creating real, messed up, individual people rather than safe, sanitized types. Quirks and flaws are two ways she accomplishes this. The other is dialogue. Heitzmann's is witty but not too cool, confrontational but not forced, entertaining and poignant and wholly original. I could read 400 pages of ""talking heads"" from her and not mind in the least. I wouldn't even need tags to know who was speaking, since each of her characters possesses a distinct voice.The secondary characterizations also deserve praise, most notably those recurring from the two previous books: Rick and Noelle, of course, but also Consuela, Celia, Livie, and others. Another bit of loveliness here is the setting. Colorado and California are both painted with vibrant detail, as are Morgan and Rick's respective homes. You can feel the opulence in the one and the rugged warmth in the other.I love the tiny bites of truth found here as Quinn and Morgan work through what is either a God-ordained gift or a terrible mistake. Morgan's broken confession says it all: ""I don't know what God expects,"" something both he and Quinn must wrestle with in more than one area of their lives. Morgan and Quinn fight and flail through the beginning of their relationship, and when God works something beautiful despite their fallenness, glory is given to Him.I want to give this book five stars because all of the above demand at least four-and-a-half. The plot, though, toppled my suspension of disbelief several times. I simply can't fathom that any law-abiding person, even self-sufficient Morgan Spencer, would learn of Quinn's situation and not immediately call the police. This questionable element might be less glaring if the entire plot didn't hinge on it, but it does. With police protection for Quinn, Morgan's solution wouldn't be necessary, and he and Quinn might never end up together.That said, I love these characters enough to read this book again and again, never mind the wobbly setup. It's in the human moments, not the perilous ones, that this book shines; and in those moments it is a beautiful, bright star. Kristen Heitzmann remains one of my favorite authors, the creator of some of my favorite characters, a dialogue expert and master of character nuance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22RAYYKGAVYGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764210424#wasThisHelpful","R22RAYYKGAVYGK","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"<< NOTE: Spoilers for ULTRAVIOLET. >>Tori Beaugrand's life is a composite of secrets. From her intellect to her emotions to her origin, nothing is safe to reveal. To anybody. Not her friends, new or old. Not her parents. Certainly not her enemies. And for a seventeen-year-old, Tori's attracted some interesting enemies. There's the obsessed ex-cop who wants to know what really happened when she disappeared months ago. There's the curious genetics lab who got a peek at her unearthly DNA. And of course there's Mathis, to whom she is an experiment, not a person.Tori is alone. But by now, she's used to it.She doesn't let things faze her, not even running for her life (maybe literally), restarting in a new town, choosing a new name. Then Sebastian Faraday materializes (quite literally) in her world again with a message: Tori's in danger. Again.This book never stops moving. Not until I browsed other reviews did I realize that, like ULTRAVIOLET, the physical action takes awhile to pick up. Tension propels this book even when Tori is working at Value Foods or pushing her parents for permission to explore her engineering skills at the local ""makerspace."" The plot takes several unexpected turns but is always driven by credible character choices, and I love Tori for her inner insecurities and her desire to be seen for who she is even as she weaves constant lies to protect herself.As a well-rounded secondary character, I also love Milo. That Ms. Anderson wrote him and Tori as friends, not a teen romance, and that the characters themselves acknowledge to each other the difference--I don't know that I've read a young adult novel that deals as well with the complexities of teenage sexuality and peer pressure. Tori's disdain for the phrase ""just a friend"" is refreshing and perfectly fits who she is as a young woman forced to pretend her way through life, desiring friendship more than she'll admit even to herself.Then there's the return of Alison and Faraday. Wow. I love them, too, this time around (yes, even Faraday). So much is hinted at in Faraday's reactions, and I salute the author for not spelling it all out.As for the Crazy Ending Twist ... the She's Not Really Going To--OMGOSH moment ... well, like Ultraviolet, this book is brilliant. Is it extreme? A little out there? Nudging a toe against the suspension-of-disbelief line? Absolutely. But with a tamer (dare I say more plausible?) climax, this book wouldn't measure up to its prequel.Speaking of the prequel, these two books must be read together (I recommend in order) for full appreciation. Not only do they tie off threads left loose by the other, but their themes also blend beautifully. Both Alison and Tori reach a point of helplessness with nothing left to do or give, and in that emptiness, from that emptiness, they are saved. Redemption (though never named as such) glimmers in both books, more brightly when they are considered side by side.As for the ending, knowing Ms. Anderson doesn't intend to continue with these characters ... sigh. There's a lot still unexplored, a lot of fallout, including that of Faraday's unforgivable choice, which happens too late in the book. Way too late, because then the story is over. And again (see my review of ULTRAVIOLET), I was not ready. Apparently, this author believes in limited closure.Can I choose to be satisfied with that? Can I recommend these books anyway, especially to readers in search of young adult fiction that will bend genres and push boundaries and shatter formulas?Sure thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16F1YHLD7PUT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761387994#wasThisHelpful","R16F1YHLD7PUT5","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
